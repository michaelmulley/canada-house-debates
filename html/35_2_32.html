<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALVOLUNTEERWEEK">NATIONAL VOLUNTEER WEEK</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is National Volunteer Week, an opportunity for us to thank those 
Canadians who devote their time and energy to helping individuals 
and causes and to improving the quality of life in our communities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As a volunteer for many years, I know the dedication necessary 
to get involved in important causes to improve our society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In my riding of Vancouver East life would be much worse 
without the help of our volunteers.
<P>
	Volunteerism is a tradition as old as Canada itself and is quite 
unique to Canadians. Active, caring citizens have always played a 
critical role in our society. In celebrating National Volunteer Week 
we are recognizing the vital contribution of today's volunteers. At 
the same time, in highlighting their example, we are helping to 
nurture volunteers for the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I urge my colleagues and all Canadians to join me in thanking all 
the volunteers in Canada. They are undoubtedly our greatest asset.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LIBERALPARTYOFCANADA">LIBERAL PARTY OF CANADA</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, voters need 
accurate information to make wise decisions at election time. With 
one vote they are asked to choose their member of Parliament, 
select the government for the term, indirectly choose the Prime 
Minister and give their approval to a complete all or nothing list of 
agenda items.
<P>
	During an election campaign it is not acceptable to say that the 
GST will be axed with pledges to resign if it is not, to write in small 
print that it will be harmonized, but to keep it and hide it once the 
election has been won. It is not acceptable to promise more free 
votes if all this means is that the status quo of free votes on private 
members' bills will be maintained. It is not acceptable to say that 
MPs will be given more authority to represent their constituents if 
it means nothing and that MPs will still be whipped into 
submission by threats and actions of expulsion.
<P>
	I cannot understand why the Liberal Party, running on words of 
rebuilding the trust of Canadians, would so blatantly ignore its 
campaign commitments now that it has gained power.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">*  *  * </H4>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FARMCREDITCORPORATION">FARM CREDIT CORPORATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it would appear that the federal Liberals are planning to 
turn the future of farm financing back to the banks. Liberals in the 
Senate, particularly those on the banking committee, have released 
a report calling for the shutdown of the Farm Credit Corporation.
<P>
	While there has been warranted criticism of the FCC, which has 
yet to be properly addressed, there is no question about the need for 
an understanding and supportive farm lender. The banks have 
demonstrated that they would rather make outrageous levels of 
profit than provide service. They cannot be trusted to be the sole 
lender in the farm community, especially with respect to the needs 
of the primary producer.
<P>

my riding of Saint John, which has been ranked third nationally for 
volunteerism.
<P>
	In particular, I want to congratulate an outstanding volunteer, 
Mr. Bert Cosman, who resides in the greater Saint John area. Mr. 
Cosman recently returned from working overseas for CESO, the 
Canadian volunteer advisers to business. CESO volunteer advisers 
are retired, professionally skilled men and women who share their 
experience with businesses and organizations in developing 
nations.
<P>
	Bert went to Romania to assist a government owned company 
which manufactures high voltage equipment such as power 
transformers as well as electric and diesel locomotives. He 
interviewed all management and trade union representatives. He 
then prepared a report which recommended the centralization of 
market planning and sales and improvements in areas such as 
customer service.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government was elected on the strength of a solemn 
commitment to abolish the GST. The Prime Minister said during 
the electoral campaign, ``We are going to scrap the GST''. The 
Deputy Prime Minister said, ``If the GST is not abolished, I will 
resign''. On May 2, 1994, the Prime Minister again said, ``We hate 
this tax and we will get rid of it''.
<P>
	The Liberals made a number of solemn promises to eliminate the 
GST. Yesterday, however, not only did the Minister of Finance 
announce that the GST was being kept, he went on to say that we 
were going to pay $1 billion to extend it to the Maritimes.
<P>
	How does the Prime Minister justify such a spectacular 
about-face?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first, we can see what is going on in the Government of 
Quebec, where the mother house is  making major changes to the 
Parti Quebecois program as it stood at election time. I just make 
this comment in passing.
<P>
	I would simply like to read what is in the red book, the document 
our election campaign was based on. Here is what appears on page 
22 of the English and on page 20 of the French:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will replace the GST with a system that generates the 
equivalent revenues, is fairer to consumers and to small business, minimizes 
disruption to small business, and promotes federal provincial fiscal 
co-operation and harmonization.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is exactly what we have begun to do. We have succeeded in 
doing it with three Atlantic provinces and are negotiating with the 
others. Quebec was even ahead of the others. It understood the 
advantage of harmonization. We will finish the job with Quebec 
and we hope the other provinces will understand that a unified sales 
tax system in Canada is much simpler for everyone and much more 
effective.
<P>
	We made it clear in the red book that we could not abolish a tax 
without equivalent revenues, because the priority of all 
governments at the moment, in Ottawa, Quebec City, Toronto or 
elsewhere, is to eliminate deficits, which have been a source of 
economic problems throughout Canada, in Quebec, Ontario and the 
Maritimes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister of Canada is becoming a specialist in 
post-election program changes. The changes should have been 
made before.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance acknowledged yesterday, it was a 
mistake to promise to eliminate the GST and not do so. Is the 
government not making a second and very serious political mistake 
by developing another harmonization model, different from the one 
already in place with Quebec, which had the advantage of not 
costing Canadian taxpayers a thing.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, now the Bloc Quebecois is asking us to be inflexible, to 
give the exact same thing to everyone. Because it is complex, we 
are looking with the provinces for a solution that is acceptable and 
fair to everyone.
<P>
	I hear the leader of the Bloc Quebecois saying we are changing 
our program; we are not changing our program. I just read our 
program. But we will see on Monday whether the leader of the Parti 
Quebecois in Quebec City has changed the Parti's program on Bill 
101.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, is the Prime Minister in such a tight spot in this House that 
he has to try to draw attention away from commitments he made 
and did not keep? It was right there on the TV screen yesterday: the 
Prime Minister in shirt sleeves before Liberal supporters making  
commitments to scrap the GST. What about the Deputy Prime

	How can the Prime Minister explain to Quebecers that, really, 
they have not been taken in again by the federal government, when, 
despite their good faith and their being the first to harmonize their 
sales tax with the federal tax, they did not get the compensation the 
Maritimers got.
<P>

book. It was very clear, and we are keeping the promise we made in 
the red book.

candidate who would rip the GST right out if it was imposed 
against the will of the people.
<P>
	In 1991 it was not the same. If Reformers were to form the 
government they could not repeal it. They would have to wait until 
they had a balanced budget. In 1992 he said something else and in 
1994 in a report tabled in the House of Commons the members of 
the Reform Party complimented the Minister of Finance for the 
harmonization of the tax with the provincial governments.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
elected four months after the Tory government in the spring of 
1989 and the GST had not even been talked about then. Nice try.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Get the facts right and get the time right.
<P>
	This government has shown its contempt for the Canadian 
people. It has shown complete disregard for the promises it made in 
the last election. It has destroyed whatever credibility the red book 
might have left. It just goes to show that the Liberals will say 
anything, do anything and believe anything to get elected.
<P>
	The Prime Minister supported the GST when he ran for the 
Liberal leadership. He opposed it in the last election and then he 
supported it again now that he got Canadians' votes.
<P>
	They can wave the red book all they like but can Canadians trust 
anything in the red book?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The red book is being used on both sides as a 
prop. I would ask please, do not use props in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, 75 per cent of the red book commitments have been 
passed by this government. The member even has a copy of the red 
book in her hand. We are still waiting for the alternative budget that 
they were supposed to prepare for the last budget.
<P>
	I remember the leader of the third party telling Canadians: 
``Ladies and gentlemen, we will have a budget to tell the Minister 
of Finance what to do''. We are still waiting. The budget has been 
voted on and we are waiting. Where are the people who made these 
commitments? They do not have to deliver. They just gave us a 
plan that they would never have to implement. There is no danger if 
they do not even have the guts to table a plan they will never have a 
chance to implement.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, nobody 
in western Canada can do a two step that fancy. This red book 
means nothing, absolutely nothing. It is a prop. It is a sham.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Human Resources Development referred 
to a problem in letting the UI fund surplus continue to accumulate. 
There is, in fact, a surplus of $5 billion this year, with another $5.3 
billion predicted for next year, while at the same time the minister 
is making a gift of some $500 million to big business.
<P>
	At a time when the Minister of Human Resources Development 
is in the process of cutting back unemployment insurance benefits 
by billions of dollars, thus creating poverty in the regions, why 
does he not withdraw this bill and use the available funds to help 
the needy unemployed in Quebec, in Acadia, in New Brunswick, 
and everywhere in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as my hon. colleague is aware, 
he could not have asked the same question last year, for the UI fund 
had no surplus at that time. In fact, there was a deficit.
<P>
	Obviously, changes in situations such as what has happened with 
the unemployment insurance fund must be taken into account. At 
the moment, however, what needs to be kept in mind is that the 
amendments made to the bill before the House at this time will 
result in improvements to situations that have been recognized as a 
result of presentations made by those interested in making fair 
changes to the Unemployment Insurance Act. The opposition's 
assistance in this would have been appreciated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I could have asked the question last year because indeed 
there was a surplus, and I am sure I would have got the same reply. 
We have finally got the minister's message. He is cutting $45 
million from manpower training courses in Quebec, while the UI 
fund accumulates billions in surplus funds.
<P>
	When the minister says he is pulling out of manpower training 
and leaving it to the provinces, that means he is no longer putting 
any funds into it, but he will continue to impose his centralizing 
views on us, and to duplicate programs already in place in Quebec.

provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>Mr. Speaker, we have been asked many times 
to withdraw from manpower training in a number of provinces, 
including Quebec. We have made the commitment, reiterated by 
the Prime Minister and confirmed in the throne speech, to 
withdraw from manpower training, not only in Quebec but 
throughout the country. Thanks to this decision, the Government of 
Canada is, in fact, pulling out of training. We have promised to do 
so within three years, and I hope to be able to do so earlier than 
that.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
the House is embarrassed by the wrong thing. It is upset about a 
book on the floor but not by the deception that it represents.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	The Liberals promised that they would kill, scrap and abolish the 
GST. What they have delivered, however, is a billion dollar bribe 
and a blended sales tax. Actually the BS tax is a good name for it 
because that is exactly what Liberal candidates were spreading on 
the campaign trail during the last election.
<P>
	Since the government readily admits that it broke its promise on 
the GST, will the Prime Minister keep at least one election promise 
and ask the Deputy Prime Minister to resign?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I read earlier in French what is written on page 22. Hon. 
members are not setting a very good example by throwing books on 
the floor when there are kids in the House of Commons. They are 
trying to look at their Parliament and they see that behaviour from 
members.
<P>
	I can start to read this but it would take a long time. On page 111 
of the red book we called for the cancellation of the helicopter 
program. Done. We called for cuts to national defence. Done. We 
called for cuts in the professional service budget. Done. We called 
for cuts in grants to business. Done. I can read more. The youth 
service corps. Done. Literacy, done.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The House is rather spirited today. The wording 
of the questions and preambles is getting very close to being 
unparliamentary.
<P>
	Members know the rules of the House. They can quote from a 
document but the document should not be flailed about in any way. 
I would appeal to members, both in  the questions and the answers, 
to put them succinctly so that we can get on with question period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, during 
the last election campaign the Prime Minister boasted about his 
decades of experience in the House of Commons. Now he is telling 
Canadians that he did not know what he was doing.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is saying he did not know what he was doing 
when he said that he would kill, scrap and abolish the GST. For 
crying out loud, the man was the finance minister. That is nothing 
but garbage, just like the red book.
<P>
	Since it is clear that he played Canadians for fools in the last 
election, since it is clear that the Liberals knew they could not keep 
their commitments, and since it is clear that the Deputy Prime 
Minister pledged to resign if that commitment was not met and yet 
she still sits here, why should Canadians believe anything this 
Prime Minister and this government says?
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to pick up on an odious reference from the member's 
preamble to his other question, the use of the word ``bribe'' in 
reference to one section of the country.
<P>
	Yesterday the premier of Alberta said he felt Alberta is entitled 
to a reduction in the federal sales tax rate as it applies to his 
province. That is a point of view that may well be expressed in 
honest debate. No one in that government has referred to bribes or 
other odious terms used.
<P>
	I quote the Minister of Finance for Alberta: ``We are Canadians 
from one end of the country to the other. The fact is that Canadians 
living in Alberta will probably pay more to Confederation during 
this time and certainly during the 1970s than Canadians living in 
say Saskatchewan or in Newfoundland. I do not believe this 
government'', the Conservative Government of Alberta,``is a 
believer in cheque book federalism. Canada is much more than 
that''.
<P>
	I certainly hope there is never a merger between the Reform 
Party and the Tories. If that were the case, there would be a 
fundamental lack of decency in the Reform Party that would 
disappear from the right wing of the spectrum.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="1891"> 1891 </A></B>
<P>
focussing considerable efforts on getting employment back on its 
feet, in partnership with all those involved within the province, 
Ottawa is headed in the opposite direction, without any 
co-operation with the Quebec authorities''.
<P>
	While everyone in Quebec is pooling forces in an attempt to 
solve the unemployment problem, how can the Minister of Human 
Resources Development justify the federal government's unilateral 
action, which creates divisions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are committed to holding 
discussions with our Quebec colleagues, in order to find ways of 
meeting our commitments concerning withdrawal from manpower 
training.
<P>
	As for all of the other issues relating to active measures and what 
is reflected in part II of the employment insurance bill now before 
Parliament, we have every intention of entering into negotiations 
with the province of Quebec, and all of the provinces in this 
country, for it is the intention of the Government of Canada to show 
good faith in this entire matter, once again demonstrating that, with 
flexibility and good intentions, we can prove the federation is 
working very well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, where manpower is concerned, the time for talking is 
over. We have been hearing for five years now that the 
governments are going to talk together about it, yet every time 
there is a meeting, you do not attend. Do something.
<P>
	Does the minister confirm that what Louise Harel, the minister, 
says is true: by his involvement in manpower training, he is 
perpetuating overlap, creating five new programs which duplicate 
provincial programs already in place, in Quebec in particular?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>No, Mr. Speaker, we do not believe that what 
we are doing at this time is adding to duplication and overlap.
<P>
	What we believe is that there is a desire country-wide to find 
new ways of getting federation to work. This includes anything 
related to job creation, trade training, active measures in the private 
sector. We hope to be able to find solutions to these knotty 
problems, for they have been discussed long enough, as the hon. 
member has said.
<P>
	I do, however, find it somewhat surprising that, when we are 
attempting to withdraw from manpower training, the hon. member 
appears to think we are heading in the wrong direction. I thought 
that was the direction the consensus in Quebec wanted us to take.

committee will be mandated to report on all options for alternatives to the 
current GST. A Liberal government will replace the GST with a system that

question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	An event dubbed ``Extreme Fighting'' is scheduled to be held on 
the Kahnawake reserve this Friday. I think the atmosphere at these 
events is not unlike that now prevailing in this House.
<P>
	In the last few days, promoters have been advertising this event, 
which is due to be broadcast on Pay-TV throughout the U.S. At first 
sight, this type of combat violates provisions in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Since the setting up of equipment to allow satellite broadcasting 
of ``Extreme Fighting'' in the U.S. must be authorized by Industry 
Canada, can the Minister of Industry tell us if he has received an 
application in this case? If not, can he assure us that any potential 
broadcaster will not use a general authorization from his 
department to transmit an illegal event?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the setting up of equipment per 
se is not illegal. If there is an illegal act it will be dealt with by the 
authorities in Quebec.
<P>
	There have been meetings between Grand Chief Norton and the 
Quebec government. They set out rules of combat: no biting, no 
scratching and no time outs, which I found was a preference by the 
Mohawks in the province of Quebec for the next referendum rules.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
notify the Minister of Industry that, this morning, the Quebec 
government advised one of his departmental officials, the one in 
charge of telecommunications, that this event was illegal.
<P>
	My question is very simple. Since this event is illegal, can the 
minister promise not to authorize the setting up of technical 
equipment so that the event scheduled to be held on Friday in 
Quebec can be broadcast all over the U.S.?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding from the 
meetings that there has been no definitive finding of illegality. If 
there is, it is up to the authorities in Quebec to stop the illegal 
action. It is  clearly within their jurisdiction. If they do not want to 
exercise it that is their problem. It is their decision whether the 
event is illegal or legal.

that promises made in election campaigns are utterly worthless and 
that politicians, even prime ministers, cannot be trusted.

	In reinforcing that perception, the government has undermined 
the integrity of every member of the House, regardless of their

<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge the damage the GST shell 
game has done to the integrity of politics in Canada, and what, if 
anything, does he propose to do to repair the damage he has done?
<P>

the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1893"> 1893 </A></B>
<P>
commitment on page 22. It is very clear. If we were only to defend 
it, that would be something people might say is a bit political.
<P>
	There was a committee of the House, all members were there 
and for a year they looked into the problem. The Reform Party 
tabled a minority report and talked about a solution: ``It is simply 
unacceptable that Canada remains the only country in the world 
with ten different sales tax regimes. We commend the government 
on its attempt to harmonize the tax with the provinces''.
<P>
	These are the words of the leader of the Reform Party. If he 
wants to show integrity, he should repeat that in the House and 
compliment the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister evades the issue of integrity. If he 
wants me to repeat something in the House, I will repeat something 
he said in 1991 when he was in opposition.
<P>
	He was asked by a fellow Liberal what assurance he could give 
the people of Canada that the Liberal Party will have a value 
system that people can trust. The Prime Minister said: ``Trust will 
come when we say we will get rid of the GST. We will have an 
alternative, but we will not try to buy votes. People want an honest 
government. They do not want a repetition of what this 
government'', the Mulroney government, ``has done to this nation, 
making promises and breaking them all the time''.
<P>
	How does the Prime Minister reconcile what he said in 1991 
with what he has done this week with the GST? Will he admit the 
integrity of his government is in danger of sinking to the level of 
the Mulroney administration?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not afraid of that at all. We have it in writing on page 
22. If we were not to implement page 22, he would be complaining 
to the House. However, he found our solution was so good that he 
commended us and said we were on the right track. He is in 
agreement with us that page 22 was the right approach and he 
confirmed that when members of his own party in committee said 
we were doing the right thing.
<P>
	The position of the Reform Party and the position of the Liberal 
Party, on page 22 in writing, is exactly the same. That is why 
people have confidence in the government today.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday we heard how businesses and consumers in 
three Atlantic provinces will benefit from harmonizing the 
provincial and federal sales taxes. Businesses and consumer groups 
have endorsed this plan. My province, Ontario, did not sign an 
agreement with the federal government.
<P>
	Can the minister tell the House why Ontario should join the 
process and harmonize its provincial sales tax with the federal sales 
tax?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am delighted to answer this question, especially coming from the 
chairperson of the economic policy committee of our caucus.
<P>
	There is no doubt that Ontario as a major exporter and as a major 
manufacturer would benefit enormously from sales tax 
harmonization. It means increased competitiveness. It means lower 
costs. It means less administration for both business and for 
government.
<P>
	For the people of Ontario it would mean lower prices, as the 
embedded retail sales taxes within prices under the Ontario system 
at the present time would disappear. The fact is that sales tax 
harmonization would benefit Canada, and Ontario, the heartland of 
Confederation, would benefit enormously.
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the finance minister said yesterday that the harmonization 
of the sales tax programs would be good for business. The 
provinces have already said that the harmonization plans will cost 
them revenues because today's corporations pay provincial sales 
tax but under the new harmonized system they will not.
<P>
	I assume the Minister of Finance has reviewed this carefully. 
Can he tell the House and the people of Canada how much of the 
tax burden is being transferred from the corporations to the 
ordinary taxpaying consumer?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is very clear that over a four year period, and indeed that is the 
basis of the transition agreement with Atlantic Canada, the 
increased economic activity that would be generated, the number 
of jobs that would be generated as a result of getting away from the 
tremendous burden that retail sales tax places upon the provinces, 
would benefit consumers.
<P>
	Also, the fact is that the rate will be lower in Atlantic Canada. It 
would be lower in other parts of Canada. Consumer prices will be 
lower. This is a win-win situation for business, for employers and 
for consumers.

member declined from withdrawing and I said that I would put the 
matter over until after question period.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	I hope the member has reflected a bit on the words that were 
used. I would once again ask the hon. member for Fraser Valley 
West to withdraw those words. I put it to you squarely my dear 
colleague. Will you withdraw the words you used during question 
period?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I mean no 
disrespect to the Chair. May I supplant them with the words 
``deliberately misled''?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member puts a question to the Chair and 
it deserves an answer. The answer is quite simple my dear 
colleague. I have asked you not to rephrase the question. I have 
asked you to please withdraw those words. That is what I would ask 
you to do now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> I am sorry, Mr. 
Speaker. I decline to do so.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, as your Speaker, I want you to know 
that I take no pleasure, none whatsoever, in naming anyone in our 
midst.
<P>
	My dear colleague from Fraser Valley West, Mr. White, I have to 
name you for disregarding the authority of the Chair. Pursuant to 
the order granted to me by Standing Order 11, I order you to 
withdraw from the  House for the remainder of this day's sitting. I 
would ask that you do so now.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is my 
first opportunity to rise on a question of privilege regarding a grave 
matter which was brought to my attention on Tuesday, April 23, 
1996.
<P>
	Events have led me to believe there has been a deliberate attempt 
by the office of the government House leader to deny me an answer 
to my questions on the Order Paper. I refer to questions Nos. 25 and 
26. Comments made by an official from the office of the 
government House leader were quoted in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> on April 
22: ``He is outrageously seeking information and a lot of it. The 
government is not going to divert personnel to answer the 
questions''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I believe this constitutes a contempt of Parliament. 
I refer you to Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 97:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While it is correct to say that the government is not required by our rules to 
answer written or oral questions, it would be bold to suggest that no 
circumstances could ever exist for a prima facie question of privilege to be made 
where there was a deliberate attempt to deny answers to an hon. member-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	Questions Nos. 25 and 26 on the Order Paper to which I refer 
were first submitted as a single question on December 1, 1994 and 
have been on the Order Paper ever since. While the government 
failed to answer within the prescribed 45 day period, I was patient.
<P>
	On June 21, 1995 I raised a point of order asking that the 
question be answered. The parliamentary secretary to the House 
leader replied that he was sorry it had taken so long and that the 
government had been assiduous in attending to its duties. He 
alluded to the fact that I could expect a response soon thereafter.
<P>
	I waited until October 26, 1995, four months later, to raise a 
second point of order and again ask the parliamentary secretary 
when I could expect an answer. The parliamentary secretary replied 
that he would get me an answer and that it was nearing completion, 
but that I should be patient.
<P>
	When Parliament resumed, I resubmitted the question as it is 
part of my parliamentary duties. However it would now seem that 
the government has no intention, and never had any intention, of 
answering the question. This obstruction of my parliamentary 
duties was confirmed in a Toronto <I>Sun</I> article published Sunday, 
April 21, 1996.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1895"> 1895 </A></B>
<P>
	Erskine May's 21st edition clearly describes contempt as 
follows: ``Any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either 
House of Parliament in the performance of its functions, or which 
obstructs or impedes any member or officer of such House in the 
discharge of his duty, or which has a tendency, directly or 
indirectly, to produce such results may be treated as contempt even 
though there is no precedent for the offence''.
<P>
	I requested the information in accordance with Standing Order 
39(1) which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Questions may be placed on the Order Paper seeking information from 
ministers of the crown relating to public affairs; and from other members, 
relating to any bill, motion or other public matter connected with the business of 
the House, in which such members may be concerned;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This request of mine was submitted under the rules of the House 
and is considered a proceeding of Parliament for the purpose of 
privilege.
<P>
	Joseph Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I>, page 70, 
defines a proceeding of Parliament as follows: ``Since two of 
Parliament's constituent elements, the House of Commons and the 
Senate, were established for the enactment of laws, those events 
necessarily incidental to the enactment of laws are part of the 
proceedings in Parliament. However Parliament has also always 
been a forum to receive petitions, and the crown's satisfying the 
grievances of members before granting supply eventually led to 
straightforward requests for information''.
<P>
	Therefore the events necessarily incidental to petitions, 
questions and notices of motions in Parliament in the 17th century 
and today are all events which are part of the proceedings in 
Parliament.
<P>
	Moreover, a report of the Select Committee on the Official 
Secrets Act in 1939 stated that a proceeding in Parliament covers 
both the asking of a question and the giving written notice of such a 
question.
<P>
	As an opposition member it is my duty to scrutinize the 
government and to ensure that it is spending the taxpayers' money 
wisely. The Order Paper is one method of seeking information from 
the government. The Order Paper questions are allowed under the 
rules of this House and as I have pointed out are a part of the 
proceedings of Parliament.
<P>
	I am an elected member of this House performing my duties in 
accordance with the rules established by this House, and an official 
in the office of the government House leader is attempting to 
impede directly or indirectly in a proceeding in Parliament.
<P>
	There was a case in 1973 when the member for 
Northumberland-Durham received a letter from the solicitor 
general stating that the RCMP did not make it a practice of opening 
mail. Subsequent questions in the House by that same member on 
November 9, 1977 to the then solicitor general regarding mail 
openings by the RCMP provided a sufficient and direct relationship 
with  the proceedings in Parliament for the purpose of privilege. 
Later, remarks before a royal commission were made by the former 
commissioner of the RCMP stating that the practice was very often 
that ministers' letters were not exactly drafted on precise 
statements of fact. The sum of this evidence permitted the Speaker 
in 1978 to find a prima facie case of contempt where the RCMP 
were alleged to have deliberately misled a minister of the crown 
and the member for Northumberland-Durham, resulting in an 
attempt to obstruct the House by offering misleading information.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Whereas the case of the member for Northumberland-Durham 
dealt with a matter of an official deliberately misleading a member, 
what I bring to your attention is a case where an official in the 
minister's office is deliberately trying to interfere with me as a 
member of Parliament by deliberately not being forthright with 
resources, causing information to be withheld.
<P>
	As I mentioned in my opening remarks, in the case of the citation 
from Beauchesne, the Speaker once ruled that there could be a 
question of privilege where there is a deliberate attempt to deny 
answers to an hon. member.
<P>
	I take issue with the comments of the official in the media in 
regard to my request. That official is quoted as saying that a request 
for information from a parliamentarian is outrageous. Such 
arrogance and insolence by an official in the face of Parliament is 
contemptuous. Is this how ministers' staff view requests for 
information from opposition members? Here we have a staff 
person making judgments on a request from Parliament, virtually 
thumbing his nose at this House.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I refer you to citation 59 of Beauchesne's sixth 
edition, which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Traditionally, articles in the press reflecting badly on the character of the 
House have been treated as contempts. Two members of the staff of the House 
have been dismissed for writing such articles, and in 1873 the House judged an 
article written by a Member to be a ``scandalous, false and malicious libel upon 
the honour, integrity and character of this House, and of certain Members 
thereof, and a high contempt of the privileges and constitutional authority of 
this House.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Surely an official referring to a request from Parliament as 
``outrageous'' reflects on the dignity of Parliament and of 
parliamentarians.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to address the issue of ministerial 
responsibility, which you may be tempted to factor into your 
decision. I draw to your attention once again the Speaker's ruling 
of November 9, 1978, which appears at page 966 of <I>Hansard</I>, 
where the Speaker said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I do not think that there is procedural significance to the doctrine of ministerial 
responsibility, it appears that we are now embarking on a different course in having the </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1896"> 1896 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>House, through a question of privilege, reach around the minister and examine  
directly the conduct of an official-it seems to me [it] is not [a] procedural matter.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Speaker did not consider that there was a prima facie 
question of privilege in 1979. There is no procedural significance 
in this case either, Mr. Speaker, and I ask that you consider my 
points accordingly.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I ask that you review this matter. Should you find 
that there is a prima facie question of privilege, I am prepared to 
move the appropriate motion.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government has been trying very hard to answer the 
questions on the Order Paper of the member. The questions are on 
the record but I would like to remind the member of the nature of 
those questions.
<P>
	In question No. 25, the member is asking:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For each department, agency and Crown Corporation, how many employees, 
including parliamentary agents, Governor-in-Council appointees, armed forces 
personnel and RCMP personnel receive a living allowance for a second 
residence and/or a transportation allowance from their residence to their place 
of work where the distance exceeds 40km?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Question No. 26 asks:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What is the rank, position or title of each recipient of second residence 
allowance and/or transportation allowance from residence to place of work and, 
what is the cost for individual recipients and method of taxation of these 
benefits?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Ever since the hon. member asked those two questions, the 
government has tried to answer in the best way it can. However, 
those two questions require much work and personnel have to be 
taken away from their regular duties in order to answer them. We 
have tried. As a matter of fact, the hon. member mentioned it 
himself when asked about the questions in October and the then 
parliamentary secretary to the House leader said that the 
government was working on them, to be patient and he would get 
the answers.
<P>
	The House prorogued. Now the hon. member has asked the 
questions again. I repeat that, yes, if he is patient he will get his 
answers. They are very complex answers.
<P>
	However, there is no question of privilege. The government 
wants to answer every question.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	However, I understand that the nature of the questions requires a 
lot of work. If the member wants a good answer he should allow the 
government to provide it in due course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to add briefly to the points raised by the 
deputy House leader for the government.
<P>
	First, the hon. member in his speech to the House reflected on 
the parallel which he drew between his case  and that of the hon. 
member for Northumberland-Durham some time ago. He also 
alleged that the wilfully giving of false information, which was the 
issue at the time, is synonymous with what is occurring today and 
that there is a deliberate attempt to deny information to him. He 
also stated that the request had been cited as ``outrageous''. He 
drew on citation 59 of Beauchesne.
<P>
	First, written questions are similar in the standing orders to oral 
questions in the House of Commons. They are under the same 
section of the standing orders. Standing Order 39 refers to 
questions as questions from members. In other words, Mr. Speaker, 
these are private members' questions and they are to be treated as 
such. A request by a private member does not constitute an order of 
the House.
<P>
	Second, I do not know if the evaluation made by someone that 
the question was so vast in scope that it was outrageous, is fair or 
not. The fact that the work required to answer the question may be 
very large may be one thing but that in no way suggests that the 
question should not be put. However, it does suggest that a lot of 
work may be required in order to put the answer together.
<P>
	The deputy House leader has indicated the size of this project. 
When we are talking about a couple of hundred thousand civil 
servants, measuring all of the things that the member has asked for 
is indeed a very significant task and perhaps the word outrageous 
was the appropriate word.
<P>
	However, there is not a deliberate attempt to deny or wilfully 
give false information. The case brought by the hon. member in 
relation to citation 59 of Beauchesne reflects those things that have 
to do with ``reflecting badly on the character of the House''.
<P>
	If I understand it correctly, no one said that such a request made 
by the House itself would have been outrageous nor was any 
comment made disparaging it. In the case of the issue in question, I 
believe there was a parallel some years ago, known as the Doyle 
case, which was judged as being a contempt and insult to the House 
as an institution.
<P>
	Nothing is parallel in the discussion today. We have a private 
member's request which is perhaps a legitimate request. 
Nevertheless, it is one that is so wide in scope that it will cost not 
only tens of thousands of dollars to accumulate the answer. 
However, I am sure that when the information is available it will be 
responded to. It is not a wilful attempt to deceive the House in any 
way but a request that is so vast in scope that it will be difficult for 
anyone to achieve the desired result, notwithstanding the best 
efforts of everyone in government.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, with regard to the question of 
privilege, it would seem to me, at least at first glance, that neither 
privilege nor contempt are in question here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1897"> 1897 </A></B>
<P>
	However, after having listened to the dissertation of the hon. 
member for St. Albert and after hearing the contributions made 
by the secretary of state and the government whip, I would like 
to review all of the papers. If it is necessary I will return to the 
House with a decision on this matter.
<P>
	I am sure that all hon. members will appreciate that sometimes 
the scope of a question is such that it could take a little bit longer to 
answer. On the other hand, an attempt should be made by the 
government to answer these questions as quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	I will take hon. members' advice and I will study it. If necessary, 
I will get back to the House and give a definitive answer on the 
question of privilege.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. Through a Page I sent 
you a notice that I wished to raise a question of privilege arising 
from today's question period. I also gave notice to the hon. member 
who was involved in the question of privilege.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> That is correct. I confirm that I did receive a note 
from the hon. member for Parkdale-High Park on a question of 
privilege which arose out of the question period. I am prepared to 
listen to the question of privilege of the hon. member.

	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise pursuant to Standing Order 48(1). I am using the authority of 
<I>Beauchesne's Parliamentary Rules and Forms</I>, sixth edition, 
citations 114 following. My question of privilege refers to the book 
throwing incident during question period by the hon. member for 
Beaver River.
<P>
	Why do I raise this? Because this is a deliberate contempt of 
Parliament. Viewers were watching this on television.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Members of the Reform Party are laughing. This is the 
party that promised to bring decorum into the House of Commons. 
This is how they are doing it. They are ridiculing the orders of this 
House. They are ridiculing the authority of Beauchesne.
<P>
	Hundreds of students were sitting in the gallery today watching 
question period. Hopefully, some of them will be sitting in these 
seats. We cannot allow the kind of behaviour displayed by the hon. 
member for Beaver River.
<P>
	As members of Parliament we have to control our tempers. I 
know that debates get heated. But the next book could be thrown at 
you, Mr. Speaker. The next  book could be thrown at someone on 
this side of the House.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh. Oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> The Reform Party which promised to bring decorum to 
this place should listen to my motion: I give notice that whereas the 
hon. member for Beaver River did show contempt of Parliament 
with her misbehaviour during question period April 24, 1996, by 
throwing a book onto the floor of the House of Commons, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the hon. member for Beaver River appear at the Bar to purge the contempt 
and promise better conduct in the future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess 
he is throwing the book at me.
<P>
	The member talked about the fact that members need to control 
ourselves. Yes we do. This is a very emotional debate. The member 
talked about purging contempt of Parliament. I hardly think that 
throwing me, one single member of Parliament, out of the House is 
going to do anything to purge contempt in this place.
<P>
	I think this is a point of debate. In terms of decorum I have just 
celebrated my seventh anniversary in this place. I have talked about 
decorum in the House of Commons. No, I do not think it is cute or 
theatrical to do stunts.
<P>
	The Prime Minister waves the red book around constantly. When 
I bring it forward or even show it, all of a sudden I am using a prop. 
But he can wave it and flail it around and it is acceptable because 
he is the Prime Minister. I do not think that is acceptable.
<P>
	My frustration today about the red book was watching the Prime 
Minister wave it around. Then I got into trouble when I even lifted 
it up to read from it or make reference to it. My frustration stems 
from the fact that I sat in opposition with these people when this 
debate was raging and saw the emotion attached to it from their 
side when the rat pack went hysterical over it. I am now sitting on 
this side of the House watching these people defending it 
amazingly.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	I appreciate the member's bringing this to the concern of 
Parliament. I certainly do not want to challenge the Chair or any 
member in the House, but I firmly believe because of what we have 
seen happen over the GST yesterday and today that the red book 
truly belongs on the floor.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> With regard to the point raised by the hon. 
member for Parkdale-High Park, the Chair agrees there was 
disorder caused in the House. The Chair agrees there was a breach 
of decorum.
<P>
	I hate to use the word punish, but in order to rectify the situation, 
members will remember your Speaker passed on from the 
questioner and hopefully that would have rectified the situation.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1898"> 1898 </A></B>
<P>
	I have pointed on numerous occasions to the use of props. It 
is true the red book has been quoted extensively by members on 
both sides. In the rules of the House if a member is quoting from 
a book, I permit them to read. Whenever it is being used as a prop 
by flailing it around or throwing it, God forbid, I step in.
<P>
	In the heat of debate, because emotions are running high, we 
should get our emotions under control. As such, I urge members on 
both sides that when quoting from a book, quote from the book, but 
you need not hold it aloft, whether it be the red book or the blue 
book, it does not matter.
<P>
	There was a breach of decorum. As your Speaker I did intervene. 
I would like to let the matter rest there, encouraging you always to 
keep your emotions under control because we are being watched by 
30 million of our fellow citizens and we would hope to set a very 
good example.

<P>
[<I>Text</I>] 
<P>
Question No. 15-<B>Mr. Grubel:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How does the Minister of Human Resources Development explain the 
increases in the value of fraudulent claims between 1993/94 and 1994/95 for old 
age security, from $256,140 to $1,076,882, and CPP, from $244,571 to 
$554,947, as reported in the Public Accounts of Canada, Volume ll, Part ll for 
these two years?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Robert Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Human Resources Development, Lib):</B> The figures quoted 
from public accounts represent the value of overpayments 
established during the reporting year related to suspected offenses. 
The reported increases from 1993/94 to 1994/95 for both old age 
security and the Canada pension plan are due to the following 
factors:
<P>
	Increased awareness of the potential for fraud and its subsequent 
detection by regional and headquarters program integrity 
officers-there were 11 more cases of suspected fraud found in 
each program in 1994/95 than had been found in 1993/94, a total of 
22 more cases than were found the previous year; detection of some 
older cases, which tend to have higher values because benefits have 
been in pay for an extended period; detailed review of benefit files 
in preparation for the conversion to income security program, ISP, 
redesign system, which revealed eight cases of suspected fraud 
with an associated value of $154,000; enhanced reassessment 
activities related to CPP disability which resulted in an increase in 
the number of cases detected in which fraud was suspected.
<P>
	To maintain the integrity of the OAS and CPP programs, many 
methods are used for the detection of abuse: quarterly fraud 
profiles, random and directed samples, disability reassessment, 
third party complaints, computer matching with Revenue Canada 
and with the  unemployment insurance program, and the vigilance 
of income security programs staff. Increases in the value of 
overpayments related to suspected offenses reflect enhanced 
detection, not necessarily an increase in the overall incidence of 
fraud.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETIMPLEMENTATIONBILL,1996">BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION BILL, 1996</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that 
Bill C-31, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget 
tabled in Parliament on March 6, 1996, be read the second time and 
referred to committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, as my hon. colleague, the Minister of 
Finance, stated when he delivered the 1996 budget, Canadians do 
not want rhetoric from their government. They want action. They 
want progress. And that is what this government intends to deliver 
in introducing the budget implementation bill.
<P>
	The 1996 budget is the third milepost on this Liberal 
government's journey to securing fiscal stability, and a vibrant, 
dynamic and competitive economy. The  legislation we are 
proposing today is in the spirit and tradition of any Liberal 
government. It is in keeping with our ongoing commitment to 
ensure that the most 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1901"> 1901 </A></B>
<P>
vulnerable and those in the greatest need will continue to benefit 
from fair, sustainable and secure social programs in the next 
century.
<P>
	Our programs which were built by previous Liberal governments 
have established us as one of the most envied nations in the world. 
Clearly, one of our highest priorities must be to preserve Canada's 
network of social programs.
<P>
	Over the last two and a half years, Canadians have turned to 
governments to provide and economic and social environment that 
encourages the economic growth needed to create new jobs. The 
legislation we are introducing points to this government's 
commitment to meet this demand.
<P>
	Through this bill, we will double our youth programs, expand 
our international trade and boost Canada's innovative capacity by 
in investing in new technologies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are determined to restore fiscal health to this country to 
balance the books. This year's budget consolidates and extends the 
actions resulting from the 1994 and 1995 budgets. Once this 
legislation is passed, these budgets will work together to help 
Canadians secure their future in a number of key areas.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	To secure our financial future, we will meet or exceed our fiscal 
goals year by year by sustaining reductions in program spending. 
The 1996 budget reaffirms the government's fiscal responsibility to 
Canadians. To get government right, we are taking further action to 
define a more appropriate and effective role for the federal 
government.
<P>
	To secure social programs for the next century, we are acting to 
restore confidence in providing a secure, stable and growing 
system for medicare, post-secondary education and social 
assistance. To invest in the future, we are reallocating money to 
new investments in priority initiatives to support youth, technology 
and international trade, areas critical to future jobs and growth.
<P>
	I do not intend to speak today about all the amendments we are 
proposing. Rather I would like to give the House a general sense of 
what we are setting out to accomplish in the budget legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I will begin by outlining how our plans will secure a solid 
financial future for all Canadians.
<P>
	Our two previous budgets set in motion actions to ensure that the 
deficit targets for 1995-96 and 1996-97-down to three per cent of 
the GDP-will be achieved. The 1996 budget secures the 
government's  deficit target of two per cent of the GDP in 1997-98. 
This means the deficit will have fallen from $42 billion, or 5,9 per 
cent of the GDP, in 1993-94 to $17 billion in 1997-98.
<P>
	To achieve this, the government is continuing to place priority on 
expenditure reductions. There are no tax rate increases in this 
budget, not personal, not corporate, not excise. In fact, there have 
been no personal tax rate increases in any of our three budgets.
<P>
	Through the continuing program review, the 1996 budget 
contains $1.9 billion in additional spending cuts for 1998-99. This 
will help sustain the reduction in program spending-that is, all 
budgetary spending except interest on the public debt. Program 
spending will decline, from $120 billion in 1993-94 to $105.5 
billion in 1998-99.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With this proposed legislation, we are also encouraging young 
Canadians to continue their education and develop their skills by 
reallocating from within the tax system an additional $165 million 
over three years. We will create new employment opportunities for 
youth by reallocating $315 million of budget savings over three 
years. We are doubling funds for the 1996-97 student summer 
employment placements to $120 million.
<P>
	The budget also increases the investment in technology and 
innovation through a number of actions over the next three years 
funded by reallocations of $270 million from budget savings. For 
example, the SchoolNet program will expand, connecting every 
school and library in the country to the information highway by 
1998. With the help of 2,000 computer students, 50,000 small 
businesses will be connected to the Internet and their owners 
trained for full access to the information highway.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	Finally, a technical committee will carry out a comprehensive 
business taxation review with three goals: promoting jobs and 
growth; simplifying the system; and enhancing fairness.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That brings me to the tax system and our proposals to ensure that 
it is not only as fair and effective as possible, but also supports jobs 
and growth. We are reallocating revenues to priority economic and 
social intiatives such as improved tax assistance for students, 
charitable donations and care of the handicapped.
<P>
	To encourage renewable energy investments, we will change the 
tax rules to create a level playing field. Proposed changes will 
improve tax rules to finance some renewable energy and 
conservation projects, including extending flow-through share 
provisions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1902"> 1902 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The budget also includes more measures to get government 
right, to help shape a focused more affordable government that 
effectively advances the key priorities of a productive job creating 
economy in a modern Canadian federation.
<P>
	Under program review, departments were asked to examine their 
programs and services to determine how best to provide Canadians 
with smaller, more effective and affordable government. Canadians 
have sent us a clear message. We must meet the challenges of 
globalization, financial pressures, new information technologies 
and demographic shifts. Canadians seek affordable services and 
programs delivered in the most effective and efficient manner 
possible.
<P>
	We are also acting to ensure that social programs are affordable 
and will be there for Canadians in the future. We will restore 
stability and subsequent growth to transfers to the provinces with a 
sustainable system of long term funding under the Canada health 
and social transfer.
<P>
	The federal government will legislate a new five year Canada 
health and social transfer funding arrangement beginning in 
1998-99. For the first two years federal support, that is tax transfers 
plus cash, will be maintained at $25.1 billion. Over the following 
three years transfers of both cash and tax points will grow at an 
increasing pace related to the economy to approximately $27.4 
billion. Also, to increase protection to provinces, a new legislated 
cash floor will guarantee that the cash portion of the transfer will 
not fall below $11 billion in all years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When I tabled the main estimates on March 7, I announced 
measures we would take to ``get government right.'' These are 
rooted in four objectives; to redefine the government's roles and 
responsibilities; to redirect its resources to the highest national 
priorities; to provide Canadians with more modern, accessible and 
responsive service delivery; and finally to achieve affordable 
government.
<P>
	To support these objectives, we carried out a fundamental review 
of all our programs and services. I might add that, not since the 
second world war has a government engaged in such a far-reaching 
review.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	During this program review, we have examined all major federal 
programs and activities to reassess what we do, how we do it and, 
how we can to it better. Our aims is to deliver services that are 
relevant, responsive, accessible and affordable. We are now putting 
into place the results of this review.
<P>
	Based on these results, most departments will have their budgets 
cut by at least an additional 3.5 per cent in 1998-99; some will be 
cut much more. Changes are  occuring not just in direct service 
delivery areas but also in our internal processes and systems.
<P>
	Together, these and other measures will reshape and redirect the 
structure of government to bring quality services to Canadians in a 
fiscally responsible manner.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As we continue on this path of reform and change we must pay 
equal attention to the federal public service which, as the 
administrative arm of government, delivers in large measure our 
programs and services to Canadians. The public service supports us 
and helps us deliver our commitments to the people of Canada. We 
recognize that changes are also required to transform the public 
service into a modern and dynamic institution. The changes we are 
proposing in this bill will put in place some of the building blocks 
to do just this.
<P>
	The legislative measures we are proposing to get government 
right are based on three key themes: alternative service delivery; 
compensation and collective bargaining; and pension reform.
<P>
	I will begin with the alternate delivery of services and programs. 
By this I mean creating service entities, special operating agencies 
and other organizational mechanisms to deliver services. One 
example is NavCan which delivers the air traffic control system.
<P>
	In the budget the Minister of Finance announced our intention to 
move in similar directions by creating a single food inspection 
service, a parks agency and a national revenue commission. We 
will undertake other such arrangements case by case as we continue 
to examine the best ways to deliver services to Canadians.
<P>
	When we create these organizations, public service employees 
working in these areas will of course be affected. We must ensure 
that these employees are treated fairly and reasonably. That is why 
we met with the public service unions earlier this year to discuss 
the subject. I am pleased to say that we reached an agreement with 
most of the unions on the transfer arrangements for employees who 
move to alternative service delivery organizations.
<P>
	The amendments we are introducing today will allow us to put in 
place fair arrangements for all employees affected by such 
transfers. They will also allow us to implement enhanced 
arrangements that some unions successfully negotiated on behalf 
of their members. This government is committed to working with 
public service unions and believes that the negotiated agreement is 
always the preferred option.
<P>
	We are also proposing other legislative amendments to various 
statutes that will allow us to put in place these arrangements. For 
example, we are proposing changes to both the Canada Labour 
Code and the Public Service Staff Relations Act to introduce 
successor rights. These rights continue to cover union representa-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1903"> 1903 </A></B>
<P>
tion and the  collective agreement until the term of the agreement 
expires, when employees move from public service employment to 
other federal employers.
<P>
	Also we are introducing changes that will ease the transition to 
and the operation of alternative service delivery organizations. We 
want to make sure that these organizations have the tools they need 
to operate effectively from the outset.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	An example is our proposal to amend the Financial 
Administration Act to allow us to use multiyear appropriations. If 
approved, we could use this authority with the three new agencies 
where flexibility is warranted and appropriate. Implementing this 
flexibility would need parliamentary approval through either an 
appropriation act or specific legislation.
<P>
	I should add that this is an enabling clause only and Parliament 
will retain the right to determine when and if multiyear 
appropriations are suitable to these or any other future 
organizations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let us now turn to compensation and collective bargaining in the 
public service. The <I>Public Sector Compensation Act</I>, which was 
first introduced in 1991, restrained collective bargaining. Public 
service wages have been frozen for five of the six years that this 
legislation has been in effect.
<P>
	I was pleased to announce that the <I>Public Sector Compensation 
Act</I> will expire as planned in February 1997. Public service 
employees have contributed significantly to fiscal restraint, and 
now, we can return to collective bargaining for public service 
employees.
<P>
	Salaries for MPs and senators will remain frozen at the 1992 
levels until at least January 1998 when the law will be ressessed as 
prescribed by Parliament.
<P>
	However, we are also proposing to suspend the binding 
arbitration process to resolve collective bargaining disputes for 
three years. We cannot run the risk of allowing independent 
arbitrators-who are not accountable to Parliament-to award 
compensation increases that the fiscal framework could not 
accommodate.
<P>
	Binding arbitration will continue for employees of the House of 
Commons, the Senate, Library of Parliament and the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service. This is because their respective 
legislation prohibits strikes and requires the use of binding 
arbitration. In these case, however, arbitrators will be required to 
take into account wage settlements that have been reached for 
comparable occupational groups within the public service, where 
Treasury Board is the employer.
<P>
	We are also seeking authority to amend the <I>Public Sector 
Compensation Act</I> to reinstate increments and performance pay 
which were suspended when the government introduced the wage 
freeze.
<P>
	This bill would also provide authority for a 2.2 per cent wage 
increase for non-commissioned members of the Canadians Forces. 
This measure will correct the disparity in wages, that existed before 
the wage freeze between members of the armed forces and public 
service employees.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our final theme centres on pension reforms. These reforms are 
intended to provide individuals and groups of employees with 
greater pension portability that meet the standards of the Pension 
Benefits Standards Act. Specifically we propose to revise the 
Public Service Superannuation Act to protect employee pension 
accruals and make them portable. This portability will be enhanced 
by the two year vesting and lock-in provisions.
<P>
	I indicated that I would not discuss every legislative proposal but 
for the most part they are all related to one of the three themes I 
have described. I would just like to draw the attention of the House 
to other measures.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	We intend to modify the Financial Administration Act to make 
changes to public service group insurance plans, for example, the 
health care plan. Another proposal will deal with the needs of our 
student employment programs by amending the Public Service 
Staff Relations Act.
<P>
	Together these changes, particularly in the areas of alternative 
service delivery, compensation and collective bargaining and 
pension reforms, will let the government do its business using a 
modernized legislative and policy framework.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, we believe that the measures we are introducing 
today are fair and reasonable to Canadians. They will help us 
secure the financial future, get government right, secure social 
programs for the next century and promote jobs and growth for 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
President of the Treasury Board told us a few minutes ago that 
Canadians are not interested in flowery rhetoric. And yet, that was 
what I seemed to be hearing last March 6 when I listened carefully 
to the finance minister's budget speech.
<P>
	It was a lovely speech, but now we must go over it all again 
today, because today is when the real budget measures are being 
tabled in this House, in the course of the debate on Bill C-31, while 
most of the members of this House are in committee. And I have 
the feeling that that is exactly what the government wanted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1904"> 1904 </A></B>
<P>
	It seems to me that this Bill C-31, tabled yesterday at first 
reading and submitted to the House today at second reading, is 
a tactic by the President of the Treasury Board, who is doing the 
dirty work for the Minister of Finance, whose erratic management 
has not really succeeded in reducing the deficit to date.
<P>
	The bill is an example of this government's inability to control 
the deficit and the debt through concrete measures and a fiscal 
policy that is consistent and fair for all groups in our society.
<P>
	To put it another way, when we see the measures contemplated in 
this bill, the number of acts amended, the number of federal 
ministers and federal agencies affected, the staff upheavals, the 
planned cuts, this bill starts to look like a fire sale by a government 
that has lost control and that is trying with varying degrees of 
success to stop the leaks in the fast-sinking Liberal boat.
<P>
	This Budget Implementation Act, 1996, will enable the Treasury 
Board to ensure the transition of human resources in the context of 
what is described as the diversification of ways of providing 
services. The Financial Administration Act is amended; it will 
allow tens of thousands of employees to be laid off, public services 
to be transferred in some cases, and measures designed to facilitate 
these transfers to be taken.
<P>
	The Canada Labour Code and the Public Service Staff Relations 
Act are amended so that collective agreements and labour 
representation can be maintained when personnel is transferred to 
other employers as part of the public service restructuring 
described by the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	Public servants who are transferred will lose certain rights. The 
changes made to the Public Service Employment Act will allow the 
Public Service Commission to delegate powers to non-public 
servants, thus eliminating <I>de facto</I> the right to appeal an 
appointment.
<P>
	Transfers to the private sector must of course be made attractive, 
which means that benefits enjoyed by public servants must be 
reduced.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	This is all that is being done here. The freeze on the salaries of 
non-commissioned members of the Canadian Armed Forces is 
ended. Instead of conducting an objective inquiry into the blunders 
of the army, particularly in Somalia, the government rewards first 
the military responsible, whose salaries will be the first to be 
unfrozen.
<P>
	An amendment to the Public Sector Compensation Act will 
make these changes possible. A right for which workers fought 
hard is withdrawn for a period of three years. Indeed, an 
amendment to the Public Service Staff Relations Act will suspend 
compulsory arbitration.
<P>
	We are told that the Public Service Superannuation Act is also 
being amended to facilitate the transfer of individual and collective 
pensions, and provide the flexibility required to maintain or 
suspend the application of the act to an entity and to its employees.
<P>
	Transfer and flexibility: these are the key words. The 
government is cutting in the rights and pensions of its employees to 
better transfer them to the private sector. These transfers will affect 
thousands of public servants. According to the bill, collective 
transferability will be made possible thanks to amendments aimed 
at facilitating the conclusion of agreements between the 
government and eligible employers.
<P>
	The government could not make it more clear that it intends to 
transfer a number of its responsibilities to the private sector. We are 
told about transitional protection, but what are the guarantees for 
the employees affected? The bill is silent on this and no transfer 
procedure is specified.
<P>
	This bill also confers upon the Minister of Transport the power 
to dispose of railway cars belonging to CN which are used to move 
grain.
<P>
	To show you the extent of the sales that will be coming, the bill 
states: ``It would also provide for an increase in the maximum rates 
for movement of grain after at least 10,000 of the railway cars or 
rights with respect to at least 10,000 of the railway cars are 
disposed of''.
<P>
	All of this goes to show, without a doubt, that the government is 
selling out our heritage, the train-which was the first link between 
the various regions of our country-our assets and the government 
employees' expertise built up over the past decades. These massive 
sell-outs will only pay the grocery bill. The government's fire sale 
will not, in the end, reduce the deficit by any significant amount.
<P>
	Another blow, this time not against its employees but against all 
workers. After having laid its hands on the $5 billion surplus in the 
UI fund, the government is changing the Unemployment Insurance 
Act by setting maximum insurable earnings for 1996 at $750. It 
also sets maximum weekly benefits at $413 for recipients who start 
receiving benefits in 1996, i.e. new recipients.
<P>
	Bill C-31 also implements a number of measures with budget 
impact. The government is taking advantage of this bill to push a 
number of extremely controversial measures through. It is trying to 
use a back door approach, to rush through unpopular measures 
including some that penalize the unemployed.
<P>
	The historically maintained tax pact between Ottawa and the 
provinces is being shoved aside. The Federal-provincial Fiscal 
Arrangements Act is amended. The Canada social transfer for 
1997-98 through 2002-03, as well as the method for calculating the 
amounts to be transferred to the provinces, is defined.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1905"> 1905 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	All that this fine business reveals is that federal transfers to the 
provinces are in free-fall. In the end, all this complex accounting 
will simply produce smaller envelopes: $26.9 billion in 1996-97, 
$25.1 billion in 1997-98 and each year thereafter until 1999-2000. 
For each of fiscal 2000-01 to 2002-03, the calculations used will 
merely reduce the Canada social transfer even further.
<P>
	The transfer to a given province is related to the calculation of a 
weighting value that decreases from 1.0 in 1997-98 to .5 in 
2002-03. In other words, the amount will be reduced progressively 
by 50 per cent over five years.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is changing the rules for distributing 
the Canada social transfer among the provinces. The new rule is 
based on the size of the population and no longer on need, as should 
be the case for social programs. Quebec, once again, is hardest hit 
by the cuts. The Canada social transfer now benefits the wealthiest 
provinces: Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta, whose 
populations are growing the fastest.
<P>
	By cutting its transfers to reduce the deficit, the federal 
government is passing the bill on to the provinces, dumping the 
deficit in their lap. There is less and less redistributing in the 
federal transfers. The cuts and the new rules for distribution mean 
in fact the end of fiscal federalism.
<P>
	The only measure that is fair for taxpayers in Bill C-31 is the 
amendment to the Old Age Security Act, which will change the 
pension paid to people with fewer than ten years' residence in 
Canada after their 18th birthday. This pension will now be 
calculated according to the number of years they have actually 
lived in Canada after this birthday. This is only fair to all taxpayers.
<P>
	The Canada assistance plan, the Radiocommunication Act and 
the Student Loans Act are amended, with the last one being 
changed to provide stricter terms for the repayment of student 
loans.
<P>
	This all-purpose bill amends various acts and has a single 
purpose: to reduce the amounts spent by the federal government to 
pay its employees; to cut the number of federal public servants; to 
undermine the rights of those who will survive the cuts; to chop 
transfer payments to the provinces. National standards remain, but 
related funds are falling.
<P>
	UI benefits are also being cut in order to augment future 
surpluses in the UI fund, where the Minister of Finance will take 
the amounts needed to hide his mismanagement and his real deficit. 
The deficit will also be reduced by selling crown assets, like the 
thousands of railroad cars used to transport grain across the 
country.
<P>
	Collective agreements are being tampered with and the rights of 
public servants undermined. The right to  appeal on appointments
<P>
of priorities is being eliminated and, more importantly, binding 
arbitration is being suspended for three years to make federal 
organizations more attractive to private sector buyers.
<P>
	All this shows a blatant lack of respect for public servants, 
something the President of the Treasury Board did not brag about a 
few minutes ago. This bill mixes the sale of railroad cars with the 
doctoring of collective agreements so that entire components of the 
public service laboriously developed by the country since the 
1940s can be sold off.
<P>
	Above all, this shows the finance minister's inability to carry out 
his mandate to balance the federal budget. In fact, clause 64 in this 
bill provides for the payment of $961 million to New Brunswick, 
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland as adjustment assistance for the 
purpose of facilitating their participation in an integrated national 
sales tax system.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	The Liberals never keep their election promises, to say the least. 
After condemning the Tories so strongly, they are doing the exact 
opposite of what they promised.
<P>
	As members may recall, in 1979-80, after vigorously 
condemning the 18 cent increase in the price of a litre of gasoline 
called for by the Tories, the Liberals were quick to raise the tax on a 
litre of gasoline even higher after returning to power in 1980.
<P>
	History repeats itself. After slamming the GST during the 1993 
fall election campaign, the Liberals are again trying in 1996 to 
harmonize the various provincial taxes with billions in hidden 
subsidies to the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> To win votes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Exactly.
<P>
	The Liberal government has negotiated with three of the Atlantic 
provinces an agreement combining the provincial sales tax and the 
GST into a single national sales tax. The new tax will amount to 15 
per cent. Current tax rates in the Atlantic provinces are quite high: 
12 per cent in Newfoundland and 11 per cent in Nova Scotia and 
New Brunswick.
<P>
	So, the federal government has forced these provinces to bring 
their tax rates down to 8 per cent, and to this end, their service tax 
base was broadened. The cost of this whole operation, or $961 
billion, will be borne by the federal treasury.
<P>
	The federal government will also look after collecting the tax. 
For this purpose, a national revenue commission will be created to 
take over the administration of the unified tax from the Atlantic 
provinces by January 1998. This is an attack in due form, aimed at 
eventually taking over all tax collection in Canada. The actual 
amount of the tax will be hidden in the sales price but will show on 
the bill. The government is creating a hidden tax, which will make 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1906"> 1906 </A></B>
<P>
it easier to raise it later on. The minister also  introduced a stringof technical changes to the GST that only an expert could make 
sense of.
<P>
	Regardless of the actual words used in the Liberal's red book, the 
fact remains that a promise was broken. Two Liberal members, 
namely the hon. member for York South-Weston and the hon. 
member for Broadview-Greenwood have left the Liberal caucus, 
and this does them credit. They were strongly supported by their 
constituents in making this decision. There are at least a few 
members who stand on their own two feet. The same cannot be said 
about the Deputy Prime Minister, but at least some still do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Bloc members do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Yes, exactly. The hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot is right.
<P>
	This goes to show the Liberals have reneged on their promises 
and the public knows it.
<P>
	Just one week before the 1993 election, the Deputy Prime 
Minister stated on the CBC, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``I have already said personally and very directly that if the GST is 
not abolished I will resign''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
The Prime Minister himself said, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``We will scrap the GST''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
In May 1994, he added: ``We hate this tax and we will make it 
disappear''.
<P>
	It is quite something when a Prime Minister says that he hates a 
tax. Did the Prime Minister suddenly fall in love with the GST? Or 
is he the victim of a love-hate affair? I personally think that the 
Prime Minister is a great comedian who uses all means available to 
him.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	There is no harmonization. The provincial sales tax will 
disappear. It will become part of the GST. The GST will literally 
absorb the provincial tax and its management will be the exclusive 
responsibility of the federal government, which will thus increase 
its control over indirect taxation in this country.
<P>
	By including the tax in the price of goods, the government shows 
it could not care less about consumers and is making it easier to 
increase the tax later on. Several associations, including the 
Consumers' Association of Canada and the Association des 
manufacturiers du Québec, opposed including the tax in the price 
of goods.
<P>
	The federal government is making all Quebecers and Canadians 
pay for the harmonization of sale taxes in the maritime provinces. 
Given the amount of money to be  paid by the federal government 
to these provinces, Quebec will have to contribute close to $250 
million but will get nothing in return. The government's goal is still 
to integrate the GST to sale taxes everywhere in Canada. If it must 
compensate every time an agreement is reached, how much will it 
cost in the end?
<P>
	The government itself says that compensation will also be 
necessary in the case of Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Prince 
Edward Island. Quebec has already harmonized its sales tax and no 
adjustment is anticipated in the future. This means that there is no 
possibility for compensation in the case of Quebec. Such is the 
price that Quebecers must pay when their province co-operates 
with the federal government.
<P>
	Provinces joining the national tax system will lose their 
autonomy, because they will no longer have full control over their 
taxation rate and their tax base. ``The federal government will 
assume responsibility for all aspects of administering the 
provincial value added tax''. This is what it says in the 
memorandum of agreement on the harmonization of sales taxes, an 
indication of the extent to which the provinces that sign will give 
up their fiscal autonomy to the federal government.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is offering the government an opportunity 
to kill two birds with one stone. The first step would be to abolish 
the GST, to turn the whole field of indirect taxation over to the 
provinces and to offset federal losses resulting from the abolition 
of the GST with an equivalent reduction in cash transfers to the 
provinces. In this manner, the federal government hangs on to its 
financial equilibrium, the Government of Quebec controls all 
indirect taxation within its borders, and the result is less federal 
interference in the health, education and social assistance sectors.
<P>
	This approach, the one the government is suggesting, is 
completely out of date. The savings generated by all the sales and 
cuts resulting from bill C-31 will be spent on paying the provinces 
to accept a national sales tax.
<P>
	Financial management under the Liberals is a bottomless pit. 
They do not realize the efforts they are asking of everyone: public 
servants, taxpayers, the unemployed, seniors, the provinces. They 
are asking all these groups to make significant spending cuts, and 
then, at the end of the bill, in clause 64, they wipe out, in one fell 
swoop, close to a billion dollars in efforts so that they can bring 
three provinces on side with their national sales tax.
<P>
	Why pass this Bill C-31 if, once again, they go back on election 
promises and eliminate with one hand all the efforts made by the 
other hand. The Bloc Quebecois cannot in all decency support this 
bill. This bill the government is rushing through contains major 
amendments to at least ten statutes that have a very large impact on 
government management. I will summarize them here to show you 
the importance of all these legislative amendments that will flow 
from Bill C-31.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1907"> 1907 </A></B>
<P>
	The following statutes are amended: the Financial 
Administration Act, the Public Service Employment Act, the 
Public Service Superannuation Act, the Unemployment Insurance 
Act, the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, the Old Age 
Security Act, the Canada assistance plan, the Radiocommunication 
Act, and the Canada Student Loans Act.
<P>
	The common denominator in all these amendments is the 
withdrawal of the federal government from its responsibilities as 
an employer and from its historic commitments to the unemployed, 
seniors and the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The Liberal government is abdicating its responsibilities. Bill 
C-31 is admission that it is abdicating before the voters send it 
packing for good. This morning's La Presse described the plan 
proposed yesterday by Ottawa as ``somewhat frantic''.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to draw the hon. members' attention to 
the fact that the Liberals have a worse record than the 
Conservatives as far as the Constitution and taxation are 
concerned. In the first instance, by reducing Quebec to the 
``principal homeland of French language in North America'', and 
in the second, far from eliminating the GST as it had shouted from 
the rooftops that it was going to do in 1993, by reinforcing it, trying 
to bury it in the price.
<P>
	So what about the transparency this government was promising? 
Through this double failure, the Prime Minister and his Minister of 
Finance are once again demonstrating their incompetency, which 
far exceeds that of their predecessors.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate, it is 
my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that 
the question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as 
follows: the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow 
Lake-Parks Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have spoken on the subject of the budget before and I 
was going to cede my place to my colleagues, but a new 
development has taken place which has very serious implications 
for the budget.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development has joined a 
chorus of demands by labour and employers that there is a need, if 
not an obligation, on the part of the government to lower premiums 
on unemployment insurance contributions made to the 
unemployment insurance fund.
<P>
	If these premium rates are lowered, as I think they should be and 
I think they will be, then the government's vaunted target of 2 per 
cent deficit of GDP in two years' time cannot be met. There is even 
doubt that this year's projections can be met. This is a very serious 
matter.
<P>
	According to the budget document, the government will violate 
tradition. For reasons I will indicate in a moment, it is almost 
illegal. However, I do not know if I can call it illegal. On the one 
hand by keeping up the premiums or on the other hand it does the 
right thing with respect to premium rates, the government will not 
be able to meet its target.
<P>
	This is a summary of what I would like to include in my speech. I 
would like to build to a conclusion and support it with some more 
careful analysis and numbers.
<P>
	Let me first remind people that the unemployment insurance 
system is an independently funded account which by law has to 
balance over time. I took the trouble of calling the solicitor for the 
Department of Human Resources Development to ask what the law 
is. He told me that it should be balanced over time. A few years ago 
the auditor general required that the government adhere to this 
principle.
<P>
	When the balance accumulates the government is, therefore, 
obligated to lower premiums. If the balance becomes negative, 
premiums have to be raised.
<P>
	The government is making the argument that is really 
pro-cyclical, that is, it aggravates the business cycle because the 
funds accumulated in the UI system are likely to become negative 
when there is a recession. If during this recession the premium rate 
is raised, it will result in the further withdrawal of purchasing 
power. It therefore aggravates the size of the business cycle.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Therefore, I agree with the government that we should 
accumulate a certain reserve during good times so that the fund 
would be able to ride out the next recession without having to raise 
premium rates again. However, there ought to be a limit to the 
amount which the unemployment insurance system can 
accumulate.
<P>
	Why is this system separate and is there this rule that the 
balances must come to zero through time? The reason is quite 
obvious. The unemployment insurance premiums have two very 
serious characteristics. First, they are regressive. The maximum 
contribution that individuals pay to the fund is $1,320 a year. This 
$1,320 a year is paid by someone making $30,000, someone 
making $100,000 and someone making $1 million. The percentage 
which this $1,320 represents of total income is much higher for 
lower income earners than for higher income earners. This is 
clearly a regressive tax.
<P>
	The reason why the rule exists that this must not be used to 
finance general government expenditures is that general 
government expenditures accrue to everyone and they are part of a 
system income redistribution, and so on. Therefore, this is not 
money that should be used to finance general government pensions 
and various other things. Those government functions should be 
financed by general taxes in the form of personal income taxes, the 
GST and corporate income taxes because all of those  benefits are 
accruing to all Canadians. All are paying for it and it accrues to all 
of them. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1908"> 1908 </A></B>
<P>
The UI contributions, on the other hand, are simply for providing 
protection against the risk of becoming unemployed.
<P>
	The second damaging characteristic of unemployment insurance 
revenues is that over one-half of them are paid by employers. 
People who go out and think that they can afford someone to work 
in their donut shop for $10 an hour will be deterred from doing so 
because the government says: ``That is not enough. You have to pay 
the 3 per cent to the government in the form of a contribution to 
UI''. This is why it is widely known and has been given the name 
by the government of a job killing tax.
<P>
	Any time that the government legislates increases in the cost of 
labour which have not been negotiated in the labour market, it 
raises the cost of labour and is therefore detrimental to 
employment.
<P>
	It is quite clear that it is not in the interest of society. It is not 
legal for the unemployment insurance fund to be in surplus for a 
prolonged time or in a surplus that is used to finance general 
government expenditures. That is why the representatives of labour 
and employers have been coming in droves to the hearings of the 
human resources development committee and have been asking for 
a reduction in the premium. That is why recently the Minister of 
Human Resources Development noted that he too believes the 
premiums are to be lowered.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Just to give an idea of the magnitude of this effect, the revenue 
from insurance premiums in 1995-96 will be $18.5 billion. People 
have great difficulty envisioning what $18.5 billion is. Let me 
compare this with what is expected to be collected from 
corporations. Corporations are expected to pay $14.5 billion. The 
UI system is expected to contribute $18.5 billion to total revenue.
<P>
	On it goes through 1997-98. It is expected that by 1997-98 the 
unemployment insurance contributions revenue collected by the 
government will be $19.5 billion. That may or may not be a lot; it 
all depends on what the obligations of the UI system are.
<P>
	The budget again has an answer for that. In the year 1995-96, the 
$18.5 billion is required to provide unemployment insurance 
benefits worth $13.8 billion. The difference between revenue and 
expenditure is $4.7 billion. It is in the budget which is being 
debated today that over this year and the following two years the 
excess of revenue collected from workers and their employers 
minus what is being paid back to them through unemployment 
insurance benefits will contribute to the nation's surplus $4.7 
billion, $4.6 billion and $5.0 billion in each of those years 
respectively.
<P>
	A surplus also existed in 1994-95. At that point it was the highest 
it had been in a long time, $5.4 billion. It was used to reduce the 
accumulated deficit of the system, but  by the beginning of this 
year the surplus, the reserve of the system, has begun to grow. It is 
estimated that by the end of this year it will be about $4.5 billion, 
the following year $9 billion and thereafter $14 billion.
<P>
	Again, people have very great difficulty relating to these 
numbers. The $14 billion at the end of 1997-98 is equivalent to one 
full year's outlay in the budget for unemployment insurance 
benefits, one full year of reserves, the highest these reserves have 
ever been in the history of Canada. I have a graph which shows this.
<P>
	It was $2.2 billion. The government has predicated the 
achievement of its deficit target on the assumption that this 
accumulation of surpluses will go to $14 billion. It is not 
reasonable. The largest cumulative deficit that ever existed was 
$5.8 billion.
<P>
	These premiums by all standards must be lowered. They cannot 
go on like this. It is almost illegal. It is killing jobs and it is unfair. 
As some people have said, the money in the UI fund does not 
belong to the government for its general programs, it belongs to the 
workers. I have made that case and it is fair and justified.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	A very great problem is developing for the country and for this 
government. This is what it will mean two years from now using 
the government's figures. If the government did the right thing and 
lowered the unemployment insurance premium, there would be no 
addition to the system's reserves. In 1997-98 the deficit is 
projected to be $17 billion. If the $5 billion generated as a surplus 
by the UI fund were not available, the deficit would be $22 billion, 
just a little bit less than the preceding year, which is next year. 
There would have been no improvement.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance brags on Wall Street and everywhere 
else: ``I have achieved our target. I have broken the back of the 
deficit''. The entire government plan and the minister's proud 
achievement are predicated on keeping money that does not belong 
to the government but belongs to the workers. It is in the books. 
The auditor general said so. It makes complete economic sense. 
The government is coming close to the mistake it made on the GST.
<P>
	I cannot believe that a man with the intelligence, background and 
integrity of the Minister of Finance and with the huge resources he 
has available in terms of this country's best economists would say 
in front of investors on Wall Street that he has broken the back of 
the deficit, without acknowledging that his prediction is based on 
the assumption he will have $5 billion in each of the next two years 
coming in as revenue he knows does not belong in that account. 
That revenue belongs to the workers.
<P>
	That revenue should not accrue because by tradition in the way 
the UI fund has been set up the premium rates should be lowered. 
Again I have a graph. It shows that whenever the cumulative deficit 
was large enough the  rates would be raised. If there was a surplus, 
the rates would be lowered. I have not had time to look at the 
speeches made by the Liberals when they were in opposition, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1909"> 1909 </A></B>
<P>
demanding I am certain the lowering of benefits because the money 
belonged to the workers. However, here they are using it to achieve 
their target.
<P>
	What are the Liberals going to do? Are they going to shamefully 
make that fund grow to $14 billion when the highest ever in the 
history of Canada has been $2.2 billion? It certainly is in the 
budget. If we do not do it, the target is not going to be met.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Where have the media been? Have they not noticed this? Where 
are all the incisive analyses that should be going on about this 
subject? If they would like some background information, they 
could call me.
<P>
	There is no way in which this government should resist the 
supremely justified demands of employers and employees, and 
organized labour is adding to the chorus that the Minister of Human 
Resources Development do the right thing and lower this 
regressive tax which is killing jobs. The government should be 
lowering the premium rates which are taxed rates. They are 
regressive because they fall so heavily as a percentage of income 
on workers in the lower echelons. They are killing jobs and they 
add to the cost of employing labour. This is a major scandal. It is a 
scandal which I predict will become very similar to that of the GST.
<P>
	I know the minister in response to questions on this subject will 
say that the government has plenty of reserves built into the 
system. Let us look at that. He has built into the 1997-98 budget a 
$3 billion contingency reserve. Part of that will already have been 
eaten up by the money which he has just committed to pay as an 
inducement-and some people in the Government of Ontario are 
calling it a bribe-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Do not use that word. He will get upset.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> I only quoted a highly placed employee in the 
ministry of finance of the Government of Ontario who called it a 
bribe to the governments of the Atlantic provinces. That will 
already take a significant proportion of that built-in reserve.
<P>
	Let us say it will still be worth $2.5 billion. What we are talking 
about is $5 billion that is put into the budget as a source of income 
which the government has no right to have in there. By definition, 
including the contingency reserve, the government will not meet its 
target. I ask myself: Why is the contingency reserve there? In case 
something bad happens.
<P>
	We heard many witnesses in the finance committee say that 
almost certainly within the next two or three years the United 
States economy will slow down significantly. Expansions never 
last forever and it has already had an expansion of almost seven 
years.
<P>
	The contingency reserve on spending was put in there because 
there might be another upheaval in capital markets outside Canada 
like there was in Mexico. The contingency reserve was put in there 
because we might find there may be a little disturbance in Canadian 
capital markets because of political developments in Quebec.
<P>
	Put that on top of the dilemma in which the government finds 
itself of having used to achieve its targets money that is not meant 
for that use. There will be very serious questions raised about the 
budget. These are questions which I did not raise before. After all, 
it is one thing for special interest groups, for the representatives of 
employers and workers, to come before human resources 
development and make their case.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	It is now serious because the Minister of Human Resources 
Development has added his very influential voice to all of those 
who have said that money should not be used for the purpose for 
which it is being used. It reveals that the government has not had 
the courage to do on the spending reduction side what is necessary 
to save the country from bankruptcy. Please do not shoot the 
messenger. Sooner or later the media would have discovered that 
anyway.
<P>
	Interest rates may rise because people will find out that a 
minister who comes to Wall Street and says we are right on target, 
we will be at 2 per cent per year, will be found either not 
competent, that he did not know he could not keep that $5 billion, 
or that he may have been misleading them deliberately. I do not 
know what the answer is but I would not be surprised if sooner or 
later that question came up. How do you think the capital markets 
will react?
<P>
	I do not want to be a doomsayer. For the sake of Canada, for the 
sake of the Minister of Finance, for the sake of the government, I 
hope everything I said can be in practice truly brushed aside as 
ideas and analyses produced by an obsolete academic economist 
who does not know what he is talking about and has ventured into 
the arena of politics and is out of his depth.
<P>
	For the sake of Canada I hope I am right, but I have the feeling 
that what we have coming is a major problem for the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the 
comments of my colleague, the hon. member for Capilano-Howe 
Sound.
<P>
	Because I have such respect for him as an economist who has 
happened into politics for a time I am saddened he had made some 
of the suggestions he has with respect to the government's 
budgetary policy as reflected in the budget implementation act, 
which we are considering today, Bill C-31.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1910"> 1910 </A></B>
<P>
	I digress from my prepared remarks for a moment to respond. 
It reminds me a bit of Chicken Little and the old story that the 
sky is falling. He is always on his feet, armed with all of his 
experience and knowledge, to say in somewhat typical Canadian 
terms things will get a whole lot worse.
<P>
	It is startling that he suggests that once again he is right and 
everyone else is wrong. Third parties have looked at the budget and 
have commended the minister and the government for the 
achievements of it, and yet the hon. member for Capilano-Howe 
Sound is saying: ``Everyone is wrong, the analysts the wrong. They 
are all wrong. Michael Walker of the Fraser Institute is wrong. I 
wish they would call me so I could get them to correct the error of 
their ways''.
<P>
	My biggest regret is with his suggestion that somehow the 
government is stealing something from the workers of Canada, 
failing to remind the House and anyone listening to his remarks 
that when that UI account was in deficit it was Canadian taxpayers 
through the consolidated revenue fund who stood ready with funds 
to deal with the deficit in the account.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	The president of the treasury board's remarks provided a cogent 
and compelling explanation of the government's fiscal policies and 
the framework for this legislation, the budget implementation act 
before us today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	He made it particularly clear why the government is introducing 
certain measures in this bill. These measures will help the public 
service help us to meet our commitment to Canadians.
<P>
	I would first like to reiterate some aspects of our financial 
situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is a timely reason for this repetition. Our record of fiscal 
responsibility and progress sets the context for one of the key 
measures of the bill, the implementation of long term funding for 
the Canada health and social transfer.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance pointed out in his budget speech in 
March, our ongoing spending reductions, real spending reductions, 
combined with those in previous budgets will ensure our deficit 
targets are secure; that is, 3 per cent of GDP for this fiscal year and 
2 per cent next. For the following year, 1998-99, the measures we 
have introduced in the last three budgets will deliver an addition 
$28.9 billion in savings. Deficit reduction will continue.
<P>
	The numbers speak for themselves. In 1993-94 federal program 
spending stood at $120 billion, almost 17 per cent of GDP. By 
1998-99 the money we spend on  programs will be down to $105.5 
billion, 12 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	It is important to note that progress on deficit reduction is not 
restricted to the federal government. The financial situation of 
provincial governments is also undergoing a significant 
improvement. In 1992 the combined deficits of Canada's federal 
and provincial governments on a national accounts basis reached 
7.4 per cent of GDP. This level was double the G-7 average, behind 
only Italy in that group of large industrialized countries.
<P>
	However, this year Canada's total government deficit is expected 
to fall below the G-7 average and come in as the second lowest in 
the group, behind only the United States. Based on each country's 
current plans we should have the lowest next year.
<P>
	Clearly and fortunately fiscal responsibility has now become a 
governing facet of our national political culture. We have stopped 
acting like adolescents with credit cards, and this sense of financial 
maturity will ensure a more secure and prosperous future for us all.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite and some of his colleagues may say, 
as they always do, it is not good enough and it is not enough. I 
suggest we are simply their worse nightmare because we are doing 
the job and getting it done, as I have said on other occasions in the 
House, fairly, reasonably and without tearing apart the country in 
the process. The proof is in the pudding, the high marks this and 
previous budgets have been given by all third party commentators.
<P>
	Through these three budgets we are ensuring the economic 
sovereignty of Canada. Foreign borrowings by Canadian business 
and governments have been cut from $29 billion in 1993 to $13 
billion last year. Our reliance on foreign borrowings will decline 
dramatically as governments continue to reduce their deficits.
<P>
	Obviously we are making real progress, something that drives 
the members opposite crazy. The 1996 budget is another 
instalment, another significant step in that direction.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance put it, and I will repeat it because 
members opposite have probably forgotten, this budget is about 
consolidating the gains we have made. It is about managing ahead, 
continuing to put in place new building blocks for security and 
prosperity.
<P>
	Some of these building blocks are contained in Bill C-31, the 
legislation before us. As we move ahead, one of our highest 
priorities, one surely shared by the vast majority of Canadians but 
not necessarily by all members opposite, is the preservation of the 
country's network of social programs. To help achieve that end the 
bill before us amends the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements 
Act. This amendment will provide secure, stable funding for what 
has come to be called the CHST, the Canada health and social 
transfer, for an additional five years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1911"> 1911 </A></B>
<P>
	I remind the House, because some here have short memories, 
of the background of this transfer program.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In its 1995 budget, the government replaced the Canada 
assistance plan and established program financing with a new 
mechanism: the Canada health and social transfer.
<P>
	This consolidated transfer represents a new, more flexible and 
mature approach to federal-provincial relations. It gives the 
provinces more manoeuvring room to design and administer their 
own programs while protecting social programs Canadians count 
on and support.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This year the budget calls for an extension of the CHST funding 
framework through 2002-2003 and puts in place a formula for 
increasing this transfer in the later years of that five year plan.
<P>
	Under the bill before us total entitlements will be pegged at 
$25.1 billion annually for 1998-99 and 1999-2000, equal to the 
level already in place for next year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are determined to support the provinces' activities in the 
areas of health, education and social assistance for those in real 
need. Despite sustained reduction in federal program spending, the 
total amount paid to the provinces under the transfer will not 
decrease during this period.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the three fiscal years beginning in April 2000, CHST levels 
are projected to rise. By 2002-2003-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Money we do not have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Madam Speaker, I listened attentively to the 
hon. member opposite. I will try to ignore the interjections.
<P>
	By 2003-2003, total CHST entitlements are expected to be $2.3 
billion higher than the level set for next year, 1997-98. This 
funding arrangement will mark the first growth in transfers to the 
provinces for social programs. That is the first additional funding 
that can go to medicare, education and welfare since the era of 
restraint began in the mid-1980s.
<P>
	Furthermore, as a result of this funding the cash component of 
the CHST will never fall below $11 billion. We expect the cash 
transfer to grow by the end of the period to provide additional 
assurance to Canadians.
<P>
	However, this legislation sets a floor, an ironclad guarantee that 
cash transfers will be maintained above the $11 billion level. This 
proposed legislation also provides a new formula for allocating the 
CHST among provinces.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As you no doubt know, changes in the existing transfer system 
created increasingly greater disparities in terms of individual 
rights. Most often, these disparities resulted from the ceilings 
imposed by the previous government on money paid to certain 
provinces under the Canada assistance plan.
<P>
	In my opinion, Canadians agree that the wealthy provinces need 
less assistance than those less well off. This concern for the welfare 
of our fellow Canadians is part of our unique social contract.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	At the same time, Canadians are firm believers in the importance 
of action that is balanced and fair. This legislation puts those values 
to work. Under the new allocation formula, which will be phased in 
over five years, disparities in per capita funding will be cut in half.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Allow me to point out to the members of this House that 
progressive implementation-funding of the transfer over five 
years-gives the provinces time to adjust and the assurance of 
accuracy in their planning activities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me now turn to the changes the bill proposes to make to the 
Unemployment Insurance Act, changes that will bring insurance 
coverage more in line with the average industrial wage for 1996. 
Effective January 1 of this year, the maximum insurable earnings 
are to be reduced to $750 per week in comparison with the $845 
level that would have resulted under current legislation.
<P>
	Similarly, the maximum weekly benefit drops from $465 a week 
to $413. These measures will save $200 million in the second half 
of this year and reduce the UI payroll tax burden on working 
Canadians.
<P>
	Some might try to claim these measures are regressive, but this 
attack rings hollow, resonating more to political grandstanding 
than accurate criticism.Let us remember that the UI program when 
considered in its entirety is progressive. Lower income 
contributors tend to draw more in benefits than they pay in 
premiums, while higher income earners tend to pay much more in 
premiums-
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I would like to 
have a little more order in the House so that at least the Chair can 
hear the member.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1912"> 1912 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Madam Speaker, thank you. As well, let me 
point out that claimants who qualify for the 60 per cent dependency 
rate prior to the coming into force of the new employment 
insurance act will not see a loss of that rate for their claims. To 
qualify for this rate, claimants must have dependents and show 
average earnings of $422.50 per week or less.
<P>
	Allow me to digress to mention a housekeeping detail with 
respect to these measures. They were announced last December 
and tabled in Bill C-112. A companion bill, the proposed 
employment insurance act, was also introduced. It sets rates for 
1997 and beyond.
<P>
	Since both bills died on the Order Paper we have decided to set 
the maximum insurable earnings and benefits for 1996 in this 
legislation. As members know, the employment insurance act has 
been retabled as Bill C-12. This bill also amends the Old Age 
Security Act, the present bill we are discussing, to lengthen the 
period of time before newcomers to Canada become entitled to the 
full guaranteed income supplement or spouses allowance.
<P>
	This is simply common sense. Under the current system, some 
immigrants obtain full benefits with as a little as one year's 
residence in Canada. Restricting this easy access will improve the 
fairness of the system and lessen the burden on Canadians.
<P>
	With the new rules, eligibility will be phased in over 10 years for 
those who qualify for benefits through social security agreements 
with Canada. As well, sponsored  immigrants from countries that 
have social security agreements with Canada will not be eligible 
for benefits for the period of their sponsorship since most older 
immigrants are allowed entry only because they have been 
sponsored by a family member.
<P>
	Those who have already come to Canada will not be penalized. 
Individuals now receiving benefits or who landed in Canada before 
budget day and become eligible for benefits before January 1, 
2001, will not be affected.
<P>
	In continuing to address the content of the bill, which I hope 
members opposite would like to discuss some time during the 
course of this debate, let me address a number of measures in this 
bill which seek to further the agenda of getting government right, 
something they speak about a great deal.
<P>
	These measures involve redefining and redesigning government 
programs and activities in three areas: grain transportation, student 
loans and radio spectrum licences. Today, in a time of tighter 
resources and taxpayer fatigue, there is no question that 
governments cannot act or think as they did in previous times. It 
must be recognized that in order to do a better job of meeting key 
priorities we should not pursue activities when others can do the 
job better.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is why Bill C-31 will enable the Minister of Transport to 
dispose of the publicly-owned freight pool.
<P>
	The government will consider any serious proposals that those 
involved may wish to submit and take into account the interests of 
producers, shippers and rail carriers in making a decision.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We will ensure that the required capacity for grain transportation 
is maintained. As well, freight rates can, on average, rise no more 
than 75 cents per ton to cover the cost of the acquisition.
<P>
	We expect that over time the privatization of the grain hopper 
cars will make for a more efficient grain handling system with 
lower costs for the railways. This in turn will lower freight rates for 
grain producers.
<P>
	Two other clauses in this bill will remove the 10-year ceiling that 
was imposed on the repayment schedules of students who 
borrowed money under the Canada Student Loans Act. Lenders 
will be able to more flexibly match the repayment period to the 
financial circumstances of  borrowers. While the borrowers must 
certainly benefit, I should point out that the government may 
actually save money with these new rules since the rate of defaults 
will clearly be reduced.
<P>
	Another measure in this bill will amend the 
Radiocommunication Act allowing the Minister of Industry to 
auction off valuable radio spectrum licences.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I should point out that competitive bids will not be used 
systematically for issuing licences. This is however a very 
convenient mechanism that can be used whenever it becomes 
impossible to accommodate everyone within the spread of the 
spectrum.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, there is a measure in this that does not flow directly from 
the budget but from an announcement recently made by the 
Minister of Finance and that is with respect to the GST. Bill C-31 
provides for the paying out of approximately $960 million to the 
provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and 
Labrador as adjustment assistance for initial revenue losses under 
the integrated value added tax regime that they have agreed to with 
the government, a harmonized tax I should incidentally point out 
which the Reform Party supported.
<P>
	This money will be paid for over a four-year period. It is in 
keeping with the firmly established practice of providing assistance 
when federal initiatives entail major structural change for the 
provinces. Under the adjustment framework this legislation puts in 
place, the cost of harmonization will be shared with all provinces 
which experience revenue losses in excess of 5 per cent of their 
current retail sales tax revenue.
<P>
	In addition to the three provinces previously mentioned, this 
would also include Prince Edward Island, Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan when they enter into harmonization.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario would be 
excluded for a very good reason: their revenues would not be cut 
back enough to make them eligible to compensation under the 
formula.
<P>
	Quebec of course has already harmonized its sales tax for the 
main part. But in light of the remarks made yesterday by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1913"> 1913 </A></B>
<P>
opposition, I must point out that Quebec would no more be 
admissible to adjustment assistance today than it would have been 
in 1990, when it signed the memorandum of agreement with 
Ottawa, and this, to Quebec's greatest advantage, because 
harmonization was profitable to this province.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Returning to Bill C-31, the government firmly believes that 
given the benefits that will flow from harmonization, the total cost 
to the federal government is responsible and reasonable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Under the formula, the federal government and the provinces 
will split almost half and half the cost of adjustment assistance over 
the four years. That is certainly a given. At the end of these fours 
years, the program will end, the provinces having had the time to 
adjust.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As the minister stated, the government has consistently acted on 
the principle that people and governments need to be able to plan 
and adjust to structural change. Where required the government has 
been prepared to provide help to those who face adjustment cost. 
For example, as members well know, payments were made to 
provinces to address revenue losses they incurred under tax reform 
in 1972.
<P>
	Adjustment assistance was provided in each and every one of our 
budgets. For example, last year resources were provided to 
facilitate the adjustment flowing from elimination of subsidies 
under the Western Grain Transportation Act to the western 
provinces. I do not recall members of the Reform Party objecting to 
that. We also did the same with Atlantic freight subsidies to Quebec 
and the Atlantic provinces, and I do not recall members of the 
official opposition objecting to that either.
<P>
	Today the same precedent is being followed. I emphasize that 
this adjustment assistance will not jeopardize the deficit targets. 
They are secure.
<P>
	I have taken up a fair amount of time because I wanted members 
to focus on the measures in this bill, not their pet peeves, and I hope 
members in responding and continuing the debate will speak to the 
bill before us and not something else.
<P>
	Through the things that I have focused on this afternoon there is 
a common thread: fiscal responsibility and getting government 
right for Canadians. The actions we are proposing are those which 
Canadians are looking for and insisting on from this government. 
As their elected representatives we would be remiss if we did not 
do our part. With this in mind I have no hesitation in calling on my 
colleagues on all sides of the House to join with me in supporting 
this important legislation.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I was listening earlier to my Liberal colleague talk about 
the new GST agreement between the federal government and the 
maritime provinces. He forgot to mention that this agreement 
requires the federal government to pay close to $1 billion to the 
maritime provinces, a political compensation, as this billion dollars 
was used to pay off those provinces to accept a proposal that does 
not kill the GST.
<P>
	On the contrary, this proposal maintains the GST but makes the 
Minister of Finance look good by allowing him to say he took some 
action in this matter. It is Canadians from the other provinces and 
Quebecers who will have to pay for this $1 billion in political 
compensation. But it is not the only cost; by reducing the combined 
sales taxes-the provincial sales tax plus the GST-in the 
maritimes from around 19 to 15 per cent, the Minister of Finance 
has paved the way for an increase in equalization payments to the 
maritimes over the next three or four years. That is what will 
happen.
<P>
	So the price to be paid by Canadians from the other provinces 
and by Quebecers is not only $1 billion; it is not true, as the 
Minister of Finance claims, that this will end after four years. In 
fact, the formula for calculating equalization payments to the 
maritimes shows that we will be paying more and more for this bad 
agreement that the Minister of Finance signed on our behalf.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The new deal between the federal government and the maritimes 
will cost Quebecers and Canadians outside the maritimes $1 
billion. It is a high price for Canadians to pay for a bad deal, a 
political deal which maintains the GST. However, it is not the only 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1914"> 1914 </A></B>
<P>
price. After four years Canadians will continue to pay 
compensation to the maritimes through equalization payments. 
When the taxation base is reduced, like the Minister of Finance's 
proposal, equalization payments intervene automatically.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Why did the Minister of Finance and the government not do with 
the maritimes what they have done with Quebec since 1991, that is 
to say, really harmonizing both taxes without it costing a penny to 
any Canadian? Why did they approve such an agreement? Why did 
they agree to take $1 billion from the pockets of taxpayers in 
Quebec and Canada outside the maritimes to pay for this 
agreement, which is not even a harmonization agreement, which 
does not even keep the original Liberal promise to kill the GST? 
Why? My question is directed to my colleague.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question.
<P>
	He is incorrect. I did not fail to mention the matter of the 
adjustment announced yesterday. It is within my comments and he 
can check the reference in <I>Hansard</I>. To suggest otherwise is 
incorrect.
<P>
	It is not a case of buying harmonization. It is a case of providing 
adjustment assistance, as as has been done on a number of 
occasions. I mentioned similar situations in the west. I need only 
mention the maritime freight rates, which have also benefited 
Quebec.
<P>
	Underlying the suggestion that the taxpayers of one region 
should not help another region would clearly undermine a number 
of things that benefit Quebec.
<P>
	With respect to equalization, I look forward to the day, vis-à-vis 
Quebec or the maritimes, when we see reduced equalization 
payments. One of the things that will be accomplished through this 
harmonization-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Why not give Quebec a tax cut?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> -which is real harmonization, no matter what 
the member says it is not something else, will be a more prosperous 
maritimes. That I am sure is something that the member opposite 
would like to see, as would every one of us.
<P>
	As for Quebec, it simply would not qualify under this formula, 
nor would Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta.

	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill C-219, an act to amend 
the Canada Labour Code (severance pay), be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it is an honour and pleasure to speak 
on my private member's Bill C-219.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to remove from Part III of the Canada 
Labour Code that portion of section 235 which denies severance 
pay to employees who at the time they are terminated from 
employment are entitled to a pension under certain pension plans or 
legislation. Passage of this bill would end an injustice and would 
end the age discrimination which is now enshrined in the Canada 
Labour Code.
<P>
	The Canada Labour Code governs the employment of 700,000 
people in federally regulated industries, including transportation, 
telecommunications, grain handling and banking.
<P>
	With the current wave of rationalizations, thousands of these 
workers are facing layoffs. Older workers are particularly 
vulnerable and workers entitled to a pension, even with reduced 
benefits based on early retirement, even reduced CPP benefits, are 
not eligible for any severance packages that their younger 
co-workers might receive.
<P>
	Subsection 235.2(b), which this bill would rescind states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An employer shall be deemed not to have terminated the employment of an 
employee where, either immediately on ceasing to be employed by the 
employer or before that time, the employee is entitled to a pension, under a 
pension plan contributed to by the employer-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In practice this means that if a company is laying off workers, it 
is not obliged to pay severance to older workers who are entitled to 
early withdrawal of pension benefits, even though they may be 
severely penalized for taking benefits before the normal 
pensionable age.
<P>
	My interest in this subject arose from the misfortune of one of 
my constituents, Mr. Abe Peters of Swift Current, Saskatchewan, a 
28-year employee of the now defunct trucking company, 
Motorways Limited. He was laid off along with hundreds of others 
on December 3, 1993. He was 58 years old at the time.
<P>
	Employees were notified that they would receive the 
magnificent sum of two days' severance pay for each year of 
service. Someone should tell the Ontario public service workers 
about life in the real, cold hard world of federally regulated 
industries. In Mr. Peters' case, the severance package would have 
been $6,872.32.

	Unfortunately, a second notice was delivered by way of the 
teamster's union to all employees aged 55 or over, advising that 
they would not be eligible for even that pittance because they were 
entitled to a pension under the Prairie Teamster's pension plan. A 
total of 240 employees were excluded from severance pay. The 
great majority had never expressed any desire to retire and few, if 
any of them, will ever be able to find work at their age within their 
field of occupation.
<P>
	Mr. Peters and others vigorously protested their exclusion, first 
to the Great Lakes regional office of Labour Canada. The assigned 
inspector ruled that on the basis of subsection 235.2(b), their 
complaint against Motorways was unfounded because the hands of 
the bureaucrats were tied by the code.
<P>
	An appeal was then filed on behalf of 133 of the plaintiffs and in 
January 1995, more than a year after the layoffs, Jack Chapman, 
QC, of Winnipeg was appointed referee. Mr. Chapman's 21-page 
judgment rendered on August 31, 1995 hinged on the premise that 
laid-off employees need not actively seek or apply for reduced 
pension benefits in order to be deemed eligible.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	He did not explore, and was not asked to rule on, the issue of 
whether or not section 235 constitutes age discrimination under the 
charter. Mr. Chapman ruled:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is absolutely no question that the primary legislation of concern to 
section 235(1) and (2) of division 11 of part III of the Canada Labour Code.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The scheme of this legislation is to provide for termination pay for employees 
who have completed 12 consecutive months of service. The legislation specifies 
the amount to be paid on termination.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Subsection 2(b) provides that an employer is not deemed to have terminated 
the employment of an employee where the employee is entitled to a pension. 
The purpose of the legislation appears to be to prevent an individual from 
receiving a double benefit, severance pay and a pension. The text of the 
legislation is simply whether the appellants were entitled to receive a pension. 
They were. Accordingly I confirm the decisions of the inspector and dismiss the 
appeal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	After losing his appeal Mr. Peters took a reduced pension at age 
60. He lives on $487 a month and he feels cheated out of the 
$6,872.32 that he would have received had he been three years and 
some months younger. While it is too late to help him, I propose 
that other workers be protected in the future by passing Bill C-219.
<P>
	Under the Canada Labour Code severance pay is a statutory 
right. Pensions on the other hand are a negotiated benefit paid for 
by the contributions of employers or workers or both. The two 
programs serve different needs and they have absolutely nothing to 
do with each other. They should not be traded off one for the other, 
nor should the two be considered a double benefit. It is a patently 
unfair situation.
<P>
	Former Motorways employees under age 55 received severance 
pay and their accrued pension benefits were protected, while those 
55 or over received neither their severance nor their full pension. If 
anyone received a double benefit, and I would vigorously argue
<P>
that nobody did, it would have been the younger workers who were 
able to receive severance pay and have their pensions vested. They 
had the option of leaving their pension funds in the plan or rolling 
them into RRSPs, a course of action which was not open to anyone 
over 55.
<P>
	Older workers deserve the protection of the Canada Labour 
Code. Bill C-219 would replace section 235 with a simple clause 
that explains the circumstances deemed to be termination of 
employment.
<P>
	It would also add a clause to section 236 which would explicitly 
make it clear that entitlement to a pension cannot be used as an 
excuse to deny an employee severance pay.
<P>
	All over Canada statutes and regulations have been or are being 
changed to conform with the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. Age discrimination is no longer acceptable. Denial of a 
statutory right to someone purely on the basis of pension eligibility 
is in my opinion to deny it on the basis of age. Statutory rights are 
rights.
<P>
	There are two issues here. The principal issue is that it is unjust 
and makes no sense to deprive an employee of severance pay just 
because he or she is entitled to a pension or some small portion of a 
pension bought and paid for by contributions unrelated to the 
severance package.
<P>
	The second issue is whether people 55 years of age or older are 
of less value or are entitled to less legal protection than people age 
54 years and 364 days. These two very important issues deserve to 
be fully debated in committee and in this House. I hope that such 
debate will ultimately lead to the passage of Bill C-219.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	There are no Reform, Liberal, Bloc or NDP fingerprints on Bill 
C-219. It is a non-partisan, housekeeping measure to bring the 
Canada Labour Code up to date and to protect thousands of older 
workers who face layoffs as downsizing continues in the federally 
regulated industries.
<P>
	Therefore at this time I beg the unanimous consent of the House 
to make Bill C-219 votable and have it sent to committee at the end 
of this debate.

member wishes to continue debate he still has time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> I will continue very briefly, in view of the 
refusal of some hon. members opposite to even consider having 
this bill debated. I did not at this time expect it to pass. I am really 
quite astonished that any government calling itself Liberal would 
oppose the protection of workers or oppose the effectiveness of the 
charter of rights of freedoms.
<P>
	Hon. members opposite are all fully protected by their gold 
plated MP pension plans which ordinary working people governed 
by the Canada Labour Code cannot count on. I find this 
reprehensible. With that, I will end my remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will attempt to assure the hon. 
member that I am not totally opposed to his bill. However, I have 
some things I want to say tonight. I congratulate him for bringing 
forward this bill.
<P>
	So that all hon. members are clear on what this legislation 
proposes, I will begin by expressing my understanding of this bill. 
In essence, the hon. member is asking that the House of Commons 
amend the Canada Labour Code to provide employees, who at the 
time they are laid off from their job and are entitled to a pension 
under a duly registered pension plan, would have the right to 
severance pay.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This request seems reasonable enough. However, as with many 
other things in life, the member's proposal is not as simple as it 
would appear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To begin with, passage and implementation of the bill would 
alter the legal notion of severance pay by introducing elements of a 
deferred wage. It is not advisable to undertake the changes of this 
nature without full consultation with those who are affected.
<P>
	For clarification, the hon. member is asking that the House 
replace section 235(2) of the Canada Labour Code with the 
following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the purposes of this division, except where otherwise provided by 
regulation, an employer shall be deemed to have terminated the employment of 
a employee, when the employer lays off that employee.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Section 235(2)(b) of the code already contains a similar 
provision that considers employees who are entitled to a pension 
when they are laid off not to have been terminated.
<P>
	As well, section 236 of the code deals with the power of the 
governor in council to make regulations with regard to severance 
pay. The hon. member is requesting that the House amend section 
236. Besides replacing a  portion of the section, he is asking the 
House to add a subsection that would read: ``Notwithstanding 
paragraph 1(a), where an employer lays off an employee who 
immediately, on being laid off, or before that time is entitled to a 
pension under a pension plan, contributed to by the employer that is 
registered pursuant to'' and then the section names the various 
plans. It concludes with: ``The entitlement to such a pension shall 
not be prescribed under paragraph (1)(a) as circumstances in which 
the layoff of the employee shall not be deemed to be a termination 
of the employee's employment by the employee's employer''.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have explained in detail the amendment proposed by the 
member because I think it important that my colleagues in the 
House understand fully the consequences.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The problem is that including this provision in this section does 
not make sense. The reason is it would result in confusion as to 
whether or not the provision constitutes an exception per se or 
whether or not it provides the enabling power to adopt the 
regulation to make that exception.
<P>
	At present under the Canada Labour Code, severance pay is 
considered to be compensation for long and loyal service by an 
employee. It becomes payable to the employee if termination is 
initiated by the employer and is due to reasons other than just 
cause.
<P>
	Furthermore there is nothing in the way this concept is currently 
presented in the code that could be construed to mean that 
severance pay is tantamount to a deferred wage. In fact, the main 
purpose of having a provision requiring an employer to pay 
severance to an employee is to ensure that employers share in the 
social costs of labour adjustment. There are numerous 
circumstances where this provision is of great assistance. It can go 
a long way in helping the employer's former employees when it 
comes to financially bridging the gap between jobs.
<P>
	I am not questioning in any way the hon. member's good 
intentions in presenting this legislation to the House. I am positive 
the hon. member perceives an injustice and believes that elected 
officials of the Parliament of Canada should address it. However, 
as I have attempted to explain, the matter is more complex than it 
might appear on the surface.
<P>
	Labour standards and labour relations have many facets and 
must always be looked at as part of the whole picture. For anyone 
who thinks otherwise, I would suggest that they read ``Seeking a 
Balance'', the recently published review of part I of the Canada 
Labour Code. To illustrate my point I would like to quote from  the 
report of the task force which carried out the review. Of course part 
I of the code is concerned with labour relations. While not specific 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1917"> 1917 </A></B>
<P>
to the proposal in the hon. member's bill, the concerns are similar 
and most certainly related.
<P>
	Under the heading ``The Limits of Legislative Reform'' the task 
force said: ``Legislation cannot fix every problem. Neither the 
Canada Labour Code nor the Canada Labour Relations Board can 
solve every labour-management situation. The parties themselves 
must do that. The Canada Labour Code leaves the parties, 
employers and employees acting through their unions, responsible 
for the quality and much of the content of their day to day working 
relationships. They can act co-operatively to solve problems or 
they can be confrontational. They can ignore their position in the 
economy or they can work together to meet their competition and 
thrive. They can pay attention to social issues that are important to 
workers or they can suffer the long term consequences of avoiding 
them''.
<P>
	In conclusion, the hon. member's bill has merit but the issue 
should be looked at in consultation with the affected employer and 
employee organizations. It should be examined in a comprehensive 
fashion, taking into account the broader issues associated with the 
right to severance pay.
<P>
	The labour program of Human Resources Development Canada 
is currently reviewing part III of the Canada Labour Code, the part 
that deals with severance pay. I assure the hon. member that the 
matter he raises in his bill will be examined along with other issues 
concerning termination and entitlement to severance pay.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for putting forth this bill, but I must ask 
him to be patient. In the light of the current review of the Canada 
Labour Code, it is inappropriate at this time to support this bill. 
Consequently I urge all hon. members not to support the bill.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I find it regrettable to say the least that the government did 
not agree to hold a vote, and I want to say that if the government so 
wishes, we will be pleased to oblige. Since there is already a 
subcommittee on labour, it would be very easy to look at the hon. 
member's bill and to give it the attention that it deserves.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I do not forget that I must look at you when I 
address the Chair, as is our rule.
<P>
	I want to thank the hon. member and remind him that we have all 
met, in our offices, with workers who had been laid off. If we 
represent a riding located in a large Canadian city, particularly a 
city that has undergone an intense industrialization process, we are 
all the more  likely to find ourselves in the situation described by 
the hon. member and to meet with workers experiencing a loss of 
qualification process that is often related to age.
<P>
	The hon. member clearly showed the existence of a two tier 
system which discriminates against those who are losing their 
qualifications in the labour market, and also against those who 
must pay, since these people are entitled to a public or private 
pension.
<P>
	We are talking here about an amendment to Part III of the Labour 
Code. The Canada Labour Code is made up of three parts. The first 
one deals with grievances and the whole issue of collective 
bargaining and collective agreements. The second part deals with 
occupational health and safety. The third part is the equivalent of a 
minimum employment standards act and lists, among others, the 
obligations relating to severance pay.
<P>
	The Canada Labour Code is an important tool which concerns 
about 15 per cent of the labour force, including all those who work 
in banks, interprovincial transportation, hauling, or any of the areas 
that come under the jurisdiction of the Canadian government.
<P>
	The third part of the Labour Code is important because it deals 
with employees' rights, employers' obligations, hours of work, 
minimum wages, equal wages, annual vacations, general holidays, 
maternity leave, severance pay, unjust dismissal and the recovery 
of unpaid salaries.
<P>
	The Minister of Labour recently asked a task force chaired by the 
Mr. Sim, which produced the Sim report, to determine what 
amendments should be made to the Labour Code. It is agreed that, 
in its present form, the Labour Code is not adequate to meet the 
major challenges of the labour market.
<P>
	Again, it would have been very appropriate, in my view, to 
support the hon. member's bill, since we have reached the point 
where the Labour Code must be reviewed.
<P>
	I find it unfortunate that party politics prevent us from 
considering a bill based on its merit. There is no doubt that, beyond 
any partisan consideration-you know how much I have disagreed 
with what the Reformers have said in the past-the fact remains 
that the bill before us today is relevant, in that it will help workers, 
and older workers in particular. The government's partisan motives 
are unfortunate.
<P>
	What are we dealing with? We are dealing with the requirement, 
under section 236 of the Canada Labour Code, which is quite clear 
and specific, to pay an employee whose employment is terminated 
severance pay. Provided the employee has completed twelve of 
employment with the same business or establishment, the 
employer is required to pay the employee either two days wages at 
the employee's regular rate of wages for his regular hours of work 
in respect of each completed year  of employment or five days 
wages 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1918"> 1918 </A></B>
<P>
at the employee's regular rate of wages for his regular hours of 
work.
<P>
	This is an explicit provision and it is clear that, in a context of 
globalization, in which the labour market is changing rapidly and 
the use of technology is growing, with machines gradually taking 
the place of workers, loss of qualification and thus layoff are not 
unusual.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Except that, in the case of a layoff, the employer is not required 
by law to give severance pay even if the employees being laid off 
are entitled to a public or private pension. Given that this provision 
applies to pensions under the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 
1985, the Old Age Security Act, including the guaranteed income 
supplement and spouse's allowance, as well as retirement pensions 
under the Canada pension plan or the Quebec pension plan, what 
the hon. member is suggesting is that we put an end to an unfair, 
discriminatory and all too common practice.
<P>
	It is important to understand what our colleague went through. 
He received a worker with 28 years of service who was laid off by 
an established business in his riding, a capital and labour intensive 
business. This is not an exceptional situation. Government 
members who refused their consent to their colleague should bear 
in mind that it could have been their own brother or father.
<P>
	It could be my father. He has been working in the same textile 
factory for 30 years. He is 58 years old and works in a vulnerable 
sector. Given the changes the textile sector is experiencing, my 
father may well be laid off some day, despite being an honest 
worker and valued employee. If our parents, our friends who are a 
little older are employed by a company working in any sector 
subject to the federal code, they may be laid off and deprived of 
severance pay.
<P>
	I think it is very important to remind the House that severance 
pay is earned; it is not a privilege. It is a right linked to seniority, to 
services rendered. It is not optional.
<P>
	Not only must the Labour Code be reviewed and improved as 
proposed by the hon. member from the Reform Party, but we as 
parliamentarians must reflect on this some day. The Labour Code 
must be tightened. What is needed is legislation on plant closings 
and layoffs, as there is in Ontario and other provinces across 
Canada.
<P>
	There are some regions in the country where it costs a business 
almost nothing to lay off workers. This is what is unacceptable in a 
system such as ours.
<P>
	All this is to tell you that it would have been preferable for the 
government not to indulge in party politics, to recognize that we all 
have older workers in our ridings, that this provision in the Labour 
Code is outdated, that it is a provision that does not respect 
workers. Without wishing to offend my friend in the Reform Party, 
I would  go even further. This is a bill that could have been tabled 
by the NDP. It is a bill tabled by an MP who cares about workers, 
who respects people who, in the environment of large and small 
businesses, are experiencing situations of discrimination.
<P>
	Once again, I repeat, this is an ideal time to approve this sort of 
proposal, because we are going to be making commitments in the 
wake of the Sims report. And the parliamentary secretary knows 
very well that the labour minister is now conducting consultations, 
that he is going to visit five major cities across Canada, and that a 
subcommittee on labour has already been created. It would have 
been a simple matter for this subcommittee to receive the bill, to 
hear witnesses, and to move very, very rapidly to recognize the 
relevance of the bill that has been introduced.
<P>
	With my time running out, and my energy with it, because it is 
already 6 o'clock, I ask you again if you would seek the unanimous 
consent of this House, in light of the information I have provided, 
to have this bill deemed votable and sent to a committee. I ask the 
parliamentary secretary, in all humility and kindness, to give his 
consent, because it is a bill that will serve workers.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is there 
unanimous consent?

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Madam Speaker, with all due respect, I believe 
the question had been put earlier that the bill be made votable. It 
was refused and it has been refused again.
<P>
	Looking at the subject matter, severance pay, and knowing the 
bill has some very positive features, maybe it would be permissible 
to refer the subject matter to committee. The committee would then 
determine if there is an injustice in this regard, which there seems 
to be, and could look at it in a positive way. Then the member could 
make his presentation to the committee.
<P>
	I believe the question of making the bill votable has already been 
put twice and it has been turned down. I think a more positive 
approach might be to refer the subject matter to committee. That 
might receive unanimous support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Madam Speaker, will you rule on the request for 
unanimous consent to send the subject matter to committee?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> My 
understanding is that the parliamentary secretary made a 
suggestion to the hon. member. Therefore there is no formal 
proposal before the House.
<P>
	Resuming debate.

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1919"> 1919 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to follow up on some of the points made by my 
colleague, the hon. member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia.
<P>
	With Bill C-219 the hon. member is trying to remove a clause in 
the Canada Labour Code which clearly discriminates against 
employees under federal jurisdiction on the basis of age. What we 
are talking about is clearly a matter of fairness.
<P>
	My colleague has already pointed out that section 235 of the 
labour code allows a company to deny a terminated employee the 
severance pay which would normally be due him or her if that 
employee were not entitled to early withdrawal of a pension plan.
<P>
	Let me read the exact words as they appear in section 235:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An employer shall be deemed not to have terminated the employment of an 
employee where, either immediately on ceasing to be employed by the 
employer or before that time, the employee is entitled to a pension under a 
pension plan contributed to by the employer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Section 235 does not say the terminated employee actually has to 
apply for the early withdrawal of his pension, he only has to be 
entitled to do so. The terminated worker may have every intention 
of looking for another job and may not want to take a cut in the 
pension which early retirement would entail.
<P>
	Most pension plans in Canada, 87 per cent, entitle an employee 
to early withdrawal of pension benefits at age 55.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	In most cases under federal jurisdiction the age 55 is when an 
employer is legally entitled to terminate a person while saying: 
``Forget the severance pay. Forget the termination pay in lieu of 
sufficient notice and forget the gold watch for that matter''.
<P>
	I have to admit I am feeling a little bit uncomfortable right now, 
as 55 is not that far off in my case. I am just getting started in my 
view. I am not ready to be put out to pasture and I do not think 
many other 55-year-olds are for that matter.
<P>
	Just because a plan states you can retire if you want to does not 
mean you are actually ready to throw in the towel. You might still 
have an awful lot to offer. I submit that most people do, even past 
65 in many instances. I would guess most members of the House 
would agree with me on that issue. Some of us have just figured out 
how to get the best seating plan to get the camera angle, and so I 
would not want to have an early retirement at this stage.
<P>
	Any employer in Canada can terminate an employee whenever 
he or she feels like it. There is no legislation that guarantees anyone 
the right to work. What an employer is required to do is give the 
employee a  reasonable notice of termination of employment. 
Failing that, the employer is required to make a payment equal to 
what the employee would have earned had he worked for that 
notice period. This is referred to as pay in lieu of notice or 
termination pay. The employer is also required to pay any money, 
such as vacation pay, owed to the employee at the time of 
termination.
<P>
	The federal jurisdiction of the Government of Canada and the 
province of Ontario are the only two jurisdictions in Canada that 
have a statutory provision for severance pay in addition to notice of 
termination requirements.
<P>
	Ontario requires that employer, upon termination, give an 
employee one regular week's wages for each year of employment 
to a maximum of 26 weeks. Some may argue that is pretty 
generous. Perhaps that was put in by an NDP government in 
Ontario. In theory, if an employee earns wages of $1,000 per week 
that employee will be entitled to 26 weeks of severance pay, 
$26,000.
<P>
	The severance pay provisions in a federal jurisdiction are not 
quite as rich as that. The employer must pay two days for each year 
worked or five days' wages, whichever is larger. The federal 
severance provision is less than half of what it is in Ontario.
<P>
	However, it begs the question who might be affected by this 
draconian legislation? There are some 700,000 people in this 
category who are affected by the Canada Labour Code. These 
people work in the banking industry, telecommunications, 
transportation, grain handling, ports and broadcasting. We know 
full well that because of our changing environment in terms of how 
long people are employed at different jobs this will become a major 
factor down the road.
<P>
	Some of these sectors, like many others in the economy, will be 
looking for considerable downsizing over the coming periods. That 
is fine. That happens. Companies need the flexibility to increase or 
contract a number of employees according to individual situations 
or as technology develops.
<P>
	Private member's Bill C-219, by removing section 235 from the 
Canada Labour Code, will ensure all terminated employees in those 
sectors are treated equally. Employers will not be able to terminate 
older employees just because it is cheaper to do so. Whether a 
worker is 55 years old plus a few months or 55 years old minus a 
few months will not make a difference.
<P>
	What we want is equality. The Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms states that every individual is equal before the law and 
has the right to equal protection and equal benefit of the law 
without discrimination. This means government rules, regulations 
and programs must not discriminate or cause others to discriminate 
on the basis of individual characteristics such as age.
<P>
	Section 235 of the Canada Labour Code is an anomaly which 
allows, in fact enforces, companies to discriminate on the basis of 
age. Age should be a factor here at all. I  am sure members on the 
other side of the House will agree that section 235 is completely 
unfair. I have difficulty understanding why unanimous consent 
would not be given to allow this to be a votable motion. However, I 
hope some compromise can be reached such as what has been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1920"> 1920 </A></B>
<P>
suggested. This is an unfair section which needs to be reviewed and 
removed from the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	Any terminated employee entitled to a pension should also be 
entitled to receive severance and termination pay just like his or her 
younger co-workers or the younger former co-worker, as this case 
would suggest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rex Crawford (Kent, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak in complete and full support of Bill C-219, an act 
to amend the Canada Labour Code, severance pay, put forward by 
the member for Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia.
<P>
	I applaud the member for bringing this matter forward. As he has 
already mentioned, the bill is a direct result of his responding to his 
constituents, the purpose of private members' business. This is a 
non-partisan hour.
<P>
	I have presented and debated many private members' bills in the 
House of Commons, some successful and others not. It is an 
important part of our work as representatives of the people. This 
bill is an important step forward in amending the Canada Labour 
Code which, at first glance at section 235, is full of age 
discrimination.
<P>
	The Canada Labour Code, which should be leading the way in 
terms of work and labour force, is the only piece of legislation in 
the country that denies severance or termination pay based on an 
employee's eligibility for a pension. This is an inequity that must 
be addressed, and Bill C-219 does that.
<P>
	Company pension plans, RRSPs and the Canada pension plan are 
all part of retirement. They are becoming increasingly important in 
the tough times ahead. According to Statistics Canada, 65 is the 
normal retirement age and 55 is when most people are eligible for 
early retirement.
<P>
	As well, a reduced pension is the norm for early retirement. Even 
if an employee is not a member of a company sponsored registered 
retirement plan, severance could be denied at age 60 because they 
could receive Canada pension.
<P>
	Some will say section 235 is there to disallow a double benefit, 
but comparing severance to pension is like comparing soya beans 
and apples. It is not a double benefit in my opinion. Supposedly the 
charter of rights and Freedoms guarantees freedom from 
discrimination based on age.
<P>
	As we all know, demographically the population is getting older. 
Employers aged 55 and older could be targeted for layoffs to save 
companies money.
<P>
	Bill C-219 comes at an important time. Termination of 
employment is now of considerable magnitude, especially when 
the economy is not as buoyant as it could be. Basically, an 
employer can terminate an employee whenever he or she feels like 
it. There is nothing in Canada that guarantees anyone the right to 
work.
<P>
	What an employer is required to do is provide the employee with 
a reasonable notice of termination or payment equal to what the 
employee would have earned had they worked for the notice 
period, referred to as either pay in lieu of notice or termination pay, 
and any other money such as vacation pay which is owed to the 
employee at the time of termination.
<P>
	The federal jurisdiction and Ontario are the only two in Canada 
that make statutory provisions for severance pay in addition to 
notice of termination requirements. Therefore in all other 
jurisdictions an employer may terminate an employee's service 
forthwith if the employer pays the employee an amount equal to the 
wages the employee would have earned in regular work hours for 
the period required by the notice provisions.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-219 is to remove from part III of the 
Canada Labour Code section 235, which denies severance pay to 
employees. Passage of this bill would end an injustice and would 
end the age discrimination which is enshrined in the Canada 
Labour Code.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	I have had similar situations with constituents in the past who 
offered the examples cited by workers in the riding of Swift 
Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia.
<P>
	As the hon. member has outlined very clearly, in 1993 
Motorways Limited, an interprovincial trucking firm, closed its 
Canada-wide operation. Employees under the age of 55 on the 
closing date received two days severance pay for each year of 
service. However employees who were 55 years of age or over did 
not, regardless of their years of service. This to me was a flagrant 
injustice to people who had worked hard. Motorways was allowed 
to deny its former employees age 55 or older their severance 
because part III of the labour code, section 235(b) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An employer shall be deemed not to have terminated the employment of an 
employee, where, either immediately on ceasing to be employed by the 
employer, or before that time, the employee is entitled to a pension under a 
pension plan contributed to by the employer-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In practice this means very clearly that if a company is laying off 
workers it is not obligated to pay severance to those who are 55 
years of age or older because those employees are entitled to early 
withdrawal of pension benefits even though they could be severely 
penalized for taking benefits before age 65.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1921"> 1921 </A></B>
<P>
	The employees of Motorways filed appeals under the Canada 
Labour Code. In September 1995 the appointed appeals referee 
cited section 235 and ruled in favour of the company. He stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of this legislation appears to be to prevent an individual from 
receiving a double benefit; that is, severance pay and a pension. The text of the 
legislation is simply whether the appellants were entitled to receive a pension. 
They were. Accordingly, I confirm the decisions of the inspector and dismiss the 
appeals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	After losing the appeal, the hon. member's constituent took his 
pension at age 60, which meant a 5 per cent reduction. He gets $487 
a month and he feels cheated out of the $6,872.32 he would have 
received had he been three years younger. We must make sure that 
this injustice does not happen again.
<P>
	During the appeal process, the decision to deny stated that a 
pension and severance pay are double benefits. This is a misnomer. 
Severance and termination pay are a statutory benefit. The details 
are regulated by law for all employers within a specified 
jurisdiction. Hon. members will be aware that a pension is a 
negotiated benefit. The details are part of an overall benefits 
package and can vary widely from industry to industry, employer to 
employer and even job to job.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Would the 
hon. member please conclude his remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crawford:</B> Madam Speaker, in conclusion I fully support 
Bill C-219. Older workers deserve protection from the Canada 
Labour Code which is why I am pleased to advocate this bill. It 
would replace section 235 with a simple clause outlining the 
reasons deemed to be termination of employment. I urge all 
members to support it.
<P>
	At this time I would like to ask the House for unanimous consent 
that Bill C-219 be withdrawn, the order for second reading be 
discharged and that the subject matter be referred to the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development.
<P>

<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud</B>: Madam Speaker, I would certainly welcome this. As 
we review the Canada Labour Code we certainly will take a look at 
this very worthwhile subject matter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> We have 
unanimous consent to have the subject matter referred to a

<P>
	(Bill withdrawn, and subject matter thereof referred to a 
committee.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I now ask the 
consent of the House to take a brief recess in order to prepare for 
the adjournment debate at 6:30 p.m.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, if you were to request 
unanimous consent, I believe that we would be prepared to go still 
further than you suggest and declare it to be 6:30 p.m., because 
those who will be speaking in the adjournment debate are, 
apparently, already prepared.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, last week when I rose in my place to ask a 
question about the future of Canada's national parks and historic 
sites, I was very concerned about what the Liberal government 
seemed to be doing. I was aware that the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, the minister responsible for the national parks and 
historic sites system, was about to implement a plan developed by 
the bean counters in Treasury Board called the employee takeover 
program.
<P>
	I was convinced that anyone who had had any experience in our 
national parks or at our national historic sites would never have 
agreed to proceed with this foolhardy program which called for 
one-half of the existing staff of Parks Canada to either quit their 
jobs or wait to be fired and then if they wanted, to form a business 
company, come back and bid on the contracts which would be let 
out on their old jobs.
<P>
	There are of course numerous problems with this proposal, not 
the least of which is the threat this privatization makes to the entire 
parks and national historic sites system throughout Canada.
<P>
	This scheme came to our attention during committee study of the 
government's spending estimates. There the members of the 
committee learned that the Department of Canadian Heritage 
wanted to reduce its workforce to 2,000 employees from 4,000 and 
remove roughly 24 per cent of its budget. The employee takeover 
plan was the scheme to achieve both goals.
<P>
	Obviously people who worked in the parks system knew that this 
24 per cent saving, or roughly $98 million over four years, was 
going to come at their expense. When they looked at the services 
they were providing to the public, they justifiably pointed out that 
the system would also result in lost services to the public.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1922"> 1922 </A></B>
<P>
	Since then the dedicated people who work for Parks Canada have 
reviewed what little information is available to them. Almost 
unanimously from all parts of Canada they have reacted very 
negatively to the minister's proposal. In addition, neighbouring 
communities, their businesses and their leaders have commented 
negatively on the impact such activity would have on them.
<P>
	I had said previously, and my words were coming back to me 
from these communities, that this scheme would result in increased 
costs, reduced service, lower wages and lost jobs for hundreds of 
dedicated long term employees of Parks Canada.
<P>
	I had also said in a letter to the minister that similar situations 
were in existence in parts of British Columbia and the United 
States and except for the odd success story the overwhelming result 
of these existing experiences was failure.
<P>
	I was concerned that should this scheme fail, which I was sure it 
would, there would be very little that could be done to correct the 
mistakes and that our parks and national historic sites were much 
too important to leave to chance. I asked the minister to postpone 
the plan to implement this scheme as of July 1 of this year and 
study much more carefully the implications of its failure.
<P>
	I was pleased that the minister, who has a good understanding of 
the parks system thanks to her term as Minister of the 
Environment, said the program would be slowed down to look at 
other options. At the same time I remain concerned that the bottom 
line for the minister and the government appears to be the reduction 
in spending rather than the provision of services in a section of our 
economy that does not have much ability to generate its own 
revenue.
<P>
	I appreciate the fact that the department will take some 
additional time to examine options other than the employee 
takeover program, which does nothing to address the 
circumstances in the parks.
<P>
	I urge the minister to review the mandate of the parks system, 
establish a clearly understood plan to ensure the ongoing 
operational and development success of the parks and national 
historic sites and to put in place the type of funding that is 
necessary to secure the long term protection of our historic and 
environmental heritage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me on behalf of the Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage to respond to the 
comments made by my hon. colleague, the member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake.
<P>
	The question is very timely, I am pleased to say. The Minister of 
Canadian Heritage today is signing with her provincial counterpart 
an agreement to create Wapusk National Park near Churchill, 
Manitoba.
<P>
	Members know that these are challenging times and Parks 
Canada has to do its share. By 1998-99, federal funding to Parks 
Canada will be reduced by $98 million. This means its 
appropriation will go down to $259 million.
<P>
	Parks Canada is offsetting these reductions somewhat through its 
cost recovery efforts. While revenues will reach $64 million by 
1998-99, they do not offset cuts of this magnitude.
<P>
	Parks Canada is committed to achieving these reductions while 
maintaining its core mandate to provide for the use and enjoyment 
of all Canadians a system of national parks, national historic sites 
and related protected areas and to manage these places in a manner 
that leaves them unimpaired for future generations. Parks Canada 
will continue to secure and set aside parks and sites for future 
generations.
<P>
	Given the economic impact of parks and sites, the government 
intends to keep the parks and sites open for the enjoyment of all 
Canadians and for our international visitors.
<P>
	To achieve the level of reductions we are considering a number 
of options. And in keeping with the direction the federal 
government has adopted under program review, Parks Canada is 
reducing its involvement in direct delivery of services.
<P>
	One option that is now being pursued by Parks Canada is 
employee takeovers. Treasury Board released a government-wide 
employee takeover policy on February 22, 1996. It is an innovative 
policy outlining an effective option for service delivery.
<P>
	The minister has already indicated to the member and he alluded 
to the fact that we are studying other options besides this one. The 
minister is determined to adopt an approach or approaches which 
will be best for the staff while achieving reductions and preserve 
the Parks Canada mandate for all Canadians.
<P>

adjourn the House is deemed to have been moved. This House 
stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m.
