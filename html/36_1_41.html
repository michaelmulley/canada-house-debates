<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-216, an act to amend the Access to Information Act (crown 
corporations), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, my private member's bill has a very 
simple concept.  Crown corporations are split; some crown 
corporations are subject to access to information and others are 
not.  That is basically the crux of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Access to Information Act was passed in 1983 and gives 
Canadians broad legal rights to get information from crown 
corporations and federal government institutions.  The 
institutions then have 30 days to respond to those requests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, many crown corporations are exempt from the Access to 
Information Act.  I will list a number of them.  The Canadian 
Development Investment Corporation and Canada Lands Company are 
both exempt.  Canada Lands Company is the federal arm that sells 
federal real estate.  Why should it be exempt from access to 
information?  This does not make any sense.  It is selling 
Canadian assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post Corporation is also exempt.  Why should it be 
exempt?  I had a letter from André Ouellet, the head of Canada 
Post, objecting to my bill, saying that Canada Post is open and 
accessible in front of committees.  I happened to be the Reform 
member on the public works committee in the last Parliament and 
we had members of Canada Post Corporation in front of us. They 
were anything but open.  We were trying to get the subsidy on the 
45 cent stamp whether it was going over to Purolator.  We just 
wanted the straight facts on how much of the 45 cent stamp goes 
to Purolator.  Canada Post simply refused to answer.  However, 
the letter I received from the head stated it was very open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have introduced this bill because it would open up Canada Post 
to the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is another one.  Why 
should CBC not be subject to access to information?  It should 
have its books opened up.  The Canadian National Railway is also 
exempt.  The Canadian Wheat Board is an interesting one because 
there is legislation before the House now that would take the 
wheat board out of the exemption status and put it into the area 
where Canadians can get information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Cape Breton Development Corporation, Enterprise Cape Breton 
Corporation, Halifax Port Corporation and Montreal Port 
Corporation are also exempt. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is interesting.  Why would Montreal and Halifax be exempt, 
and yet there are a number of other ports where there is access? 
This whole area is a dog's breakfast because some are open and 
some are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All my bill would do is make all crown corporations subject to 
access to information.  There are a number of other members in 
this House who have different access to information private 
members' bills in, two on the government side and two on the 
opposition side that I am aware of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows Canadians' interest in having the government 
accountable, government corporations, the federal departments 
open so that Canadians can access them, can find out what is 
going on inside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a closed club.  This is just Canadians' money, 
Canadians wanting to know what is going on.  My bill is votable. 
I am looking forward to the day when we can all stand up in this 
House and vote for it because I think it is a bill that has broad 
acceptance right across the floor, right around this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason this bill is put forward is to enhance public 
confidence in our government.  Confidence in government 
institutions is dwindling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last session of Parliament the auditor general published 
a scathing report on the operation of crown corporations on 
October 5, 1995.  The auditor general is saying that crown 
corporations need to clean up their act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their problems were either in corporate and strategic planning 
or performance in measurement and reporting.  Crown corporations 
need to be brought up.  They need to be enhanced so they are 
accountable to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned Canada Post. The government refused to put Canada 
Post forward for access to information in the last Parliament. 
Yet the Radwanski report, the report that did a detailed study of 
Canada Post, recommended that in fact Canada Post be open to 
access.  The government failed to take that advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is taxpayer money in these corporations that we are talking 
about.  It is not some business or whatever.  There would also 
have to be, in my mind, some cushions.  For example, if there is 
a crown corporation that is in the open market, there would have 
to be some cushion that would allow that corporation to not 
divulge all its information if it is competing with a private 
enterprise because it has to be a level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could not be allowed to open everything up so that the other 
corporation is private but then get into its market.  There are 
some stumbling blocks.  They are not stumbling blocks but little 
bumps on the road that need to be ironed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go over some of the corporations that I was 
talking about before.  These corporations are already open.  The 
Bank of Canada is open to access.  CMHC and Canada Ports are 
open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying earlier, Canada Ports is free for access, yet 
the Halifax port is not.  It is just all over the place so that 
if we go through the list it makes absolutely no sense why one 
corporation, a port particularly, is not available and yet 
another one is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You have my support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour:</B>  This member says that I have support. 
That is two votes.  We are really adding up here.  The clock is 
just ticking ahead and we are very early in the game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour:</B>  Do I hear four?  This is moving ahead 
very quickly.  I am not going to elaborate greatly on this 
because the bill is so simple.  In fact, there are about five 
words in the whole bill that basically change crown corporations 
from being split the way they are, some accessible, access to 
information, and others not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill simply makes all crown corporations open to access.  I 
think it is a good bill.  I think it is a bill that will be 
supported broadly across this House.  I hope, particularly, that 
the government side sees this as the way to go.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to 
speak today on the bill by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to thank the members of my riding of 
Bruce—Grey for returning me to Parliament.  I came to this 
country in 1966 with my family, my wife Verona, my daughter 
Sonja, who was six months old at the time, and my son Andrew.  I 
knew it was one of the best countries in the world. 
It has certainly proven itself to be so.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a high school teacher and in 1968 I moved to Owen Sound 
and entered public life.  I did so because I wanted to make a 
difference, to make the community better.  I became a Liberal 
member because of the the programs of the Liberal Party of caring 
for the aged, the young, health care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that sometimes when I am sitting in the 
House I am reminded of my old classroom days.  I taught auto 
mechanics to a young man named John Garvey who is now one of the 
best mechanics we have in our city.  I had many conversations 
with him about his future and his career.  I had conversations 
with many young men in the locker room after a basketball game, 
such as Kevin Belbeck who is now a veterinarian and has a good 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 2, I was reminded by the arrival of my grand-daughter, 
Haley Jackson Bruin, a member of the next generation of the 
Jackson family of this great country of ours.  I know her future 
will be sustained because we in the House, the highest court in 
the land, do a good job with our human and material resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-216 tabled by the hon. member for Nanaimo—Alberni is one 
that I cannot support.  The hon. member's bill will redefine the 
current definition of government institution in section 3 of the 
Access to Information Act to mean any department or ministry of 
state of the Government of Canada listed on schedule I, any body 
or office listed on schedule I, or any crown corporation as 
defined in the Financial Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect the bill would redefine government institution in the 
Access to Information Act to include all crown corporations.  A 
weighty proposal, indeed, and one which warrants thorough 
examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passed in 1983, the act gave Canadians a broad legal right to 
information recorded in any form under the control of most 
federal institutions.  Access rights are not absolute.  They are 
subject to specific and limited exemptions, balancing the freedom 
of information against individual privacy, commercial 
confidentiality and national security.  The hon. member's bill 
would alter that balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 27 crown corporations are already subject to the act.  We 
recognize in principle that crown corporations can be subject to 
the act.  For example, the Bank of Canada and Canada Post are 
subject to the act, while Atomic Energy of Canada Limited is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-216 would snare all crown corporations under the Access 
to Information Act.  It assumes no difference in purpose among 
crown corporations.  It does not consider the different 
environments in which they operate and it makes no allowances for 
the different demands placed upon crown corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's crown corporations operate at arm's length from the 
government in providing services to Canadians.  They do so within 
the market in competition with private interests as the sole 
actor in a given area.  Therefore not all crown corporations 
operate in the same environment or under the same conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those crown corporations that operate within the market do so in 
a competitive setting.  The market is useful in allocating 
certain goods and services, but it is not perfect.  A public 
presences helps ensure the delivery of goods and services to 
Canadians where delivery through private sector alone is found 
wanting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ask ourselves how Bill C-216 would affect crown 
corporations operating in the market.  By placing all crown 
corporations without exception under the Access to Information 
Act, the bill would put requirements on crown corporations that 
are not placed on private sector competitors.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-216 will place crown corporations at a competitive 
disadvantage.  The Access to Information Act requires that 
government institutions respond to access to information requests 
within 30 days.  Time, personnel and other resources will be 
devoted in order to comply.  This is understood.  However the 
free market operates within a slim market for its expenses.  Bill 
C-216 would force crown corporations to spend time, money and 
energy answering questions that their competitors are not 
required to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want crown corporations to compete under fair and 
equitable conditions.  Under the bill a competitor could bind a 
crown corporation in endless requests for information, putting a 
drain on time, people and finances that no private competitor 
would have to endure.  Under Bill C-216 a competitor could obtain 
vital business information about a crown corporation with no 
obligation to reciprocate by disclosing similar material in 
return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Atomic Energy of Canada Limited is an example of a crown 
corporation that operates in a highly competitive environment. It 
competes on a commercial basis in the marketplace and should be 
treated the same as its competitors.  AECL is thus able to 
protect its sensitive commercial information as well as 
commercial information received from global customers and partner 
companies.  If AECL or Canada Post were unable to protect 
confidential commercial information from competitors, its ability 
to compete could be seriously affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's Bill C-216 would jeopardize equal treatment in 
the marketplace for AECL, Canada Post and other crown 
corporations.  Has the hon. member consulted crown corporations 
on the bill?  Does he not believe in fair and equal treatment in 
the marketplace, or would he prefer that all crown corporations 
simply withdraw altogether from the market? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who speak on behalf of Bill C-216 may use the language of 
accountability and transparency, but by putting conditions on 
crown corporations that are not placed on private companies they 
show disdain for or at least misunderstanding of the idea of a 
public presence in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a great House where we can debate and discuss ideas. The 
hon. member must have felt some things could be changed when he 
drafted the bill.  These things could happen if the government 
wanted to do so.  However, as I have explained, his bill would 
jeopardize a lot of the business the Government of Canada is 
trying to do for people.  We already have built-in mechanisms and 
ministers report to the House on these matters.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a privilege and an honour for me to represent the people of 
Jonquière, who elected me in the last election and expect greater 
transparency in their government institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased, therefore, to inform you that the Bloc Quebecois 
is in favour of Bill C-216, an Act to amend the Access to 
Information Act, presented by my colleague for Nanaimo—Alberni. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is aimed at broadening application of the Access to 
Information Act to include crown corporations as defined by the 
Financial Administration Act, making them more accessible to the 
people of Quebec and of Canada, and requiring them to be answerable 
for their administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois cannot do otherwise than to approve this 
bill, in the name of democratic principles, the taxpayer's right to 
know, and our desire to see greater transparency in the 
administration of public affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will remind my colleagues in this House that the Access to 
Information Act was passed in 1982 and implemented the following 
year.  This act obliged governmental institutions to give access to 
their documents.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will pass over the exceptions to access to information in 
order to address our primary concern, which is the fact that a 
number of crown corporations are not subject to this act.  On 
numerous occasions during the 35th Parliament, the Bloc Quebecois 
has spoken out on having the Access to Information Act apply to all 
publicly funded government institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those of you who were in this House during the previous 
Parliament, I will remind you that the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques tabled a 
motion, Motion No. 260 to be precise, which read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
make all Crown corporations subject to the Privacy Act. 
</UL>
<That motion was passed unanimously on April 15, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind you, to guide us in our reflection on Bill C-216, 
that all of the arguments around Motion No. 260 focused on 
broadening the scope of the Privacy Act and the Access to 
Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of us can take the statement of principle adopted by the 
House as an invitation to move to another stage in amending the 
Access to Information Act.  The Bloc Quebecois is not the only one 
to argue for broadening of the Access to Information Act. 
We can go back as far as 1987, when the Standing Committee on 
Justice and the Solicitor General recommended that crown 
corporations be more accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recommended that the Access to Information Act 
and the Privacy Act be extended to include crown corporations and 
wholly owned subsidiaries that appear in the Treasury Board's 
annual report to Parliament on crown corporations and joint 
ventures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle, the committee wanted the Access to Information 
Act to be applied to crown corporations in which the government had 
controlling interest and which provided the public with goods and 
services on a commercial or semi-commercial basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee's recommendations are unequivocal. 
The commercial nature of certain corporations is no reason to 
exclude them from the provisions of the bill before us.  In fact, 
the Standing Committee on Justice and the Solicitor General felt 
that the legitimate secrets of these corporations would be properly 
protected by the various exceptions provided by the Access to 
Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, sections 18 and 20, which concern 
issues relating to Canada's economic interests and disclosure of 
trade secrets, provide for such exceptions.  I do not agree with 
the viewpoint we will no doubt hear expressed on this sort of 
argument, which I consider without merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that John Grace, the commissioner of 
information in 1993-94, recommended extending the Access to 
Information Act to cover all federal institutions, including crown 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, the crown corporations are covered by the 
Official Languages Act since its enactment in 1969.  In addition, 
subsidiaries established under federal law, which are the exclusive 
property of crown corporations, come under the Financial 
Administration Act since its amendment in 1984.  So, there are 
precedents for Bill C-216. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of questions have been raised regarding the Canada 
Post Corporation's operations and its funding.  There is a flagrant 
lack of transparency. 
Many Canadians and Quebeckers think that the government should be more 
actively involved in supervising Canada Post in the public interest.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Extending the Access to Information Act to Canada Post would allow 
us, parliamentarians, to make the corporation accountable for its 
overall administration, about which we hardly know anything. And this is 
but one instance where parliamentarians have very little information to 
work from in answering the numerous inquiries from their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all, 15 years after its coming into effect, it is high time 
for the government to broaden the scope of the Access to Information Act 
as provided for in Bill C-216. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many taxpayers wonder about the enormous salaries paid to crown 
corporation executives, as social programs are being slashed. No wonder 
they are sceptical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many Quebeckers and Canadians are disillusioned by federal 
institutions, public administration and politicians. The time has come 
to change tack and show our commitment to the democratic values of our 
society. A relationship of trust must be restored between governments 
and the public, and I sincerely believe that passing the bill before us 
would be a positive step in this direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore ask my hon. colleagues in the House of Commons to 
carefully consider the merits of the proposed amendments and support 
this bill aimed at broadening the Access to Information Act to include 
crown corporations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to get this debate on track immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I obviously support Bill C-216.  I think it is an excellent bill 
in every way, and very important right now.  However, this 
morning when I arrived at my office, the effect of Bill C-216 was 
clearly felt because on my desk were representations by letter 
from the CBC and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited complaining that 
this bill, if passed into law, would be a serious threat to their 
competitive position and other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let's just get it straight for everyone.  Section 18 of the 
existing Access to Information Act fully protects the competitive 
position of any government institution.  I will read a section 
from that.  Section 18 states:  “The head of a government 
institution”, which could be CBC or AECL “can refuse to 
disclose any record requested under the act that contains trade 
secrets or financial, commercial, scientific or technical 
information that belongs to a government institution and has 
substantial value”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in subsection (b) of section 18 it states that the 
“government institution can refuse to disclose information that 
can be reasonably expected to prejudice the competitive position 
of a government institution”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the greatest respect for the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the President of the Treasury Board, the hon. member for 
Bruce—Grey, but the reality is that the current Access to 
Information Act fully protects an institution's competitive 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you go further through section 18 you will find other 
provisions.  In fact, it is too broad because it does not put a 
monetary value on the commercial information that belongs to the 
government institution.  It should, and I think an amendment is 
in order there.  Let's get it straight from the outset that there 
is no problem with respect to the competitive position of Canada 
Post or anyone else.  That is a red herring.  It is a red herring 
that has been around for years and it is time we were done with 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I received a letter from the CBC and it raised an 
additional concern, that we should hesitate with regard to 
applying the Access to Information Act to an organization like 
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.  It brought up the 
question of journalistic integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been a journalist for a long time, both as a reporter and 
as an editor, and I cannot say that I can remember a single 
instance in which I received or sent a note that I was not 
willing to let the public see.  Journalists are like politicians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that neither journalists nor politicians want to 
do anything that is improper.  When we talk about journalistic 
integrity, we mean not only what is open and public but also what 
is not open and public.  There should be nothing in journalism 
that should not be available to the public to read.  There may be 
some things that would cause embarrassment, but that is another 
case entirely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot see the problem of opening up the CBC to the Access to 
Information Act.  There may be an argument that the journalists 
receive all kinds of information in confidence from the people 
they talk to.  Indeed, editors and reporters do discuss with 
individuals in confidence when they are preparing stories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 19 of the current Access to Information Act covers that 
as well.  It says that a government institution may refuse to 
disclose any information which is considered personal information 
under section 3 of the Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to have that section 3 of the Privacy Act.  I will not 
read all of the types of personal information protected by the 
Privacy Act and consequently would be protected under the Access 
to Information Act, but section (b) says it would be information 
relating to the medical, criminal or employment history of an 
individual.  Another section says correspondence sent to a 
government institution by the individual is implicitly 
confidential and the views and opinions of another individual 
about the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we examine that section of the Privacy Act which is covered 
by the Access to Information Act, we realize that a journalist 
and an MP for that matter in dealing in a confidential manner 
with the public, those confidential dealings would be excluded 
under the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC has no case for exclusions under the act because the act 
already provides for the type of concerns the CBC might raise. On 
the other hand, what would we get if the Access to Information 
Act did apply to the CBC or AECL?  What would we get access to? 
We might get access to records that deal with mismanagement.  We 
might get access to records that deal with nepotism.  I 
understand from some of my sources that nepotism is a little bit 
of a problem in the CBC.  We might get access to records that 
deal with laziness or political correctness.  I bet the CBC has a 
problem with political correctness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would we not as parliamentarians and the public love to see 
documents pertaining to political correctness.  What it boils 
down to is this.  We cannot regulate institutions whether they 
are for profit government institutions or whatever unless we have 
transparency.  We cannot have accountability without 
transparency.  We must have a certain level of confidentiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Access to Information Act there is plenty of provision 
for that and maybe too much.  The important thing is for open 
government.  An institution that proclaims itself to be an 
institution of integrity should be willing to have much of its 
documents open to the public so that we the taxpayer, the MPs who 
are actually paying the salary of the CBC, can see whether its is 
running as efficiently as it should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support Bill C-216.  I think every member of this House should 
get onside. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in this House today to speak on private 
members Bill C-216, an act to amend the Access to Information Act 
with respect to crown corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party has always favoured more openness and transparency in 
government.  It is important for taxpayers to know how their 
government is spending their money.  It is important for 
Canadians to understand what are the priorities of their 
parliament and how the bureaucracy is implementing the 
government's agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill raises a new issue.  Should the Access to Information 
Act be extended to include crown corporations as defined under 
the Financial Administration Act?  Some crown corporations are 
already subject to the Access to Information Act such as Canada 
Mortgage and House Corporation.  Others such as Canada Post and 
Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. are not.  The argument made most 
often by these companies is that because they are subject to 
competitive pressures of the marketplace, they should be exempt 
from the access act. 
Their legitimate fear is their competitors will use the act to 
obtain sensitive competitive information which could be used to 
undermine the corporation's competitive advantage.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I phoned the information commissioner's office not long ago to 
try to resolve these competing interests.  What I learned is that 
under section 18 of the Access to Information Act government 
institutions can exempt competitively sensitive information. Here 
is what the act says:  “The head of a government institution may 
refuse to disclose any record requested under this act that 
contains (a) trade secrets or financial, commercial, scientific 
or technical information that belongs to the Government of Canada 
or a government institution and has substantial value or is 
reasonably likely to have substantial value; (b) information the 
disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to prejudice the 
competitive position of a government institution”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to also exclude “information the disclosure of which 
could reasonably be expected to be materially injurious to the 
financial interests of the Government of Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 18 then may offer exemptions significant enough under 
the act that crown corporations would be able to comply with the 
act without having to disclose sensitive competitive information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are issues which must be resolved before a change to the 
Access to Information Act can be contemplated.  In principle we 
support this bill subject to some changes which I foresee as 
necessary to protect the integrity of the crown corporations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, 
the bill before us in the House seeks to make all crown 
corporations subject to the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member introduced his bill he mentioned that crown 
corporations such as Canada Post, among others, should be subject 
to the Access to Information Act in order to make them 
accountable. He also mentioned that crown corporations are exempt 
from the act even though they are subsidized by the taxpayers of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found his comments very interesting because I have a special 
interest in Canada Post as the Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services who happens to 
hold the responsibility for Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore like to concentrate my remarks on the impact 
the proposed amendments would have on Canada Post Corporation. 
First, let me put to rest a fundamental misconception.  I am 
happy to inform the hon. member that since 1988 Canada Post 
Corporation has not received a single cent of taxpayers' support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did it accomplish this impressive feat?  It did it because 
of the direction provided by the Liberal government that created 
Canada Post Corporation back in 1981.  I mentioned before in 1981 
Canada Post was incorporated for the purpose of operating on a 
self-sustaining financial basis.  As one of the few crown 
corporations under the Financial Administration Act, it is 
recognized that Canada Post operates in a competitive 
environment.  It also is recognized by members on this side of 
the House that it is not dependent on the appropriations of the 
Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that Canada Post Corporation needs to be 
open and accountable and I have to say that it is entirely that 
position this government supports. However, if one looks at the 
facts, one sees that it is already the case at Canada Post.  One 
only has to read Canada Post's annual statement this year to see 
that the crown corporation is committed to these principles in 
both its operation and financial reporting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually the front page of the report says “A Look Inside Our 
Business”.  If the hon. member had taken time to read the report 
he would have noticed that Canada Post Corporation has its 
results on a segmented basis and includes an opinion from an 
independent auditor confirming Canada Post does not 
cross-subsidize competitive services with revenues from basic 
letter service. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT10"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT10"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1145
<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report also provides a detailed discussion of the financial 
results to the highest standard, that required of publicly listed 
companies.  Canada Post is in fact far more open to public 
scrutiny than its competitors and that is because of this 
government's commitment to openness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since October 1, 1997 Canadians can count on an additional level 
of accountability at Canada Post with the appointment of a Canada 
Post ombudsman who will provide an independent avenue for 
customers whose issues or problems cannot be resolved through 
normal channels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, Canada Post has a commercial mandate. 
This mandate was reconfirmed recently when Canada Post underwent 
a review of its mandate.  In its final response to the Canada 
Post mandate review, the government confirmed that the 
corporation requires a commercial mandate in order to ensure that 
Canadians enjoy a universal postal service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector competes with many of the services offered by 
Canada Post. Having financial objectives comparable to that of 
the private sector, Canada Post cannot successfully continue to 
meet its mandate if it cannot compete on a level playing field 
with its competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Federal Express spokesman appearing before a Canada Post 
mandate review committee in 1996 highlighted the concern that all 
companies operating in competitive markets have in regard to 
access to proprietary information.  He said, “I would obviously 
love to see Canada Post's detailed financial information but I do 
not think it is fair because, should I see it, then our 
competitors ought to see mine”.  I am in favour of fairness, but 
what the hon. member is proposing is obviously not fair. Even the 
Federal Express employee recognized this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must have regard to public interest.  In many of 
the markets in which Canada Post participates, it faces vigorous 
competition including that posed by large, well financed 
multinationals such as United Parcel Service and FedEx. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The requirement that Canada Post disclose costs, revenue, 
operational and consumer information would certainly create a 
very uneven playing field.  Although I do not dispute the merits 
of accountability and openness in the sectors of the federal 
government, one must consider the impact of applying across the 
board disclosure rules to commercial crown corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case Canada Post would be placed at a very obvious 
disadvantage with its competitors unable to collect information 
themselves but their competitors know all the competitive 
strategies enlisted by Canada Post. Under the disclosure 
environment being proposed, these competitors would be under no 
obligation to release their operational figures to Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reduced competitiveness of Canada Post resulting from 
compliance with the Access to Information Act would impact on 
Canada Post's ability to require self-sufficiency.  This may in 
turn reduce the level of postal service to Canadians at a much 
higher cost to postal services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deserve an affordable universal postal service. 
Despite the challenges posed by this country's size, low 
population density and extreme weather conditions, Canada Post 
has been able to provide a postal rate that continues to be among 
the lowest in the world. That is very good for Canadians and 
something we all should be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, this government is committed to openness.  The 
government is committed to accountability.  However, the 
legislation before us would cause more harm to Canadians than 
good. It is not in the public interest and that is why I cannot 
support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when 
I came into the House today I did not intend to speak on this 
particular matter.   However it is an important bill and I feel 
compelled to stand and rebut some of the things my colleagues 
across the way are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first point out to my hon. friend that Canada Post is a 
monopoly.  That is its biggest competitive advantage.  I do not 
think any of the competitors of Canada Post are going to be able 
to succeed in somehow imperilling the ability of Canada Post to 
get by when it is a monopoly.  In fact the hon. member said it 
would reduce service.  Well I point out that we have no service 
today.  We have a postal strike and that is because there is a 
monopoly in Canada Post.  I thought it was important to point 
that out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak to Bill C-216 from the perspective of a 
westerner. 
I note that one of the things Bill C-216 would do would be to 
open up the Canadian Wheat Board to an access to information 
request.  I cannot say how important that is to western producers 
today. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members and many Canadians across the country know, right now 
in western Canada there is great dissatisfaction with the 
Canadian Wheat Board on a number of fronts.  One of the ones that 
is most important is that producers in the west do not know for 
sure that they are getting the best possible price for their 
grain. Yesterday when I was in my hometown I saw a bumper sticker 
on a truck which read “We want the Canadian Wheat Board to be 
subject to access to information requests”.  That is very 
reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need to point out here is that farmers who grow their 
own wheat do not have the ability ultimately to find out how much 
the wheat board is selling that grain for, whether or not it is 
getting the best possible price.  It is impossible for them to 
determine that. I would argue that when we are talking about 
hundreds of millions of dollars, when we are talking about the 
livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people, they should as a 
basic right know what is going on with their grain and what is 
happening in terms of the price they are getting for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly support this legislation, Bill C-216.  I urge all 
members to consider supporting it.  It does after all bring 
accountability to crown corporations at a time when, I would 
argue, unfortunately politicians are held in fairly low regard 
partially because it seems as if we try to protect our own 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way to ensure that we do not do that is to open all the 
crown corporations up to access to information legislation so 
that Canadians can scrutinize these things.  The auditor general 
can scrutinize them.  Right now he does not have the ability to 
do that in some cases.  Then we could ensure that money that is 
being spent on behalf of Canadians is being spent wisely and in 
their interests. 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak on Bill C-216 which seeks to have the Access 
to Information Act apply to crown corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say at the outset that I have a great deal of respect 
for the private members' bill process.  It is one of the few ways 
in which members have an opportunity to come forward with various 
legislative initiatives, hopefully to make sure that our 
government and its operations are working well and that the best 
interests of our constituents are well represented in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very relevant for me to speak on this bill because the 
Candu division of AECL is in my riding, in fact within a couple 
of hundred yards of my home.  I have had communications from 
them. I wanted to rise because they are constituents.  I want to 
speak on behalf of the Candu group of AECL. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that whenever we have legislation and 
although there may be some emotional reasons and there may be 
some specific very good reasons why certain bills should be in 
place, from time to time we have to be very vigilant that there 
would not be unintended consequences.  It is extremely important. 
We have to be very, very careful of there not being unintended 
consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one of the previous speakers addressed the bill, he tried 
to articulate what reasons one may have for having the Access to 
Information Act extended to crown corporations.  In general, 
accountability and transparency are very important. The member 
articulated four specific reasons and I would like to repeat them 
because they characterize what the possible intent and perhaps 
misguided position may be with regard to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first reason was to identify mismanagement in a crown 
corporation.  The auditor general is responsible for the audits 
of crown corporations. 
He has available to him all of the necessary expertise to deal 
with that.  In fact the auditor general does report. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot for a moment believe that some individual—not 
necessarily a member of Parliament as we must keep in mind that 
we are talking about the public at large—would obtain 
information through the Access to Information Act which would 
somehow expose mismanagement.  This is suggesting that somehow 
uninformed communications or broad questions may impale some 
crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These kinds of things are the responsibility of the auditor 
general and are done very well by the auditor general. I do not 
believe for a moment that mismanagement is a valid reason to 
expose crown corporations which may or may not be involved in 
commercial activity.  I do not believe that would be a compelling 
reason to have this bill pass and have crown corporation 
information subject to the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were three other reasons given and I want to group them. 
As a group they substantiate the fact that there is a more 
frivolous intent here. There were four reasons given.  The first 
was mismanagement.  The other three were to expose laziness, 
nepotism and political incorrectness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were the four reasons given by someone who has been a 
champion of getting underneath charitable institutions and crown 
corporations.  However to start having witch hunts on laziness, 
nepotism and political incorrectness seems to be a very 
unsubstantial line of thinking as to why we might need this kind 
of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to get back to the real issue.  The real issue 
is whether or not there are unintended consequences as a result 
of changes, such as making crown corporations subject to the 
Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to deal specifically with the case of AECL.  I want 
members to know that the main commercial business of AECL, which 
is the export of Candu reactors, is not supported in any way by 
taxpayers' dollars.  I want to repeat that.  AECL's main 
commercial business, the export of Candu reactors, is not 
supported in any way by tax dollars.  There is no public subsidy 
on the export of Candu reactors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has never lost a cent on the Candu export deals.  Money 
loaned by Canada stays in Canada to pay for sophisticated 
equipment manufactured in Canadian factories and technical 
project services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since AECL competes against some of the world's largest 
multinationals, it has to operate like a business and protect its 
commercial information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the flip side.  AECL in its commercial activity 
deals with literally hundreds of suppliers and service vendors. 
Information concerning those other companies which employ tens of 
thousands of people is also in the records of AECL.  To the 
extent that AECL would be subject to the Access to Information 
Act, not only would we be talking about the commercial activities 
of AECL, we would also be talking about the activities of all of 
those companies which deal with AECL. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise this point as it is an important one.  No matter 
where legislation comes from, whether it be government bills or 
private members' bills, we have to be vigilant about the risk of 
unintended consequences.  I believe that the AECL example is a 
good one.  Its commercial activity is not subsidized by the 
government which may present a problem or a risk to AECL as well 
as to hundreds of other businesses which deal with AECL and which 
employ hundreds of Canadians.

<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill before 
us proposes major amendments to the Canada pension plan and the 
establishment of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, which was tabled in the House on September 25, is an 
updated version of a previous bill that died on the Order Paper when the 
federal election was called, in April. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-2, particularly 
since this new legislation is an indirect tribute to the initiative 
taken by the Quebec government in the mid-sixties, when Jean Lesage's 
team decided to create the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To better understand the fundamentals of the proposed reform, I 
will try to answer a few questions regarding Bill C-2. What is the 
objective of the bill? Who, in Quebec, will be affected by the new 
legislation? What are the main changes sought and what are our 
objections to the amendments proposed by the various parties in this 
House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the purpose of this legislation? The bill has three main 
objectives. 
First, to preserve the Canada pension plan and strengthen its financial 
foundation by accelerating the increase in contribution rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, to improve the investment practices of the Canada pension 
plan by establishing the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, to reduce costs through a more rigorous administration 
of certain benefits, in particular disability benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those listening, it is important to mention 
that any change such as this must be approved by two-thirds of the 
provinces representing two-thirds of the population of Canada. 
This requirement was met and the proposed changes were approved. 
Only the provinces of British Columbia and Saskatchewan opposed 
this proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will this bill affect?  For those Quebeckers listening, it 
should be mentioned that the CPP reform is of greater concern to 
Canadians than to Quebeckers.  Less than half of 1% of Quebec 
residents receive CPP benefits.  Last August, there were 12,882 
such people.  Those affected must fall into one of three 
categories. The first category is Quebec residents who have worked 
all their lives in another province, and who have therefore paid 
CPP premiums only.  For example, a resident of Hull who has worked 
all his life in Ottawa could be eligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment also applies to members of the Canadian Armed 
Forces and the RCMP who reside in Quebec and must pay CPP premiums. 
Having paid only CPP premiums, they receive CPP benefits, even 
though they are residents of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment also affects those receiving CPP benefits who 
move to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all other cases, the QPP will apply.  It should be noted, 
however, that the Government of Quebec is also in the process of 
reforming the Quebec plan, although that plan is in better 
financial shape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers are indirectly affected by the present reform 
because the two levels of government have always harmonized the 
main features of the two plans, through a common desire to 
accommodate those who have paid into both plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the main changes intended with this bill? I will deal here 
briefly with the two main changes being considered: the establishment of 
the Canada pension plan investment board and the rate of contribution. 
I would like to state immediately that the Bloc Quebecois agrees with 
these two initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The design of the Canada pension plan investment board being 
established by the government with this bill is closely modelled on the 
Quebec Caisse de dépôt et placement. However, unlike the Caisse de dépôt 
et placement, the federal investment board has no economic mandate; it 
only has the mandate to achieve the best possible rate of return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be remembered that, at present, the money in the Canada 
pension plan is not invested in financial markets, as is the case in 
Quebec. 
By placing the management of this money in the hands of an independent 
organization, it will be possible to increase the performance of the 
Canada pension plan and also to protect taxpayers against dramatic 
contribution increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a proactive measure Quebec implemented a long time ago; it 
has produced convincing results. We should therefore point out the 
vision and the determination of the work carried out in this area by 
Jean Lesage and Jacques Parizeau, among others, who gave Quebec a tool 
not only to maximize the pensions of its citizens, but also to provide 
an instrument for economic development. We feel that, in this bill, this 
second component has not been given enough emphasis, with the result 
that the investment board's mandate is too weak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rate of contribution is certainly an area of the bill that has 
raised major concerns. 
It should be remembered that it had become necessary to review this rate 
because the plan was rapidly approaching unsustainability. The way 
things were going, the fund would have been empty by 2015, and the rate 
of contribution would have had to increase then from 6 to 14% in the 
case of the Canada pension plan, and from 6 to 13% in the case of the 
Quebec pension plan.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the bill calls for a gradual increase up to a permanent ceiling 
of 9.9%, to be reached in 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sustainability and affordability are the main issues in this 
debate. We cannot put our heads in the sand and try to avoid this 
reality. As we know, the population of Canada is aging rapidly. Here are 
some numbers. There are now 3.7 million elderly people, in 2030, it is 
estimated there will be 8.8 million of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canada pension 
plan was established in 1965, there were, for each elderly person in 
Canada, eight persons of working age. In 1997, the ratio is five to one, 
and it is estimated that it will be three to one in 2030. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, with all the progress in medicine, experts feel that 
the average length of time people will receive Canada pension plan 
pensions will be 20 years, as opposed to 15 when the plan was 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this is very informative, and is the reason we are 
examining this bill. These are the reasons why the increase in 
contribution rates earlier than expected, which will result in 
improved funding, will reduce generational disparities by making 
the baby-boomers, who generally have about twenty years left to 
work, pay a greater portion of contributions, which is more 
representative of the benefits they will be receiving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the question of the amendments 
proposed by the different parties in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without reviewing all of the proposed amendments, I will if I 
may touch upon two of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Motions Nos. 20 and 25, the NDP is calling for deletion 
of the clause setting penalties for fraud or false declarations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one can be against virtue.  We understand the NDP's 
preference for incentives over coercive measures.  We cannot, 
however, subscribe to such a proposal, since it is very difficult 
not to be severe in cases of fraud or false declarations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Reform Party, its Motion No. 10 calls for deletion 
of the clause permitting the retroactive increase of 1997 
contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This again is an amendment to which the Bloc cannot subscribe. 
Let us not forget that deferring any increase in contributions will 
only increase the contribution rate in the long term. 
The problem is with us now, so deferring action that ought to have 
been taken long ago is irresponsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to repeat that we agree with the 
objectives of the reform, which are to make the system more viable, 
affordable and equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are duty-bound to ensure the viability of the plan for the 
generations to come.  The proposed reform ensures intergenerational 
equity among contributors by establishing a constant and long term 
contribution rate, and by doing so promptly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my time is up, so I shall stop here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to group 6 and the motions that 
have been put forward regarding Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to point out from the very beginning 
that it is no small surprise that we see so many motions that 
have been put forward to try and make something out of Bill C-2. 
In fact, the House will find that the number of motions is far 
above the average that we would normally see for a bill.  The 
reason is that members opposite have seen so many flaws in Bill 
C-2 that we have had no option but to put forward a number of 
motions to try to make C-2, although it may be a sour pill to 
swallow, at least something that we do not choke on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Group 6 has a number of motions to it.  I will first deal with 
Motion No. 11.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This one being put forward by the fourth party basically wants 
to stop the government from having a golden lever that it can 
pull every time it needs more cash.  We congratulate the fourth 
party on having the foresight, although we brought it up in 
committee.  The fourth party made it into a motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is very important that we do not let the government 
get away with having the option to raise contributions any time 
it simply wanted to.  Therefore this motion would prevent that. 
We support Motion No. 11 put forward by the fourth party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also support Motion No. 13, which would basically take away 
the freezing of the year's basic exemption because, as members 
know, the Liberals snuck this one in and it could be used in fact 
as a form of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without the ability to increase the YBE, as the cost of living 
went up, as inflation went up, the exemption on taxes that a 
Canadian would be able to have could not go up.  Therefore they 
would find their disposable income shrinking even more than it 
has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out that since these Liberals came to power in 
1993, the average household disposable income has decreased by 
some $3,000 in this country.  Who needs yet another mechanism 
to wrench disposable income dollars out of Canadians' 
pockets?  The Liberals felt that they did but we certainly do not 
feel they should have that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 14 we oppose.  This is confusing.  The fourth party 
put forward Motion No. 13, which we support, preventing the 
freezing of the YBE.  Yet its members only wanted to prevent it 
until the year 2006. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Life does go on in this country.  It is bad enough that this 
bill has been put forward in the first place, where it is going 
to raise Canada pension premiums by an astounding, obscene 73% 
over the next few years. Members will find nowhere in this bill 
that that is all they are ever going to go up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By supporting Motion No. 14 that would mean that the ability to 
not freeze the YBE would only continue to the year 2006.  We 
cannot support that because the world is going to go on a lot 
longer than the year 2006.  We will oppose that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that we have to touch on in this debate, and 
it deals with these motions, is that this band-aid approach to 
fixing the Canada pension plan, this quick fix that the Liberals 
put through, has no more merit than the manner in which the 
Liberals and the Tories before them have managed the Canada 
pension plan since the mid-1960s when it was introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been badly managed.  It does not even do justice to the 
lousy job that the Liberals and the Tories have done with the 
Canada pension plan.  It is $600 billion in the hole in unfunded 
liability.  To fix it, and this is not rocket science, they 
simply raise the premiums.  That will fix everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, they are going to build this fund and they are going 
to have some Liberal hacks running it unaccountable because there 
are clauses in here which, if they do not get changed, will make 
sure that the investment board of the Canada pension plan is not 
accountable to Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about over $100 billion in CPP funds.  It is 
scary to think that the Liberals could have any type of influence 
over that kind of money.  It is really scary to think that. 
The way they are going to fix it really has no more merit than 
the way they have managed it for the last 30-some years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not let the Tories off the hook.  They stand up in this 
House so indignant about this bill.  They slam the Liberals about 
how they have not presented. They had nine years to do something 
under the disaster of the Mulroney government from 1984 to 1993. 
Back when the unfunded liability was down around $400 billion or 
$375 billion the Tories could have done something.  They could 
have taken the bull by the horns.  They knew at that time that 
the CPP was broke or was headed for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very time the Canada pension plan was introduced in the 
mid-sixties, the Liberal government of the day knew it would not 
work because its own financial advisers told the government that. 
But that did not deter the Liberals at that time from pushing 
ahead with this plan that was doomed for failure.  They pushed 
ahead, and now here we are 30-some years later, $560 billion in 
the hole in the CPP fund, and the Liberal answer to fixing it is 
to raise the premiums by 73% over the next few years.  Let's get 
into the pockets of young Canadians who will be starting out in 
life to make their careers and raise their families.  Let's just 
double their premiums and give them less when they want to 
retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe retirees now get about $12 for every dollar they put 
into the Canada pension plan.  The Liberal government must hate 
that.  Under its plan if someone in their twenties starts paying 
into this plan, by the time they retire the Liberals want to give 
them an astounding 57 cents for every dollar they contributed. 
The Liberals really hate a good deal.  They must hate a good 
deal.  They would be thrown in jail if they were to handle an 
investment like that in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Liberals see retired Canadians getting $12 for every $1 
they put in, and that just is not Liberal philosophy.  Canadians 
should not be getting fair treatment, so the Liberals will change 
the plan so Canadians get only 57 cents.  Young people will be 
paying into that plan for 40 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope some of these motions get put into Bill C-2.  If some of 
these motions were to pass the government would be brought to 
accountability kicking and screaming and we would be there 
pulling it.  We will support some of the motions.  We have some 
of our own that we hope some other members will support, members 
from the third, fourth and fifth parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand as a member of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition in this 
House of Commons, this House of Parliament in the country of 
Canada, and I say let us not let the Liberal government get away 
with this odious piece of legislation.  Let us fix it, as the 
Liberals and the Tories had a chance to—

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to express our support for one of the amendments proposed by our 
colleague from Qu'Appelle last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment proposes a sliding scale for contributions by 
self-employed workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this amendment, a self-employed individual earning 
$25,000 would contribute less than another such individual earning 
$60,000.  The amendment would therefore resolve one of the most 
serious problems in Bill C-2 for the self-employed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues for Madawaska—Restigouche and Saint John 
pointed out last week, these workers, who represent 18% of the 
workforce, must bear the brunt of combined contributions.  With a 
contribution rate of 9.9%, self-employed workers do not have myriad 
calculations to make.  They know that they have to contribute $9.90 
for every $100 they earn.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When you realize that 45% of these workers, and there were 2.5 
million of them in 1997, earn less than $20,000, you understand the 
importance of the amendment immediately.  We are talking about over 
1.1 million Canadian workers.  Given the fact that the growth in 
self-employment is far greater among women, there is even more 
reason to support this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As currently worded, Bill C-2 has a significant negative 
effect on women.  But this we should have expected from a 
government that has no concern about the effect of its policies on 
women. 
In fact, in the initial discussions on the proposed changes to the 
pension plan in 1996, nothing was said about the impact of these 
proposals on the income of women who would be retiring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, almost all the proposed changes affect women more 
than men.  Let us look, for example, at the freeze on the annual 
basic exemption.  It affects mostly those with low incomes, and 
this category of worker is made up primarily of women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women, therefore, generally make less than their male 
counterparts.  For example, women working part time earn only a 
portion of what full time workers make, that is, between 69% and 
72%.  Furthermore, 28% of women, compared with 10% of men, work 
part time.  They also tend to retire earlier, with up to 25% of 
women taking their retirement at an average age of 52. 
They also live longer. The life expectance of women is 80.9 years, as 
compared to 74.6 for men. This means that they will have to make do 
longer with lower benefits than men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, senior women received on average $274 per month in 
benefits, while men received $477 per month. Add to this the fact that 
there is a much higher risk of becoming a widow than there is of 
becoming a widower. Also, there are nine times more senior men than 
senior women who remarry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One last point. Women are not covered as well as their male 
counterparts by employer sponsored pension plans. And many of these 
plans do not provide any survivor benefits, the survivors being mostly 
women as I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cumulative effect of all these factors precludes women from 
setting funds aside for the many years of life they have remaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should not have the power to make changes to such a 
fundamental and important program as the Canada pension plan without 
first explaining their full impact to the people of Canada. Also, there 
is nothing in here to ensure that they will be treated fairly and 
equitably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, in the Progressive-Conservative Party, believe in equity for 
all. Since equity is also a major concern in the public at large, it is 
essential that an equitable contribution scale be provided for in Bill 
C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This way we will be fair, at least to some extent, to those who 
account for more than 52% of the Canadian population: women. 
This is also a way to recognize the work and important contribution of 
the men and women who now make up 18% of the Canadian labour force, that 
is to say self-employed workers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to the group 6 amendments and to the changes 
to the Canada pension plan and the creation of the investment 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a new member of the House, like many other new members of the 
House, it is sometimes a daunting process to go through a bill 
such as this and to try to make sense of what the bill is really 
trying to accomplish and what the impact of the changes will 
really be on Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having gone through the bill and listened to debate in the House 
and having spoken to the member for Qu'Appelle, who is our expert 
on this matter, we find ourselves at report stage today with an 
overriding concern that Bill C-2 will endanger the security of 
retirement for many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with this bill is that it will create winners and 
losers.  We have to ask ourselves who will be the winners in 
terms of changing the Canada pension plan. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT20"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT20"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1315

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the bill we see that the winner will definitely 
be the private sector.  It will have a huge financial windfall as 
a result of increasing privatization.  Even the business section 
of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> took note that the changes to the 
Canada pension plan were a huge financial windfall for the 
private sector.  The privatization of the administration of the 
plan will create approximately $500 million in commissions for 
the private sector.  It is unconscionable and should not be 
allowed to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The section question is who will be the losers as a result of 
the changes to the Canada pension plan.  It has been very well 
evidenced in debate by witnesses before committee and in motions 
and amendments put forward that the losers under the bill will be 
women, people with disabilities, widows, widowers and retirees 
generally.  We have to be very clear and frank about the bill. It 
is about reducing benefits for people with disabilities, survivor 
benefits to widows and widowers and the ongoing privatization of 
the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, even the 16th actuarial report projects that CPP 
spending reduction on disability benefits by the year 2005 will 
be over $1 billion.  There is no getting away from that.  The 
changes being put forward by the government in the bill are a 
clear attempt to reduce benefits to those with disabilities who 
collect Canada pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that those retirees will be hit 
disproportionately higher than any other component as a result of 
the Canada pension plan changes.  This raises a serious question 
about the social equity of the plan and the fact that there will 
be more losers.  It will also create greater hardship or 
inaccessibility for Canadians with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The survivors benefit will also be reduced.  The amendments of 
the member for Qu'Appelle address the issues and mitigate the 
damage that will be created if the bill goes ahead.  Widows and 
widowers who are disabled will also have reduced combined 
benefits.  This is a shocking state of affairs that needs to be 
brought to the attention of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second major concern of the New Democratic Party that our 
amendments speak to is that the changes in the bill will force 
Canadians to rely more and more on private arrangements, on 
privatized pension plans.  We need to address the reality of 
working people who cannot afford to buy into private pension 
plans such as RRSPs.  This is another giveaway to the private 
sector by privatizing the plan and forcing more and more people 
into a private arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very serious concern that the bill undermines and 
erodes the universality and the accessibility of our public 
pension plan.  If we talk to Canadians in our local 
constituencies, at community meetings or associations that 
represent seniors, they all tell us that one thing they have been 
proud of in this country is the fact that we have stood behind 
and strengthened our universal accessible pension plan over the 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now stand at a moment in history where that universality and 
that proud history of Canada are about to be changed forever if 
the bill goes ahead without the critical amendments that have 
been put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that this crisis has been deliberately staged 
to undermine the credibility of the Canada pension plan, as we 
move toward more and more privatization, and to create a huge 
windfall for the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments of the New Democratic Party balance the scales 
and ensure that Canadians who pay into the Canada pension plan 
and rely on it for the future will not be losers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motions before the House today deserve our serious 
consideration if we truly and genuinely believe we want to 
protect, strengthen and enhance our public pension system.  If 
that is what the bill is about these motions must be approved, 
but we have a great fear that what is at work here is the 
government's agenda to create winners and losers, to further 
provide privatization of the Canada pension plan, and to erode 
the universality of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak in favour of the amendments proposed by the New 
Democratic Party.  It is an important set of amendments that will 
seek to mitigate the damage being created by Bill C-2. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to address the concerns we have in government about 
some of the motions we think will be detrimental to the 
preservation and securing of the CPP as a pension plan for all of 
us, for future Canadians who will be retiring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the previous speaker has mentioned, it is very 
important to understand we arrived at the changes through rather 
dramatic and extensive consultations across Canada.  They are the 
result of federal-provincial statutory review which included 
extensive cross-Canada consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unequivocally we heard from Canadians.  They asked that their 
governments preserve the plan by strengthening its financing, 
improving investment practices and moderating the growth of the 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not rocket science to understand it is important to 
improve investment procedures.  I would share some examples.  In 
years gone by in various provincial legislatures and indeed in 
this place pension plans have been used by governments as a cheap 
source of financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the government of Ontario in the 1970s consistently 
went to the well to borrow funds at as low as 3% interest rates 
at a time when marketplace interest rates were in the 
neighbourhood of 10% or higher.  It used that money to build 
roads, bridges and other facilities; but in turn what happened is 
that the pension fund was suffering because it was not allowed to 
grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot allow this to happen with the CPP.  As a result of all 
the consultations and what Canadians have said, we must ensure if 
the money is borrowed and it is used as a fund that fair market 
value is paid.  It is simply not acceptable to rob Peter to pay 
Paul by using pension fund money for cheap investments with a 
view that somehow taxpayers will save money.  At the end of the 
day the particular pension fund will have to be shored up.  In 
their entirety the motions run counter to a strong fiscal policy 
that we believe is needed to secure the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also share an example with which some may be familiar.  Money 
was used from the teachers' pension fund without a proper view 
toward investment practices.  In 1989 or so one of the teachers' 
pension funds in Ontario, the superannuation fund, was running at 
a deficit and the other one was running at a surplus.  The reason 
for the deficit was the bad borrowing practices of previous 
governments.   We cannot allow that to happen regardless of who 
is in government.  The CPP funds should not be used and abused in 
that way.  That is one very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 11 specifically wants to delete the new contribution 
rate schedule.  The old unsustainable rate schedule would remain 
in effect.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is sticking his head in the sand, I say with all due 
respect.  If the motion were to be accepted by the government it 
would put financial sustainability of the CPP at risk.  That is 
the very issue the changes address.  In parliamentary terms it 
probably should not be allowed on the floor as it is totally 
contrary to the intent of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of rates raising by 9.9% in the year 2003 and then 
levelling off, if the motion were adopted contribution rates 
would rise to 10.1% in year 2016.  That happens to be a year when 
many in the baby boomer generation will be looking to drawing on 
their CPP fund.  Therefore it makes it even more important to 
ensure the sustainability of the CPP.  Then it would go to 14.2% 
in the year 2030.  This would be a 140% increase over current 
contribution levels.  I cannot imagine justifying contribution 
levels rising by that amount.  It makes no sense and frankly the 
motion would be destructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem, and we have done the financial analysis, is 
that the plan would be bankrupt by the year 2015.  It would 
impose a totally unfair burden on our children and our 
grandchildren.  They would loose the ability to collect the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When talking about the CPP bill, the amendment and all the 
motions, we must recognize that our main goal should be to 
sustain and secure the system now.  We consider it to be a top 
priority in government.  We have heard other members and other 
people talk in terms of it being a tax.  The reality is that it 
makes us distinct as Canadians because we have a public pension 
plan that leaves no Canadian behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard the example used about people being in a race.  At 
the Special Olympics there was a wonderful example that my good 
friend, Dalton McGuinty, the leader of the provincial Liberal 
Party in Ontario, talks about.  In a race in the Special Olympics 
one of the runners fell.  Another runner who was competing to win 
that race, which presumably we all do from time time, stopped and 
picked up the person and helped him finish the race.  It meant 
the person who stopped would not be victorious.  It meant that he 
would not win the race.  What a message it sends about Canadians 
and about Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we will stop and help when one falls.  We are all in this 
together.  The CPP is one landmark that shows us that we as 
Canadians care about one another.  We could ignore the problem. 
Some paint it as a tax grab.  That is nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This plan has to be secured for future generations.  The bill 
will do that but the motions of the hon. member will not. A key 
priority is to secure retirement income for all Canadians. That 
is why we are proposing a comprehensive plan to make the system 
sustainable, affordable and fair.  Affordable is key. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to drive rates through the roof like some of the 
motions are suggesting with increases in the neighbourhood of 
140%, that is what we should adopt.  However that will not be 
affordable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often found a lack of realism on the part of my 
colleagues opposite.  They think that by putting a motion forward 
some workers will benefit.  In reality it will be unaffordable 
for employers.  If we do not have employers we do not have jobs. 
If we do not have jobs we do not have CPP contributions and the 
plan will fail. 
This is all inextricably tied to the economic growth and the 
future of this growth.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as has just 
been pointed out, I too think that the group 6 motions drive the 
cost way beyond what Canadians can bear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back a little bit into the history of this whole 
thing and also use a few quotes from some of my constituents that 
might give a better focus on where grassroot Canadians really 
stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1966 government made a contract with Canadians basically 
stating that it would provide a pension when a person reached age 
65.  We believed that, went along with it and everybody dutifully 
paid their 3% or whatever it was and thought that government 
would take care of them.  Obviously mismanagement and a poorly 
designed plan caused the situation that the government finally 
realized it was in last year.  It found out that it had an 
underfunded liability and had a real problem. Obviously some of 
the amendments we are speaking about here would make that problem 
even that much worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians realized this problem much sooner.  They knew 
this plan was not working and could not work.  They were not 
dreamers but, as often happens, the people are so much ahead of 
government that we are only now catching up.  The only solution 
that the government has put forward is a 73% increase in the 
premium tax which is going to be collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of other ways to solve this problem and I will 
try to touch on some of those briefly.  Basically, when you talk 
to the people on the street, they will tell you that this is an 
extremely important bill.  They know what is happening. They know 
about it and can talk very intelligently about the changes to the 
Canada pension.  They will tell you that it is a $10 billion tax 
grab.  They will tell you that they are already taxed at the 
highest rate in the G-7 and just cannot afford any more taxation. 
They will tell you that the self-employed person is just going 
to buckle under this sort of an increase.  They will tell you 
that this is going to cost jobs and probably more jobs than even 
some of the critics of this would point out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are also extremely concerned about the setting up of an 
investment board with 12 political friends being appointed to 
this and the potential abuse that this could create.  Remember, 
people do not have all that much respect for political choices in 
our past history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the young people who are looking at this plan, the message 
is pretty well standard.  They do not believe they are really 
going to get any Canada pension plan.  They do not really believe 
it is going to be there for them.  In fact, if the government is 
going to collect an extra $700 from them and their employer and 
only give them $8,800 some 30 years from now, that is just not 
realistic.  It will not sell and is not acceptable to the 
Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They look at the other options of what they can do with that 
same amount of money if they were to invest it privately.  I 
believe that this change in CPP can be equivalent to what the GST 
was to the PC Party.  I believe this is its Achilles heel and the 
public will react when they find out what the politicians have 
done to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give a summary of some 4,000 letters received in my 
riding.  First, “My husband and I are very concerned about the 
proposed CPP hike.  We are a young couple expecting our first 
child and we feel that it will be very difficult for us and many 
people of our age to pay the proposed tax increases.  We also 
feel that it is unfair that we be forced to pay this seeing as we 
have no hope of ever receiving the Canada pension plan 
ourselves”. 
I believe that summarizes what young people are saying.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments that we are talking about here that say we are 
going to increase those premiums even more are even that much 
less acceptable for the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Middle aged people are saying “What about our children?  Our 
children are having a tough enough time as it is”.  They are 
concerned about the killing of jobs. They are concerned about 
what this means.  They still feel they have time under an 
optional plan to that being proposed by the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seniors are saying “We also are concerned about our 
children and our grandchildren and what it might mean for them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we have across the range of ages genuine concern 
about Canada pension and what the future of this is going to be. 
The sad part is that the government will not even look at the 
options.  It has made no attempt to look at other countries to 
see what they have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list is quite long but if we take a look at countries that 
have adopted a different kind of a pension plan, in that list we 
would include Chile, Australia, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, El 
Salvador, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Uruguay, Great 
Britain.  All of these countries have gone to a different form of 
Canada pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely this government owes it to Canadians to look at the other 
options.  It should take a look, see how they work, find out what 
happens.  When it was suggested in the committee that the 
committee bring the designer of the plan in Chile, who 16 years 
ago put their plan together, the committee was refused to have 
this person come and testify before it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is letting down Canadians.  Canadians have the right to 
find out what all the options are and to have open discussion. Of 
course, the use of closure on this sort of debate also is not 
accepted very well by the Canadian people.  Again, I remind the 
members on the other side that this is not going to be looked on 
any more kindly than was the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a lot of misrepresentation.  We have a finance minister 
who says “Feel good, be happy, everything is fine now”.  We all 
know that is not the case.  We know that we have a $600 billion 
debt. We know that we are paying $50 billion in interest payments 
in a year.  Just think what we could do with that $50 billion in 
terms of pensions, in terms of our social services.  All of those 
are there but they are not accessible to us because of 
mismanagement of the previous two governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Liberals are taxing the soul out of 
Canadians. They are going too far.  This Canada pension is going 
to be for some the final straw.  It is going to drive the economy 
underground.  It is going to cause small businesses to close. The 
government is going to use this as another tax increase to opt 
out of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are taxing our food, they are taxing our homes, 
they are taxing our savings, they are clawing back from senior 
citizens and people are losing patience with them.  That is the 
message we have to get out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments simply go one step further in that tax and 
spend philosophy that seems to be so common or possibly the 
disease which people get when they come into this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to say no.  Canadians need to speak out and let the 
government know what they think about Canada pension.

order in the Canada pension plan and to modernize its structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pay tribute to my distinguished colleague, the hon. 
member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, who 
does a wonderful job in leading the Bloc regarding this issue and in 
expressing Quebec's representations on the amendments to the Canada

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan must undergo a thorough review. If the 
government does not act or is slow to act, within ten years, the fund 
will be empty. I am among those who have always believed that, when a 
government or a municipality buys or builds things, the payments should 
be spread out over the duration of the investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not be wise for a government to borrow each week to pay 
its public servants, just as it would not be wise for the hon. member 
for Québec to borrow every month to pay her rent. 
The government has now reached a deadline where it must make decisions, 
otherwise our children or grandchildren will have to pay so we can get 
our old age pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year's contribution rate of 5.6% was clearly too low. In 15 
years or so, the baby-boomers—and I am one of them—will reach 
retirement age in very large numbers, at which point the fund would be 
insufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the government, whose role is to anticipate such things, must 
make proposals to adjust the contribution rate, so as to meet future 
financial needs. The proposed rate schedule seems fair and reasonable. 
The rate current of 5.85% for 1997 would be increased to 6%. 
Premiums will go up slowly but surely over the next five years to 
a maximum of $9.90, or 9.9% if you prefer, in 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This 9.9% would be frozen.  According to actuaries we have 
consulted, who corroborate the government's figures, it could be 
frozen until 2100, in other words, for over a century.  If our 
forecasts are accurate, and I believe they are, this should provide 
us with a safety valve for those who will begin to draw a pension 
at age 65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To govern means to anticipate.  Certain parties in the House 
are going to oppose an adjustment. They apparently do not 
anticipate the impact of baby boomers.  Those now 50 and under are 
going to be reaching the eligible age in very high numbers. 
When we begin drawing benefits, we will be contributing much less, 
perhaps nothing at all if we have no insurable earnings.  So the 
fund will be rapidly depleted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my sincere and honest belief that recipients must pay 
the cost of this pension plan.  For this reason, our party will be 
supporting Bill C-2 generally speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we cannot vote in 
favour of the motions in Group No. 6 because they go directly 
against the premise that the plan must be self-funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 has three basic objectives.  In order for the plan to 
be self-funding, there must be increased capitalization, and this 
I think will be achieved through the new premium rates over the 
next five years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also necessary to increase the rate of return—and this is 
important—through the establishment of a Canada pension plan investment 
board. The role of this board is not to stash the money in a sock like 
my grandfather used to do; that was not only unsafe, it was also 
unprofitable. Inflation was not very high at that time, so he did not 
lose anything, but he did not gain anything either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, we could say that the government has not succeeded in 
using wisely this large amount of money that was placed in its care. It 
has not been a cautious administrator of these investments, unlike what 
Quebec did for the Régie des rentes when it established the Caisse de 
dépôt et placement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take the opportunity here to pay tribute to a great 
team led by Jean Lesage at the beginning of the sixties. That team 
included none other than Jacques Parizeau, and, of course, René 
Lévesque. So they set up the Caisse de dépôt et placement, which, often, 
produces a return of up to 20% a year. That is a very interesting annual 
rate of return; it is the equivalent of one fifth of the total capital 
that the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec is responsible for. 
Unfortunately, the central government failed to act and was unable to 
ensure a proper yield for the money in the Canada pension plan; this is 
rather disturbing and shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, with Bill C-2, the Canada pension plan investment 
board is being established, and if it is well managed, it should be 
able, hopefully, to equal the return obtained in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are now only two provinces that continue to oppose Bill C-2. 
But with the agreements that are now in place, as soon as there are 
eight provinces representing a sufficient percentage, we will be able to 
override the two provinces that refuse to go along with the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third objective of Bill C-2 is to tighten up the requirements 
for certain benefits, including disability benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be careful not to give disability benefits to everyone who 
claims them. Everyone knows that, in certain regions, and especially in 
certain provinces I will not name here, when people lose their job, they 
go to see the doctor or any other person who can be of assistance to 
provide a disability certificate. But doing this costs a lot of money 
for all the other people who are honest 
and who have to pay for the ones that are exploiting the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, the Canada pension plan investment board, again, if it 
is properly managed, could provide dividends, and this would be 
profitable for all Canadians. The member for Malpeque, in Prince Edward 
Island, who is listening to me closely, must know that when a potato is 
planted, it is subdivided into eight parts, and this can yield almost 
three quarters of a bag of potatoes. So he knows that in the case of 
potatoes, it is possible to ensure that these plants will provide a 
yield. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, in the case of the federal government, if they do the 
same thing as the member for Malpeque, they will be able to make sure 
that this money yields a profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And, finally, I am glad to see that with this bill, it will be 
possible to invest up to 20% outside the country, and, of course, a 
minimum of 80% will have to stay in the country, in Quebec or elsewhere, 
but it will have to stay in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The object of the changes to the pension plan was to address the 
most needy of our country, our seniors and our elders, but these 
changes do not address that need.  I will give examples of some 
members of my community, seniors and elders who live solely by 
means of their pensions.  There are two of them who support a 
family and their eldest son is on a disability pension.  He is 
disabled from the neck down.  They must use their old age 
security and their GIS to support a disabled son. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the pensions are inadequate for those most needy 
is very clear and the changes were meant to address this need. 
Unfortunately $10 a month or $120 a year will not address the 
question of need.  We must ask why these changes are being made. 
I agree with my colleagues that there are definitely winners and 
losers in this scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be $2 billion taken out of our pension plan. I feel 
we are trying to convince Canadians that by taking out $2 billion 
we will somehow be able to help them more.  This just is not the 
case especially in our present society and circumstances where 
social housing is no longer available and those who need it most, 
seniors, will not be able to get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have faced cuts to transfer payments, cuts to medicare with 
the federal government being the last payer at this time.  We 
have faced a huge increase in the cost of prescriptions. These 
are all services our seniors desperately need. They are not 
working and they do not have the income to make up the 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are facing the basic problem that we do not have the level of 
employment to support our pensions.  This is a problem the 
present government refuses to address.  If we had strong 
employment we would not have to be worried at the other end about 
the ability of our elders and seniors to get their pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended a finance committee meeting in which the witnesses 
talked about how they would see our new pension fund being used. 
Their major point was that it should not have such a low foreign 
investment ceiling, that 20% just was not enough and that if you 
were sophisticated enough you could get around it.  They believed 
people would be cheating.  I was quite shocked at that attitude. 
They claimed that investing 80% of that pension fund in Canada 
somehow was not a good deal for Canadians when in fact it is a 
good deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces should be able to access Canadians' money for 
infrastructure programs, for roads, for hospitals, for schools, 
for jobs, because that is good for all Canadians.  The more jobs 
we create the more we will be able to support our seniors and our 
elders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes being proposed are unfairly targeted at women and 
those who are expecting a disability pension.  I do take 
exception to my colleague from the Bloc who alluded that people 
with a disability pension received it fraudulently.  I do not 
know of anyone who has done that and I do not believe they would 
like to be considered as Canadians who are criminals by behaving 
that way.  They should never be labelled as criminals because 
they have applied for a disability pension.  It does no service 
to our citizens and to those who are more desperate because they 
cannot work and their only sustenance is from their pension, and 
one that is drastically inadequate at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a good idea if the money from the pension fund that 
we are proposing would actually go to pensioners, but it is not. 
Half a billion dollars a year will go from public money into 
private hands. None of that money will be going to those who are 
poorest.  None will be going to those who are getting an extra 
$10 a month.  They will not be benefiting from those investments 
although I believe that is where the money should go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The investment board should not be able to set its own 
standards.  It should not be able to hire and fire its own 
auditor, set its own guidelines for ethical or unethical conduct. 
That should be done independent of that body.  If we are going 
to have a board, it should be for the benefit of those in our 
society who are most needy.

there have been many amendments brought before the House over the 
past two days and many more to come that wish to improve this 
plan the government has developed to change the Canada pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the amendments that are before the House in Group No. 6 
would jeopardize the Canada pension plan because they refuse to 
admit that there is a problem with the CPP. They refuse to see 
that it is in a crisis situation. The sad fact is that if we do 
not fix the CPP, it will not be there for our children and our 
grandchildren.  If we spend blindly now, we will be playing with 
the money of future generations.  This is simply not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people today are already facing huge student debts and 
fewer job prospects.  Let us not saddle them with the 
responsibility of paying for our retirement.  I know that this is 
not the legacy I want to leave to my children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's population is aging rapidly. This will put great stress 
on seniors programs in the years ahead.  Today for every person 
of retirement age there are five persons of working age.  In 20 
years there will be one person of retirement age for every four 
persons of working age.  When today's youth retire in 40 years, 
the ratio will be just one to three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strain on the CPP results from an aging population, a lower 
birth rate, increased life expectancy and a sharp rise in 
disability claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP was set up as a pay as you go plan in 1966.  Premiums 
were set at a rate that provided the fund with investments equal 
to at least two years of benefits. There is $40 billion in the 
fund.  However, the cost of its promised future benefits totals 
$600 billion. Under the present Canada pension plan the premiums 
are expected to rise to 14.2% in the year 2030. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Progressive Conservatives the CPP is a fundamental part of 
the Canadian social safety net, an obligation that government 
must honour.  Let us make it clear, the CPP is worth saving.  We 
believe that there is an urgent need to restore public confidence 
in the Canada pension plan so that Canadians will continue to 
participate in saving for their future retirement.  Many of the 
amendments we are debating now will not restore the public 
confidence in the CPP.  Far from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP contribution rates will have to rise to levels adequate 
to ensure the long term viability of the plan, but these 
increased contributions must be more than offset by substantial 
reductions in our taxes.

a wide range of options open to them, but this has not lessened

to adapt to audience fragmentation and changing fiscal realities.

the children of Canada and throughout the entire world will spend 
their entire lives dealing with the risk of infection by the virus 
that causes AIDS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the latest figures indicate that AIDS hits children 
under the age of 15 hard, particularly marginalized youth.  Some 
3.8 million children under that age have been infected with HIV 
since the start of the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s, and 2.7 
million of those have probably died by now, according to the latest 
UN AIDS report. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>AIDS is emerging as a leading problem for youth in Canada.  The 
medium age of new infections dropped from age 32 in 1982 to age 
23 in 1986-90. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's announcement by the Minister of Health to commit $42.2 
million a year over the next five years will ensure that our 
efforts to educate our youth to the dangers of AIDS and to 
provide treatment, care and support to those suffering will be 
maintained during this crucial time.

not put the whole delegation on the same plane to Kyoto because 
at this rate they will probably come off the plane with a

a tremendous emphasis on paying down debt and reducing taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that reflects what the Reform Party has heard in 
consultations across the country and that is reflected in its 
minority report which is appended to the government report.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order.  I wonder if there would be unanimous 
consent for all parties to respond to the tabling of the 
committee report in the same manner as the Reform Party just did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We have a report from the committee.  We 
have a response.  We now have a request from the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona to speak to the tabling of the committee 
report. We are going to try to do this legally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member have unanimous consent to put the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Does the House agree that all the parties 
should have a chance to respond to the report with equal time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order.  Perhaps I missed it, but I would 
like to ask you whether there was a time limitation put on this. 
I would also like the House to be well aware that this is in no 
way a case precedent and not necessarily going to be given to 
parties— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The usual tradition of the House is that 
whatever time it takes for the report to be tabled, other parties 
get equal time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would presume if the House has agreed to have responses that 
all the responders to this committee report would have 
approximately the same amount of time as the presenter of the 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that I will hear the hon. member for Halifax.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to say a few words about this report, 
specifically to draw attention to the dissenting opinion filed by 
the NDP finance critic who quite correctly is concerned about the 
priorities reflected in the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the point of view he has presented on behalf of our 
caucus is summed up by the words “the federal books may be in 
balance, but the economy is out of kilter”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason, the New Democratic Party has put forward a 
dissenting view in which we have outlined the priorities that we 
think more accurately reflect the concerns, the voices and the 
values of the broad majority of Canadians that simply do not find 
expression in the government's majority report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had an opportunity to set forward what we think the 
priorities ought to be, starting with making jobs the number one 
priority, first and foremost, which is still not reflected in the 
prebudget report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the overall priority in addition to finally setting 
timetables and targets with respect to job creation is to be 
given to investments which raise our long term social and 
economic well-being, investments in education, in health, in 
tackling poverty and in the sustainability of our natural 
environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, once 
again, in reading the report presented by the chair of the Standing 
Committee on Finance, we can recognize the style of the Liberal 
government, a government focused on maple leaf-flavoured 
propaganda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reading this report, which was leaked by the Toronto media, we 
can see that the Liberals are attempting to pass it off as an 
objective summary of what the numerous organizations and 
individuals consulted since mid-October from coast to coast had to 
say.  This is false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, this report is nothing but the red program of the 
Liberals from the last electoral campaign. 
Once again, the Liberals have thumbed their noses at the rules of 
democracy, by squeezing the opposition parties into a tight 
timeframe and thus trying to prevent us in the Parti Quebecois from 
voicing our opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have, moreover, strongly urged the chair of the Standing 
Committee on Finance to hold an in-depth review of the process 
surrounding publication of the finance report and to conduct his 
own investigation in order to identify the person or persons 
responsible for the leak to the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate, this report shows that there are two economic 
visions, one belonging to Canada and the other to Quebec, which are 
diametrically opposed.  Quebec condemns federal intrusion into 
areas of provincial jurisdiction, while the other provinces are 
calling for a stepped-up federal presence.  The solution is 
extremely simple. 
All Quebeckers are aware that what will solve all of Quebec's 
socio-economic problems is Quebec sovereignty.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>   Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
question of privilege concerning several matters which arise from 
the report which was just forwarded from the Standing Committee 
on Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By an order of this House I am a member of the standing 
committee.  The committee, in obedience with Standing Order 
83(10), undertook consideration of proposals regarding the 
budgetary policy of government.  The staff from the Library of 
Parliament assisting the whole committee prepared a draft 
document which was to be considered in the formulation of our 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well known that there have been media accounts of the 
contents of this committee report.  I want to express my regret 
that our report was not first given to all members of the House. 
That part of the draft report started to find its way into the 
media before the opposition members of the committee had access 
to the draft material. We were not given access to the draft 
material until 10 a.m. last Friday and we were required to 
prepare a report for today.  We had less than three hours to 
consider that material.  Obviously some other members had earlier 
access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premature disclosure of a report or the disclosure of 
confidential committee documents is a long established ground for 
contempt proceedings by the House. 
I was unsuccessful in having this matter reported to the House by 
the committee so that actions could be taken by the House.  I am 
aware that you are therefore restricted in the actions you can 
take. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT44"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT44"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1515

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I was further obstructed in the discharge of my 
obligations to this House.  On several occasions I requested 
access to the document which was to form the basis of our draft 
report.  I made my request known to the chairman of the committee 
and was repeatedly told that I could not have access to these 
papers which were prepared for the entire committee by staff. 
This included descriptions of the hearings, summaries of the 
testimony of witnesses, history of past government policies and 
so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was then informed that my opinion about our hearings or the 
government's budgetary policies could be included in a section of 
dissenting opinions.  In other words, no matter what I may have 
wanted to propose, I would not be given a chance to have my 
opinions considered by my colleagues on the committee for 
inclusion in the report proper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition views would not find their way into the committee 
report.  I would not have a chance to see a draft report within a 
reasonable timeframe nor to debate its accuracy and merits and 
any views which I might have.  Whether or not I agreed with the 
draft report would be relegated to the status of dissent 
opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, this contempt for the maintenance of a legitimate 
process is troubling to me.  These hearings cost Canadian 
taxpayers over $400,000.  Are they to be nothing but a public 
relations show for the Minister of Finance?  Did they go through 
this exercise just to save the minister the time of having to 
meet with the groups that addressed the committee while he met 
with the select groups of his choosing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly there will be a division of opinion about which 
budgetary policy the government should follow.  However, the 
one-sided nature of this process is a mockery of this House.  The 
Liberal attitude was that there was no need for debate, no need 
to defend their position, no need to do anything other than to 
tell the Minister of Finance what he wanted to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only people on the committee who could offer opinions for 
inclusion in the main body of the report were the Liberal members 
of this committee.  All other members were denied access to the 
draft material and their views were held to be not worthy of 
debate.  They were told their opinions would be slapped into the 
report as dissenting views.  Dissenting from what?  We committee 
members were never to know.  Nor were the Liberals to consider 
our views and debate them in committee.  We on this side of the 
House, we are not to be participants.  By virtue of where we sit, 
we are labelled as dissidents from the revealed truth of the 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old Liberal arrogance is back.  Stop opposition members from 
participating in discussions, deny them access to draft reports. 
“They couldn't possibly agree with us so don't waste time 
letting them in the door”.  The finance committee of the House 
of Commons is nothing more than an organ of the Minister of 
Finance and the Liberal caucus.  Certainly this was the view of 
several witnesses after their experiences before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I ask you to consider whether or not the denial of 
my access to committee draft papers available to other members of 
the committee constitutes an obstruction of a member and 
therefore constitutes a prima facie question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, the question of privilege is 
very serious.  I saw two members rising in their places.  Is it 
on this question of privilege? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Yes, it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Medicine Hat. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
the same question of privilege, I want to confirm that what I saw 
of how the finance committee conducted itself with respect to 
sharing information with members of the opposition exactly 
reflects what the member said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I confirmed to the chairman of the finance committee that 
we would probably be bringing in a minority report, we were told 
that we would have to have that minority report in by last 
Wednesday without seeing the majority report.  We never had a 
chance to even see the report but had to put in a minority 
report.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add insult to injury, the next day we read about the 
government's report in the newspapers.  It could only have been 
leaked from one place, the government.  I can tell you, Mr. 
Speaker, it has really jaundiced my opinion of how the government 
operates its committees.  I do believe that this is a breach of 
the hon. member's privileges and those of all opposition members 
who sit on the finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the Speaker will very seriously consider what the 
hon. member is saying.  I really do confirm his concerns.  I hope 
that the government takes what it has done extraordinarily 
seriously because I believe it has caused quite a rift between 
government and opposition members. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have listened very attentively 
to the points raised by the hon. two members across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one hand we heard a number of remarks on the government. Even 
the government's motive is being questioned by the hon. member 
from the Conservative Party.  While I totally reject the premises 
and indeed the allegations behind the government's sincerity, 
what the government is seeking to do and what it asked the 
committee to do and what I believe the committee did in all 
sincerity is provide valuable input which I am sure this report 
will be.  I have not read it yet.  I suspect neither have most 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two points in particular which I would like to 
address.  One is that the hon. member for Medicine Hat has just 
said that it wanted to provide a minority report before seeing 
the report of the majority.  He then went on to say that it was 
wrong for the majority to pretend that it would not agree with 
the minority report.  At the same time he said that he wanted to 
file a minority report without having seen what he believes was 
the report of the majority.  Mr. Speaker, one cannot have it both 
ways.  That is not logical in the thought process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a more fundamental point and where I do agree with hon. 
members, and hopefully we will all agree, is the following.  That 
a leak from a report from the committee is not appropriate before 
the House is seized with the report.  I believe that the first 
group of people who should see a report prepared by any committee 
are hon. members of this House.  That is why we have been sent 
here.  This is our mandate.  It is our sacred duty.  I believe, 
Mr. Speaker, that you are the custodian of our rights as members 
of Parliament.  To that extent I agree that no one should ever 
make a report accessible to someone who is not a member of 
Parliament prior to members of Parliament— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What are you going to do about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  So why did you do it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one member has just 
gratuitously accused me personally of leaking the government 
document.  I hope that he would choose to withdraw an allegation 
like that.  For him to even say that is not knowing me very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that it is wrong for anyone to 
leak a report from the committee.  Members of the House, I, you 
and everyone else have a right to see it at the same time, 
possibly before anyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to the government's motives behind this, Mr. Speaker, 
I can give you my impression as a member of this government. What 
we want to know through this process is what the general public 
thinks should be in the budget.  That is why the process is there 
and that is why we have already scheduled a two day debate later 
in this session but before Christmas so that Canadians through 
their members of Parliament can have a debate in the House of 
Commons and listen to the valuable contributions which all 
members of Parliament will make in that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I summarize by saying that I do not believe that anyone on the 
government side did anything wrong in terms of the content of the 
report. I do agree that if anyone leaked this report to the media 
then that in itself is obviously wrong. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of privilege just put 
forward by the hon. member for Markham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Keeping in mind the comments made by the hon. House leader for 
the government, I am not going to burden the House with a 
recitation of precedents on the issue of advanced disclosure of 
committee reports.  The hon. member has put forward the principle 
that he certainly agrees that all members of this House should be 
given the opportunity to view this prior to it being made public. 
Unfortunately, that is no the case here.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, the <I>Star</I> and 
another publication—I believe the <I>Financial Post</I>—had this 
information in advance of opposition members.  This is a very 
serious breach of privilege, I would submit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only an insult to the House, but it is an insult to 
all members and an insult in particular, I would suggest, to 
staff members on this committee because as a result of this 
occurrence, it casts a shadow over their involvement in the 
process.  Those persons are now under suspicion, I would suggest, 
as a result of this leak occurring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point brought forward by the member for Markham is very 
serious.  This is a situation that the government is going to 
have to look into in more detail, not only to ensure that it does 
not happen again, but to ensure accountability and to ensure that 
the good name and reputation of those staff persons involved in 
this particular committee are not going to be besmirched by this 
incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is problematic in and of the fact that some members of the 
committee had it and others did not, but I would suggest equal 
importance and equal emphasis have to be placed on the fact that 
these staff persons are now castigated by this particular 
occurrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit, Mr. Speaker, that in the absence of a distinct report 
on the matter from the standing committee, there is an overriding 
duty on you to permit this House to probe the situation which 
compromises the staff of this House.  They should not have to 
tolerate this situation in silence, and I say emphatically that I 
do not believe for one moment that any staff person involved here 
is the source of the leak—that is not the allegation—but 
because of the leak, they have been placed in a non-acceptable 
position and it is up to this House, I would suggest, to remove 
that cloud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House does not address this premature disclosure issue 
and the standards it expects regarding disclosure and 
non-disclosure, the bad situation will be made worse.  Some 
members of this House favour more transparency at the committee 
deliberations.  That, I would suggest, is a good thing. Certainly 
the Finance committee is not of a mind that leaking a report is 
going to do anything to help improve the reputation of this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They voted down a motion by the hon. member for Markham to bring 
this matter to the House and now I would suggest a double 
standard exists.  The rules require confidentiality, the 
committee has voted not to bring the matter of the leak to the 
attention of the House and others may see merit in keeping it 
confidential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would suggest that having a report introduced through 
the media rather than the proper channels that we know exist in 
this House is completely inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the views of this House, I would suggest that there 
should be some debate and an agreement on the standards that we 
expect with respect to the introduction of these reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I invite you to consider the position of the 
employees involved in this particular matter when this game is 
played and leaks are put out to the media and I would ask that 
should you find that a prima facie case exists meriting priority 
consideration by this House, I would be pleased to move the 
motion in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, I want to hear opinions, of 
course, on a point of privilege.  I do not want us to get into 
debate.  If we go back and forth, it turns into a debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to say briefly that we 
support the comments by the Conservative members about the 
Liberals.  In the present circumstances, it is very obvious that 
what has been done is very harmful to the government's pre-budgetary 
consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak about my personal situation.  I 
conducted a pre-budgetary consultation in my riding and 
constituents kept asking me if it was serious, if it would be taken 
into consideration, if they would be able to see the results of the 
suggestions they were making.  I said that when I was elected to 
Parliament, this pre-budgetary consultation process did not really 
exist. 
It can be considered one of this government's good moves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But today, with the news of the leak, everything that has been 
said—and that is what I told my constituents as their member of 
Parliament—has been thrown into question by the fact that there 
is now no point in participating, that this is more political 
opportunism to give one party a leg up over the others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore find the comment by the Conservative member to be 
very relevant.  The government can try to make the best of it by 
allowing two days of debate.  I think that that would perhaps be 
interesting.

been taken for a ride. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am going to listen a second time out, if 
you have new information to give us, the hon. member for Medicine 
Hat, and then I will go to the hon. member for Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I simply want to point 
out very quickly that oftentimes opposition parties do issue 
minority reports.  I was being very frank with the chairman of 
the finance committee when I made that statement.  I did not 
suggest for a second that opposition members should not be 
allowed to see the majority report.  Even if we do issue a 
minority report, Mr. Speaker, certainly it would be nice to be 
able to see the majority report so that if we wish to amend what 
we are proposing we can do that but that was not allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I wish to make very briefly is that I trust, 
Mr. Speaker, you will look into the very serious matter of who 
leaked this document and that it will be made very public so that 
we can get to the bottom of this.  I do believe that it 
besmirches the whole reputation of the committee system when that 
sort of thing happens in Parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would just like to bring to the Chair's attention that a point of 
privilege on this very same matter came before the House last 
Friday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to advise the Chair that at the finance 
committee meeting last Friday when this matter first came to 
light as a result of the article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> that 
morning, the committee did spend extensive time discussing it.  I 
think the record will show this. I urge the Chair to look at the 
transcript of the committee, if it is available as it was an in 
camera session.  The members on the finance committee unanimously 
agreed that the situation that had occurred was unacceptable and 
passed a resolution requiring the chair to undertake a full 
investigation of what happened on behalf of all the members so 
that we could all know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wanted the Chair to know that since last Friday this 
issue is being dealt with by the chair of the finance committee. 
I just raise that for your attention, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We are still on this point of privilege. 
Unless there are more pertinent facts to be brought to the 
Chair's attention, I trust we will not go over information that 
was given previously.  The hon. member for Prince George—Bulkley

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in support of the question of privilege by the hon. 
member for Markham, I want to tell you that I have firsthand 
knowledge of the proceedings and how he got to his question of 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to add to the argument.  It is very clear from comments 
made that the Liberal members of the committee in fact did have 
prior knowledge of the committee report before it was presented 
to the committee.  That was absolutely clear from statements that 
were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, there were members of the committee who did acknowledge 
that they had discussed certain issues that the committee dealt 
with with the media over the last few days.  To what extent that 
went is up for debate but members had recognized that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that the opposition members' privileges were 
breached due to the fact that the Liberal members of the 
committee took part in the formation of the committee report at 
the exclusion of the opposition members of that committee.

evidence or suggestion that committee reports are being leaked to 
the media before other members, particularly opposition members, 
have seen them or for that matter that committee reports are 
being leaked anywhere. 
We remember still with great offence that the committee report on 
the review of the drug patent legislation was leaked to the

but I think you would agree that we are getting into a little 
dangerous ground when the member from Mississauga talks about 
votes taken in camera and the result of those votes and so on. It

mean if the vote is then reported back to the House.

the House.  I have had the opinions now of six or seven members 
which I want to take into consideration. I also want to get other 
information for myself with regard to what went on in committee. 
I think I will probably be able to get that so that will come 
into my decision.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK217">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-2, an act to establish 
the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and to amend the Canada Pension 
Plan and the Old Age Security Act and to make consequential amendments 
to other acts, as reported with amendments from the committee; and of 
the motions in Group No. 6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I believe that the hon. member for Tobique—Mactaquac 
still had seven minutes. He has the floor. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as I was saying, CPP contribution rates will have to rise to 
adequate levels to ensure the long term viability of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These increased contributions must be more than offset by 
substantial reductions in other taxes like EI.  This means more 
money going into the plan without asking Canadians to pick up the 
tab and without creating more threats to job creation.  As a 
result, the CPP will get the funding it needs without increasing 
personal tax burdens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need to know that never again will their pension funds 
be mismanaged the way they have been in the past.  They also 
deserve a greater return on their investment.  For this reason 
there must be a complete restructuring of the financing of the 
CPP to secure it for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many young people today are already sure they will not have the 
CPP when they need it.  In my riding I see young people who have 
a lot of trouble finding jobs that would allow them to earn a 
decent living and plan for the future.  The NDP amendments would 
let them foot the bill for us.  The NDP wants all sorts of 
benefits and all sorts of goodies.  That is just not right.  I 
cannot support that.  I cannot support putting my children's 
future on the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the only effective opposition in the House of Commons it is 
our role to explain to Canadians that there are alternatives to 
the government's position.  The government is trying to steamroll 
these changes through parliament and the official opposition 
party has been too inept to stop it.  Canadians deserve real 
policy alternatives, not just opposition while the cameras are 
rolling.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with some dismay that we have seen the government suggest 
reckless changes to the CPP which would affect Canadians long 
after the government has been forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In good faith we presented a series of amendments to the 
legislation during the committee hearings.  The government 
rejected all our amendments and then proceeded to introduce 
watered down versions of what we proposed.  Its amendments are 
too little too late but show how effective opposition and 
effective policy alternatives can influence change to misguided 
government legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, there 
is a lot of hypocrisy on the benches across the way.  While 
Canadians will have to pay 9.9% for a Canada pension plan, a plan 
which the Liberals across the way first created and ran into the 
hole to the tune of $600 billion, the government has another 
plan.  Its members have their gold plated pension plan.  While 
Canadians are contributing to the tune of 9.9%, having their 
premiums hiked up 70% or better from 5.85%, government members 
have their gold plated MP pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no greater hypocrisy than to have politicians set their 
own pension separate, above and beyond that of the people they 
serve.  That is exactly what the Liberal government has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals do not seem to see a problem, but I do and I think 
a lot of taxpayers do when they see members of Parliament 
collecting million dollar pensions.  Indeed one of their former 
colleagues, Brian Tobin, who is now the premier of Newfoundland, 
is collecting a pension which, if he lives to the age of 75, will 
result in him collecting $3.4 million.  It is outrageous that 
they are collecting this amount of money.  A number of members 
opposite will be collecting millions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is a millionaire.  He is talking about 
the changes to the CPP as though he personally cares about them. 
He has a lot of his money offshore in foreign trusts and is not 
paying tax on it.  However Canadians will have to pay nearly 10% 
of their income into the Canada pension plan to a government that 
bankrupted the pension plan.  The finance minister's own father 
said that it would never amount to more than a few hundred 
dollars and would never rise to more than 5%.  Shame on the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets even worse.  In the last term from 1993 to the last 
election there were 36 tax increases.  The bill represents either 
the 37th or the 38th tax increase depending on which passes 
first, Bill C-2 or Bill C-10.  With Bill C-10 once again the 
government is hitting upon those least able to pay. The 
government is taxing back and redefining as income social 
security benefits which a number of our seniors receive from the 
United States.  It will affect 50,000 people to the tune of about 
$2,000 each.  It is a tax grab of $100 million.  The government 
is hitting seniors.  Bill C-2 and Bill C-10 represent two new tax 
increases which will impact the pensions and retirement incomes 
of Canadians.  Shame on the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I would like to speak about our youth.  It is a subject 
which is near and dear to my heart.  The young people of Canada 
are being forced to pay into a pension plan out of which they 
will see less than a 2% rate of return.  Anyone could get that 
rate of return.  They are being forced to contribute to the plan 
in the same way as I have been forced as a new member of 
Parliament to contribute to the gold plated pension plan of which 
I do not want to be a part.  Many of my colleagues had the 
opportunity to opt out of that pension plan in the 35th 
parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing here a draconian measure of the greatest degree. 
The Liberals are plucking from taxpayers what they make by the 
sweat of their brows and the fruits of their labour.  They are 
telling them that they have to contribute to the government 
pension plan.  It has been poorly mismanaged in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has been proposing the idea of a mandatory or 
super RRSP.  What could be better than that?  People who would 
contribute to that plan would own it.  There would be a real 
sense of ownership.  They would be able to track the super RRSP. 
They would be able to know where their money is.  It would not go 
into some account.  It would not go in through one door and 
travel out through another.  The fund would actually be theirs. 
They would own it.  These people would have far more 
responsibility and far more accountability for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we trust a government across the way that talks about a 
Canada pension plan investment board when it has such a heinous 
record in terms of patronage appointments?  This year alone, 
excluding the Senate, there were 50 patronage appointments made 
by the government.  Those were just the ones we could find.  It 
can be guaranteed that for every patronage appointment we could 
find there are probably two or three more.  The government has 
that type of track record with patronage appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government broke its word.  A member across the way helped 
to write a critique of patronage positions and what was being 
done with the previous Tory administration.  The Liberals in 
opposition said that these matters should be brought before a 
parliamentary committee and that these jobs should be given based 
on merit.  Yet when the Liberals got into government what did 
they do?  In 1997 alone there were 50 patronage appointments. 
They made more patronage appointments to the Senate than even 
Brian Mulroney made when he was prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have an atrocious record on the whole issue of 
patronage appointments.  Yet once again the finance minister 
screams that we should trust him when it comes to the Canada 
pension plan investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record speaks for itself.  How can we trust somebody who has 
given his word but goes ahead and breaks it time and time again? 
How can we trust a man who has little or no understanding or 
empathy for what the average taxpayer does or for what lower 
incomes Canadians have to pay into this and what a struggle it is 
for them?  With his shipping companies and his tens of millions 
of dollars offshore, how can he relate to the amount of money 
these people have to take from their incomes to put into his 
Canada pension plan scheme? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have a poor track record yet this finance minister 
has the gall to stand before us and say that this is the save 
all, the same way his own father said that the Canada pension 
plan was a save all when it first came out.  It was a pay as you 
go plan with no accountability and no ownership on behalf of the 
individual Canadians contributing to it.  Shame on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go through the reasons for it being wrong.  Who will pay 
for it?  Taxpayers, in the same way they paid for the $600 
billion unfunded liability that was the CPP before reform.  Who 
wants it?  Do people want to have a 10% CPP contribution rate? 
No.  They wish the money had been invested properly in the first 
place.  They wish they had a sense of ownership with respect to 
the plan instead of having it badly mismanaged by the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who slips through the cracks?  Let us look at all the people who 
will be paying outrageously greater amounts of money than what 
they reasonably should.  For example, people under 35 years of 
age will be paying into the plan many more times than what they 
will receive from it if the plan even survives under the 
government mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us also look at the hypocrisy of MP pensions, the idea that 
Liberals have pensions above and beyond what any taxpayer could 
ever get.  For every dollar they put in, the taxpayer puts in 
close to four dollars.  Yet with the pension plan the public gets 
a pittance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also look at the idea of the Liberals going after the 
seniors in terms of social security benefits from the United 
States.  Once again they are going after the young and everybody 
else with the Canada pension plan tax hike.  We can look at it 
from the point of view that it is the 37th or the 38th tax 
increase the government has brought in since 1993.  We can look 
at it from the point of view of a finance minister who has little 
or no appreciation and does not care, a finance minister who does 
not pay his own fair share of taxes because he hides money out of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, shame on them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I was listening 
to my Reform colleague talking about the previous government. He was 
saying that the present government is not any better than the previous 
government. I got the impression, listening to the Reform members, that 
they think they know the answer to everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to emphasize that we have nothing to be ashamed of regarding 
the work of the previous government in the area of tax reform. 
Unfortunately, the present government did not follow up on that reform. 
We should also remember the free trade agreement, which allowed us to 
increase our exports by 140%. Talk is cheap, but the facts of history 
should not be ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To come back to Bill C-2, I believe that one of the basic errors 
the present government is making is to want to go too far too quickly. 
I think it should be criticized for acting this way. This is cause for 
concern because this government does not presently have a very heavy 
legislative agenda. The government would have time to consult the 
population further, to better inform Canadians of the importance of this 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reform of the Canada pension plan is the key issue during this 
mandate. I believe the government should be willing to spend more time 
on this. Unfortunately, it is addressing this issue with considerable 
indifference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They seem to want to copy very quickly, especially in the case of 
the investment board. 
They seem to think that this investment board will prevent all mistakes, 
protect us from any patronage, and so on. Quebec offers an interesting 
example, with the Caisse de dépôt et placement managing all Quebec 
funds, but perhaps we should take a closer look at this example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that further consultations on the subject would show 
that Canadians feel it is a little risky to give exclusive access to 
this kind of money—tens of billions of dollars—to an exclusive 
fund, which, as we will see in a moment, may not be protected against 
political interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the government is moving ahead quickly, establishing 
an investment board that will enable it to manage all funds contributed 
by Canadians. I think this is a very dangerous and risky proposition. 
In time, it will justify thinking that there should have been two or 
three boards, in totally different areas, instead of just one. This 
would at least have had the advantage of giving us a higher degree of 
security in every regard, including patronage appointments and 
investment choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all agree, of course, that it is important to amend this act. It 
is a fundamental component of our social safety net. However, we must 
try to be as fair and equitable as possible in making these amendments. 
With this bill, we will be dipping into the pockets of all Canadian 
taxpayers in a totally unacceptable fashion. Tens of thousands of jobs 
will be lost as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Change is clearly required, but the main reason for that change is 
obviously our aging population. 
It is an inescapable reality. There is also the dwindling birth rate. 
This means even greater pressure on the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Life expectancy is, of course, another factor that is not 
negligible. There is also the rising number of people on disability. 
There is the great concern generated by the general thrust that the 
government wants to give the fund. Then there are the reduced benefits 
that will be paid, even though the government will be dipping deep in 
the pockets of all Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about one or two billion dollars: we are talking 
about an annual average of $11 billion. This measure will result in the 
loss of tens of thousands of jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a political party, we want to ensure the program's long term 
viability. Obviously, everyone agrees with this goal. We also want to 
ensure sound management of the fund. 
Sound management simply means there should be a variety of investment 
options, given the huge amounts that will be collected.

not to rely solely on government retirement funds. 
I think that, when positive measures are taken, people are in a 
position to understand, and particularly to make their own 
investments, if they are given worthwhile means to encourage this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want above all is for the $11 billion in increased 
contributions taken from the pockets of Canadian taxpayers to be 
offset by lower taxes and, for goodness' sake, by lower employment 
insurance premiums as well.  It is inconceivable that the 
government has created a $15 billion fund at a time when all 
Canadians need that money.  Not $1 billion or $2 billion, but $15 
billion have been salted away in order to reduce the federal 
deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know very well that the record of the present government as 
far as its battle with the deficit is concerned is due, among other 
things, to—and you will forgive me for bringing up measures of the 
former government—the way free trade has performed. 
The present government voted against free trade.  Our exports to 
the U.S. market have risen from $90 billion to $215 billion.  This 
is one of the measures which now enable the government to fight the 
deficit without having to dig into the taxpayers' pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are, therefore, in agreement with a variation in the 
contribution rate, but we are particularly in agreement with people 
not having to pay more in order to ensure the long term survival of 
the federal pension fund.  This means lowering employment insurance 
contributions at a time when there are $10 to $15 billion dormant 
in the fund.  Book transfers are made, and then they say we can 
eliminate the deficit.  It is being eliminated now, thanks to other 
measures adopted by the previous government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that we would be in favour of increasing the 
foreign content limit of RRSPs from 20% to 50%.  This is a 
progressive measure and one with which we are in agreement.  We are 
also in agreement with staggering the increase over a longer 
period.  We will not go to the wall over a staggered increase, but 
we do want to see this increase balanced out by a corresponding 
decrease in EI premiums and a reduction in taxation sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the government would now be able to start 
the process of giving money back to Canadians.  That is the only 
way to create jobs.  Let us not forget that a 1% increase 
represents 25,000 to 35,000 lost jobs.  This is the completely 
unavoidable reality of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back then, the Liberals criticized payroll taxes.  They no 
longer feel bound by the wonderful promises they made.  The 
increase in CPP premiums must be offset by a decrease in other 
taxation sectors. 
The Liberals opposed a ceiling on increases in CPP premiums.  These 
increases could go well beyond 9.9% without Parliament having to 
give its approval.  This is an enormous door cabinet is opening. 
We must be very cautious.  Above all, we must not be too quick to 
pass this measure.  The aftermath could be terrible.  A 1% 
increase—believe it or not—will result in 25,000 to 30,000 lost 
jobs.  Entire municipalities will be threatened by this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last point is that politics must not be allowed to play any 
role whatsoever in the Canada pension plan investment board. 
I repeat that it is extremely dangerous to have just one investment 
board to manage a fund of $100 to $200 billion dollars. There have 
been cases in some countries where exclusive public funds were 
completely misappropriated.

this aspect.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to join in this debate on Bill C-2, the 
Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan is a very important part of our society. 
This universal plan, I believe, is under attack by the Liberal 
government.  This plan, which guarantees benefits for people when 
they reach their senior years, is facing a great amount of 
difficulty by the proposals in Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk particularly today about the disability 
provisions.  I stand in support of the motions that were made by 
our party, the NDP, concerning this aspect of the Canada pension 
plan.  These motions we made are designed to offset the 
provisions in the bill which alter the rules for calculating 
disability benefits and which make it harder to be eligible for 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the people applying for these pensions have enough 
difficulty now when they try to obtain what they are entitled to 
obtain; some of the bureaucratic delays that they have to go 
through, some of the difficulties while they are experiencing 
pain and disability.  It is very degrading for many people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a bill which proposes to make it even more difficult 
for people to obtain their benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed bill is very hard on those who are self-employed, 
on seniors and on women.  By deindexing the year's basic 
exemption by freezing it at $3,500 beginning in 1998, this 
downloads the burden of pension hikes on the low income earners. 
We know that low income people are experiencing enough difficulty 
now without having to pay more in order to obtain benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern is that the effect of adding the definition of 
maximum pensionable earnings average alters the benefit formula 
for calculation with a net effect again of reducing benefits. 
Reducing benefits is all we need to hear about today.  Pensions 
themselves are so low right now that when we talk about reducing 
them even further we realize that we are creating extreme 
difficulty for people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this past weekend I was at a function where a constituent 
was telling me that he receives a $560 disability pension.  Out 
of that he has to pay a mortgage of $400.  That leaves him with 
$160 to pay his lights, heat, telephone and buy groceries to feed 
himself and his family.  Imagine $160 a month.  Now we are 
talking about looking at the Canada pension plan so that we end 
up reducing people's benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes proposed regarding the minimum contributory 
requirements for a disability pension result in a reduction to 
disability benefits and further hardship, requiring recipients to 
work and contribute in four of the last six years instead of two 
of the last three or five of the last ten.  We want clause 69 
which provides for that to be deleted altogether.  Let us not 
make things more difficult for people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern is that Canada pension plan premiums are 
collected from only the first $35,800 of income.  The effect of 
this is that those who make over the maximum pensionable earnings 
pay a lesser percentage than those who make less.  We need to 
make sure that as one earns more, one contributes accordingly 
rather than having the low income workers always bearing the 
brunt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An hon. member of the Bloc Quebecois mentioned earlier that the 
NDP wanted to remove elements of the legislation relating to 
fraud. 
I believe some reference was being made to our motions where we 
want to amend Bill C-2 by deleting clauses 87 and 107.  These are 
the clauses which spell out massive new powers for the minister 
responsible to conduct investigations into the viability of 
claimants.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These clauses go so far as to talk about being able to enter 
people's dwellings with a warrant to enforce penalties, to gather 
information, to request information from third parties.  What 
third parties, I ask.  Your neighbours, your friends?  These 
clauses also talk about investigating Canada pension plan claims 
and imposing penalties for infractions. Who is imposing penalties 
for the infractions that the government administration causes 
with respect to the administration of this plan right now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the House's attention to a case where someone applied for 
benefits, was refused, appealed to the review board tribunal, a 
favourable decision was rendered and then the minister through 
the department appealed that favourable decision.  Here is 
someone who is unable to work, is suffering, is going through all 
kinds of mental anguish, wins at the tribunal level and then it 
is appealed by the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the appeal process when that appeal is made, I believe to 
the vice-chair of the Canada pension board, that official is 
supposed to forthwith under the act let the parties know whether 
that leave to appeal has been granted.  What is happening is the 
applications for appeal are piling up on that official's desk and 
a year later the person has not even got around to responding as 
to whether or not that appeal will be allowed, let alone setting 
up the process to carry through with that appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of bureaucratic delay and infraction of the current 
plan is of deep concern to me.  And now under Bill C-2 we are 
going to introduce even more powerful mechanisms that will slow 
down the process and cause indignity to those who need to apply 
for these pensions. We have to think very carefully about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about safety and we talk about safeguards against 
fraud, I maintain that that safeguard is already there now.  The 
safeguard is there in the integrity of our seniors, the people 
who are going to receive these benefits, the people in our 
society who are going to benefit from the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By introducing the kinds of changes that are addressed in this 
bill, we are automatically implying that our senior citizens and 
others are not—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
think you will find that the member is now discussing Group No. 7 
and if you check, you will find that we are still on Group No. 6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Yes.  May I remind 
the hon. member that we are still discussing Group No. 6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>   Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I will 
return to Group No. 6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I brought that forward because when my hon. colleague was 
speaking earlier, he made reference to the fraud element. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving back to Group No. 6, we are very concerned about the fact 
that the definitions outlined in Bill C-2 will end up reducing 
benefits.  With the amendments we have put forward in Group No. 6 
we want to counter that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not believe that in today's society it benefits anybody to 
reduce the amount of benefit that someone receives.  Rather, by 
doing that we end up paying in the long run because those people 
then have to seek other means to try to compensate their income. 
Therefore it is very important that the level and the integrity 
of the plan be maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I support the motions we have put forward under 
Group No. 6. We feel that those motions should be adopted in 
order to keep the plan effective.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, as I listen to the debate on the report stage 
amendments, I do understand that the devil is in the details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to discuss a little more generally some of the 
fundamentals as we consider these amendments, particularly those 
in Group No. 6 before us now. I want to talk about the 
fundamentals of retirement security. I am thinking primarily of 
RRSPs, the old age pension, the Canada pension plan and tax 
relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all to talk about RRSPs, company pension plans and 
RRSPs are the largest portion of retirement savings plans for 
most Canadians.  Consequently the Liberals hit RRSPs hard with 
tax grabs over the last four years, undermining the fundamentals 
of retirement security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in 1995 the RRSP contribution limit was reduced 
from $14,500 to $13,500 for 1996-97.  That is $1,000 less for 
people to invest for their retirement and $1,000 more for the 
government to tax and grab from Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well in 1996 the government reduced the age limit for 
contributions to a RRSP from 71 years to 69 years.  As well as 
giving two years less to contribute to a person's own retirement 
security, reducing the age limit allows retirement income to be a 
tax target two years sooner.  It is one big tax grab after 
another, aimed directly at seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even worse, the government plans to erode the RRSP retirement 
pillar even further.  During the last session of Parliament, the 
government members reluctantly admitted that they were looking at 
more ways to tax RRSPs. This is shameful.  It is a shameful 
action of the Liberals to do this.  No sooner do people try and 
salt some money away for their retirement than the government is 
right there with its hand in their pockets trying to get every 
last red cent. If the Liberals continue the steady calculated 
hacking away at RRSPs, people will lose their incentive to save 
for self-sufficient retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old age pension is the second pillar of retirement that the 
Liberals are slowly destroying.  In the year 2001, the old age 
pension, the guaranteed income supplement, the pension income tax 
credit and the age tax credit will be replaced by the so-called 
seniors benefit. Unfortunately when the seniors benefit is 
implemented, the government plans to claw it right back again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, pension experts estimate the seniors benefit will 
raise the average tax bill of a retiree from $3,000 to $7,000 a 
year. The government in its effort to grab every tax dollar it 
can, will base the amount of the clawback on family income, not 
individual income.  This means seniors will end up paying more of 
their retirement income to the government.  Some seniors are even 
considering divorcing to avoid this unfair tax grab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does this government shamelessly hammer away at the family 
institution at every level from youth to seniors?  Why do the 
Liberals consistently kill individual self-sufficiency, 
instituting more and more costly controls on citizens with its we 
know what is best for you attitude? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the government invented the seniors benefit 
strictly for the purpose of grabbing more tax dollars from the 
elderly knowing this will impoverish many. By the year 2030, the 
seniors benefit is projected to produce $8.2 billion in 
additional tax back benefits.  The only beneficiary in this case 
is the government, not the seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third pillar of Canadian retirement security is the Canada 
pension plan.  When the Liberals established the CPP 30 years ago 
it was structured in a fashion similar to a pyramid scheme. 
Early contributors reaped attractive benefits paid for by younger 
entrants to the plan. 
The problem in the 1990s however is that there are fewer and 
fewer contributors paying for more and more beneficiaries.  It 
would take $600 billion to pay all the benefits promised so far, 
but the CPP fund can only meet present commitments.  That is the 
catastrophe the plan is facing.

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To rectify this problem the government plans to hike the CPP 
payroll tax.  For example, CPP premiums will be hiked from 5.85% 
of wages up to a maximum salary of $35,800 to 9.9% by the year 
2003. Workers now paying $944 a year will see their annual 
contributions rise to $1,635 by the year 2003, which is an 
increase of 73%, the largest tax hike in Canadian history.  And 
for all this the retired person will receive less than $8,800 per 
year after retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that Canadians, especially young Canadians, will have 
to pay much higher premiums for much smaller benefits. For 
example, the Library of Parliament says a person who retired in 
1976 will get $12 for every dollar contributed, but a person 
retiring in the year 2041 will actually get a negative return. 
This means that after all the years of contributing, instead of 
being paid interest on the money contributed, Canadians will 
actually be eligible to receive less than the amount they paid 
into the CPP fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nearly doubling CPP premiums will also kill thousands of jobs, 
reducing the number of Canadians who can contribute to the fund. 
Even the finance minister admitted this fact on May 3, 1994 when 
he said “payroll taxes are a cancer on job creation”. Further, 
Department of Finance economist F. Weldon wrote in 1993 that a 
one percentage point increase in payroll taxes means a decline of 
nearly 1% in employment. That works out to 140,000 jobs lost. The 
Liberals want to hike premiums by four percentage points. That is 
560,000 jobs sacrificed for this latest Liberal scheme. Bill C-2 
will kill more than half a million jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far I have explained the three pillars of retirement 
security:  RRSPs, old age pension and the CPP.  Now if I may, I 
would like to read a letter that I received from one of my 
constituents expressing her concern about the amendment to the 
CPP.  She writes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am writing in regard to the increase in CPP. I am a housewife 
with two small children.  My husband works 12 hour days, six or 
seven days a week. Even with all the hours my husband works, we 
are only making ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot afford an increase in CPP. This increase only means my 
husband has to work even harder which means we will see even less 
of him.  How is this good for my two children?  How is this good 
for our marriage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government borrows, or should I say steals, from the CPP 
fund and then increases it because they can't pay it back.  Why 
do we have to pay for a dishonest government?  They preach about 
how they want to save our children. They preach about broken 
marriages. Then they turn around and screw us again.  Couples 
stress over money and it does affect the children. It does affect 
the marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can I afford to put my children in swimming lessons or 
baseball when any extra money we have the government takes? My 
oldest son is five and he said to me, “Why can't I, mommy? We 
can't afford it, right?” This is from a 5 year old. All his 
friends at school get hot lunches on Fridays but he doesn't. How 
are we supposed to dish out another $100 a month? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will CPP be there when my husband retires?  I doubt it.  I have 
a friend who at 28 is having to declare bankruptcy.  She has 
three children. I know that it could be us.  Kids are in trouble 
today more than ever because parents aren't there.  They have to 
work harder and longer so the kids are on their own. The future 
looks bleaker. Something has to be done about this CPP. Canada is 
on its way to ruin the way I see it. 
</UL>
<The lady who wrote this letter speaks for millions of Canadians. 
Thus, I urge the government to take a second look at the proposed 
changes to the Canada pension plan and to review them carefully 
for the benefit of Canadians.

Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in favour of Bill C-2.  I also 
rise to speak to the motions in Group 6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the motions put forward by a party opposite indicates 
that the proposed amendment would remove new investigative powers 
and administrative penalty provisions designed to prevent fraud 
and to allow for remedial action outside of court processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We oppose this motion for the simple reason that client rights 
are protected by the availability of full appeal rights 
pertaining to all matters within this bill and arising from the 
imposition of an administrative penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new investigative powers align the Canada pension plan 
with old age security and with current provisions of the EI act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker spoke rather scurrilously about Bill C-2. I 
was reminded of something which Mark Twain once said.  He said 
that there are lies, there are damn lies and then there are 
statistics.  The hon. member for Cariboo—Chilcotin played fast 
and loose with the statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was making disparaging remarks about the CPP and endorsing 
RRSPs.  RRSPs are not guaranteed.  People can invest their money 
in RRSPs and lose it, but if they invest their money in the 
Canada pension plan it is guaranteed by the federal government. 
It is a pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B>  It is a guaranteed loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member opposite has 
a beautiful wife.  She is a very good friend of my wife.  I 
really do not know what she sees in the hon. gentleman, but I 
guess he does have some redeeming qualities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite indicated that it was a payroll tax. 
All hon. members opposite know full well that it is not a payroll 
tax.  It is a pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  Madam Speaker, tell them to watch my 
lips.  It is a pension plan.  We will look after people when they 
decide to ride off into the sunset with their pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actuaries of the Reform Party have already told them that it 
would be more costly initially to get into an RRSP plan than it 
would be to get into the CPP.  They know full well that is the 
truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another motion that was put forward, I believe it is No. 11, 
suggested that the new contribution rate schedule be deleted and 
the old unsustainable schedule remain in effect.  That would be 
absolutely devastating. This motion would put the financial 
sustainability of the CPP at risk, which is the very thing our 
bill addresses.  We want this plan to be sustainable.  That is 
why Bill C-2 is before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion most certainly should not be considered, as far as 
we are concerned. It would bankrupt the plan by the year 2015.  I 
realize that some members opposite are bankrupt of ideas with 
respect to the CPP, but the plan would actually have no money in 
it by the year 2015 if we went along with this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about money.  The Greek philosopher, Sophocles, 
once said that there is nothing so demoralizing in the world as 
money or the lack thereof.  I say to members opposite that if we 
went along with some of these motions there would certainly be a 
lack of money in the pension plan.  Therefore we cannot endorse 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 22 would delete the requirement for increased 
contribution rates to cover the costs of new or increased 
benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an important statement of principle, but the federal and 
provincial governments agreed that any future benefit enrichments 
must be paid for and that we should never ever again put the 
security of the CPP at risk by enriching benefits without being 
able to pay for them.  We must have the money to pay for these 
benefits.  We will ensure that because we want to ensure that our 
young people most certainly of all are not saddled with this 
unbearable burden.

I know the hon. Leader of the Opposition most certainly did.  It 
was Sir Wilfrid Laurier.  Sir Wilfrid Laurier over a hundred 
years ago had this to say, and I will paraphrase it, about 
liberalism.  Before some of the members opposite start indulging 
in idle rhetoric and yelling at me, it is small “l” liberalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  “Liberalism is inherent in the very essence of our 
nature.  It is that desire of happiness with which we are all 
born into the world.  We constantly gravitate toward an ideal 
which we never attain.  We dream of good but never realize the 
best and thus it will be as long as people are what they are.  As 
long as their immortal soul inhabits a mortal body, their desires 
will always be vaster than their means”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The means by which we are going to set a plan that is viable and 
is sustainable for the youth of this country is this Canada 
pension plan because we and I believe all members in this chamber 
care.  We as federal members of Parliament must lead the way.  We 
must get Canadians to look beyond the Teflon and the show biz of 
perhaps question period and perhaps of some of the things we do 
and say in this House.  We must get them to look at the reality 
of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will not be done by each and every member in this House 
standing up and reading a speech that has perhaps been penned by 
hired guns, a speech that perhaps sounds good.  We need speeches 
that are good and sound.  We do not need speeches that bring 
people to their feet.  We need speeches that bring people to 
their senses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To do this each and every one of us as parliamentarians must 
make sacrifices.  We must give up a little bit of our 
self-interest.  On occasion we cannot get exactly what we want. 
The truth of the matter is that this truth must ring loud and 
clear. It must not be muffled by crass manipulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth of the matter is that in order to proceed as 
parliamentarians, in order to proceed with this bill, our people 
must be more intelligent, more highly organized, our social 
standards more just and each and every person in this chamber, in 
the House of Commons, must be more united in our cause.  We must 
not fail in our duty at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians we must believe in a country as blessed as 
ours, and blessed we are with the riches of our natural 
resources, be they gas, oil, water or timber.  The richness we 
really have is our human resources.  All members in this House, 
irrespective of their race, creed, colour, religion or political 
affiliation, must come together and do what is best for our 
country Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must believe that we will be able to reach out to those 
people, reach out to the hungry, the homeless, the sick and the 
destitute.  How do we do that?  By bringing forth a bill such as 
Bill C-2, a Canada pension bill that is good for all.  It is time 
that we stood up and shaped our own Canadian identity, that we 
stood up and did what we have to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I was a 
minister in Quebec briefly in 1985, and I remember at the time the 
government of René Lévesque brought down an orange paper.  The 
colour stuck in my mind.  What was it about?  It was on the need to 
better finance the Quebec pension plan.  That was in 1985.  The 
Quebec pension plan and the Canada pension plan serve the same 
purpose, which is to ensure that people who have worked receive 
universal benefits so they can enjoy a comfortable retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find surprising is that a number of members in this 
House are just discovering the problem. 
What I also find surprising is the fact that this government, in 
power since 1993, has not looked at this urgent matter before now. 
What I find even more surprising is that we are not hearing the 
Conservatives repent openly, saying “We should have looked at the 
viability of the Canada pension plan when we were in office”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, some 0.5% of people receive a pension from the 
Canada pension plan, while the others receive theirs from the 
Quebec pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motions in Group No. 6 concern viability.  I understand 
those colleagues who would like people not to have to pay for this 
collective insurance and would like them to receive more. 
Unfortunately, over the years, we have learned that when we pay out 
benefits we must ensure there is money to cover them, otherwise the 
plan is threatened, and with the passage of time young people are 
increasingly facing the prospect of no benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House must quickly go through the democratic process to 
approve the increased contributions proposed, even if they hurt. 
This is the only way to ensure that future generations can benefit 
from this program, which is rightly considered the jewel of the 
social safety net. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No other system can do the job.  Some people, of course, can 
invest in RRSPs, but everyone agrees that it takes a certain salary 
level and a secure income. 
Only people with no problems in life, who do not have to stop 
working because of illness or pregnancy, for example, can afford to 
invest in RRSPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, as a supplement, yes.  But there must be a universal plan 
that is viable and not only for one generation, but for all 
generations to come.  This is why this bill, which increases 
contributions, must be approved quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must also further reduce unemployment insurance 
premiums.  I think I was the first to say in this House that 
unemployment insurance premiums had to be cut.  When we were 
elected, I was the human resources development critic.  It was true 
then, but today it is outrageous. 
I say it as I see it.  It is crazy for the government year after 
year to plan surpluses of $6 billion a year from the premiums paid 
by workers who earn up to $39,000 and then stop paying premiums. 
I am speaking primarily of small and medium size businesses, 
because capital intensive businesses pay much higher salaries and 
so pay proportionately less. 
It is the people who work, the small and medium size businesses that pay 
these premiums, which are not even a disguised tax but an obvious tax 
imposed to reduce the deficit.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc have been saying for some time that premiums must be 
reduced and that the plan must be improved. With a surplus of at least 
$13 billion already in the fund, we will never be in a situation—given 
the current plan's structure—where it could become empty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that the former unemployment insurance plan 
incurred an annual deficit of $2 billion during the 1990-92 crisis, but 
it was a more generous plan and the unemployment rate was also extremely 
high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absurd and outrageous to have such a high payroll tax. The 
government is in a position to lower contributions while promoting the 
growth of the Régime des rentes du Québec and the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure the viability of the plan, the bill provides that it will 
be managed by a board. In my speech at second reading, I mentioned that, 
in Quebec, a board was set up in 1965 to not only manage the fund, but 
also to promote economic development. I do realize however that in 
Canada a board with such powers will necessarily have centralizing 
effects. I must say that if I thought I had to live with that board for 
a long time, I would be concerned about its centralizing effects. 
Members from other parties should look into this, because there is a lot 
of money involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Caisse de dépôt et placement now has assets—and 
I am quoting from memory—of at least $62 billion. It has investments 
in all large corporations and also in small and medium size businesses. 
It plays an important economic role, and Quebec is a mixed economy, 
partly thanks to the Caisse de dépôt et placement. We are very proud 
that, in 1965, the government of the day, whose motto was “masters in 
our own house”, decided to co-ordinate management of the premiums paid 
by workers and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is not perfect, and nor is the Régie des rentes du Québec. 
Personally, I would like to see some conditions changed but, generally 
speaking, if we are serious in our commitment to younger people, we must 
quickly ensure adequate financing of the Régie des rentes du Québec and 
the Canada pension plan. The RRQ must continue to serve as economic 
leverage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it intrigues me that we can have such different views of Canada 
and such different views of what Canadians are saying to us. 
I will take some time to speak against Bill C-2 and somewhat to 
the group of amendments before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin that it is necessary for me to begin my remarks by 
touching on something that was recently written by Michael 
Jenkinson of the Edmonton <I>Sun</I>.   Like many other Canadians, 
he is realizing that the proposed changes to the CPP are 
tantamount to the biggest tax rip-off in Canadian history.  Mr. 
Jenkinson writes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I apologize if I misled people into thinking that the CPP 
premium increase would be a massive tax hike instead of a 
freaking monstrous tax grab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now satisfied that the Liberals are not ignorant, money 
grubbing, peons who believe the answer to every problem is to 
hike taxes.  Instead people should correctly understand that the 
Liberals are actually treacherous demon spawn who would rather 
sell out today's younger generation for the sake of a quick 
political fix.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now those are not my words.  I would be a little more delicate 
in what I would say about people.  However, it is an expression 
of some of the outrage we in the Reform Party are hearing about 
the proposed changes to the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion that this Liberal government is selling out future 
generations of Canadians is at the heart of this matter.  We take 
the opposite viewpoint from our hon. colleagues across the way 
who see it as the great salvation for our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from the cruel intergenerational transfer of wealth that 
this bill proposes, this legislation will give Canadians in the 
upcoming generation a pathetic return once they retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues, for just a second I plead with you to think of 
what this legislation will do in conjunction with a $600 billion 
or more national debt.  Not only has this Liberal government 
effectively relegated repayment of the national debt to future 
generations of Canadians, it has now saddled them with the $590 
billion unfunded liability present within the Canada pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if Liberal members across the way have children.  Do 
they not have grandchildren?  What can they possibly say that 
would justify placing this heavy debt around the necks of our 
young?  What will these future generations of working Canadians 
have to look forward to after decades of debt repayment?  What 
will be their reward for the thousands they will pay into CPP 
contributions?  A pathetic pension which will give them a 
negative return on their investment once they retire.  I think 
that is downright criminal and sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond that, when I listen to the flippancy coming from the 
government benches during question period and when I listen to 
the finance minister twist his responses on the matter of the CPP 
it is disgusting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have eight children.  Some of them are old enough to vote and 
some are not.  In either case, the proposed changes to the Canada 
pension plan are and will be nothing short of a national tragedy. 
What say do my children have right now in this matter?  Actually 
their say will mirror that of their future pensions, nothing at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now contributions are 5.8% of every working Canadian's 
gross salary whether employed or self-employed.  Participation is 
mandatory.  Contributions will increase over a six year period 
until the year 2003 when they will reach a steady state of 9.9%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Library of Parliament, those who retire in the 
year 2026 will only get back 64% of what they put into the Canada 
pension plan.  That same study also shows that people who retired 
in 1976 will receive nearly 12 times what they put into the 
scheme.  Is that fair to our young people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what this is.  It is a scheme.  More precisely, 
it is a pyramid scheme, one which greatly benefits those who are 
in first and gives the shaft to those who will follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, however, a major difference between Bill C-2 and the 
illegal investment scams conducted in places like Albania.  Yes, 
just like the pyramid schemes that plagued but were accepted by 
the Albanian government, the CPP is also sanctioned and condoned 
by our government in Canada, except the people of Albania at 
least had a choice in whether or not they wanted to participate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Bill C-2 this Liberal government is not giving Canadians 
any choice whatsoever in the matter.  In short, this state 
sanctioned mugging is mandatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the year 2003 every worker making at least $35,800 will pay 
$1,635 per year and his or her employer will have to match it. Of 
course, self-employed people will have to pay both contributions, 
as much as $3,270 per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maximum benefit payable under CPP is 25% of an average 
salary of $35,800.  This works out to a top yearly payment of 
$8,725.  If that is not obscene, what is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax grab hits everyone.  The only real difference is the 
proportional way in which it does so.  In terms of low income 
workers and part time workers, they will feel the pinch 
disproportionately.  The first $3,500 of income is exempt from 
CPP deductions.  It is called the yearly basic exemption. 
However, Bill C-2 will freeze this deduction.  So as the price 
index rises with inflation over the years the real level of the 
YBE, the yearly basic exemption, will decline. This will 
effectively shift the burden of contributions more heavily on to 
low income earners. This is a regressive feature that widens the 
contributory base by stealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from the negative consequences that Bill C-2 will have on 
future generations of workers, this legislation also represents a 
huge obstacle to anyone who will be looking for a job.  Why? 
Because the proposed premium increases are the biggest payroll 
taxes ever put to Canadians since the inception of the Canada 
pension plan, 73% over the next six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, colleagues, Canadians, payroll taxes kill jobs. 
Do not take my word for it.  In the House of Commons on May 3, 
1994 Paul Martin said in an answer to a question by 
the leader of the Reform Party “payroll taxes are a cancer on 
job creation”.  In  his own presentation to the Standing 
Committee on Finance on October 17, 1994 finance minister 
Paul Martin said it even more clearly— 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
on a point of order, with due respect, the rules of this place do 
not allow members to refer to members by their name but only by 
their riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  That is correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Madam Speaker, the finance minister said 
it clearly: “We believe there is nothing more ludicrous than a 
tax on hiring, but that is what payroll taxes are.  They have 
grown dramatically over time. They affect lower wage earners much 
more than those at the high end.  We took steps early in our 
mandate to reverse this trend in the case of UI premiums.  We 
would hope to take further steps in the future”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There we have it.  Even the finance minister admits that payroll 
taxes kill jobs.  Yet we now have the most hypocritical of 
positions before us in Bill C-2.  The Liberals are not listening 
to themselves and they are certainly not listening to average 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joe Italiano of the Department of Finance did a study in April 
1995 on the employment implications for growth in CPP 
contributions.  The CPP premium rate grew just seven-tenths of a 
percentage point between 1986 and 1993 but Italiano said it cost 
Canada 26,000 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals intend to increase the rate almost six times the 
rate increase Italiano used.  Using Italiano's assumptions and 
projecting into the future we calculate that the phased-in 
increase of the higher CPP premiums will cost the Canadian 
economy 100,000 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I serve notion of my intention— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must apologize but 
the time really has run over.  Resuming debate, the hon. member 
for Brandon—Souris. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is not necessarily with great pleasure that I rise to speak to 
this piece of legislation, but I certainly do have the 
opportunity to speak, albeit somewhat limited because of the 
closure that has been suggested by the Liberal government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that in itself terribly damaging to this piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally when legislation is put forward by the government in 
power, it is done with the best interests of Canadians at heart 
when the legislation is proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government suggested that this legislation cannot be debated 
in the House and did not give the opportunity to consult 
Canadians about this piece of legislation which will impact them 
quite dramatically over the next numbers of years, not only from 
a premium perspective but also from the perspective of a return 
on those dollars that are going to be invested in the CPP 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take exception to the fact that Canadians were not consulted, 
that the people who will be paying the majority of the premium 
price have not had an opportunity to tell us one way or another 
what their views are.  This government has decided in its own 
wisdom to stop the debate, “Let's not give anybody an 
opportunity to talk about the pros and cons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of citizens who would love to have the 
opportunity to speak to this.  The first are obviously the 
seniors.  We have a high proportion of seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have been talking to me.  They have been calling me and 
asking what is going to happen to them.  As well, they have a 
need and a desire to make sure that their children and their 
children's children are taken care of in the years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those seniors would like to be consulted.  They are currently 
reaping some of the benefits of a Canadian pension plan that was 
put in place 30 years ago.  It also behoves the government to 
consult with the baby boomers—I put myself in that category and 
you too, Madam Speaker—who are going to be affected quite 
dramatically by the fact that we will be faced with substantial 
increases in premiums and may not be able to get any return on 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan, I believe, should be based on a very 
simple premise.  That premise is a pension plan is a pension 
plan.  It is not a tax.  It is not an opportunity to raise money 
to pay for others who have gone before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A pension plan is a pension plan.  When money is put into a 
pension plan, you expect to have a rate of return and certainly a 
return on that investment at some later date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the case here.  Until the government admits that 
this is a tax grab, believe me, we will be debating this bill as 
long and as hard as we possibly can for the benefit of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the legislation.  I will talk to the motions 
before us.  By the way, they are good motions in some cases and 
in some other cases perhaps not quite as valid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just one attack on what is happening with our pension 
structure in Canada.  Other effects are going to be on the OAS, 
the old age security, and on RRSP contributions as was mentioned 
earlier by a speaker from another party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Make no mistake about it.  The Progressive Conservative Party 
wishes to have a sustainable, stable Canada pension plan, but a 
pension plan, not a tax.  We believe in sustainability.  In fact, 
we believe that premiums have to be increased in order to make 
the plan sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have said all along that in order to do that, we would like 
to offset these regressive payroll taxes that are being proposed 
now with the huge, intolerable increases, excessive increases in 
the CPP premium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That can be offset quite simply by taking the EI premiums that 
are currently in place and generating substantial revenues that 
are going to offset the deficit.  This government in a 
self-congratulatory fashion is saying that those dollars are 
going to the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other methods to reduce the deficit.  The huge 
resources that are being generated from EI premiums should go 
into the CPP.  Those are payroll taxes. 
Payroll taxes destroy jobs.  I am sure that everybody recognizes 
that the change in premiums to $1,635 in the year 2003 is a 
premium matched by the employer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An employer will have few options to fund the premium increase; 
reduce the salaries of their employees which would give them less 
disposable income; do not give increases in the following years 
because of the excessive changes to the CPP premium level or lay 
people off. In fact, at that time nobody would be contributing, 
not to society and tax revenues but also to the CPP.  The final 
and worst option is to lose money in the business and not have a 
business in the future. That does not help anybody. That is what 
happens when there are regressive payroll taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan is simple.  Have a sustainable fund and make sure that 
the offset of the CPP premiums come from EI.  The Reform plan, 
unfortunately, is very simplistic.  It does not have a plan.  We 
should simply throw up our arms and say every man, woman and 
child for themselves.  Let us simply say that a $600 billion 
unfunded liability does not exist.  It does not work and it never 
has worked.  However, these are very simple solutions for complex 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say that it is not only seniors and the 
baby-boomers that I am concerned about, but the people who come 
after. I too have children, ages 22 and 18.  They are going to 
join the job market as soon as I have paid for their university 
education.  They will be in the job market and be contributing 
members of this society.  In fact, they will be contributing a 
substantial amount of money to a plan that may well, for all 
intents and purposes, not be available to them when they are 
depending on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember the simple premise?  A pension is a pension. CPP is a 
pension. When we contribute to it, we should get a return back on 
the investment.  If we are not going to do that, then call it 
what it really is, a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hate looking at the term benefit.  There are benefits that are 
paid.  No, there is a return on the investment that is being 
paid.  The return on that investment is proposed to be decreased 
on an annual basis.  However, in fact, the premiums are being 
increased on annual basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the numbers and they are not refutable. 
Contributors will be getting no return on their investment when 
they want to collect CPP in the not too distant future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 11 from the NDP, unfortunately we cannot support it. 
It is a proposal to eliminate the premium table. We have always 
said that we believe in the CPP. There has to be funding in order 
to have a sustainable fund. There has to be a premium table. 
Premiums have to be paid and certainly premiums have to be 
increased, but with a decrease in the EI premium as well. That is 
sustainability.  That is not regressive payroll taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We have reduced it four times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Not enough.  The comment was made that 
EI premiums have been reduced four times.  It is our very valid 
opinion that they can be reduced dramatically to offset this CPP 
contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 14 is to freeze the yearly basic exemption for ten 
years.  We believe that there should be a freeze on the YBE, but 
it should be for a ten year period, not in perpetuity for the 
simple reason that there are changes in our inflationary factors 
in Canada.  Let us put it in place for the first ten years and 
review it after a ten year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this very, very 
important piece of legislation.  I hope that the government will 
look at the ramifications that this legislation will have on the 
Canadian public, the Canadian employees and employers of this 
country. This legislation will have serious, negative 
ramifications.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to express why I am so supportive of the 
government's Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a demonstration that we are willing to restore Canada's 
faith in its pension plan.  We are dealing with this pension plan 
in a businesslike manner.  It is one of the things that we hear 
more and more lately:  The community is asking the government to 
operate as a business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were extensive hearings in partnership with the provinces 
from April 1996 to June.  It was a David Walker committee.  The 
reforms that this government is suggesting reflect the wishes of 
those people who were consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard hon. members opposite talk about a contribution to 
the Canada pension plan as a job-killing payroll tax.  When I 
consult with the small business people in my area, they say that 
contributions to the Canada pension plan are merely the costs of 
doing business and that if your bottom line indicates you can 
hire more people, you will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan has aspects of it that I think 
demonstrate the kind of country Canada is.  We have insurance 
benefits. We have disability pension and survivor benefits. They, 
too, reflect the kind of character that we heard Canada wanted in 
its pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan is not a wealth redistribution plan.  It 
is a plan that will be there for all Canadians.  That is why I 
feel that it will restore the Canadian belief that a pension plan 
will be there for our children and our grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak to Group 6.  Motion No. 11 speaks about 
deleting the new contribution schedule rate.  One of the things 
that the reform to the Canada pension is doing is establishing a 
sustainable rate that Canadians can rely on.  The suggestion that 
we do not deal with the increases both on the part of the 
employer and the employee would put the sustainability of the 
Canada pension plan at risk.  That is the very issue that this 
bill addresses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestion by the hon. member opposite that we not raise the 
contribution rates would mean that the plan would be bankrupt by 
the year 2015.  The Canada pension plan has an unfunded liability 
that these reforms will deal with, again in a businesslike 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 13 by the member opposite talks about removing the 
year's basic exemption and freezing it.  The year's basic 
exemption is the portion of earnings on which contributors do not 
pay premiums but receive benefits.  Under the proposed changes, 
the year's basic exemption will continue at its current level of 
$3,500 rather than growing on the line with average wages.  By 
freezing the year's basic exemption at $3,500, more and more very 
low earning workers will be eligible to contribute to CPP and 
receive benefits from the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier the member opposite talked about a very compelling 
letter by a constituent whose husband works six days a week. I 
believe there was real angst in that letter.  Those kinds of 
people do not have the kind of money that they can contribute to 
the super RRSP plans that have been suggested by the Reform. That 
is why it is fundamental that the Canada pension plan be there 
for all Canadians in their retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 22 speaks about deleting the requirement for 
increased contribution rates to cover the cost for new or 
increased benefits.  When we had hearings with the provinces and 
Canadians in the communities we visited across Canada, one thing 
we heard about was the fact that they did not want current 
recipients to be impacted and they wanted it to be there, to be 
sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the 9.9% that we will go to and stay with, 4.3% goes to 
pension contribution, 1.7% would go to the insurance component. 
Again I would underline that that is something Canadians said 
that they wanted to see in their Canada pension plan.  .1% goes 
to administration, which is a very low percentage when you look 
at private pension plans and how they are administered, and 3.8% 
would go to the unfunded liability, which is the very point this 
government needs to wrestle with in order that this plan be 
sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the first step of many.  We are going to look at track 2 
in dealing with other issues that we heard Canadians were 
concerned with.  Bill C-2 is a step forward and something that 
all Canadians need for their future.
