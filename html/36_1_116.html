<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN TRANSPORTATION ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION AND SAFETY 
BOARD ACT

<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (for the President of the Queen's Privy 
Council and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs)</B> moved that 
Bill S-2, an act to amend the Canadian Transportation Accident 
Investigation and Safety Board Act and to make a consequential 
amendment to another Act, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak today to Bill S-2, which amends the Canadian Transportation 
Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act and makes 
consequential amendments to another Act. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989 parliament passed the CTAISB act and the act was 
proclaimed in March 1990.  Following a review that was required 
by the statute and on the basis of the operating experience of 
the Transport Safety Board, the TSB, over the past eight years 
some legislative changes have been proposed to fine tune the 
TSB's already good legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1005"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT2"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT2"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1005
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the proposed changes are relatively minor, or are 
administrative in nature.  It is also proposed to improve the 
Board's operating practices and its independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the administrative changes proposed, a number of the 
definitions used in the act will be improved, application of the 
act as it applies to pipeline accidents and incidents will be 
clarified, and it will be made clearer that departments may 
continue to perform their duties while the Board is 
investigating an accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the TSB will be more readily able to respond to 
provincial requests to carry out investigations for them, on a 
cost recovery basis. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several proposed changes to put increased emphasis on 
the identification of safety deficiencies through TSB 
investigations. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to encourage people to provide the TSB with information 
on safety, it is proposed that information provided to 
investigators, by witnesses for instance, be better protected. 
Civil proceedings may be taken against persons refusing to 
provide information to TSB investigators. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A proposal will provide protection to representations made to 
the board on its confidential draft reports by persons with a 
direct interest who are asked to review them.  Such protection 
would be similar to that provided to witness statements. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill contains a number of provisions as well concerning 
on board recorders, equipment known as black boxes, which can be 
very useful in a complex investigation.  The on board recordings, 
which are already protected, will include the video recordings 
of crew activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, sounds heard in on board recordings that are not voice 
recordings, such as motor noise, will no longer be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, on board recordings cannot be used in criminal or 
disciplinary proceedings.  One provision will apply the same 
privilege to the recordings to limit their use in civil 
proceedings. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was considered in detail by the Senate and three 
amendments were made.  The first was to provide assurance that 
there would be a minimum number of full time board members.  The 
second was to accommodate the orderly administration of judicial 
and other proceedings started before these amendments become law. 
We believe that both of those amendments improve the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third amendment was made to widen the meaning of on-board 
recordings.  That amendment leads to some serious problems for 
the Department of Transport in its safety oversight role and we 
requested that it be defeated.  It has the unintended effect of 
denying the employer and the regulator access to the information 
necessary to ensuring the quality and safety of some elements of 
air traffic service.  Further, it makes it difficult to take 
remedial measures when procedures require amendments.  I point 
out that the Canadian Air Traffic Control Association does not 
object to the removal of this amendment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-2 would help improve Canada's already exceptional 
reputation in transport accident investigation.  I ask all 
members of the House to give the bill speedy passage.

am pleased to speak to Bill S-2, an act to amend the Canadian 
Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act and to 
make consequential amendments to another act, the Canadian Labour 
Code.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a reprint of Bill C-86 which was introduced during 
the last parliament on March 6, 1997.  It passed first reading, 
but it was never considered by the transportation committee of 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I speak to the bill I would like to say a few words 
about the process that is being followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am on the transportation committee and this is the first time 
I have heard about this bill.  Would it not make sense for the 
transportation committee of the House to see the bill before it 
is introduced for debate in the House of Commons?  This is one 
good reason for the House not to accept bills originating in the 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transportation committee of the House of Commons is the 
scrutineer of all legislation pertaining to transportation 
matters in this country, not the Senate.  At no time should the 
transportation committee be left out of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House support this bill in principle, but 
we need an opportunity to clarify some technicalities in the 
bill, hopefully at the committee level.  We agree that there is a 
need to modernize Canada's transportation safety investigation 
regulations to align them with the recommendations made in a 1994 
review commission report on the Canadian Transportation Accident 
Investigation and Safety Board Act and the 1992 Moshansky 
commission report on the Dryden air accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the goals of the review was to uncover cost efficiencies 
as well as increase the flexibility of the board's operations. 
Included in its recommendations allowing for part time board 
members was that the ratio of the full and part time members 
would be left up to the governor in council.  That makes a lot of 
sense.  For example, should there be a large serious accident or 
even a series of serious accidents it may seem necessary to the 
governor in council to appoint five full time members.  At other 
times a full time board would not be necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it necessary to have three full time members all the time? 
Would it not make sense to leave it up to the government of the 
day to hire on need? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good news is that this amendment, unusual as it may be, 
would not result in new programs and new expenditures.  This is 
indeed unusual in most government bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to repeal the Transportation Safety Board's 
mandate to initiate and conduct special studies and special 
investigations on matters pertaining to safety in transportation 
puzzles me.  This amendment appears to take away from the 
Transportation Safety Board the authority to be independent and 
to initiate investigations on its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment would make the Transportation Safety Board very 
reliant on directions from government on what it can and cannot 
investigate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-2 will also place a greater emphasis on the 
identification of safety deficiencies in the transportation 
sector.  It will prohibit other federal departments, except the 
Department of National Defence, from investigating a 
transportation occurrence for the purpose of making findings as 
to its causes and contributing factors.  An investigation for any 
other purpose is sanctioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-2 will strengthen the distinction between safety 
investigations and court disciplinary proceedings.  It will also 
provide for greater protection of information provided to the 
Transportation Safety Board.  It will prohibit the use of 
on-board recordings in legal proceedings and will generally 
relieve investigators from the obligation to appear as witnesses 
in any such proceedings.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports the bill.  It is critical to the 
process that the bill originated in the Senate and should pass 
through the transport committee of the House of Commons. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to Bill S-2.  For the 
benefit of those watching, this bill was originally introduced 
by the government on March 6, 1997 as Bill C-86 but died on the 
order paper when the last federal election was called on April 
26, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first off like to say that our party, the Bloc 
Quebecois, will support the bill. I give the government the 
option of proceeding to second and third reading this morning to 
permit the bill to be passed quickly before the summer recess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though elements of the bill are of interest to our party, 
there is a procedure not often used in the House, which is 
sometimes a problem, but which is permitted, namely, the 
introduction of bills directly in the Senate.  This is why this 
bill is known as Bill S-2.  So, exceptionally, the government 
decided, with the co-operation of the Leader of the Government 
in the Senate, to introduce this bill in the Senate first, 
rather than in the House first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like most Quebeckers, we in the Bloc Quebecois are totally 
opposed to the institution that is the Senate. We deplore the 
fact that, showing a degree of contempt for democracy, the 
government chose to introduce the bill before unelected 
parliamentarians. Bear in mind that this archaic institution 
from another era is made up of 104 individuals appointed by the 
government of the day, who are currently almost equally divided 
into two groups: a Liberal majority and a Conservative official 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To us, as a party, it is absolutely indecent for such a bill to 
be initiated by unelected senators. The government should have 
followed the usual procedure and introduced the bill here, in 
the House of Commons, the house of the people, where we 
represent democracy as it was clearly expressed in the June 2, 
1997 general election. 
Whether we get along or not, or have differences of opinion 
about Canada's or Quebec's place on the international scene, we 
are all democratically elected members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no ambiguity about the political colour of the 44 
members of the Bloc Quebecois: we are sovereignists. We have 
said so before, during and every day we have a chance to do so 
in this House since the election. We consider ourselves 
democrats, to the same extent as our colleagues from the four 
other parties represented in the House. This concludes the aside 
I wanted to make regarding the unusual procedure used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will not make it a habit. We work hard in 
this place. We have a number of bills to examine. Unfortunately, 
it is rumoured that we will adjourn soon, earlier than scheduled 
on the parliamentary calendar, because our legislative agenda is 
so light. 
I see the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration laughing 
across the way. But it is true, there is not much to work on. We 
are prepared to work hard, night and day and on weekends if 
necessary, but we need a legislative agenda to work on. 
I believe members of this House have shown that they can be 
serious and work hard. There is no need to have bills introduced 
directly in the Senate.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to the fact that the Canadian Transportation Accident 
Investigation and Safety Board Act was passed in 1989 and 
proclaimed in 1990. That legislation provided for a review 
mechanism. The board that conducted the review tabled its report 
in 1994, and the bill before us reflects these recommendations, 
those of the Moshansky commission of inquiry, and also takes 
into account various consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to deal with three specific issues: the board's 
independence, the role given to the provinces in this bill, and 
the members of the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the bill does strengthen the board's independence, and 
our party is very pleased with that. The board will deal at 
arms' length with the minister. Its independence is also 
encouraged by promoting non coercive methods to gain the 
co-operation of witnesses and to better protect the confidential 
nature of the information provided by witnesses, and by 
providing greater protection in legal proceedings, following 
statements made by witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The object of the board is to advance transportation safety by 
conducting independent investigations, identifying safety 
deficiencies, making recommendations and reporting publicly on 
investigations. These responsibilities are stated in clause 7 of 
Bill S-2. 
The idea is not necessarily to find guilty parties. Rather, it 
is to find out what happened, why and what conditions led to the 
accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board must play an inquisitive but not necessarily 
accusatory role to find out what happened. It must find out the 
facts to understand the incident and, of course, to write 
reports, which is the important element in clause 7. This will 
help to define prevention measures, so that such incidents do 
not recur. The issue is transportation safety, it is about 
saving human lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we use a means of transportation in Canada or in Quebec, we 
expect the company to be serious, reasonable and professional. 
Since we naturally trust it, it could be tempted to try to 
stretch increasingly limited financial resources a little 
further by trying to keep costs down—by cutting a few corners, as 
my mother would say, not bothering with every little detail—to 
the detriment of safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government therefore has the important legislative and 
regulatory role of ensuring that Canadians and Quebeckers have 
an efficient, effective and, above all, safe transportation 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter how many regulations are in place, accidents are still 
going to happen.  But they must be well documented; we must look 
into them, make reports and recommendations so that, when these 
accidents occur, we really know what went wrong. And I hope that 
that will not be the end of it, that these recommendations will 
not gather dust on library shelves and never be consulted again. 
It has to have a certain documentary value if prevention is to 
be served.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board's purpose is not to cast blame.  Right now, the board 
can press charges against individuals refusing to testify.  The 
issue is one of being compelled to testify.  In future, it will 
be possible to make an application to the Superior Court or the 
Federal Court in order to require an individual to disclose 
information or be found in contempt.  Our party is pleased with 
this procedure.  It is faster, less costly and more effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois are not narrow-minded.  We are not in 
the opposition for the sole purpose of criticizing and 
complaining.  When the government gets something right, we say 
so.  That is a sign of political maturity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when it is wrong, I hope we have to right to sat so, 
and I hope the government does not think it is perfect. For 
instance, in clause 19, paragraph 15.1, the government is 
proposing a faster, less expensive and more efficient process, 
that we support, because we think it is a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the independence issue, the bill confirms the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the board over investigating the causes of a 
transportation occurrence. That is stipulated in clause 14.4. 
The wording is also changed to show that the board is not an 
administrative or quasi-judicial tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not remember the exact wording and I do not have the time 
to start looking for it in the bill, but we wanted to 
decriminalize the whole process as it concerns the witnesses. If 
memory serves, we no longer talk about briefs and witnesses, but 
about people giving testimony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That might sound like a technicality, but still it 
decriminalizes the whole process and it indicates that the main 
purpose of the board is to investigate the facts and to come up 
with recommendations to once again improve safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, the government wanted to eliminate the 
quasi-judicial aspect of the proceedings of the board. We support 
this move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second remark concerns the role of the provinces. Since we 
are still in a heavily centralized federal system, it is 
unfortunate that the Canadian pact should provide for a strong 
central government and provinces that are nearly powerless. This 
is one problem. And, partly because of that, Quebec looks 
forward to the day when it has full power and does not have to 
come begging to the federal government all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the system we have to live with for the time being, and 
our party being a democratic party has said that it would keep 
looking for ways to improve the Canadian federal system from 
within. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces will now be allowed to ask the board to 
investigate accidents in transportation areas that are under 
their own jurisdiction. Paragraphe 15.1 provides that provinces can 
use the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that this provision could be interesting under the new 
approach being used with railways in Canada and especially in 
Quebec, where we have a number of railway lines. The process is 
underway. This procedure could be used in the case of so-called 
short line railroads. The board will be empowered to investigate 
accidents in transportation areas under provincial jurisdiction. 
The fact is that short line railroads are entirely under 
provincial jurisdiction when they are not involved in 
interprovincial operations.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the costs of the investigation must then be recovered 
from the provinces. Our party does hope the board will be 
reasonable in assessing the costs to the provinces. I hope it 
will not try to pass on to them the cost of the three inch thick 
carpeting which I am sure covers the floor in the board's 
offices. If, however, the costs incurred during the course of an 
investigation on a means of transportation under provincial 
jurisdiction are reasonable, I do not foresee any problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill encourages co-operation between the board's 
investigators and provincial coroners as opposed to peace 
officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My third and last point, before I conclude, deals with board 
members. 
The bill provides for the appointment of part time members and a 
full board of no more than five members. We acknowledge that 
this is bound to make the board more cost efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is another case of bouquets and brickbats. We must 
raise an issue that the government really fails to understand or 
refuses to accept. When the Liberals were in the opposition, 
under the Conservatives, they took issue with the many partisan 
appointments made by Prime Minister Mulroney, as can be seen in 
<I>Hansard</I> for the years 1984 to 1993, at which point the Liberals 
came to power. When they formed the opposition, the Liberals 
kept on lambasting Prime Minister Mulroney and his Tory 
government for their partisan appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, the Liberals were voted in, but the practice was 
maintained. Today, it is alive and well. Our party would have 
hoped that with Bill S-2 the government would have shown an 
openness and transparency it has not shown since 1993. We would 
have liked to see an open appointment process under which 
board's members would be chosen for their skills and expertise, 
and not for being a member of the Liberal Party of Canada or a 
candidate in a general election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is well aware of how the government rewarded 
the Liberal candidates who ran against us unsuccessfully in the 
Quebec City area. I remember a lady by the name of Margo 
Brousseau, who ran in 1993 for the Liberal Party in Louis-Hébert. 
Shortly after her defeat to my former colleague, Philippe Paré, 
Mrs. Brousseau was appointed to the board of directors of the 
port of Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know also that in the last election Jacques Portelance, a 
councillor in the municipality of Charlesbourg, was defeated by 
my colleague from Charlesbourg. A few months ago, he was 
appointed to the board of directors of the port of Quebec City. 
I have nothing against Mr. Portelance. And my colleague from 
Argenteuil—Papineau is telling me that Stéphane Hébert was also a 
Liberal candidate who was rewarded by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should have used this bill to say “Enough is 
enough”, as Reform members like to say. It should have taken the 
opportunity to provide for transparency in the appointment 
process. But no, the partisan appointment process lives on.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone will find some benefit in my last comment on the issue. 
The Liberals are continuing what the Conservatives were doing 
and now, with the Conservatives in opposition, the few 
Conservative members we see in this House, because they are 
often missing in action, starting with their former leader— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> These few Conservative members wax 
indignant, criticizing the government's partisan appointments, 
even though they did the exact same thing during their eight or 
nine years in office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This confirms what we in the Bloc said to Quebeckers in the last 
election campaign in 1993: “The Liberals and the Conservatives 
are exactly the same, except that they throw the ball at each 
other”. When one party is in office, the other complains and 
vice versa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois are of one mind in this regard: Since 
we field candidates only in Quebec, we know that we were elected 
to represent Quebec's interests. What we ask for is a 
transparent process. We have no one to reward for contributing 
to our election fund. We want the government to appoint the most 
able people, regardless of gender, origin or academic 
background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, this bill makes various small administrative 
changes resulting from the experiences of the last few years. We 
think it is normal to make such administrative changes and, as I 
mentioned earlier, we believe the board plays an important and 
essential role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good thing that there will be more emphasis on the 
identification of safety violations. It is a good thing that the 
board will use collaboration and rely on information provided in 
all frankness and confidence to improve its investigative 
method. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are happy that, through this bill, the board will confirm 
that it is determined to identify circumstances surrounding the 
loss of lives in order to promote security, and not to determine 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is a clarification that needs to be made. 
The issue is not to know who is responsible, but to try to 
understand what happened, especially if lives were lost, and to 
make sure that it does not happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A country's transportation system depends essentially on the 
degree of confidence. People will prefer one means of 
transportation over another if they are confident, if they think 
safety rules are observed and if they believe they are in an 
environment that is safe and sound for themselves and their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that problems will arise if people in Quebec and in 
Canada lose confidence in one means of transportation or 
another. We have an example of that right now. Air traffic 
controllers are presently negotiating with Nav Canada. I do not 
want to sound alarmist, but I hope that the safety of air 
passengers is not threatened by these negotiations. 
We know there are pressure tactics, we know there are obstacles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nav Canada—and this was confirmed by the Auditor General of 
Canada, Mr. Desautels—was literally given the air traffic 
control system in Canada. I think it would be in Nav Canada's 
best interest to sit down at the bargaining table with its 
employees, the air traffic controllers, and to find a way to 
settle this collective agreement. It is crucial to the safety of 
Canada's air transport system as well as to the confidence we 
have in this system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat what I said at the beginning of my speech: We support 
Bill S-2 and our party will co-operate with the government should 
it decide to proceed with second and third reading of this bill 
this morning so it can be passed before the summer recess. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, back in 
1989 the Conservative government originally introduced the safety 
board act and we opposed it.  It was fundamentally flawed then 
and it is fundamentally flawed now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us is to amend the act but does nothing to 
address the deficiencies in the Transportation Safety Board. The 
main idea underlying this act is supportable in principle.  In 
1989 this act brought a number of federal bodies responsible for 
investigating transportation safety under the same roof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Conservative government had wanted to, it could have 
streamlined these operations, increased efficiency and saved 
money for the taxpayers without sacrificing public.  Instead this 
act created a seriously deficient Transportation Safety Board, a 
board that was and still is unable to fulfil its mandate to 
safeguard the lives of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year there were 2,159 train, marine, air and pipeline 
accidents reported in Canada. This is just the number of reported 
accidents and does not include any that went unreported.  These 
accidents resulted in 127 deaths.  Yet the safety board's 
nationwide investigative staff only consists of 135 people. These 
135 people, field investigators, supervisors, laboratory 
personnel, forensic investigators have to cover all the accidents 
that occur in Canada.  No wonder the safety board is plagued with 
a backlog. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its annual report the board states its intention to reduce 
the amount of time it spends on each case so that it can reduce 
its backlog. Think about that.  They are going to spend less time 
on each case so they can cut down the backlog. An investigation 
into an accident is not something that can be rushed.  It is a 
matter of public safety and warrants a complete and thorough 
investigation, not a rush job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has left the Transportation Safety Board 
understaffed and underfunded so much that the dedicated public 
servants who work there have little choice but to cope as they 
are doing.  It should not be this way.  This organization is 
supposed to advance transportation safety in Canada.  It is what 
Canadians rely on to protect them and their environment from 
accidents on the rails and waterways and in the the skies and the 
pipelines of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians rely on the Transportation Safety Board but its 
resources are spread too thin.  It was a good idea to streamline 
safety investigations under one roof, but for it to work we have 
to give the board the resources it needs to fulfil such a broad 
mandate.  By nickeling and diming the Transportation Safety Board 
the government is putting the health and safety of Canadians at 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not something we can afford to cut corners on, but that 
is just what is happening.  Apparently the government would 
rather save money than lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately the original act included a clause requiring a 
review of the Transportation Safety Board.  This review was 
completed in 1994. By then we had a new government.  The Liberals 
had replaced the Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have had a chance to fix the problems with the 
Transportation Safety Board to make a meaningful investment in 
transportation safety but they have chosen not to.  They are just 
as indifferent to the health and safety of Canadians as their 
Conservative predecessors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the Liberals have given us the bill before us today, 
Bill S-2. Not only does this bill not deal with the deficiencies 
of the Transportation Safety Board, it actually makes them worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present the board consists of four members.  One of the 
amendments that the Liberals are proposing would allow them to 
turn some of these appointments from full time into part time 
positions.  We are led to believe that this is a good thing 
because they will be able to spread themselves a lot further. I 
am sceptical.  I am concerned that the board will have even fewer 
working hours to deal with the many important issues it is 
mandated to investigate.  This is a big step in the wrong 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few good amendments in this bill, but on the whole 
it makes a bad act even worse.  One of the good amendments which 
I will touch on briefly is the extension of the privacy 
protections for those who give information to board 
investigators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an experienced labour activist I know the kind of pressure 
and intimidation employers are capable of using against workers. 
If employees have information that is of use to the safety board 
but may be damaging to their employer, they must be free to give 
this information.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, they might not co-operate with investigators if they 
are afraid for their jobs and families.  Thus it is vitally 
important that testimony given to the safety investigators be 
held in the strictest of confidence.  This is necessary so that 
witnesses can be candid with investigators without fear of 
retribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The extension of confidentiality in the investigative process is 
a good amendment.  It gives workers the freedom to co-operate 
with safety board investigators and protects them.  It is 
surprising to see such an amendment in a Senate bill.  That place 
is hardly an institution known for protecting workers.  It has 
historically played the role of advocate for the privileged few. 
Not that the privileged few have ever needed this protection with 
the Liberal and the Conservatives in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even John A. Macdonald acknowledged the other house's role as a 
defender of the privileged when he said a larger qualification 
should be necessary for membership of the upper house in order to 
represent the principle of property.  The rights of the minority 
must be protected and the rich are always fewer in number than 
the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment protecting workers is quite out of character for 
that other house. In the context of the rest of the bill this one 
amendment is an anomaly.  The amendments to this bill that I most 
strongly object to are the ones that reduce the independence and 
public accountability of the board.  These are much more in 
character for that unelected and unaccountable institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the auditor general, this transportation safety board is 
expected to be independent of political and outside influences. 
That is the whole point.  It is supposed to provide an 
independent neutral perspective on safety issues in Canada. 
Everyone acknowledges this.  Yet the safety board act includes a 
ridiculous provision allowing ministers and other interested 
parties to review draft copies of the board's annual report and 
submit comments on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a glaring contradiction.  What this does is allow 
parties with vested interests in the board's reports to attempt 
to influence these reports to their advantage. Even if the board 
members try their best to be neutral they will be undoubtedly 
influenced to some degree by these outside submissions. This is 
especially true in the case of submissions by ministers since the 
board members are appointed by the government.  Thus the safety 
board is not independent like it should be.  It is subject to 
undue political influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comprising the board's independence and neutrality in this way 
is scandalous.  It risks the health and safety of Canadians for 
the sake of politics.  The safety board must be free of outside 
influences so it can focus exclusively on public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does this bill before us today not resolve the board's 
independence problem, it makes the problem's magnitude 
much worse.  At least now when private interests comment to the 
board about the draft reports these comments are not secret.  At 
least the public has a chance to scrutinize these comments and 
see how the board is being influenced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would make these submissions secret. Why is this?  Why 
do the Liberals in the Senate not want the public to know what 
people are saying to the transportation safety board?  It looks 
like they do not want Canadians to know what is going on at the 
board. They are covering it with a shroud of secrecy.  It is bad 
enough that the current act allows private interests to influence 
the safety board.  Now the Liberals are trying to hide this from 
the Canadian people.  It is deceptive. It is patronizing.  It is 
anti-democratic.  It shows how out of touch the Liberals are with 
ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am forced to wonder what the Liberals are trying to hide.  If 
these private submissions they are trying to hide were not unduly 
influencing the safety board there would be no reason to hide 
them.  By placing this shroud over the safety board they are 
shattering the illusion of independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians expect the transportation safety board to be looking 
out for them so that when they travel for business or for 
pleasure they can feel safe.  That is why they need a safety 
board that is independent, neutral and adequately funded.  It 
must be adequately funded so it has the resources to properly 
carry out its mandate.  It must be independent so it can focus on 
public safety without undue political or private influences 
diverting it from its purpose.  To deny the board these essential 
necessities does a great disservice to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated, there are beneficial aspects of the bill.  We 
will be in a corner today weighing the benefits being enacted 
before the summer or delaying the bill with the hope of trying to 
convince the Liberals of the changes in the fall.  It is apparent 
they have a majority and I am not convinced that delaying the 
bill will result in any changes but just a stalling of the 
inevitable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to give my views on Bill S-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been provided with a book on this bill which we have 
reviewed as best we could.  We have contacted as many people as 
we could, including officials of the transportation safety board 
to find out their views on it.  As far as we could tell there 
seemed to be consensus for the passing of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government wants to move it through the system and 
avoid the transport committee.  It will require unanimous consent 
on that.  I am going to withhold my consent on that because this 
is the second major transportation bill to go through the 
government.  As members of the transportation committee we have 
been denied access to witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Bill C-9, a much more profound bill with more 
impact, I moved a motion to have witnesses heard but I was 
overruled by the committee so we never heard witnesses opposed to 
Bill C-9.  There is the same effort with Bill S-2 to avoid 
allowing witnesses to make presentations.  We are only allowed to 
hear the people in support of the bill while we are not allowed 
to hear the people opposed to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill C-9 went to Senate after we passed it in the House, 
the senators had witnesses in their senate committee, and many 
people opposed it.  We were denied access to those presentations. 
I feel very strongly that we were sent here to serve the people. 
We were put on the transport committee to help make decisions and 
proper amendments.  If we are not allowed to hear both sides of 
the story but are only allowed to hear the government side, we 
are not equipped or able to make intelligent decisions. I will be 
opposing unanimous consent on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really sorry with Bill C-9 that I did not push harder for 
witnesses to be heard.  I did make the motion and I was overruled 
but I feel now that I should have done more.  I am not going to 
make that mistake again.  I want to hear both sides of the story, 
not just one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that effort we contacted officials of the transportation 
safety board.  They are supportive of this bill.  We asked them 
several months ago and then asked them again yesterday.  They 
feel there are some positive changes here which they want to see 
go ahead.  However, we have not heard the other side of the story 
from the people affected, and a lot of people will be affected by 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason to send it to committee and to call witnesses is 
that the government strangely enough moved an amendment in the 
bill that was passed but it now wants to withdraw that amendment. 
I do not have a satisfactory explanation of what that was all 
about.  Why did the government move the amendment in the first 
place?  Who was affected by it? I think air traffic controllers, 
perhaps pilots and a lot of people would be affected by that 
amendment.  Now the government wants the amendment withdrawn with 
no explanation, no hearings and no witnesses.  That is another 
reason to make this bill go to committee and to hear all sides of 
the story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is a good bill it will pass committee.  I pledge my total 
support to see that it goes through as quickly as possible but I 
do want it to go to committee.  If we allow this bill to go 
through without first going through committee and hearing 
witnesses, it will be the second transport bill this happens to. 
It will be the same as Bill C-9 where we were not allowed to hear 
from witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 was a much more profound bill with more impact. A lot 
of people were against it and we were not allowed to hear from 
any of them.  The only people we heard from are those we reached 
out to and contacted ourselves.  We did not have an open 
committee or testimony from people who were affected.  That same 
thing will happen with Bill S-2 if we allow it go through via the 
speedy process which is going through the House without going to 
committee. We will be voting against unanimous approval to 
expedite this bill through the system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
for thousands of years the Ottawa River was the primary 
transportation route to the Canadian interior.  Long before the 
arrival of the white man, our aboriginal people understood its 
importance.  In fact, the Algonquins controlled the river for 
many years and exacted tolls from those using it.  It is likely 
that Etienne Brûlé was the first European to travel the river in 
1610, followed by Samuel de Champlain in 1613. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today a group of individuals no less visionary than our 
aboriginal peoples and the early explorers is seeking to open up 
the Ottawa River to navigation from Lake Temiskaming to the St. 
Lawrence.  Two phases which open the upper reaches of the river 
have already been completed by the Ottawa River Navigable 
Waterway Corporation.  The final phase between the Chaudière 
Falls and Lac Deschênes is the only stretch of the river that 
remains to be opened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is tremendous potential for jobs and economic development 
along the Ottawa River.  I would like to urge the federal 
government to work with this non-profit corporation to initiate a 
feasibility study to determine the economic costs and benefits of 
constructing a bypass system or a lock system to permit the 
navigation of small craft on the Ottawa River.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby—Ajax, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Brooklin Spring Fair, initiated in 1911 and held the first 
weekend in June, holds very special significance for the historic 
village of Brooklin in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditional events that are held over four days form the 
backbone of the fair.  On Thursday exhibits are placed in the 
arena to be judged in the home craft section.  Main events 
include a children's pony show, opening ceremonies and the 
ambassador of the fair competition.  Friday unleashes the 
excitement of the midway for children's day, followed by the roar 
of the truck and tractor pull.  Saturday features a parade, horse 
shows, livestock competitions and an action packed demolition 
derby.  The final day of the fair incorporates the sheep show, 
car show and harness horse racing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remarkable success and longevity of the Brooklin Spring Fair 
can be attributed to the effort and dedication of many 
individuals.  The variety of the events displayed at the fair 
ensures a bright future for one of Canada's oldest fairs.

by saying “This court decision goes to the very question of

publics affairs”.  With the provincial government's hands tied 
and the federal government's unwillingness to take 
responsibility, combined with the Supreme Court of Canada's 
activist approach, a solution does not appear to be close at 
hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbians must insist that the federal government 
accept its legal responsibility and the cost of reaching a 
permanent solution with all B.C. aboriginal people and, if

</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent ruling of the CRTC calls for an increase in 
Canadian content on Canada's radio stations, despite the fact 
that both the Canadian people and the radio industry oppose any 
such changes.  Poll after poll indicates that Canadians are happy 
with 20% to 25% Canadian content on radio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the CRTC decide to do?  It raised the level to 35%, 
despite the fact that broadcasters are already having a hard time 
finding Canadian programming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to question the chair of the CRTC on this 
issue.  Her answers were vague and hidden behind cultural 
objectives that the Liberals want to force upon the Canadian 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that Canadians are masters of their own homes 
and are quite capable of making their own decisions.  Therefore, 
I call upon the CRTC to reconsider its decision.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If I correctly understood what the minister was saying about his

be modernized and adapted to contemporary reality.

Mr. Speaker, three weeks ago the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
slammed the door on Nova Scotia fisheries workers by not granting 
a single tonne of the 28,000 northern shrimp quota to any of the 
four Nova Scotia community proposals. According to scientific 
advice from DFO, the minister is free to allocate an additional 
7,000 tonnes of shrimp quota.

quota to the four Nova Scotia proposals?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, several weeks ago we heard the minister say that

simply does not understand or he is not willing to admit that a 
substantial portion of that shrimp quota is going to Nova Scotia 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the second aspect of his remarks that fish come 
first, I simply ask him, can we have fishermen if we do not have 
fish?  The answer is no.  Can we have fishing communities if we 
do not have fish?  The answer is no.  I suggest it is time he and

</I></B></P><P align=left>If leadership means bringing people to the table when they did 
not want to consider any such issues, well then that is 
leadership. The minister brought his colleagues from across the

my question is for the minister of national revenue.  Yesterday 
the government brought in legislation to create the Canada 
customs and revenue agency.  If there ever were a bureaucratic 
blunder looking for self-justification, it is this proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister of national revenue prepared to reconsider this 
matter, given the fact that the provinces have not agreed and 
that a lot of the initial justifications for this agency simply 
have not manifested themselves?

<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue,

wrong.  In fact with five provinces including British Columbia we 
have working groups to look at areas where we can work in 
co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not take a rocket scientist to understand that there is 
only one taxpayer.  If we in the country can get to having a 
single tax administration we would all be better off.  With one 
stop shopping, a single window administration, we will better off 
as Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the origin of this agency had to do with the 
government's intention to harmonize the GST and to envision this 
supertax agency that would reach down and do all the taxing for 
all levels of government.  A working group does not make a 
provincial agreement to participate in these agencies and the 
government is being premature in proceeding with this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of proceeding without the original justification, why 
does the minister not scrap the agency and the GST while he is at 
it and he will have no justification whatsoever for proceeding 
with this agency? 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should know that we 
already do a lot of work for the provinces.  In fact we collect 
50% for certain provinces and up to 87% of their taxes.  We have 
a very good established relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will create an opportunity to even advance that for 
provincial participation.  Is the hon. member against provincial 
participation?  The provinces have been asking for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agency will include the provinces.  That is good for Canada 
and that is good for the provinces.  It will provide a better

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PENSION BENEFITS STANDARDS ACT, 1985 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK165">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill S-3, an 
act to amend the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 and the 
Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act, be 
read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I very much 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to Bill S-3 today at third 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a well considered and concrete example of how we 
are dealing federally with our regulated private pension plans. 
We are updating the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985, or the 
PBSA as it is often called. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These reforms are long overdue.  This legislation governs the 
private pensions plans in the sectors that are subject to federal 
jurisdiction, including banking, interprovincial transportation 
and telecommunications.  These plans are administered by the 
Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, or OSFI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of Canada's 16,000 pension plans about 1,100 are covered by the 
PBSA.  They represent approximately $45 billion or 10% of the 
entire asset value of all private pension plans in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the number of seniors in Canada growing so rapidly I assure 
the House that sound, secure pensions are and continue to be a 
priority of this government.  Our colleagues know that over the 
past two years we have embarked on a dramatic reform of the 
public component of our national pension system, including 
changes long overdue in the Canada pension plan.  If we had not 
made these changes, in 20 years there would have been real 
problems and we would not have the type of secure retirement that 
Canadians deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PBSA has not been materially revised since it came into 
force in 1987.  This is in contrast to the financial institutions 
legislation where the supervisory and credential systems were 
significantly strengthened, first in 1992, then in 1995 and again 
in 1997.  There is no question that the PBSA needs to be updated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While most federally regulated pension plans are fully funded, 
some pension plans have come under financial pressure as a result 
of demographic and economic factors.  These include an aging 
workforce.  They can also come about from corporate downsizing. 
Those are two factors which make pension funding relatively more 
expensive for employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this environment there have been solvency concerns regarding 
some plans, while others have wound up without sufficient assets 
to pay all of the benefits that were promised.  In these 
situations the employer, whether a single employer or an industry 
group, experienced economic difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many pension plans made substantial improvements to pension 
benefits in the 1980s with the expectation that employers would 
always be able to fund them.  This also added to the challenges. 
In some cases insufficient contributions were made to fund these 
improvements.  As these problems emerged it became clear that the 
current credential and supervisory framework is not always 
equipped to deal with problem plans.  The range of powers and 
regulatory components needed were just not there.  Bill S-3 is 
our effort to meet these challenges.  Under this legislation the 
federal government and the superintendent of OSFI will have the 
necessary powers and tools to work with plans that are 
experiencing problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures in Bill S-3 flow from a series of basic principles 
outlined in our July 1996 white paper.  These principles are that 
private pension plans be supervised for the benefit of members, 
retirees and other beneficiaries, that the pension regulatory and 
supervisory framework should contain the incentives and 
safeguards necessary to reduce the possibility that pension 
promises might not be met, and to provide for early intervention 
and resolution of pension plans that are experiencing difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Outside supervision cannot and will not be expected to guarantee 
that pension promises will always be met, nor can it be a 
substitute for good governance of plans by administrators.  After 
all, these plans are governed by the trustees who are appointed 
by the workers and by the companies themselves.  Regulation and 
supervision must be cost effective.  Regulatory framework for 
pension plans should not impose undue costs on existing plans or 
unduly inhibit the creation of new plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of private pension plans should receive adequate and 
timely information from the administrator concerning the precise 
financial condition of the plan that person is under. 
There must be appropriate accountability and transparency in the 
supervisory process itself.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures in this bill are as a result of a very broad 
consultation process.  In drafting this legislation the comments 
received on the initial proposals that were contained in the 
white paper were considered and the appropriate amendments were 
made.  Provincial ministers responsible for the supervision of 
provincial pension plans were also invited to comment and there 
was ongoing consultation among pension supervisors to the CAPSA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention, too, that other proposals in the white paper 
which have not been addressed in this legislation will be 
introduced later through regulation.  Areas such as additional 
disclosure requirements and funding rules are already dealt with 
through regulations and this approach will continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other cases, such as planned governance and investments, the 
government believes that it is more appropriate to develop best 
practices.  We recognize that the size and other attributes of 
individual pension plans will affect government structures, 
government practices and investment strategies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considerable additional consultation will take place prior to 
the implementation of these regulations and guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, on behalf of the government, I would like to thank 
the Senate, the many industry participants and other stakeholders 
who provided such constructive and insightful co-operation and 
advice in bringing this legislation forward and in working with 
us in such a constructive way to deal with the precise problems 
that we faced to fashion legislation which is more responsive to 
the concerns that all of us have, which is to maintain secure and 
dignified retirements for our pensioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have highlighted the important issues dealt with in this 
legislation.  All of us believe that the stability of Canada's 
private pension regime will be enhanced for the benefit of its 
plan members.  We are confident of that.  I certainly encourage 
all colleagues in this House to give speedy passage to this bill 
and I thank them for the co-operative approaches which they have 
taken in working with us, with pensioners and with the regulators 
to provide better legislation for Canada's pension community.

to have the privilege to stand in the House of Commons, Canada's 
highest court, we hope.  We hope that it would take precedence 
over the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a responsibility in standing here.  Today I 
represent not only the people of Canada, not only the people of 
my riding, but also I represent, hopefully, the interests of 
pensioners or potential pensioners in private plans around the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give a statement that will put you at ease, Mr. 
Speaker.  That is, I am not going to use more than about 30 
seconds to talk about the Senate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People out in the real world who are listening to this debate 
are probably not too aware of the fact that bills which initiate 
in the House of Commons begin with the letter <I>C</I>.  This one 
happens to begin with the letter <I>S</I>, which means it started 
in the Senate.  Of course we have reasons to believe that there 
are some untoward government motivations to quickly pass it in 
the Senate and then bring it here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe very strongly in the Reform Party that that is 
backwards.  Bills of this importance should definitely be 
initiated by the elected members of our parliamentary system and 
not by those who are appointed by political patronage 
connections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is called S-3.  That means it started in the Senate. 
With that comment about the Senate, I am going to get on to some 
of the things which are particularly interesting to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw your attention, Mr. Speaker, and the attention of 
all of the Liberals who are pushing this legislation through and 
certainly the attention of Canadians to a very important aspect 
of Bill S-3.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary has already outlined some of the 
reasons for this bill.  I have to admit there are many things in 
this bill we think are commendable and should be proceeded with. 
However, there are also some extremely odious components.  As a 
member of the official opposition it is my duty and 
responsibility to draw those to everyone's attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 9.(2) in the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 is 
fraught with a bit of a problem.  It states that if an actuarial 
report filed under this section indicates that there is a surplus 
in a private pension fund, in other words if there is more money 
in the fund than what is needed to meet the obligations under a 
fixed benefit plan, that surplus may be refunded to the employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 9.(2) gives some conditions as to when, where and under 
what conditions the employer can get the money back.  One of them 
is that the superintendent must consent to the refund. I will 
come back to this in a few seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also states that an employer has a claim to the surplus or 
part of it after being notified of the employer's proposal for a 
refund of that surplus or part of it if at least two-thirds of 
the persons in the different categories consent to it.  If only 
50% consent to it then the superintendent will appoint an 
arbitrator and will judge the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that not raise a red flag?  I know Liberals love red. There 
is a member across right now dressed in red and I think it looks 
great.  We are familiar with the infamous red book.  So red and 
Liberal sort of go together.  In this case, however, I hope they 
see red.  Red is also a warning.  In traffic it means we need to 
stop.  It is a warning for danger.  Whenever there is extreme 
danger the colour red is used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I want to talk about.  It so happens that section 
9.(2) could directly impact on the personal holdings of the 
Minister of Finance.  For at least a decade there has been a 
controversy about actuarial surpluses in private 
employer-employee pension plans, a situation that rarely occurred 
before the mid-1980s.  Is the employer entitled to a surplus or 
are the workers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue was brought to a head in 1986 when Conrad Black's 
Dominion stores took $63 million from three employee pension 
plans and were subsequently forced by Ontario's supreme court to 
return the funds.  At that time a moratorium was put on all 
surpluses regulated by the province of Ontario and although this 
has been relaxed somewhat, provincial rules for the division of 
surpluses are still very stringent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of questions that need to be answered about 
the minister's involvement in this legislation before the Reform 
Party can approve it and certainly before the Liberals should be 
passing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance acquired Canada Steamship Lines in 1981. 
The Pension Fund Society of Canada Steamship Lines based on 
Montreal has had one of these defined benefit pension plans for 
its employees since 1940.  The last actuarial evaluation of the 
plan on which we have information was done in December 1995 by A. 
Foster Higgins & Co.  However, according to the Pension Fund 
Society's newsletters we know that the plan's assets have enjoyed 
spectacular growth in recent years, for example 21% in 1995, 20% 
in 1996 and 17% in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The society's obligation to the beneficiaries was $84 million in 
1997.  However, net assets in the plan were $252 million and the 
total surplus was valued $142 million in that year. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the present rules of the superintendent of financial 
institutions the employer, in this case the minister, is eligible 
to claim $118 million in surplus from this pension fund.  He 
would probably not get all of it because he would have to strike 
a deal to give a part of it to pensioners in order to persuade at 
least 50% of them to agree to give him the surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No contributions have been made to the plan by the employer 
since December 31, 1984 and by employees since December 31, 1991. 
There were 823 beneficiaries in 1996, after 25 had passed away in 
that year, which included 127 active employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan is committed to indexing benefits to 80% of inflation. 
Beneficiaries received an increase of 2% in 1996, representing 
90% of inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very timely for the Minister of Finance that the act be 
passed now.  It was first introduced by the Minister of Industry 
in the House in March, 1997, then in the Senate by Senator 
Alisdair Graham last fall with a few minor changes.  Under the 
bill if two-thirds of beneficiaries vote to release the surplus 
funds the employer can have them provided also that the 
superintendent of financial institutions agrees.  If less than 
two-thirds but more than half agree, the matter must go to 
binding arbitration.  The arbitrator is chosen by the 
superintendent if the parties cannot agree on a choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This information begs a number of important questions.  The 
official opposition must receive adequate answers to them before 
approving this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister in a general conflict of interest when a bill 
from which he might benefit so significantly is passed under his 
general authority, a bill that receives all necessary support and 
impetus from his office?  We have searched for an answer to this 
important question for some time.  We spoke to ethics counsellor 
Howard Wilson January 30 about the minister's involvement with 
this legislation and he answered that the Canada Steamship Line's 
pension fund is incorporated under the Pension Fund Societies Act 
under the auspices of the Department of Industry and will not 
therefore be directly affected by the Pension Benefit Standards 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor confirmed to us that the surplus in CSL's 
plan is about $140 million.  However, we have obtained the 1996 
financial statements for Canada Steamship Lines Pension Fund 
Society and a number of newsletters from the society.  The 
newsletters comment often on the passage of the Pension Benefits 
Standards Act, 1985 as if it will be directly relevant to the 
surplus in their plan.  The financial statements from 1996 
actually state that the plan is registered under the Pension 
Benefits Standards Act, 1985 and the registration number is 
55006. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also consulted with the Department of Industry and it 
has found a registration for the pension fund under the Pension 
Fund Societies Act.  It is registered under both, while the 
ethics counsellor is under the impression that it is registered 
under one act only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like an answer to our second question.  Is Mr. Martin's 
pension plan still registered under the— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member knows he 
cannot refer to members of this House by name.  I know he would 
not want to make that mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  I know that, Mr. Speaker.  I apologize.  The 
notes have his name and I guess I was not paying close attention 
to what I was reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the pension plan still registered under the Pension Benefits 
Standards Act, 1985?  If it is, it means that the Canada 
Steamship Lines pension fund will be directly affected by this 
legislation.  Does this put the minister in conflict of interest? 
That is a very important question that needs an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third question the Reform Party would like to have answered 
is a more important one.  Why did the ethics counsellor have 
incorrect information about the registration of this pension 
fund.  Who told him that the pension fund was not registered 
under the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 currently before 
this House but only under the Pension Fund Societies Act?  How 
did the misinformation come to him?  Did it make its way from the 
minister's office?  Was it an honest mistake or does it represent 
an attempt to mislead the ethics counsellor into thinking that 
the minister would not be directly affected by the act now before 
this House and cause the ethics counsellor to defend the minister 
when perhaps he should be warning him? 
We have made an access to information request to Mr. Wilson's 
office on this issue but we were refused any information he has 
on his file.  We appealed this decision to the information 
commissioner but we think it is strange that all information 
would be denied us in a way directly contrary to the spirit of 
the conflict of interest and post-employment code for public 
office holders approved by the Liberal government in June 1994.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to read clause 3.2 of the code: “Public office holders 
have an obligation to perform their official duties and arrange 
their private affairs in a manner that will bear the closest 
public scrutiny, an obligation that is not fully discharged by 
simply acting within the law”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that the ethics counsellor does not want the public 
to have any insight into this matter, much less the closest 
public scrutiny the code requires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We regard this as a serious issue and we encourage the ethics 
counsellor to lay before the public the documents that will bear 
the level of public scrutiny required in the code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Continuing with what the ethics counsellor told us, he then said 
that the minister has doubly distanced himself from the passage 
of the bill because he left all ministerial work concerning the 
bill to the Secretary of State for International Financial 
Institutions.  Combined with the suggestion that the bill would 
not impact the CSL Pension Fund Society, this was a kind of 
double indemnity against conflict of interest in the ethics 
counsellor's eyes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would remind the House that the Secretary of State 
for International Financial Institutions is not an independent 
minister.  The present secretary of state was appointed by 
cabinet proclamation pursuant to section 11 of the Ministries and 
Ministers of State Act which was first passed by the Trudeau 
government in 1970.  Section 11 of that act tells us that the 
duty of the minister is to assist any minister or ministers as 
having responsibility for any department and states that the 
secretary of state will make use of the services and facilities 
of the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A copy of the proclamation notice from the June 25, 1997 
<I>Gazette</I> states that the present secretary of state was 
appointed pursuant to section 11 and it details the duties to 
assist the Minister of Finance in carrying out his 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary of state clearly takes his direction from the 
Minister of Finance and his job is to follow his orders.  This 
looks like a suspiciously close relationship and it gives rise to 
the follow question.  Since the minister's pension fund will be 
directly affected by this act and since the minister guiding it 
through the legislative process cannot rightly be called 
independent, is the Minister of Finance therefore in a conflict 
of interest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are suspicious about the secretary of state's independence 
for a particular reason.  As I stated earlier, the Minister of 
Industry first introduced this bill into the House a year ago. 
This gives rise to yet another question.  Presumably the Minister 
of Industry first introduced Bill S-3 because he bears 
responsibility for the Pension Fund Societies Act, an act that is 
separate from the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985.  Why did 
the Minister of Industry then not reintroduce this act in this 
parliament?  Why was it transferred from the Minister of Industry 
to the secretary of state, a junior minister under the direct 
control and supervision of the Minister of Finance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We become even more suspicious when we note that in section 9 of 
the act now in question the rules for granting a surplus to an 
employer are considerably relaxed.  There is no division formula 
in the present act.  There is no vote required in the present 
regulations.  We are not opposed to entrenching a formula in 
legislation, but in practice in the pension fund industry most 
companies hold a vote and receive the agreement of up to 100% of 
pensioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some examples.  Last July active and retired employees 
of Jenisys Engineered Products voted 95% to divide a surplus. In 
December 1997 Unisys employees voted 99% in favour of a division 
of a pension fund surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since July 1990 regulation 10 of the Ontario pension benefits 
act has stipulated that for ongoing plans a plan sponsor must 
obtain 100% agreement of all members.  Later that was changed to 
90%, which is the current requirement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario's legislation may be restrictive but the idea that there 
would be a vote requiring the approval of just two-thirds of 
employees, and if between one-half and two-thirds of employees 
voted for the change it would go to an arbitrator who would make 
a final decision is an innovation in the industry.  Only the 
provinces of B.C. and Quebec allow for mandatory arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act will make the surplus much more accessible to the 
minister. The present role of the superintendent under the 
Pension Benefits Standards Act is to ensure the funded status of 
the plan that it remain solvent if any surplus is given.  His 
role is not to hand out surpluses to employers or employees; the 
courts decide who gets any surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the Pension Benefits Standards Act in Bill S-3 
actually broaden the role of the superintendent in that he must 
appoint an arbitrator if 50% of employees agree, a role he did 
not have before.  The superintendent's office tells us that in 
the situation of an ongoing pension plan, like the minister's, it 
is very unlikely that the employer would get anything under the 
present act.  The employer might try to approach employees for 
their agreement, but even if there is a vote the superintendent 
will still require that the courts give their blessing to any 
distribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a plan is terminating, that is winding up, the superintendent 
makes a strictly legal decision based on the plan documents.  If 
the plan itself is silent on who gets the surplus, it again ends 
up in the courts.  In the minister's case where his company's 
plan is ongoing, the case would normally have gone to the courts. 
This act removes the issue from the courts and politicizes it to 
the point where only half the employees have to agree before the 
matter goes to an arbitrator.  And get this:  the arbitrator is 
appointed by the superintendent who in turn is appointed by the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is so different from the norm that it begs two further 
obvious questions.  The present superintendent, John Palmer, was 
himself appointed by the minister in September 1994.  He 
presumably hopes to be reappointed when the superintendent's 
seven year term expires in 2001.  The superintendent is therefore 
dependent on the minister, but the minister in turn depends on 
the superintendent to appoint an arbitrator to get the surplus. 
Is this not in itself a conflict of interest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seventh question is, at any point during which the 
legislation was being developed, did the minister have input into 
the make-up of the new surplus division formula?  Could he have 
brought his considerable authority to bear with the intent of 
relaxing the legislative requirements necessary for an employer 
to have access to his own pension fund assets? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our next concern is that the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions regulates about 1,100 private pension plans.  The 
Minister of Finance will argue that he is just one employer among 
many and that he will be treated like every other employer by 
this legislation.  We would respond by quoting from the 1996 
annual report of the superintendent released in March, in the 
section entitled “Surplus Refunds”: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general, surplus must exceed the greater of 25% of the 
liabilities of the plan or 2 times the contribution of the 
employer to the normal cost of the plan, in order to qualify for 
a refund.  Very few plans in surplus have levels of surplus above 
these thresholds. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were many other pensions plans governed by the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions which are in the same 
surplus situation, this particular circumstance might not be so 
important.  But should this act pass, the Canadian Steamship 
Lines Pension Fund Society has a surplus that could be made 
available to the minister of approximately $50 million.  To me, 
this is not small change and it would accrue to an individual 
rather than a corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An eighth question, part of which we asked through access to 
information, is how many other plans are regulated by the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions with surpluses available 
to the employer in the neighbourhood of $50 million? If there are 
such companies, is the employer an individual such as the 
minister or a corporation in which no one has individual 
benefits?  Is the minister claiming to treat himself as any other 
employer when he really belongs in a category all by himself? 
Will he receive a personal benefit from this legislation greater 
by far than almost all other employers in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This question was answered in part by an access to information 
request of April 1 which detailed for us all actuarial surpluses 
over $10 million that the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions oversees.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just 44 of the 1,100 plans that the superintendent oversees have 
surpluses over $10 million and only five of them have surpluses 
larger than $110 million.  This means that the minister's pension 
fund surplus is one of the top five in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act will provide a benefit for him that only four other 
companies in the nation can beat.  Those companies may not be 
individuals but corporations.  We cannot know for sure, but in 
all likelihood the minister is the individual in Canada who will 
benefit the most from the passage of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all intents and purposes the minister is really in a unique 
situation rather than just one more employer among many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we would like to receive the minister's personal 
assurance that he has kept out of the issue.  We note that the 
president of the pension fund society of Canada Steamship Lines 
is Mr. Gordon Black, long time employee of CSL.  Mr. Black is 
also listed on the board of directors of Canada Steamship Lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So that we might be assured that the minister is not consulting 
improperly with the president of the pension fund society who 
will look after the interests of the company in the surplus 
distribution process, we would like the minister to answer this 
question:  has the minister spoken to or met with Mr. Black for 
any reason since January 1, 1997, just before the legislation was 
first tabled?  If so, when?  What was the subject of the meeting 
or meetings? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the job of the official opposition to conduct careful 
inquiries into these matters in order to ensure that no minister 
abuses a position of trust by passing legislation that would 
augment his or her private fortune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not accusing the minister of wrongdoing.  We are simply 
doing our job by asking questions.  We are asking for full and 
complete disclosure on the part of the ethics counsellor and the 
minister himself so that the people of Canada can be fully 
satisfied as to the integrity of the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government ran on a platform of openness and 
accountability.  Yet we have had such bizarre situations that the 
code of conduct for ministers has been kept secret from us. The 
prime minister alludes to it but never ever has presented a copy 
of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have now a situation where there is a lot of question as 
to the propriety of this government actually passing this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of my speech I said that the Liberals are 
associated with the colour red.  I have raised a bunch of 
questions.  They are red flag questions and they are questions 
that demand answers. These are questions that must be answered 
before this government proceeds to ram this legislation through, 
having all its members stand up in concert at the pull of their 
strings to vote in favour of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Liberal members who want to build or create for the 
first time this reputation of integrity that is so important for 
the Canadian people.  They want to trust their government. I urge 
them to vote against this legislation.  Why not let this be the 
first bill that this government actually loses?  It comes from 
the Senate.  There is no implication of anything like confidence 
in the government or anything on this.  Let us defeat this one 
because of these unanswered questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK168"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
take a little time to go over the bill since we have not had the 
opportunity to discuss it fully as a result of the process that 
has been taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 was passed by the Senate on November 20, 1997.  The 
legislation governs private pension plans set up for employees 
working in businesses under federal jurisdiction, including 
banking and interprovincial transportation and 
telecommunications. The pensions of parliamentarians and those of 
federal public servants are not covered by this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is Bill S-3 intended to do?  It would introduce to the 
Pension Benefits Standards Act the same philosophy that governs 
the changes to the legislation governing federally chartered 
financial institutions in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overall intention of the bill is to set clear ground rules 
for housekeeping, to codify the rules on how to handle the 
controversial issue of the treatment of surplus assets in a 
pension plan, to restore better balance between the employer and 
those who benefit from the plan, to enhance the ability of the 
minister to enter into agreements with provinces to apply and 
enforce the provinces' pension legislation. There is a mandate 
for the administrator of the fund to invest the assets of the 
fund in a manner that a reasonable and prudent person would apply 
in respect of a portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we opposed to this?  All of these are good intentions 
and the roads to hell are paved with good intentions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three major reasons we oppose Bill S-3.  It entrenches 
regulations which unnecessarily bypass parliament.  S-3 promotes 
an obsession with surplus withdrawal rather than a focus on ways 
to improve the existing pension system. S-3 emanates from the 
Senate and is part of a sloppy process that abandons the role of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the regulations which unnecessarily bypass parliament. 
Section 10.1(2)(b) of Bill S-3 allows for the imposition of rigid 
arbitrary rules without consultation, truly a Henry VIII clause. 
There is no evidence that such arbitrary carte blanche is needed. 
The provision confers tremendous powers to unaccountable 
bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 10.1(2)(b) stipulates that there shall be no 
improvements in pension plans if the solvency ratio of the plan 
falls below a specified level.  The solvency ratio is defined by 
regulations.  We have a major problem with this concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the testimony of an Office of the Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions official before the Senate banking 
committee, the prescribed level would initially be set at 105%. 
This would have had a very serious impact on the take home pay of 
plan members and on the ability of trustees to improve benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our understanding that following a discussion with the 
Canadian Labour Congress and the Office of the Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions, the OSFI now intends to use a less 
stringent ratio.  Section 10.1(2)(b) allows OSFI to do this 
through order in council without having to go back to parliament. 
There is no guarantee that an unaccountable bureaucrat at some 
point will not impose a harmful solvency ratio at some time in 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens if a stringent solvency ratio is imposed?  A too 
stringent solvency test such as the 105% ratio threatens to stop 
the development of any new benefit programs in a pension plan and 
even discourages improvements to existing defined benefit plans. 
It will be virtually impossible for some private plans to become 
more attractive because this may cause short term fluctuations in 
their solvency ratio.  If similar rules were to apply to the 
purchase of homes, very few consumers could purchase a home 
unless they could use existing liquid assets to fully purchase 
the home or fully pay for any home improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these rules had been in place 30 years ago, it is hardly 
exaggerating to say that we would have had no defined plan in 
Canada.  Every time an employer based plan improved benefits, it 
had to incur a temporary solvency deficiency, which was paid up 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when the federal government is encouraging privately 
funded fully defined benefit plans, a 105% solvency ratio will 
also discourage employers to set up new plans. The Canadian 
Institute of Actuaries concurs. We are also concerned that the 
solvency test becomes in principle a model for pension 
legislation, which the provinces will adopt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why a shotgun approach when the OSFI has ample powers to place 
restrictions on poorly funded plans or on plans deemed at risk? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>OSFI may be looking for the easy way out; a lot of arbitrary 
authority but not enough staff for a fine tuned regulation. 
Hence, it is much easier for the OSFI to end its examination 
function and strap all defined private pension plans into a 
solvency ratio straitjacket, even if it freezes initiative and 
may end up killing certain plans.  At the very least, it shows a 
lack of understanding of the historical modus operandi of private 
pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are uncertain as to which problem this government is trying 
to resolve. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT34"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT34"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1245

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no solvency crisis in the private pension system. Since 
the Pension Benefits Standards Act came into force in 1987, 392 
plans terminated.  The assets were wound up and distributed. Of 
these only nine terminated in less than fully funded status. In 
most of the nine the loss of benefits to the members was minimal 
and the plans had very small membership.  In one plan only the 
members received less than 95% of the pension benefits credit. In 
that case the members received approximately 80%. The source for 
that figure is the Public Benefits Standards Act annual report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is inappropriate to undermine the ability of all plans to 
enhance pension benefits and become more attractive because of 
the exaggerated importance given by the OSFI to short term market 
fluctuations.  It is the view that prescribing any solvency ratio 
test for plan investment is probably not the right approach to 
making sure plans do not terminate in an underfunded situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 already gives OSFI wide reaching powers to force poorly 
funded plans to take whatever action is necessary to bring assets 
and liabilities in line.  There is no need for a Henry VIII 
clause that removes parliament from the equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current five year funding solvency constraint in the PBSA is 
already sufficient to limit a situation in which contributions 
and plan assets could fall short of termination liabilities.  The 
five year funding framework also provides ample guarantee that 
termination liabilities are funded over a short period. OSFI is 
taking a major policy position without any broad discussion. Even 
the U.S. has much more relaxed rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should instead make the plan sponsor liable for 
all the unfunded liabilities should the plan be terminated.  In 
the province of Ontario, for instance, an employer that 
terminates a plan has to make up for the unfunded liability and 
not just be on schedule with amortization payments as is 
currently the case at the federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This creates a self-regulatory incentive for the employer to 
follow the prudent per cent approach in making improvements to 
the plan.  The system works well.  Why not pursue this avenue at 
the federal level? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Labour Congress has said that it may be more 
important for OSFI to take action against individuals who have 
acted imprudently than to try to create a general rule governing 
plan improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An obsession with the surplus withdrawals rather than a focus on 
ways to improve the existing pension system is our second 
concern.  Bill S-3 proposes a mechanism for employees and 
employers to take the surplus out of a private pension plan 
rather than offer incentives to improve pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal assault on the Canada pension plan, old age security 
and its gutting of universality on the backs of the working poor 
are followed by this assault on the middle class, the main 
beneficiary of the private pension system.  This lack of 
legislated incentive to make things better is a hallmark of a 
mediocre management vision of the public interest.  It condemns 
an increasing number of workers and retirees to poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 should impose an outright ban on the removal of 
surpluses from ongoing plans and require the consent of plan 
members to remove surpluses in plans being wound up.  It is 
especially annoying to see the feeble position of the government 
on the surplus issue when it is proposing nothing in regard to 
inflation protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is today an urgent need for public policy to strengthen 
our public and private retirement systems.  While CN and VIA Rail 
retirees have seen their pensions lose value because of poor 
inflation protection, the CN and VIA Rail pension plans are 
approaching a surplus or are in a surplus position.  Rather than 
focusing on surplus refund, would it not be better instead to 
focus on ways to enhance the CN and VIA Rail pension plans? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has failed to move away from its obsession with 
short term bureaucratic efficiency.  It should endeavour to work 
with employers and provinces to improve pension plans rather than 
focus on ways to take the money out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 emanates from the Senate and is part of a sloppy 
process which undermines the role of parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth taking some time to talk seriously about the one 
sided and dysfunctional legislative process that bills like Bill 
S-3 are symptomatic of.  We saw it earlier this morning and we 
are seeing it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to believe in the House of Commons.  They want to 
believe that what goes on here is a process steeped in trust, 
openness and mutual respect.  They want a process that allows all 
voices to be heard, a process that is respectful of not only the 
will of the majority but the rights of the minority, and a 
process that is conducted in good faith, recognizing that there 
are people whose voices are too often excluded from the most 
critical legislative stages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not help but listen to the minister speak on this matter 
and indicate that he had heard from the Senate and from industry. 
Nowhere did he mention that the House of Commons had a chance to 
be heard from.  Nowhere did he mention that Canadians as 
individuals had a chance to be heard from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the government has made us all so captive to 
the process that there is no quarter for those indispensable 
principles of democracy.  We give up on democracy to deal with 
mountains of legislation.  While the government is sure to say it 
is a legitimate function of the Senate to deal with such a bill, 
I would hasten to say that there is no legitimacy in having an 
unelected body drafting bills that would affect the pensions of 
thousands of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no legislative vision.  It is so obsessed 
with pushing forward bill after bill that it loses sight of the 
delicate interrelations that exist between one program and the 
next.  We saw this with the changes to CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party kept calling on the government to table 
the changes to old age security as well.  We can hardly change 
one without knowing what is going to happen to the other.  Yet 
the government failed to act.  Five months later while seniors 
fret about their security the government is still tinkering with 
the old age security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lack of consultation.  Instead of inviting Canadians 
to share their voices with us the government marginalizes people 
by consulting with polling firms rather than with Canadians. Bill 
S-3 may have gone to the Senate banking committee but I would be 
overly charitable if I were to call that consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only two groups appeared before the committee.  More shocking 
than that, the government wants us to accept fundamental changes 
to these pensions in the absence of broad based consultation. 
Even though this bill affects only 10% of total pensions in 
Canada it introduces to the private sector a paradigm that may 
threaten other plans including those run by the provinces.  Would 
a government that believed in consultation not have sought out 
the voices of the people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the opposite side of the House are very comfortable 
with their slim majority.  Canadians see them forcing through 
legislation.  They see them stopping legitimate debate in the 
House and making major policy statements for the cameras rather 
than for their colleagues.  This sort of arrogance and disrespect 
for parliament is a symptom for bad legislation such as Bill S-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I was honoured to stand today on behalf of the 
member for Qu'Appelle who is our critic and who is in Sault Ste. 
Marie listening to what Canadians have to say about bank mergers. 
The government has refused to allow parliament to do its job and 
called for an all party parliamentary committee to review the 
merger.  On behalf of that member I present his words. 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill S-3 
proposes to update the Pension Benefits Standards Act, a law 
through which the federal government supervises private pension 
plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's system of retirement income has three pillars.  The 
first pillar is the basic old age security paid to all seniors 
together with the various supplements paid to low income seniors. 
The old age security benefit has come under considerable scrutiny 
lately as Canadians await the finance minister's overhaul of the 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recently as last month the finance minister attempted to push 
through reforms to the program in Bill C-36.  Bill C-36 proposed 
changes to the guaranteed income supplement that 1.5 million low 
income seniors receive.  The changes increased the clawback on 
benefits to seniors who work part time for extra money.  The PC 
Party proposed amendments at report stage of that bill to protect 
seniors who would see more of the supplement taken away from 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also proposed to change how the supplement was 
calculated thereby costing each senior a further cut of 
approximately $6 a year. 
PC Party amendments to protect seniors from these cuts were 
defeated by the Liberal government.  However the finance minister 
has now agreed to propose further legislation to rescind these 
changes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a press release of May 25 the minister admitted that these 
changes had unforeseen adverse effects on seniors benefits.  If 
it had not been for our party which brought the government's 
attention to these cuts, the proposed changes would have passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Retirement savings experts are already telling middle income 
Canadians over the age of 50 to be wary of savings in RRSPs 
because what they save now will most likely be eaten up in higher 
taxes later.  This creates a directive disincentive for Canadians 
to do what is right and to save for their own future and their 
retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second pillar consists of employment based Canada and Quebec 
pension plans.  Under the government's reform to this pillar 
Canadians will have to pay more to get less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third pillar includes retirement savings such as RRSPs and 
employer pension plans.  The government has moved to restrict 
access to RRSPs by freezing contribution limits and forcing 
seniors to mature their RRSPs two years earlier.  The legislation 
deals with other parts of the third pillar such as employer 
pension plans.  Most employer pension plans are governed by 
provincial law, but 500,000 Canadians belong to the 1,000 plans 
that fall under federal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten years ago the Progressive Conservative government overhauled 
the Pension Benefits Standards Act, the law which governs those 
plans.  Significant changes were made to the minimum standards 
that plans must meet in areas ranging from survivor benefits to 
information disclosure.  The bill before us updates that act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goals of the bill are to improve the way that the plans are 
governed, to improve Ottawa's ability to step in when plan 
administrators do not appear to be following sound financial 
practices to set up rules for the withdrawal of pension 
surpluses.  It will also allow Ottawa to enter into supervisory 
agreements with provincial regulators through the Canadian 
Association of Pension Supervisory Authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike other recent changes to our system of retirement savings 
the only parts of the bill to generate even minor controversy are 
the provisions that pertain to the withdrawal of pension 
surpluses.  Pension fund managers are concerned that the surplus 
and the wind-up provisions in the bill are weighed heavily 
against employers.  However the bill is not particularly 
controversial.  There has some controversy over the introduction 
of some government bills in the Senate, a practice which has 
fallen into disuse in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without getting into debate on Senate reform, if bills are to be 
introduced in the Senate, Bill S-3 is especially the kind of bill 
on which the Senate can do solid work before sending it on to the 
House of Commons.  This is particularly the case given the 
combination of the technical nature of the bill, the expertise of 
those on the Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce in 
area of corporate governance and the non-partisan spirit of 
co-operation with which members of this committee approach such 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To not optimize the collective skills, wisdom and experience of 
these senators is an affront to Canadian taxpayers.  We have a 
Senate and the senators on this committee have demonstrated 
prowess, ability and expertise in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind my colleagues that to not optimize this expertise would 
be denying Canadian taxpayers another level of deliberation on 
this type of important legislation.  It is an approach that we 
could use here from time to time when we look at legislation, 
especially legislation affecting areas of corporate governance 
where there is a significant amount of institutional knowledge in 
the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate banking committee has made six substantive amendments 
as a result of the testimony it heard from officials and from 
outside witnesses.  The Senate amendments further clarify the 
rules to be followed when an employer wants to withdraw from the 
pension surplus.  It struck a provision that would have given the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions the ability to decide if 
a particular allocation of a surplus was fair as the issue of 
fairness should be left to employees and employers to be settled, 
not public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also improved the process for allocating a surplus in cases 
where a company goes bankrupt or winds down.  It is very 
important that we protect individuals when a company is faced 
with the types of dramatic downsizing and corporate readjustments 
that have occurred over the past several years.  The legislation 
will help improve that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those amendments were developed by opposition and government 
members in the Senate working in the spirit of co-operation with 
the officials.  A spirit of co-operation might be something we 
should try to duplicate in the House periodically when we are 
working on legislation as important as this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ) </B>moved: 
<A NAME="LINK174">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
institute a public inquiry on the administration of the 
maximum-security penitentiary at Port-Cartier. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I speak to you today on a matter that has, 
unfortunately, taken a long time to reach the attention of this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six months ago, I moved a motion calling for a public inquiry 
into events that were occurring at the Port-Cartier detention 
centre, which is a maximum security facility and therefore under 
the jurisdiction of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six months have passed since then, and the motion has just 
resurfaced today.  This motion calling for a public inquiry is, 
in my opinion, self-evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public inquiry called for would cast light on the past 
events, which forced the guards to work under intense stress for 
some days.  I have met with mamagement, the unions and the 
workers in the detention centre on two occasions since the 
incidents, and they have told me directly that everything 
possible would be done to try to find solutions to the problem 
experienced. 
Today, all committees that were struck have presented reports 
and, fortunately, the tension appears to have dissipated 
somewhat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, however, most fortunate that management decided to take 
the bull by the horns.  Judging by the length of time it took 
for my request to be responded too, it is a good thing no lives 
were at risk.  If that had been the case, I trust that the 
government would have reacted more promptly.  This long delay 
between the events and the consideration of this motion makes me 
wonder, however.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the motion was moved the Port-Cartier penitentiary, a 
maximum security institution, was facing a crisis.  The guards, 
men and women, had worked long periods in a highly charged 
atmosphere.  They and all the personnel in the institution know 
necessarily that everyone aware of it when the inmates are up to 
something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This very tense situation could have ended in violence.  The 
inmates threatened the corrections officers and their families 
as well. 
The corrections officers know when they start working in these 
institutions that they can expect rough talk from the inmates at 
times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, patience has its limits, and when insults and 
threats are directed at those dear to us it really hurts.  A 
number of corrections officers at the time were obliged to take 
days off to distance themselves from the unhealthy atmosphere in 
the institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure any member of this House would agree to work in 
such circumstances and be treated the way guards often are in 
detention centres.  There are always ups and downs in these 
institutions.  The situation varies from one to another, 
depending on the type of inmate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I made the motion in September, calling for a public 
inquiry into the events at the Port-Cartier detention centre, the 
situation was critical.  There had been threats to the life of 
certain guards, and some inmates had been violent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took six months for the matter to be brought before the 
House.  Six months in which, fortunately, the situation 
improved, it appears. Six months in which the management of the 
institution worked with all departments, including the union and 
workers to find solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But do we have to wait for the situation to arise again before 
we intervene?  Could we not take appropriate measures now to 
make sure that all security guards, regardless of where they 
work, can do their work safely without putting their health or 
even their life in danger? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are workers in these institutions who have nervous 
breakdowns, anxiety attacks and all kinds of physical problems 
related to stress. Guards know all these problems. It is quite 
understandable. Corrections officers in maximum security 
institutions, like the one in Port-Cartier for example, have to 
deal everyday with hardened criminals who are serving a life 
sentence in most cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inmate population in institutions like the Port-Cartier and 
Donnacona penitentiaries, for example, is very similar. However, 
Port-Cartier will also receive inmates facing serious accusations 
or those who need protection from other inmates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not kid ourselves, these are tough guys who fear nothing, 
especially not a guard who is asking them to go back to their 
cell because it is late. 
These inmates are dangerous and violent when they are alone. 
Imagine having to face them as a group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violence does not stop when the door of the cell is closed. It 
often goes on inside in many different forms. That is exactly 
why penitentiaries have the infamous hole, which is feared by 
all inmates, the place where an inmate will be kept alone for a 
certain period of time, where he will have to eat and sleep 
alone with very few opportunities to get out.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An inmate is not sent to the hole because he decided to give 
flowers to his cellmate. The hole is used for rebels or for 
those who need to be protected against violence from other 
inmates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violence in penitentiaries is a reality, and immediate action 
must be taken when a difficult situation is reported. We must 
not wait for guards to lose their lives before we react. 
Otherwise, why would we put criminals behind bars if guards are 
to become the victims of their violence? If guards are killed on 
duty, I think it means that there is surely something wrong with 
the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, I think the judicial system as a whole needs to be 
scrutinized, reviewed and adjusted where appropriate. Many 
inmates who are behind bars in 1998 have done time before. They 
served a first sentence and were released on good behaviour two 
thirds of the way through their sentence. In many cases, former 
inmates quickly fell back into their old criminal habits and 
offended again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an individual of any age mercilessly takes away someone 
else's freedom or life, or significantly reduces their quality 
of life, and if the justice system finds him guilty beyond any 
reasonable doubt, it should also deny him all privileges, at 
least the freedom he has taken away from innocent victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully understand that one is innocent until proven guilty. I 
agree this is a very important concept. However, I am not clear 
about how specific the evidence to the contrary must be. 
Must one have witnessed the crime in order to be able to give 
proof or will rational analysis be sufficient? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the spouse of a woman whose child was found dead is 
acquitted and, to boot, part of the deposition is dismissed, I 
have grave concerns. Does it have to be one or the other? In 
granting parole to an individual who has taken the life of a 
child, is any consideration whatsoever given for instance to the 
full impact of his action? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, at the time of sentencing, the judge decided he should serve 
25 years, why then does he serve only about half his sentence? 
Why should an inmate be released earlier than his sentence calls 
for, when his victims may have to live with the consequences of 
his violent actions for the rest of their lives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it is not the victims themselves who have to live with the 
memory, it is their relatives and friends who must live every 
day without the presence of a loved one. While their lives will 
forever be changed, the murderer may be set free after 10 or 12 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it absurd and I have not yet talked about how the trial 
is conducted. When it takes a whole year to produce a report, it 
is only normal to forget some elements and to end up producing a 
document that is not as clear as if it would have been, had it 
been written in the days following the events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, when a case takes months before going to trial, 
because it keeps being postponed or adjourned, the same thing 
occurs. In some cases, it took years before some people finally 
got their day in court. All the while, the victim and his or her 
close ones were constantly reliving the tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the trial takes place and a verdict is rendered. 
Imagine the pain of the members of a family following an 
acquittal, or even when a jail sentence is imposed, since they 
know full well that the offender will not serve out his full 
sentence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it the whole judicial system that needs to be reviewed? One 
thing is certain: we must review the rules governing parole for 
serious offenders who, once released, committed the same crimes 
again. While it is true that, in many cases, time spent behind 
bars is beneficial and can be a form of therapy, it is not the 
case for every inmate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the motion before us, the atmosphere that prevails 
in certain penal institutions is so bad that an inmate cannot be 
rehabilitated. If verbal, psychological and even physical 
violence is as prevalent inside the institution as it is 
outside, how can we expect to rehabilitate these people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is the case, we must do so before other innocent victims 
fall prey to a criminal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased to have the 
opportunity to discuss an issue which, as the hon. member for 
Manicouagan pointed out, was raised in the House on October 22, 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member expressed concern about management of the 
maximum security penitentiary at Port-Cartier, Quebec, and asked 
the government to institute a public inquiry. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 28, 1997 staff from the day shift at Port-Cartier 
institution in the Quebec region refused to relieve the night 
staff from their posts, citing dangerous working conditions. 
Later that morning staff invoked Part II of the Canada Labour 
Code. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the evening, Labour Canada issued an interim ruling 
ordering evening shift employees to perform their duties. It 
also asked employees to put in writing their reasons for 
invoking part II of the Canada Labour Code. Labour Canada 
officials were at the Port-Cartier institution on the morning of 
August 29 to conduct their inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also point out that, on August 30, the situation at the 
institution had gone back to normal. On September 2, at the end 
of its independent inquiry, Labour Canada issued its final 
ruling, confirming that the immediate safety of the staff was 
not at risk. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be known that Labour Canada is an independent 
body which addresses the health and safety concerns of all 
employees involved in any federal work within the legislative 
authority of parliament.  As I have just stated, it acted very 
promptly. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of prevention is integrated into the Canada Labour 
Code, which gives a number of basic rights to workers in the 
federal administration, so as to ensure their safety in the 
workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been instances where the employees availed themselves 
of their right to refuse to work, and where the inquiry 
conducted by Labour Canada concluded that their health and 
safety were not at risk, or that the danger was hypothetical 
rather than actual. Such was the case regarding the events of 
August 29, 1997. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the right to refuse to work can often result in an 
immediate lockdown, which in turn results in increased tension 
within the inmate population, it is extremely important that this 
right be used for resolving genuine safety and health concerns. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 23 during Oral Question Period our hon. colleague, 
the member for Manicouagan, asked the Solicitor General why he 
refused to order a public inquiry.  As my colleague knows very 
well, the solicitor general answered the question a number of 
times.  He explained his reasons, once again, in a letter to the 
member for Charlesbourg October 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general said it was not necessary at that point to 
call a public inquiry, because Labour Canada had already 
investigated employees' concerns. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also worthwhile to mention that the hon. member for 
Manicouagan submitted an application for access to information at 
the Correctional Service of Canada on September 9 to view and 
hear the recordings of the events that occurred at Port-Cartier 
institution on August 28.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 16 the member visited Port-Cartier to view and 
listen to the recordings.  He watched the video cassettes first 
and decided not to listen to the audio cassettes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did not raise any specific problem.  He did, however, 
indicate to the director of the institution that he had met a 
number of employees, that things seemed to be going well and 
that progress had been made since August. 
In the light of these observations, the Solicitor General of 
Canada and the Commissioner of Correctional Services Canada 
considered the matter closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my hon. colleague for expressing his concerns on the 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true that, in 
Port-Cartier, relations are much improved between management, 
employees and the union. It is also true, however, that this 
motion is six months old and that the events it refers to took 
place six months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I like about this motion is that it allows us to discuss 
the judicial system as a whole, a system that I question. 
Canadians pay high taxes. Fathers with working children like 
myself are still paying school taxes, and I am happy to do so 
because we have a responsibility to pay for the education of our 
children and grandchildren. It is our civic duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we have a responsibility to pay taxes, a reasonable 
quality of life and a safe environment must be provided for our 
children and our families. 
It is the government's responsibility to protect society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see the justice system releasing inmates before they have 
served their full sentence, when I see that it takes years for 
cases to get to trial and then they are dropped for lack of a 
case, I tell myself that we are not fulfilling our mandate of 
protecting society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion is promoted, and the public, whose tax bill is high, 
is told “You pay your taxes to have a good quality of life; we 
are looking after the public, those who are ill, children, 
seniors, the disabled, the mentally ill, and hoodlums as well”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But they must be looked after in such a way that our society can 
again live in freedom, that people are not afraid to go out at 
night.  I therefore call on the government to overhaul the 
entire justice system. 
When it does that, it will be serving decent folk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding I have seen people whose lives were changed by 
crimes, such as a child or woman who has been raped.  These 
people will be marked forever.  We cannot ignore these problems. 
The system must be reformed and our society protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the government to examine the justice system, which is 
now in need of reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since no more members wish to speak and the 
motion was not selected as a votable item, the hour provided for 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the item is dropped from the order paper. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 1.23 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday 
next at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
