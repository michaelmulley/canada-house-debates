provision similar to article 611 of the Quebec civil code which 
states that in no case may a father or mother without serious

indicate societal approval of same sex relationships or of 
homosexuality, including amendment the human rights code to 
include in the prohibited grounds of discrimination the

and seven more petitioners feel existing gun control laws are 
doing the job in Canada, that new laws will be ineffective and 
expensive and that money and resources ought to be diverted 
toward fighting crime instead of fighting responsible gun 
owners.
<P>
	I am pleased to agree with both of these petitions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am today presenting 
petitions signed by constituents of Prince George-Peace River. 
They feel that no amount of gun control has ever succeeded in 
preventing criminals from acquiring guns by illegal means.
<P>
	Furthermore, the petitioners feel that many existing firearms 
regulations were brought in for a matter of public policy with no 
regard to future effectiveness and potential benefit.
<P>
	Therefore they ask Parliament to support laws which punish 
criminals using firearms, support, recognize and protect the 
rights of law-abiding citizens to own and use recreational 
firearms, and abolish any existing gun control laws which have 
proven to be ineffective.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House deplore the government's employment equity policy as 
unnecessary, ineffective, costly, unpopular, intrusive, discriminatory and 
harmful to designated and non-designated groups; that this House recognize 
the equality of all Canadians by affirming that hiring and promotion be based 
solely on merit rather than on gender and race; and that discriminatory 
employment practices be more vigorously pursued on an individual, case by 
case basis.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I appreciate your reading that 
through to its very logical conclusion. I appreciate the way you 
put the emphasis on the right spots and so on. It was well read.
<P>
	Employment equity is really the last gasp effort of an old 
government style brought forward from the 1960s and 1970s 
that says governments need to be involved in every little aspect 
of Canadian life.
<P>
	When one finds an area in which the government is not 
involved it seems this government is still hanging on to the 
residual of an idea that perhaps what we should do is interfere 
wherever we can in the marketplace, in people's lives, in 
intrusive legislation; employment equity probably being the last 
serious effort to intrude in corporate and individual lives from 
coast to coast.
<P>
	Employment equity is a road paved with good intentions. It is 
an idea that perhaps by enforcing certain racial goals, numerical 
goals and targets on employment hiring practices we can 
somehow make Canada more discrimination free and that we 
will all live in the utopia the Liberals would have us believe is 
just around the bend.
<P>
	Employment equity and affirmative action have fallen on hard 
times lately around the world. Employment equity is being 
challenged and being defeated in the United States courts, 
including the Supreme Court, one case after another.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12967"> 12967 </A></B>
<P>
	There is a proposition in California that will banish 
affirmative action plans from its law books probably within the 
year. In Canada, however, instead of following the lead of 
around the world which is to get away from social manipulation, 
for some reason the government has decided to expand the 
employment equity program.
<P>
	It has brought in Bill C-64 which will expand it to include not 
only people regulated by the federal government but the entire 
public service, the RCMP, the Canadian Armed Forces, CSIS 
and so on. It is a very intrusive bill. It smacks of social 
engineering of the worst kind. In the bottom line, it is very 
discriminatory and that is why the Reform Party opposes it.
<P>
	In the last week I clipped two or three pieces from a 
newspaper. I am wondering whether we are in tune with the 
Canadian people; are we reflecting the things that concern 
them? Recent opinion polls say that 74 per cent of Canadians 
oppose employment equity in Canada. In my province of British 
Columbia, 81 per cent oppose employment equity. The 
government, instead of retrenching and rethinking this idea, has 
decided at this time to expand it.
<P>
	What are the newspapers saying lately? Is it on people's 
minds? It certainly is on people's minds in Ontario where there 
is a provincial election going on. The <I>Globe and Mail</I>, hardly a 
radical paper, in talking about Mr. Harris says he will do away 
with the employment equity program if given a chance as the 
premier of Ontario.
<P>
	The paper asked: ``Is it radical to propose that Canada's only 
quota base affirmative action program'', meaning the 
employment equity program, ``which effectively requires 
discrimination in employment against white males be dropped 
along with the requirement to track employees by race, sex and 
disability?'' No, the <I>Globe and Mail</I> says that is not radical at 
all, that it only makes common sense.
<P>
	A May 27 article from the <I>Globe and Mail</I> says employment 
equity is no way to run a railroad or a newspaper. I might add 
that it is no way to run a country.
<P>
	The article goes through the litany of problems with the 
employment equity program, everything from how expensive it 
is to how it is discriminatory, intrusive and gives a lot of power 
of invasion. It is so intrusive in Ontario it had to be exempt from 
the Ontario human rights act because one cannot be in 
compliance with the human rights act at the same time as one is 
forcing employment equity. That is how discriminatory it is.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	Also interesting is the way much of this argument rests on a 
few words. The government says numerical goals are really not 
coercive and that numerical targets are not really quotas. The 
government says not to worry, it has numerical goals; they are 
not quotas, don't worry, be happy.
<P>
	It is interesting because that is not according to what all 
Liberals say. The federal and provincial wings of the Liberal 
Party are divided. We saw a senior federal Liberal saying a 
Liberal is a Liberal is a Liberal. We have had numerous 
statements in the House from federal Liberals endorsing the 
provincial Liberal program of Lyn McLeod. What did Lyn 
McLeod say about employment equity?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Lyn who?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> She is the leader of the Liberal Party in Ontario. 
On May 18 there was a major television debate which started off 
with a question on employment equity, what would all three of 
the major parties do with employment equity.
<P>
	The provincial Liberal leader repeatedly attacked the NDP 
premier of Ontario about the language of employment equity. I 
quote from the Liberal leader of Ontario: ``For me employment 
equity means ensuring that there is real equal opportunity in the 
hiring process, in the promotion process. That to me means that 
we do not support a quota approach by any other name, 
including numerical targets. To me a quota approach in 
employment equity is a violation of the principle of equal 
opportunity''.
<P>
	She went on to say numerical targets by any other name are an 
approach to quota because it focuses on the end goal. It does not 
deal with where the efforts should be, which is to ensure at the 
start of the process that real barriers should be removed.
<P>
	What does Bill C-64 propose? The government is now trying 
to ram the bill through committee. One of the first sections of 
the bill relates to numerical targets. It says not to worry, it is not 
a quota, it is a numerical target. Numerical target is a harmless 
little thing meaning, according to Lyn McLeod, a quota. That is 
exactly what it is. It is a quota and hon. members know it. That is 
why this kind of legislation is repugnant to people looking for 
equal treatment for all Canadians and not special treatment for 
some which causes discrimination against others.
<P>
	She was talking about equality of opportunity. If I were to take 
her position on this issue, she talks an awful lot like a Reformer. 
I almost hate to admit that, but that is the Reform Party position. 
The Reform Party position is we should ensure equality of 
opportunity but we cannot guarantee equality of results.
<P>
	I do not understand why the federal Liberals and the 
provincial Liberals do not get their act together on this. They 
should look through the two red books. They both have a red 
book. One is more discredited than the other because the other 
one has not been around for quite as long. The provincial red 
book says they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12968"> 12968 </A></B>
<P>
will abolish the numerical targets. That is why they are to do 
away with it; it does not foster equality.
<P>
	The leader of the provincial Conservatives says he will do 
away with the whole program. The federal Liberals seem to be 
eye to eye with the NDP. They are the only ones in the provincial 
election who are saying numerical targets are admirable. They 
along with the NDP seem to think it is a good idea. Even the 
provincial Liberals say it is not a good idea.
<P>
	The Liberals probably have honourable intentions. They 
believe they are trying to foster an attitude of equal opportunity. 
Unfortunately it is based on a series of wrong assumptions 
which I will go through at this time.
<P>
	To begin with, the idea we can somehow have numerical 
parity, that numbers will somehow make things 
non-discriminatory or more just is false.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	There are all kinds of reasons why people are involved in 
different occupations: cultural, geographic, economic, 
historical. People have put other priorities in front of certain 
types of jobs and people sometimes do not even want to enter the 
workforce or do not want to work full time. There is never going 
to be a precise numerical target equalling the representation of 
the workforce in any one occupation. It is not possible. It will 
never be possible, no matter how you try to legislate it.
<P>
	The entire legislation is based on a false assumption. The 
assumption is that Canadian employers are somehow 
systemically discriminatory; they are bad. The assumption is 
that they systemically discriminate against people, they are 
guilty, and we must force them to jump through hoops. And even 
if they are not guilty, their parents or grandparents probably 
were, so we will force them to jump through the hoops and go 
through a book of instructions. If they do not do as they are told 
we will jump down on them with the compliance police in order 
to make sure they do it.
<P>
	It is wrong to assume that employers are discriminatory. I 
realize we do not live in a perfect world, but where we have 
examples of discrimination I say the courts and the human rights 
tribunals should come down on them like a ton of bricks. We 
have no patience on this side of the House for people who have 
discriminatory practices toward anyone. All people should be 
treated equally. When they are not, then the courts and the 
tribunals should do their job and make sure that those employers 
are punished properly. That has always been our position.
<P>
	We also have big problems with the statistical base this whole 
thing is founded on. For example, 10 per cent of aboriginals 
refused to even be enumerated in the 1991 census. Also, we will 
be working with 1991 statistics until the year 2003. In other 
words, we are going to try to mesh current employment practices 
with 12-year-old statistics at a time when the demographics of 
Canada are changing so fast. It just is not going to work. Also, 
broad statistical generalizations do not take into account that 
certain groups, even if one believes in group rights, do not need 
any help.
<P>
	Not that I like to do this, but Statistics Canada breaks down 
the Canadian population based on ethnicity and income. If we 
take the top earning group in Canada by ethnicity, which I think 
is a repugnant thing to even ask, the people of Japanese origin 
have the highest per capita income of any group in Canada, 
followed by Jews and Egyptians, if we take it by ethnicity.
<P>
	Why would we want to put together an employment equity 
program that favours, in this case, the highest per capita income 
group in Canada? If we want to fulfil the letter of the law, if not 
the spirit, all we have to do is say we will hire this group or that 
group. Of course we should be hiring based on merit, not on 
ethnicity. However, if we are filling our quota we may be filling 
it up with people who do not need assistance, leaving others 
aside and hiring those who already have a good job or a good 
statistical average, if that is what matters.
<P>
	It is interesting that the biggest problem with this statistical 
base is that in 1991, 765,000 people refused to say what their 
ethnic background was. Do you know what they put down? They 
put down ``Canadian''. Statistics Canada said it would get to the 
bottom of this by changing the next one so that people will have 
to answer what their ethnic background is, because we cannot 
have this dangerous trend where people are starting to call 
themselves Canadians; we must have hyphenated Canadians. 
Stats Canada is going to change its forms to ensure we get more 
hyphenated answers in the next go around. I am so pleased to 
hear that. That is disgusting.
<P>
	We are also very concerned about the coercive nature of this. 
Bill C-64 and the current employment equity practice says that 
people must self-identify their ethnicity and whether they are 
one of the four designated groups: a visible minority, a woman, a 
disabled person, and what is the fourth one? Anyway, they must 
self-identify. What happens if they do not self-identify? The 
legislation and the courts say they cannot be forced to do it.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	It is interesting that DND must now take part in the new 
process and it has started the identification process. It sends 
around a questionnaire, which is in two parts. It says on the top: 
``You must fill out out the top''-the top being your name, rank, 
serial number, and so on. Part two is optional-wink, wink: 
``You do not have to fill out the second part about your ethnic 
background. You will not be discriminated against if you do not. 
Do not worry about it. Just fill out the top. And if you do not fill 
in the bottom part, that is fine. Do not worry.''
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12969"> 12969 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us get serious. Once our name is on the piece of paper we 
are not one of the players in the game. It is left up to the 
personnel manager or the promotion officer or whoever to say: 
``Is this guy playing by the rules or not? I am going to ask him to 
fill out the bottom part and then we will get the ethnicity on this 
piece of paper if it kills us.'' That is a very dangerous trend.
<P>
	We think the whole system is wrong. It is very open to abuse 
by those who might lie on a form. For example, what would 
happen if we just encouraged everybody to put down that they 
consider themselves a member of a minority group? Everybody 
in Canada, let us all self-identify as minorities. In the end there 
could be a whole program designed around totally false 
statistical information, which of course is wrong.
<P>
	I mentioned that there are only four designated groups. 
Although the government has no plans at this time to admit other 
groups, it is interesting how others can be read into it. We know 
that the courts can read other groups into the charter of rights. 
Last week, for example, although it did not actually say that 
homosexuals are included under section 15 of the charter, the 
federal court said they should be, doggone it, and they will be in 
future court references. Therefore, the idea that there are only 
four designated groups could well be expanded.
<P>
	In the United States one New York firm had to do an entire 
survey of its workforce, with special attention being given to 
Canadian Americans, to find out if they had been discriminated 
against. I guess I should be grateful for that. Maybe we will get 
employment opportunities in the United States. It just shows 
how ridiculous it can be when it is taken to its logical extreme.
<P>
	Employment equity is also very expensive. In the United 
States, where it has been in place for some 30 years, estimates 
from <I>Forbes</I> magazine say that it now takes up almost 4 per cent 
of GDP per year. Billions and tens of billions of dollars in the 
United States are used up, wasted, instead of helping individuals 
who need help. Money is wasted on government programs that 
have not proven effective in helping these groups at all. In 
Canada it is just starting, so it is not nearly as intrusive and not 
nearly as expensive; still, it is estimated that about 1 per cent of 
GDP is wasted on employment equity programs. That is $6 
billion or $7 billion a year that is not even helping the people the 
government wants to help. It is being wasted in book work, 
reporting, jumping through the hoops, making it look good and 
so on and not really helping people based on need.
<P>
	Reform sees this very much as a drag on our economy and a 
hidden tax on businesses that we cannot afford. It also hurts the 
designated groups. Many studies have shown how people feel 
patronized when we say we must have a program to make sure, 
for example, that we must hire women at this particular place of 
employment and we must have a special program. The inference 
is that somehow women are not qualified. Well that is just  
ridiculous. Fifty-five per cent of people who graduate from 
universities today are female. I am pleased to see that women 
have taken a leadership role in all avenues of our country and are 
continuing to expand as we move from a culture that was 
basically a home based job of rearing children and looking after 
the house and so on. We have evolved from that to a culture 
where women are accepted and should be accepted in all areas of 
the economy.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	To say they somehow cannot compete on an even footing is 
very patronizing, not only to women but to the other designated 
groups as well. We have a role in government to ensure equality 
of opportunity. We should challenge everyone to compete 
equally. It is the role of government to ensure that and not to 
dictate the results on the employment side.
<P>
	There are many other things my colleagues will be bringing 
up dealing with what is wrong with this whole idea. I look 
forward to the debate as it unfolds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am shocked and deeply saddened, as I am sure most 
Canadians are, by the appalling lack of knowledge and the 
insensitivity shown by the hon. member's motion. It would be 
laughable were it not so lamentable.
<P>
	Discrimination is no laughing matter. This mean-spirited 
motion adds insult to injury for millions of Canadian women, 
aboriginal peoples, visible minority members and persons with 
disability who already know all too well the disadvantages of 
being a member of these designated groups.
<P>
	It is patently clear that this attempt to kill Bill C-64 is nothing 
more than a desire to turn back the clock to the days when men 
were men and everyone else knew their place. Canada cannot 
afford the anachronistic attitudes embodied in this opposition 
motion to stand in the way of progress.
<P>
	To those who are members of the designated groups 
employment equity is about human decency and democracy. It is 
the freedom to exercise constitutionally guaranteed rights, to 
participate in the political process and to make contributions to 
the economic and cultural fabric of Canada.
<P>
	Employment equity means simply that everyone is treated 
equally, not preferentially and not to the detriment of 
non-designated Canadians. It means only that qualified 
candidates, regardless of gender, race, or physical or intellectual 
capacity, will be given equal consideration for recruitment and 
will be promoted on the basis of merit.
<P>

<P>
	First let us look at the suggestion that the legislation is 
unnecessary. Tell that to the Canadian human rights 
commissioner, who in 1994 alone fielded a total of 1,372 
complaints based on either disability, race, colour, national or 
ethnic origin or sex.
<P>
	I challenge the hon. member to test his thesis on persons with 
disabilities in this country who are being hired in proportion 
equivalent to about one-quarter of their representation. Along 
with aboriginal peoples, they experience the highest 
unemployment rates in this country, at 18.5 per cent, which is 
double the national average.
<P>
	Perhaps he might explain to young, visible minority 
Canadians, who are generally better educated and trained at 
higher levels than the general population, why they too 
experience significantly higher rates of unemployment. Let him 
tell the women of Canada there is no need for employment 
equity when although they may prove themselves to be 
eminently qualified for jobs they are often still unable to break 
through the glass ceiling.
<P>
	To quote Madam Justice Rosalie Abella, the former chair of 
the royal commission on employment: ``For every woman in the 
thousands whose glass ceilings have been melted, shattered or 
raised, there are women in the millions who think a glass ceiling 
is just one more object to polish''.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to remind the members of the Reform Party that white 
male Canadians make up just 45 per cent of the workforce yet 
they land 55 per cent of all jobs. Men account for roughly 90 per 
cent of all senior managers. They also earn on average about 20 
per cent more than women workers.
<P>
	The recent Wannell and Caron report which looked at 
employment equity groups among recent post-secondary 
graduates found that even if men and women start out on an 
equal basis in the labour market, a change occurs as they 
progress in their careers. The earnings gap tends to grow over 
time within a group of graduates. The report's authors 
discovered the female-male earnings ratio dropped by 5 per cent 
over a five year period.
<P>
	I ask the House: Does any of this suggest members of 
designated groups enjoy preferential treatment? The figures 
speak for themselves.
<P>
	Speaking of numbers, the opposition's claim that employment 
equity is too costly just does not add up. This initiative has been 
designed to minimize the regulatory burden and cost to business 
by streamlining and simplifying the requirements into a single 
legislative approach. To ensure any new regulations result in the  
least burden possible, consideration is being given to using a 
business impact test developed by the Department of Industry.
<P>
	Coverage of the Employment Equity Act has not been 
extended to include small business, nor has coverage of the 
federal contractors program been expanded. The threshold 
remains at 100 employees.
<P>
	There will be some cost to private sector employers for 
responding to audits under the act but they will be offset by the 
savings resulting from the proposed amendments in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act. Costs to government have also 
been carefully calculated.
<P>
	I can assure the House that the Department of Human 
Resources Development will not experience any additional 
expense as a result of this legislation. The Canadian Human 
Rights Commission has also indicated it can undertake the 
compliance related activities in Bill C-64 within its current 
budget.
<P>
	These cost considerations do not begin to take into account 
the many economic benefits of employment equity. Progressive 
employers report employment equity gives them a competitive 
advantage. They say the legislation helps them attract, retain 
and motivate employees from all backgrounds, not only an 
advantage in terms of human resources but also in tapping the 
more diverse marketplace. It is clear that on this front the 
Reform Party is seriously misinformed, as it is with respect to 
employment equity's popularity.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that the Standing Committee on 
Human Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons conducted 
broad consultations, hearing from over 50 witnesses 
representing the interests of business, labour and designated 
groups. The vast majority of those witnesses indicated they were 
in favour of employment equity. Needless to say, so are the 
millions of Canadian women, persons with disabilities, visible 
minorities and aboriginal people who make up more than half of 
the country's population. It is hard to argue with numbers like 
those.
<P>
	I must confess I have the most difficulty trying to comprehend 
the opposition's argument that employment equity has been 
discriminatory and harmful to designated groups. While there is 
undeniably a lot of work yet to be done, members of many of the 
designated groups have seen substantial progress since the 
original Employment Equity Act was introduced.
<P>
	Women's representation in the workforce is now in line with 
their availability, although many continue to be ghettoized in 
low paid and part time work. Movement into management 
positions is improving. Women's representation in middle 
management positions increased from about one-third in 1987 
to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12971"> 12971 </A></B>
<P>
over 43 per cent in 1993, while their share of senior management 
jobs more than doubled to just under 11 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	Visible minorities have also made slow but continuing 
progress in all occupational groups, including management. The 
representation of visible minorities in the actual workforce 
increased from 5 per cent in 1987 to more than 8 per cent in 
1993. That is close to their 9.1 per cent availability rate. The 
really good news is in the banking sector where visible 
minorities enjoy their highest representation at 13.4 per cent.
<P>
	It is important to point out to the House that these gains have 
not come at the expense of other Canadians. In a statement 
accompanying the 1994 annual report of the Canadian Human 
Rights Commission, chief commissioner Max Yalden said: ``Far 
from falling behind, able bodied white males appear to be 
getting more than a proportionate share of hiring. Such data 
hardly convey a convincing portrait of reverse discrimination''.
<P>
	The very real danger of this motion is that it could cause 
serious damage. If adopted, it would recreate in law an 
unacceptable working standard for millions of disadvantaged 
Canadians. It would tacitly condone racism, sexism and other 
forms of discrimination which we know already exist in the 
workplace.
<P>
	It would permit prejudice to go unchecked and might even 
encourage the outright acts of physical or sexual harassment of 
the most vulnerable. Now that I have outlined what is wrong 
with the opposition's motion, let me talk about what is right with 
the actions this government has taken in the area of employment 
equity through Bill C-64.
<P>
	As we promised in the red book, the new employment equity 
act will broaden its coverage to include both the public service 
and the private sector. The revisions to the legislation will 
establish the same core obligations on public and private sector 
employers to develop and implement equity plans and 
programs.
<P>
	The present act covers roughly 5 per cent of all people 
employed in Canada. Extending coverage within the public 
service will add another 2 per cent. When one considers that 
there are roughly 230,000 employees among the 80 federal 
departments, boards and agencies, the changes represent a 
substantial number of new opportunities for members of 
designated groups.
<P>
	Inclusion of the public sector is a fulfilment of our pledge in 
the red book to have a federal workforce representative of the 
public it serves. For the same reason, federal contractors will 
also be obliged to comply with the principles of the Employment 
Equity Act.
<P>
	Another key improvement to the legislation is the increased 
authority of the Canadian Human Rights Commission. Its 
mandate is being broadened to allow it to conduct audits of 
public and private sector employers to verify and gain 
compliance with the act.
<P>
	The changes will clarify the commission's enforcement 
powers to ensure that employers pay more than lip service to the 
principle of employment equity. I can assure the House 
however, that the amendments are not meant to be heavy 
handed. The fact that an enforcement mechanism will be 
established is a guarantee. The legislation is intended to achieve 
a balance. The act will not set out to solve one set of problems 
for employees by creating another one for employers. Changes 
to the regulations will be minimal and developed in full 
consultation with business.
<P>
	This government is committed to creating an environment 
conducive to economic growth and job creation. We are 
convinced that the proposed amendments which will not 
increase the paper burden will allow us to do just that. We are 
working to do everything possible to ensure that every 
Canadian, regardless of gender, race or physical attributes, has a 
chance to fulfil his or her potential, to get a rewarding job and to 
contribute to the social and economic health of Canada.
<P>
	Employment equity is not an impediment to progress. It is a 
catalyst for improvement in the workplace. Workforce diversity 
will enhance Canadian companies' competitiveness in the 
global economy at very little cost.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	I ask members of this House how any of us can put a price tag 
on personal fulfilment and the dignity that comes with having a 
job. Ultimately, the amendments to the Employment Equity Act 
are not about counting numbers or instituting new rules and 
regulations. They are about providing enhanced opportunities 
for self-sufficiency and self-satisfaction for women, aboriginal 
peoples, persons with disabilities and members of visible 
minorities. They are about giving meaning to the lives of 
millions of work ready Canadians, men and women seeking the 
respect and recognition, the salary and enhanced lifestyle that 
comes with work.
<P>
	The proposed changes are designed to promote the optimal 
use of our rich human resources. They are intended to act as a 
stimulus to our national economy. They are a reflection of the 
progressive way this government is addressing the employment 
equity issue.
<P>
	The misguided motion put forward by the opposition misses 
the point. Bill C-64 is an affirmation that hiring and promotion 
should be based on merit rather than special designation. The 
bill is designed so those decisions are based solely on the bona 
fide requirements of an occupation and not on any other non-job 
related criteria.
<P>
	The legislation clearly states that the obligation to implement 
employment equity does not require an employer ``to hire or 
promote unqualified persons''. With respect to the public sector 
I will quote again: ``to hire or promote persons without basing 
the hiring or promotion on selection according to merit''. That 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12972"> 12972 </A></B>
<P>
of course begs the question: What could anyone possibly find 
discriminatory about that?
<P>
	I can only conclude, as did the Canadian human rights 
commissioner in the annual report last year, that occasionally 
the tone of the opposition to employment equity seems more 
than a little shrill. For all who believe in the principles of 
democracy and the noble ideas of this institution, the 
Employment Equity Act is a welcome reminder of the values we 
hold dear as a nation. It is an affirmation that Canadians are just 
and honourable people who passionately believe in fairness and 
dignity for all.
<P>
	I am proud to count myself among those individuals who 
support employment equity. I urge members of this House to 
defeat this draconian motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am glad the member counts himself in support of 
employment equity. In my province he joins 11 per cent of the 
population who would agree with him, and only 11 per cent.
<P>
	I was on a talk show last week about the issue of employment 
equity. The host of the talk show asked me a couple of questions 
which may be similar to what the hon. member mentioned. For 
example, one question was: How will we make sure that 
employers hire the best? The member talked about progressive 
employers attracting the best employees. It may possibly be that 
because this legislation was designed in Ottawa that this whole 
concept is so flawed.
<P>
	Members should take the time to come out to Vancouver 
sometime because there is actually a country that exists beyond 
the Rocky Mountains. They should come out and see what 
British Columbia looks like. British Columbia, especially 
Vancouver and the lower mainland, is the most cosmopolitan 
area in Canada.
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of people from all different ethnic 
backgrounds live in harmony together in the lower mainland and 
work well together. By the year 2000, 85 per cent of all new job 
applicants will come from those four designated groups. What 
employer in Vancouver is going to say: ``I am going to refuse to 
hire the best people I can get''. That is an employer who is on the 
way out and is going broke.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	In Vancouver if employers are not prepared to hire the best 
people, regardless of gender, visible minority status and so on, 
they will not be able to compete on the west coast of Canada. 
They must hire the best. Employers in the lower mainland find 
this laughable. That is why there is only 11 per cent support in 
the entire province. They look at this and say: ``We are hiring the 
best. I do not care what gender they are, what colour they are or 
what background they have. We want to hire the best people we 
can''.
<P>
	Although they talk about the progress since employment 
equity was brought in, the old Employment Equity Act, 
employers who have been covered under the act for the last eight 
or nine years have done absolutely no better in hiring people 
from the designated groups than employers who are not covered 
under the act. In other words, they have done all the paperwork, 
gone through the motions, done the surveys and spent the money 
but it has not made a lick of difference. If it helped maybe I 
would be persuaded, but it has not made any difference because 
employers in the non-covered areas have done equally as well in 
hiring people from the designated groups.
<P>
	In Toronto, if we were to take the low income people by 
ethnicity, Portuguese people have some of the lowest per capita 
incomes, the lowest employment rates and one of the lowest 
graduation rates from high schools. It is a problem in that 
community. The ironic part is that they could live across the 
street from someone who fits in a visible minority group and the 
visible minority would be covered under the program but the 
Portuguese people would not be covered. Why? Because they do 
not fit the right criteria.
<P>
	They have demonstrated need. They have historical 
disadvantage. They have low per capita income. They have poor 
job opportunities. They have less education. They have need of 
assistance based on need, not based on ethnicity, but they cannot 
get assistance because they are not in the right group. That is 
totally unfair because that group needs help as much as or more 
than any other person who might be living on that street.
<P>
	I would like the member to respond to any of the comments I 
have made and to give me examples from his list of employers 
who have been using poor employment practices. As I 
mentioned earlier, nowadays the people who refuse to hire the 
best are the companies on the way out. That is good. If they are 
not hiring the best they deserve to go broke. However they 
should not have to hire based on a quota. If it is 80 per cent 
female, what is the difference? If those are the best people they 
can find for the job, great.
<P>
	I would like him to tell me about his list of discriminatory 
employers who he will whack into line with this coercive 
legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Madam Speaker, I am wondering whether 
the hon. member listened to the speech I delivered or paid 
enough attention to the great number of people who appeared 
before the human rights and status of disabled persons 
committee to understand that the Employment Equity Act is a 
positive measure by the government to ensure that some of the 
inequities in society are addressed in the fairest possible way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12973"> 12973 </A></B>
<P>
	One of the exercises the hon. member should do, if he is 
serious about bringing about positive change to society, is to 
look at the power structure in the country, whether political or 
economic, to see whether the cultural diversity present in the 
population is reflected within the power structure. He could 
perhaps read <I>The Vertical Mosaic</I> by Porter, which will 
enlighten him a great deal about the sort of things we have to do 
to make society a fairer and more just society than it is today. I 
cited a few statistics during my speech that clearly illustrated it 
was a very fair act that was trying to address some of the existing 
inequities.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	I know where the hon. member and the Reform Party are 
coming from. They are concerned a great deal about the white 
male relationship to the economy. I understand their instinctual 
response to that because obviously intellectually it is very poor.
<P>
	I want to tell them again, so they can get it straight once and 
for all, that while white Canadian males make up 45 per cent of 
the workforce they land 55 per cent of the jobs. When Reform 
members are speaking to their constituents they should present 
them with the facts of life as they relate to the Canadian reality. 
They should try to tell them that discrimination unfortunately 
exists in the country. It does affect aboriginal people, persons 
with disabilities and visible minorities who are not given fair 
treatment in our economic system.
<P>
	We as a society could close our eyes to that reality, or we as a 
government could open our eyes to the reality and try to address 
it. Through Bill C-64 the government is heading in the right 
direction.
<P>
	I say to the Reform Party that it should not kid itself. 
Canadians understand where that party is coming from.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Oh, yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> They understand exactly what the motion is 
all about. They read between the lines. The hon. member can 
couch it in elegant language but we know what it is all about. 
The Canadian people know what it is all about.
<P>
	Reformers will have to go to the people of Canada and talk to 
over 50 per cent of the Canadian population who have not been 
given a fair deal. They will have to explain their stand and tell 
them that the hiring practices existing in the country are fair to 
all. When the Reformers have those answers they can come back 
here. They can speak to the people with disabilities, to visible 
minorities and to all the groups that appeared before the 
committee. They can give them the right answers and not play 
cheap politics with something that is extremely serious to our 
economic system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I thank you for allowing me to take part in the 
debate. Once the House has returned to normal, you will permit 
me to say what is obviously a fact and what I am proud to point 
out: that the Bloc Quebecois supports the bill on employment 
equity.
<P>
	You will understand my concern that we should be dealing, in 
this House today, with a motion that is, in my opinion, 
ultraconservative. It is very backward and has a major strike 
against it because it fails to take into account a basic premise, 
which has been brought to our attention by a number of 
witnesses since December. The Standing Committee on Human 
Rights of which I am the vice-chairman has been working for 
almost seven months on employment equity.
<P>
	I can assure you that we have had a number of people come 
and remind us that one would have to be completely blind and 
particularly obtuse not to understand that, when it comes to 
dealing with the labour market and finding one's niche in an 
organization, people are not all equal before the law.
<P>
	Permit me to point out that the notion of employment equity is 
not new. In the early 1970s there was a movement in Canadian 
society and people demanded that legislators intervene to 
promote greater equality among individuals.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	There are, in the area of employment equity, two major types 
of discrimination. There is discrimination, which is more at the 
individual level in our society, which takes the form of prejudice 
and stereotypes and which is found in interpersonal 
relationships. There is another broad type of discrimination, 
which is systemic. This means that the system, the labour 
market, left on its own, would generate inequality of itself, and 
we would find ourselves in a situation created by a set of 
practices and procedures. The most obvious example of this, 
which we all know, is that women do not have the same career 
options.
<P>
	These arguments could also apply to politics. We must 
acknowledge that women interested in a political career face 
additional requirements because there is a social division of 
labour which takes for granted that women should be 
responsible for child care. The same goes for the labour force. It 
is much more difficult for a woman to reach management levels 
because of the social pressures that still exist in our society.
<P>
	That is why in 1983 the Liberal government then in power 
asked Judge Rosalie Abella to lead a commission of inquiry and 
recommend what could be done to achieve greater equity in the 
workplace. What is interesting about this commission, which 
made 31 recommendations-including some that have become 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12974"> 12974 </A></B>
<P>
law and some that are included in Bill C-64-is that the Isabella 
Commission defined discrimination right off the bat. The 
commission defined discrimination as the  arbitrary barriers that 
deny some people the opportunity to demonstrate their abilities.
<P>
	This definition underlines the early link between the desire to 
end discrimination and the notion of ability.
<P>
	What I find most appalling, most disgusting in the Reform 
rhetoric is that, throughout committee proceedings, they tried to 
establish a false link between employment equity and ability. As 
if public or private sector employers promoting employment 
equity had to hire incompetent people.
<P>
	Right from the start, the Abella Commission made it clear that 
the two employment equity laws did not require employers in 
any way to hire incompetent people.
<P>
	There is something very loathsome as well as some dishonest 
associations in the Reform Party's arguments.
<P>
	What was the situation? Now that the Employment Equity Act 
has been in effect for nearly seven years, we see that some 
progress has been made. Let us look, for example, at the four 
designated groups. As members know, employment equity is a 
requirement for private sector employers with 100 or more 
employees. At the present time, the Employment Equity Act 
affects roughly 5 per cent of the labour force and 350 employers. 
We have not done nearly as much as we could to provide greater 
coverage for the labour force.
<P>
	So, any employer who employs one hundred or more 
employees and does business under federal jurisdiction is 
required to develop employment equity plans indicating how he 
will ensure that his workforce better reflects the representation 
of various groups in the Canadian workforce. This is the 
purpose, the basis for the Employment Equity Act. Employers 
are asked to pay special attention to four groups which have a 
harder time finding a place in our society.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Which are these four groups? They are, as you know, visible 
minorities, members of ethnic communities; women of course, 
to whom you are very sensitive and who make up 52 per cent of 
the Canadian population; aboriginal people and people with 
disabilities.
<P>
	Figures show that progress has been made. There are certainly 
more women and members of visible minorities in the 
workplace today than before. Let me give you some figures.
<P>
	In 1987, one year after the Employment Equity Act was first 
passed, visible minorities represented five per cent of the labour 
force; in 1993, they represented 8.09 per cent of the labour 
force. So, there have been gains; there has been some progress. 
But can we reasonably assume that, without legislation to 
sensitize employers to visible minority integration, without 
influencing the labour market in any way, this would have 
happened anyway? I think not.
<P>
	As for women, in 1987, they represented 40.93 per cent of the 
labour force and, a few years later, in 1993, 45 per cent. There 
have indeed been gains, but we must never lose sight of the fact 
that women make up half of the Canadian population and that it 
would be unacceptable for the workplace not to reflect this 
reality.
<P>
	As for the other two designated groups, namely aboriginal 
people and persons with disabilities, they may well be the 
greatest source of concern to us parliamentarians. While the 
situation is relatively positive for women and for members of 
visible minorities, aboriginal people and persons with 
disabilities still have a long way to go.
<P>
	In 1987, it will be remembered, aboriginal people accounted 
for 0.66 per cent of the workforce, compared to 1.04 per cent in 
1993. This is not even a one per cent improvement. It is 
important to recognize the need to make room for more 
aboriginal people on the labour market.
<P>
	Persons with disabilities account for 13 per cent of Canada's 
population, something which cannot be overlooked as we are 
about to enter the 21st century. There are more and more persons 
with disabilities in our society. These people want to work, and 
they can be part of the labour force. In 1987, persons with 
disabilities accounted for 1.59 per cent of the work force, 
compared to 2.56 per cent in 1993. This represents an increase of 
just under one per cent.
<P>
	These figures are a reminder that, when it comes to 
employment equity, we can certainly not say ``mission 
accomplished''. There is still work to be done. I take exception 
to the comments made by the Reform Party.
<P>
	Throughout the proceedings, we heard Reform members 
shamelessly and unacceptably claim that, in 1995, there existed 
what they called reverse discrimination. They said that, in our 
society as well as in the workplace, those who are discriminated 
against and for whom policies are required are in fact white men 
with no handicap, a group which the neoconservatives of the 
Reagan era called the silent majority. This is the simplistic 
argument used by Reform members.
<P>
	Yet, we see-according to the figures released by the 
Canadian Human Rights Commission-that white men with no 
handicap hold 55 per cent of available jobs, while accounting for 
45 per cent of the workforce.
<P>
	Given these figures, how could we possibly agree with the 
simplistic views of the Reform members and their comments on 
reverse discrimination?
<P>
	Another study, conducted by the Pearson Institute, is very 
enlightening. Two years ago, this institute estimated that, of the 
people in the top 500 positions in Canada, the movers and 
shakers who make the most important decisions and have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12975"> 12975 </A></B>
<P>
enormous influence on the government's decisions, less than 1 
per cent were aboriginal people, less than 4 per cent belonged to 
a visible minority and less than 12 per cent were women.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	And there are nevertheless still people around who say that 
there is no need to legislate a more even distribution of 
influence, power and management positions in our society, than 
what currently exists.
<P>
	If they would only make the effort to methodically write up 
the profiles of the members of each designated group, they 
would see that there are still some extremely unsettling 
problems and inequalities. Of course, we are not saying that 
nothing good has come of the legislation in the seven years since 
it was passed. We realize that women and visible minorities 
have made advances. But we can in no way sit back and exclaim: 
``Mission accomplished''.
<P>
	Let us look a little closer at the realities of the designated 
groups. In 1994, even 1995, it is downright awful that the 
average woman working in the private sector, doing exactly the 
same job, reporting at exactly the same level in the management 
chain, and holding exactly the same responsibilities as her male 
counterpart earns approximately 66 per cent of what the man 
earns. It is statistics like that which should make us all 
indignant. Why should we tolerate, as parliamentarians, the fact 
that, as our society prepares to enter the 21st century, a woman 
and a man with the same responsibilities and qualifications are 
not paid the same salary?
<P>
	It is odd that the Reform Party does not mention this reality. 
This is absolutely incredible, given the large-scale awareness 
campaigns led by Treasury Board. So, how is it that, during the 
course of our work the Reform Party never concerned itself with 
this reality? What about visible minorities? If we conducted a 
little experiment and put ten members of visible minorities and 
ten Caucasians-and I say Caucasian because this is the 
expression used in the Act-in the same room, we would realize 
that there were more university graduates among the members 
of visible minorities than among the Caucasians. And yet, half 
the time, members of visible minorities are limited to jobs that 
require little education, pay little and involve manual work.
<P>
	Who is going to tell me that we, as parliamentarians, should 
not be concerned about this injustice? This is the reality. And 
then, what about native people? A report was recently tabled in 
the House on social problems among the native population. The 
rate of suicide is extremely high among native peoples. My 
colleague, the hon. member for Saint-Jean, could speak much 
more movingly and more expertly than I on this subject. 
However, the latest statistics have revealed that, in 1993,-and 
we are not talking about 300 B.C.-the rate of unemployment 
among native people was still double the national average.
<P>
	Native people are concentrated in jobs requiring less 
knowledge and fewer skills and even more in so-called manual 
jobs. You would not be surprised to learn, Madam Speaker, that 
the annual employment income of native people is lower. If you 
have a job, earn a salary and are a native person you, in all 
likelihood, will be earning $10,000 less than your white 
counterpart. This is unacceptable, as you will understand.
<P>
	As regards persons with disabilities, this is perhaps where the 
Employment Equity Act has made the least progress. This is 
understandable, because integrating a person with a disability 
requires employers to make alterations, what the courts have 
called reasonable adjustments.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	It is because of these realities that we must support a bill like 
the one tabled by the government. I am not saying that, as the 
official opposition, we do not have a few reservations about this 
bill. As the committee members know, we put forward a number 
of amendments. I would have preferred the employment equity 
plan to be developed jointly by the workers' representatives and 
the employers, but such is not the case.
<P>
	What is the Reform Party so worried about in this bill? Why 
must we spend our time trying to convince our Reform 
colleagues that a law such as the Employment Equity Act is 
necessary in Quebec and Canadian society?
<P>
	Bill C-64 provides for something that we have been 
demanding for six years: it will now apply not only to 600,000 
private sector workers but also to the Canadian public service. 
This means that, at a single stroke, 200,000 additional workers 
will enjoy greater protection. I see this as a positive 
development, since we must recognize the absurdity of asking 
private sector employers to promote employment equity while 
exempting the government. We have waited several years for 
this amendment.
<P>
	Another positive point is that there will now be an entity in 
charge of enforcing the act. While employment equity was 
previously under the jurisdiction of the minister and the human 
resources branch, the Canadian Human Rights Commission will 
now be responsible for enforcing the act. The commission may 
audit reports and establish an employment equity review 
tribunal. From now on, when employers do not submit their 
reports in time or when compliance officers discover violations, 
a quasi-judicial tribunal will have the power to investigate. That 
is an achievement, a very positive development, that must be 
applauded.
<P>
	What is also very positive, as I think we pointed out earlier, is 
that we used to ask employers to make a quantitative assessment 
of their efforts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12976"> 12976 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois is very much in favour of 
this bill, although we do have a few amendments. But I cannot 
understand how the Reform Party can take such a small-c 
conservative, reactionary and deplorable position on human 
rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened to what my hon. colleague for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve just said and I was shocked by his 
criticism of the motion and of the Reform Party for having 
moved it.
<P>
	I was shocked because he said that the Reform Party was 
almost taking the stand that you had to be white, male and 
without a disability to participate fully in the labour market 
without being discriminated against. Upon analysis, we realize 
that the separatist option supporter said basically the same 
thing; you must be either pro-sovereignty or white and you must 
absolutely be an old-stock Quebecer to participate in this 
option.
<P>
	I would like to quote a few statements that were made. Taking 
part in a debate in this House on January 27, 1994, the hon. 
member for Longueuil clearly stated that multiculturalism ``is 
something that has created ghettoes''. In an interview for the 
daily newspaper <I>Le Devoir</I>, the Quebec Deputy Premier said that 
Quebec would not use public funds to subsidize difference, 
stating that his government was against multiculturalism.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Minister Louise Beaudoin said that she wanted to live in the 
society she wanted and was wondering why she could not live in 
the country to her liking rather than to the liking of English 
Canadians. ``Canadians want a multicultural society, she said, 
but I do not. This would leave the door open to social ghettoes. I 
am for integration and against the wearing of the Islamic scarf at 
school''.
<P>
	So far, Bloc Quebecois supporters and the Quebec 
government have not shown that they were open to visible 
minorities and, I might add, to anyone who does not share their 
political views. We will recall how these minority groups were 
treated during the public consultation process on the future of 
Quebec.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve 
to tell me how he envisages their proposed society, their 
nation-building project. How can he justify the position taken 
by his party and the Quebec government? The fact that 
aboriginal people must give in to the Premier currently 
responsible for this issue was raised as an example. What 
assurances can he give young Quebecers that their future will be 
brighter? How can he tell aboriginal people in Quebec that their 
future will be brighter? How can he tell visible minorities that, 
as he said himself, their future will be brighter? All those 
minorities.
<P>
	So far, no matter how hard they criticize the Reform Party, 
they have done no better. They have clearly demonstrated as 
much intolerance as the motion before the House this morning.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, I thought you would have 
availed yourself of the rule of relevancy. I do not know whether 
the term ``stupid'' is unparliamentary, but it spontaneously 
comes to mind.
<P>
	I cannot understand how someone can be as confused, as blind 
and as mixed up as the member for Vaudreuil. You should ask 
one of the pages to bring him some aspirin, because there is 
definitely something wrong with him.
<P>
	I have been working with the government party for seven 
months to improve employment equity, and the member has the 
nerve to rise today and speak against the Bloc Quebecois. There 
is something wrong with him.
<P>
	Let me kindly remind him that the issue being debated today 
is whether or not the motion tabled by the Reform Party against 
the actions of his government is supported by the official 
opposition. We made a speech in which we expressed our 
concern about the ethnocentric attitude-the member may not 
understand that term, but we will send him a dictionary-of 
Reform members, and the member finds a way to rise and be 
disrespectful towards me.
<P>
	I will conclude by telling him this: As for sovereignty, if he 
wants to debate the issue, I am prepared to do so anytime, 
anywhere.
<P>
	I will also tell him that, if he looks at the way the Parizeau 
government, and the previous Quebec governments, particularly 
the PQ governments, have treated the English-speaking 
minority, to which I think the member fully belongs, he will 
realize that he need not worry at all and, also, that we have no 
lesson to learn from him, given the respect which we have 
always shown towards the English-speaking community in 
Quebec.
<P>
	The members' comments are shameful, unacceptable and 
totally irresponsible, in my opinion. I am sure that the Minister 
of Human Resources Development and his secretary of state are 
outraged by the fact that a government member would rise to 
make such irresponsible comparisons.
<P>
	As for the issue of a better future for sovereignists, the hon. 
member has come up with a rather stupid and meaningless 
argument, and I would remind him that when Mr. Lévesque held 
the referendum in 1980, the federal debt stood at $75 billion. 
Consequently, when the member rises in this House, he should 
never forget that the debt now stands at $600 billion.
<P>
	I am not worried about Quebec's future, but I certainly am 
concerned about the future of Canadian federalism.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I agree with the hon. member that we are getting off 
topic in a very serious way.
<P>
	I would like to bring the discussion back on track by saying to 
the member that he knows full well that the Reform Party is not 
in favour of any particular ethnic group in Canada. We are fully 
in favour of equal rights and equal treatment for all Canadians.
<P>
	One reason the Reform Party opposed the Charlottetown 
accord was because of the unequal treatment of people based on 
their ethnicity and background. We said that was wrong.
<P>
	One trend that has been noted over the last little while is that 
hearing individual cases of discrimination before the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission takes an average of a year and a half. 
I agree there is still discrimination and prejudice and we must 
fight against it. However the time to hear individual cases has 
now expanded to a year and a half. The number of cases is 
dropping year by year because people have given up coming 
before the commission asking for redress.
<P>
	I guess my question to the member is this. What does he think 
we should ask the human rights commission to stress? Should 
we try to get the time period for the commission to hear cases 
down from a year and a half to a more reasonable length of time? 
Should we be spending more and more of our time and energies 
on the group rights cases, some of them six and seven year 
cases? I just wonder what he thinks we should do.
<P>
	Should individuals have quicker access and more resources 
committed to their individual cases of discrimination? 
Personally I believe that is what should happen.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, I much appreciate the 
member's logical and far-reaching question. He will perhaps 
share my point of view when I remind him that the human rights 
commissioner appeared before our committee this morning. As 
you know, the Canadian Human Rights Commission has a 
budget of close to $14 million. We learned that the backlog to 
which my hon. colleague is referring represents almost 600 
cases.
<P>
	Of course, the ideal situation for any such organization would 
be no backlog at all. I agree with my colleague. From what I 
understand of the workings of the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission, a body whose work I follow rather closely, it is 
fairly diligent, and the backlog is, in my opinion, in the 
acceptable range, not ideal, but acceptable.
<P>
	Our colleague is right to remind us that, as parliamentarians, 
we must never accept a situation where the Canadian Human 
Rights Commission simply processes applications; it must also 
play a proactive role in developing policy. And it is my 
understanding that  Commissioner Yalden reiterated this 
morning that that was also part of the commission's action plan.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will share my time with the 
member for Halifax.
<P>
	My colleagues in speaking to Bill C-64 have eloquently 
stated the numerous reasons why Canada must strengthen the 
Employment Equity Act. The changes are clearly necessary on 
moral, social and economic grounds.
<P>
	I want to oppose this opposition motion and to demonstrate to 
the House that employment equity is good for the country. Let 
me remind the proposer of the motion that we brought forward 
Bill C-64 as progressive legislation that when enacted will 
quickly prove to be advantageous to both employers and 
employees.
<P>
	This initiative has been especially designed to improve the 
plight of disadvantaged Canadians while at the same time 
enhancing the country's economic performance. It strikes the 
right balance between the legitimate needs of the designated 
groups and the concerns of industry about excessive government 
intervention, because that is what equality is all about; 
achieving equilibrium.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	If the intent of the opposition motion is to satisfy business and 
industry concerns, the legislation will actually minimize the 
regulatory burden and cost to business by simplifying and 
streamlining procedures. All that is within the bill.
<P>
	The Employment Equity Act that is before the House will not 
tip the scales in anyone's favour but instead will serve the best 
interests of everyone in the country. Quite simply, employment 
equity is good for Canada.
<P>
	Canadians are proud of Canada's linguistic and multicultural 
diversity, so much so that we have enshrined equality in this 
country's Constitution. We believe firmly in ensuring the 
protection of individuals' rights, especially those most 
vulnerable to overt and systemic discrimination.
<P>
	Report after report, research study after research study, prove 
that discrimination is a disturbing fact of life for too many 
Canadians, marginalized from the mainstream because of their 
race, gender or physical attributes.
<P>
	I could go on to give the statistics because they disprove the 
suggestion that these individuals enjoy preferential treatment 
under the existing legislation. I would ask the opposition to 
support Bill C-64 because it incorporates constructive 
contributions of the many Canadians who appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Human Rights and the Status of 
Disabled Persons 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12978"> 12978 </A></B>
<P>
to ensure that they achieve a reasonable balance. Good 
employment equity deals with workplace problems in a fair and 
even handed way.
<P>
	Let me address some of the misconceptions that some people 
have about Bill C-64. First, we want to be quite clear that the 
government has no intention of legislating quotas. In fact the act 
specifically states that quotas cannot be imposed.
<P>
	Under the legislation, a quota is defined as a requirement to 
hire or promote a fixed and arbitrary number of persons during a 
given period. What the act calls for are numerical goals, goals 
based on the availability of qualified people to do a given job. 
That is because the philosophy underlying the act is merit, not 
tokenism.
<P>
	Under the provisions of Bill C-64, employers are responsible 
for setting goals and timetables to achieve greater equity in the 
workplace. The new law would oblige them to make reasonable 
efforts to achieve that objective.
<P>
	The legislation recognizes that employers are in the best 
position to develop meaningful and realistic equity targets. The 
role of government is to assess whether the employer's 
numerical goals constitute substantial progress and whether the 
organization is truly making reasonable efforts to fulfil them.
<P>
	The bill clearly states that if employers make a genuine effort 
to achieve greater equality in the workplace they will be found 
in compliance. The legislation also stipulates unequivocally 
that directions or compliance orders will not cause undue 
hardship for an employer, nor will it force firms to hire and 
promote unqualified people or create new positions in the 
workplace to satisfy numerical goals.
<P>
	I should point out as well that the creation of employment 
equity review tribunals to hear appeals will ensure the interest 
and concerns of all parties are properly addressed. Good 
employment equity means equality for all.
<P>
	There is no going back. We must move forward, removing the 
barriers to full involvement in Canadian society that have for 
too long been insurmountable and both a moral and economic 
imperative.
<P>
	Employment equity is not about instituting new rules and 
regulations that will result in so-called reverse discrimination. 
Neither is it an impediment to business. Good employment 
equity is instead a catalyst for progress.
<P>
	Workforce diversity allows us to capitalize on the under 
utilized talents and skills of more than half the country's 
population. That in turn enhances Canadian companies' 
competitiveness in the global economy.
<P>
	The fundamental issue at stake is far more important than the 
bottom line on the balance sheet. Only when each Canadian 
regardless of his or her country of origin, skin colour, gender or 
physical attribute is free to participate fully in the economic, 
social and civic life of the nation can we truly say we live in a 
just and caring society. Our world is far from ideal but with 
progressive  legislation like Bill C-64 we can help to reshape 
society in a way which will give visible minorities, aboriginal 
people, women and persons with disabilities hope for the 
present and confidence for the future.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Ultimately the employment equity challenge comes down to 
you and me, Madam Speaker. We cannot legislate attitudes. 
Progress depends on the willingness of each one of us to uphold 
the principles of equality enshrined in the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	The motion today would almost reverse Bill C-64 and it 
should be strongly opposed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
was very interested that it is not a quota when we set a numerical 
goal. I am having a little difficulty with that concept.
<P>
	I came to the House with what I call coffee shop common 
sense. If I were to take this into any coffee shop in any town in 
my constituency and ask the people the difference between a 
numerical goal and a quota, I can imagine the same kind of 
stunned look which must be on my face would be on their faces. I 
do not understand.
<P>
	I find it astounding the way the Liberals have taken to 
wordsmithing. They say it is not a quota, they do not want 
anything to do with quotas but they will have numerical goals. I 
am missing something.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You are.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> The Liberal members are telling me I am 
missing something. However, maybe I could inform the 
parliamentary secretary of something that happened to me as 
revenue critic.
<P>
	I was in the Toronto airport going through the customs section 
being toured around by a black woman from Jamaica. She was 
telling me how concerned she was that the government seemed 
to be so set on the idea of creating the problem that she would be 
in a different category, someone special.
<P>
	That is the coffee shop common sense of more than 80 per cent 
of Canadians who are saying the government does not know 
where it is coming from. The government does not have a clue 
what is happening as far as the people in Canada are concerned. 
The people in Canada, including the woman who gave me the 
tour around the customs section, simply want equal opportunity. 
They do not want something legislated in which there are to be 
some kind of numerical goals. She does not want numerical 
goals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12979"> 12979 </A></B>
<P>
	I report to the parliamentary secretary that this woman said: 
``I am a capable person. I have my position because I am a 
capable person, not because I am a woman and not because I am 
black. I do not want anything to do with numerical quotas or 
anything else like that''.
<P>
	I do not understand. Maybe the parliamentary secretary can 
help me and help this wonderful woman who gave me the tour to 
understand why a numerical goal is not a quota. Explain that, 
please.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Madam Speaker, I rest my case on the 
member's statement. I am reminded of a verse I learned when I 
was very young: ``There is none so blind as those who will not 
see. There is none so deaf as those who will not hear. A man 
convinced against his will is of the same opinion still''.
<P>
	I wonder if there is a will to understand. I wonder if there is a 
will to comprehend the whole notion of equity, equality and 
diversity, ensuring everyone in society who for various reasons 
is taken to the starting line with the word go cannot make the 
same progress because of various institutional, systemic and 
other things built into the system.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	As an educator I can define quota and numerical goals to the 
member who I think is convinced against his will and will be of 
the same opinion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member, with 
whom we have had this discussion before.
<P>
	I still do not know the difference between a numerical goal 
and quota. Perhaps the member would like to explain that again.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Madam Speaker, this is 1995. We have done 
several things in society to ensure we address equity issues. The 
member and his party should have a day or a few hours of work 
with someone who would spend some time taking them through 
the process. It is a red herring and a waste of House time to be 
addressing those two items.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I make 
an offer to the Reform Party if it is serious.
<P>
	In my former profession one of the things I did was gender 
sensitivity training, particularly for large organizations. I 
explained concepts such as this to St. Francis Xavier University. 
I am sure the members for Fraser Valley East and West would be 
happy to attend. I would be happy to do this if hon. members 
could afford me because my fees were fairly high in those days. 
However, we can always negotiate.
<P>
	It is wonderful to be back after a week's break and share in the 
cloud cuckoo land sometimes perpetrated on us by our hon. 
friends in the third party. They seem to be saying by this motion 
that there is no discrimination in  Canadian society except for 
specific and regrettable incidents here and there.
<P>
	To hear them talk, we have reached a state of blissful equality. 
They tell us that after a few decades of human rights law any of 
the many and obvious differences in representation in the 
workplace are now really a matter of personal choice. By their 
logic, visible minorities, aboriginal people and people with 
disabilities like being unemployed more, to the tune of 
sometimes more than twice the national average.
<P>
	They talk about women. There are a lot of us sitting on this 
side. We want to make less money than men. Maybe we as 
members of Parliament should suggest women members should 
not make as much money as men. That might be a good idea. 
Women want to make 67 cents for every dollar men make.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> In your case they will make an exception.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> They certainly would not. They are telling 
Canadians they are to blame for whatever fate befalls them in 
the labour market unless they can prove a specific act of 
discrimination.
<P>
	When I come to give my seminar to the Reform Party-in the 
interest of the Canadian way I might even do it for free-I will 
be happy to explain the concept of systemic discrimination, 
what it means and how we differentiate between quotas and 
numerical goals. We have learned that change does come but it 
comes slowly and needs regular reinforcement and constant 
support by government and legislation.
<P>
	As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister has 
already said and I can only reinforce, one cannot legislate 
attitudes. If members need an example of this, look across the 
way.
<P>
	Many employers have taken their role in employment equity 
quite seriously. They have taken a hard look at their practices 
and they see they are not fair. They have moved from simply 
trying to eliminate blatantly unjust policies to developing ones 
that correct problems.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	People like my hon. colleagues have brought forth in their 
idea of jest the question in so far as it relates to women and 
employment equity. They ask about men's groups, are there any 
men's groups? Yes, there are. It is called western civilization. 
There is a long way to go. There are still inequalities that 
deserve to be addressed.
<P>
	I bring these to the attention of the hon. members opposite. I 
will focus my remarks on the cold, hard statistical facts that 
show we have a problem when it comes to equality. They can 
bury their heads in the sand but all they will do is get sand up 
their noses.
<P>
	Let me start with one piece of good news. Members of visible 
minorities who graduated from universities and community 
colleges in 1990 earned approximately the same average salary 
in 1992 as others who graduated that year but they did not fair as 
well in the other three measures of disadvantaged. Those 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12980"> 12980 </A></B>
<P>
graduates were more  likely to be unemployed, had lower 
participation rates and were more likely to be concentrated in 
lower level occupations such as clerical work.
<P>
	There is plenty of other evidence that members of visible 
minorities face overwhelming difficulties in employment. The 
1991 census showed these people tend to be better educated than 
the general population. Eighteen per cent reported a university 
degree compared with only 11 per cent in the general 
population. Again, they tend to have higher unemployment 
rates.
<P>
	The unemployment rate of visible minority university 
graduates was 9.4 per cent in that census, whereas in the general 
population it was 4.1 per cent. Does that say something to my 
friends opposite? Heaven knows.
<P>
	Among those who were working, visible minority university 
graduates were twice as likely to be in low levels, clerical, sales 
and service occupations, as non-visible minority men. That 
imbalance was reversed when the census looked at employment 
in upper levels, middle levels and other management jobs.
<P>
	Some of my hon. friends might argue it was just the kinds of 
programs these people took. Even here the facts provide no 
comfort to their narrow view. When we look at the census data 
for people with degrees in commerce, business or management 
we are looking at people with degrees in tangible skills 
regardless of race or colour.
<P>
	Why were 28 per cent of non-visible minority males with this 
kind of useful education in management occupations compared 
with only 16 per cent of visible minority members with similar 
degrees? Why were the earnings of visible minorities only 60 
per cent of what the others made? It is ludicrous for anyone to 
stand in the House and suggest all this comes back to bad 
choices.
<P>
	I hope enough facts will show hon. members of the Reform 
Party their glib explanations do not work in real life. I remind 
them, especially those who want to make inroads in my part of 
the world, that in Atlantic Canada we understand the questions 
of inequality. If they want to make inroads there perhaps they 
had better listen to some of this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> You'll be thrown out in the 
next election anyway.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Right, you and whose army? The unemployment 
rate for white males with university degrees was just 4.1 per cent 
in the 1991 census. Compare that with 7 per cent for university 
educated aboriginal peoples and 10.9 per cent for persons with 
disabilities with the same academic background.
<P>
	The situation facing people with disabilities is particularly 
bad. They are being hired at a rate that is only one-quarter of the 
representation in the Canadian workforce. They experience an 
unemployment rate of 18.5 per cent, double the national 
average. Is it any wonder their labour force participation rate is 
only 60 per cent?
<P>
	I could go on: the situation facing aboriginal people not just 
on isolated reserves but in our cities; the situation facing women 
who are disproportionately found in clerical, sales and service 
occupations, what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime 
Minister and I in our years as feminists-and proud we are to use 
that term-know as the pink collar occupations, the job ghettos. 
Stories of these people have been told eloquently already.
<P>
	During the recent hearings of the Standing Committee on 
Human Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons approximately 
60 witnesses came forward to share their experiences and 
expectations. They came from many backgrounds but the vast 
majority supported this legislation based on their real life 
experience, not some theory they posit in their group of white 
males getting along just fine and do not want the hoards of those 
people knocking at their gates.
<P>
	Look out, the gates are being knocked on and they are being 
knocked on hard.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	The committee heard stories of broken dreams. It heard 
stories of sincere desires to become full participating members 
of society. Witnesses did not appear before the committee to 
seek a special deal. Witnesses appeared before that committee to 
seek fairness. That is what we as members of Parliament have to 
start giving. Those people on the other side of the House need to 
learn a little bit about that.
<P>
	Witnesses did not ask for redress for the wrongs of the past. 
They wanted attention to the wrongs that are happening right 
now. These are not the kinds of wrongs human rights 
commissions can address through individual complaints. These 
are systemic discrimination that can only be got at by being 
rooted out and dug out through things like the Employment 
Equity Act.
<P>
	The problems have little or nothing to do with evidence of 
overt discrimination. They have everything to do with removing 
barriers and implementing innovative solutions.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, Reformers seem to seize on the odd statistic that 
this law has had some impact. They see one improvement in 
some indicator and declare that the war on inequality has been 
won: strike down the law and send home the troops. Well not so 
fast. The battle is not over.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> She is Madam 
Speaker. Let us have a little equity here.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I know she is Madam Speaker. She is not going 
to get upset with that. We know each other very well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12981"> 12981 </A></B>
<P>
	This law is an effort to address problems that are still very 
much with us as one last fact will prove. Max Yalden, the 
Canadian human rights chair, recently noted that while white 
male Canadians make up just 45 per cent of the workforce, they 
account for 55 per cent of all the hirings. I think that is 
discriminatory.
<P>
	I urge my hon. friends to put away their ideological blinders 
and listen, really listen to the needs of all Canadians. I reiterate 
my offer to help.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am glad the hon. member had a chance to sit down to 
collect her thoughts because she obviously did not before she 
started to talk.
<P>
	Would she tell us the difference, a last time, between a 
numerical target and a quota? Lyn McLeod, the Liberal leader in 
Ontario says there is no difference between a numerical target 
and a quota. She says there is no difference and that is why when 
she gets to be premier, heaven forbid, she will eliminate 
numerical targets. She says they are the same as quotas. That is 
what the Liberal leader in Ontario says.
<P>
	Would the hon. member like to correct her Liberal provincial 
colleague or does she agree with her?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, I am delighted to deal with the 
hon. member's question. I have not been following the election 
in Ontario perhaps as closely as I should because with the 
greatest of respect to my colleagues from Ontario, some of 
whom are here in this Chamber now, Ontario is not always the 
centre of the universe for those of us from Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	If Mrs. McLeod has indeed made these comments that is Mrs. 
McLeod's outlook. I suggest the hon. member for Fraser Valley 
East should discuss that with her.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> She is a Liberal, a provincial Liberal.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> But I am from Nova Scotia and we do not have a 
problem with these questions in Nova Scotia as Premier Savage 
could tell the member. We have employment equity on the books 
in Nova Scotia and it is working well.
<P>
	As to the difference between quotas and numerical targets, let 
me do this very, very slowly so there will be no difficulty with 
comprehension. Let me remind them again that I used to get paid 
to do this for groups like theirs but the afflicted need assistance 
and I am happy to help.
<P>
	A quota. Do we understand percentages? A whole can be 
turned into 100 per cent. Do we understand that? Let us say we 
decided we needed a quota of Reformers to be allowed to go and 
see a movie. Let us say there are 100 seats in the movie theatre. 
We will give 25 per cent of those seats or 25 seats to the Reform 
Party. There will be 25 Reformers there and the other 75 people 
will not be Reformers. That is the quota, okay?
<P>
	On the other hand, consider a target. I understand why you 
gentlemen have difficulty with this. The concept is, to a degree, 
a bit more intellectual, a bit more inspirational than a hard and 
fast, let us cut the block out of the square.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	The answer is to look at the whole picture and say, there are all 
sorts of Reformers who need the education that this movie can 
give. Let us look at the number of Reformers that we feel 
through their merit could understand what it is we are trying to 
teach. Rather than saying Reformers will get 25 seats, it may 
well be that only 18 of them will get in because only 18 of them 
will have the wherewithal to handle it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
find the attitude just expressed to be absolutely the most 
condescending pile of brown smelly stuff. I just find it 
absolutely astounding.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would request that the 
member rephrase his comment. The time has almost expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Madam Speaker, I apologize to you and to the 
House for my indiscretion.
<P>
	However, I still find it absolutely astounding that the member 
has not explained the difference. Now she has added to it, if I 
understood her explanation, that she or the government will be 
the judge of who is going to be competent and capable of being 
able to do this. I do not understand this.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, I am awfully glad I have the 
opportunity to address this. There are employment equity 
commissions, not the government. There are employment equity 
officers and there is an entire set up. Read the bill.
<P>
	I am sure that the hon. member for Fraser Valley East would 
not be caught this way because I am sure as the author of the 
motion he understands what the bill is doing and what, indeed, 
the history of employment equity in his province is.
<P>
	I am somewhat shocked that my hon. colleague for Kootenay 
East would be this way. Again, in closing I reiterate my offer. If 
they would like to call my office, I would be happy to set up a 
seminar but I think maybe we ought to do it on a pay as you go 
basis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, some of the comments are indeed condescending. I 
would like to get back to some of the more practical aspects of 
what we are talking about in employment equity today. I would 
remind you, Madam Speaker, that I am dividing my time with 
my hon. colleague.
<P>
	I would like to begin by quoting Booker T. Washington who 
said: ``I have always been made sad when I have heard members 
of any race claiming rights and privileges or certain badges of 
distinction on the grounds simply that they were members of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12982"> 12982 </A></B>
<P>
this or that  race, regardless of their individual worth or 
attainments''. I suppose that says a great deal to what this debate 
is all about.
<P>
	I have always struggled with the employment equity situation 
in terms of whether or not it is right or wrong or how it is 
applied. I think to a great degree we are trying to accomplish 
fairness and equality in the country regardless of race, colour, 
creed or religion. I am not entirely satisfied that we can legislate 
equality and attitudes or legislate how best to achieve the results 
of a fair and caring society.
<P>
	We get into all kinds of issues with employment equity. I want 
to relate two. First, in my past life I happened to be the chief 
executive officer of operations for a fairly large organization, a 
school district of some 1,500 employees. I often wondered how 
we could legislate hiring equity with 1,500 employees. If we 
look at the area I come from, there is a very large number of 
Indo-Canadian people.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	If we were to take that ratio and a ratio of male-female which 
is probably around 50:50, I wonder how that kind of equity 
would be applied to the organization I ran. Within that 
organization a large number of employees were female and I 
would suggest that they were white and of younger ages.
<P>
	To turn around and apply employment equity ratios, 
numerical goals or quotas which are one and the same, to that 
organization, I do not believe would practically work. The ratio 
has to be applied back at the universities, in the bachelor of 
education courses taught at university. Then that ratio would 
have to be applied back at the high school level, to the graduates 
for acceptance into university.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> That is what they do in the states.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> As my colleague says, that 
is what they do in some states, and it does not work practically.
<P>
	What has to be done when bringing people into organizations 
like the one I managed is to bring them in as they were on the 
basis of the career they chose a long time ago, based on their 
ability to pass courses, on their personal desire to teach young 
people and so on and so forth. To legislate employment equity in 
an organization like that would be near impossible. It just does 
not work.
<P>
	People from all over the world reside in my community. Many 
businesses and companies I have visited even recently have 
almost exclusively been owned and operated by people from 
Laos, Cambodia and other countries. We could look at that and 
say if we want to enforce or legislate numerical goals or quotas, 
it could actually work in the reverse. There are some people 
missing out of here from the community so let us go back and 
change all of the ratios. That is not practical.
<P>
	I do note from the community I live in that I do not see the bias 
we are talking about here from the Liberal ranks. I do not see the 
necessity of having that quota, that numerical goal. I am sure 
people in my community would be quite opposed to the thought 
that might happen.
<P>
	A number of times we have heard Liberal members talk about 
numerical goals. They say that numerical goals in employment 
equity are not quotas, that they are something else. We just pick 
a number and say this many people have to be hired.
<P>
	If we look at something like the supply management system in 
this country, we should say that there are no quotas in supply 
management, just numerical goals. I do not think the folks 
across the way really know what the heck they are talking about 
when they talk about numerical goals and quotas. They are 
legislating something here that the rest of Canada is going to 
have to live with for a long time. They are making a very grave 
mistake.
<P>
	We only have to look as far as the official bilingualism 
program to see what they are trying to legislate. They tried to 
legislate a country into an attitude that everything shall be 
equal. In fact, they would hire a number of investigators to 
ensure that the official bilingualism policy would be fulfilled 
and put into place. If not, there would be penalties.
<P>
	That is exactly what the Liberals are talking about here. They 
are talking about a large number of people within a department 
to make darn good and sure that employment equity is put in 
place. If it is not put in place, maybe they should be given a fine.
<P>
	My experience is that we cannot legislate attitudes. One 
cannot legislate that which people will not do. What we have to 
do in this country is make fair and reasonable application to all 
people. We must have a country where all people are equal, 
regardless of race, colour, creed or religion. That is what has to 
be done and we have to have it up here. We do not legislate or 
mandate it.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	I am reminded of two young fellows who came into my office 
not long ago holding a piece of paper. It was an application for a 
scholarship from a very large company in British Columbia. It 
had to do with scholarships for pre-apprentice electricians. 
What these young fellows were concerned about was that it was 
only available to aboriginal people, visible minorities, the 
special needy and women. I had to explain to them that my 
feeling was the company was trying to increase its employment 
equity. They did not understand that. They truly did not. They 
thought things were based on abilities, skills, work experience 
and so on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12983"> 12983 </A></B>
<P>
	Once the bill goes through and we have more employment 
equity rules and regulations, I am not sure how we can explain 
that to them. I sincerely hope the Liberal government will have 
an answer because the people do not understand. It is not as easy 
as chalking it off, as the Liberals would say, to a bunch of dumb 
Reformers. That is not the case. We should get off that kind of 
rhetoric. I think Liberals have some explaining to do as to how 
the legislation will really work.
<P>
	There are a lot of examples in society in which governments 
get too far involved in what they think is right and they legislate 
it, which is exactly where this government is going. I often 
comment in the House about the arrogance of a party much 
resembling the arrogance of the Conservative Party when it held 
a large majority. I would caution the government very closely 
that it not get carried away with its arrogance in its legislation. It 
should look at the employment equity legislation and consider 
that all Canadians today consider themselves equal, regardless 
of race, colour, creed or religion. Do not try to legislate it. Put it 
in your hearts and in your minds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
noted in my colleague's speech that he made the comment that it 
is impossible to legislate attitude. I found it rather instructive 
that when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister was 
on her feet speaking today she made exactly the same comment: 
it is impossible to legislate attitude.
<P>
	I cannot help but wonder why it is that the Liberals have 
difficulty understanding that they cannot legislate attitude when 
the parliamentary secretary says it and it is obviously agreed to 
by my colleague from Fraser Valley West. In fact, they are 
getting involved in social engineering to try to redress a 
situation by way of legislation when 80 per cent of the people in 
the coffee shops across Canada say they do not want any part of 
it.
<P>
	The problem I am having is when I raised the question with 
members opposite, asking them to explain why the leader of the 
Ontario Liberal Party says that goals are the same thing as 
quotas, I have not yet had one explanation from the other side as 
to why there seems to be such a discrepancy in this never-never 
land that these people in Ottawa are in, bringing forward 
legislation that 80 per cent of Canadians do not want. They do 
not seem to understand.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	I wonder if my colleague could help me understand why the 
Liberals in Ottawa seem to be so grossly out of touch with 
reality and certainly out of touch with the attitude of the 
majority of Canadians on this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, this was 
not a loaded question at all.
<P>
	I think most people who come here from all regions of the 
country understand that there is a certain amount of being out of 
touch with Canadian reality in Ottawa. I think it prevails where 
there is a majority government,  which is less and less in touch 
with the people. The reason for that is that for five years those in 
power do not have to work as hard as the party in opposition to 
get things accomplished. They come into the House and say 
``this is what Canadians want, because they elected us, and this 
is what we are darned well going to give them''. There is a 
certain amount of hypocrisy and arrogance in what we see in the 
legislation passing through this House.
<P>
	I do not think for a moment that what these folks are trying to 
push off onto the rest of Canada, and which we are going to have 
to live with for the rest of our lives or until they are removed 
from office, is representative of what many people in this 
country are seeing. What we have here again is an attempt to 
legislate what people will be given not necessarily what people 
want.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will be very brief. I listened to what the hon. member had to say 
and, like the rest of us, was also invited by the member for 
Fraser Valley East to cross the Rockies and visit the rest of the 
country. I must tell him that I have already done so.
<P>
	I would like to return the favour and invite the Reform 
member to visit my fair province, Quebec. I found the hon. 
member's statement a little irresponsible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
We are speaking of employment equity. The member refers to 
employment equity and brings biculturalism and bilingualism 
into the debate.
<P>
	I would like to put him on the defensive. The proof is in 
Quebec, where being bilingual gives more job opportunities. 
With the emerging economy today and with North American 
free trade there are now schools in Quebec offering Spanish as a 
third or fourth language. So how can he bring that into the debate 
and say that he is against bilingualism when he is for 
employment equity and opportunities for all people, especially 
the youth of today? It is ironic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
member totally misunderstood what I was talking about. The 
fact is I mentioned the bilingualism issue not as an issue that fits 
in with employment equity but as an example of how the 
government challenges the strength of the Canadian fabric by 
issuing law to its people when it gets a majority government. 
They have totally misunderstood what I was talking about.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry but the time 
has more than expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, employment equity is discriminatory. It is also 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12984"> 12984 </A></B>
<P>
illegal. Subsection 12(3) of the Public Service Employment Act 
states: ``It is illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, gender 
and colour''.
<P>
	Employment equity seeks to institutionalize what we seek to 
avoid. We seek to avoid discrimination, but instead it brings it 
right into the workplace. It tells a minority group: ``You cannot 
compete on the basis of merit. Therefore, we in the government 
are going to create opportunities for you to advance on the basis 
of your demographics and not on the basis of merit.'' It makes an 
issue of gender and it makes an issue of race and geographic 
location when none ought to exist. In fact when we speak to 
minority groups we find it is an insult to them.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	The purpose we have in this country is to give minority groups 
and disadvantaged groups the opportunity to become the best 
they can become. This legislation tries to enable them to have a 
fair share of jobs, a fair share based on numbers.
<P>
	We have had this discussion in the House. The government 
says it is in favour of numerical goals, not quotas. Quotas and 
numerical goals are synonymous. There is no difference. As I 
said before, it is discriminatory. All we need to do is look at the 
fine institution of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to see 
that white males need not apply.
<P>
	What we want to have in this country is equal opportunity. We 
must have a country in which everybody has an equal chance to 
become the best they can be, to employ the talents, the drive and 
the initiative they have in their hearts to do whatever they can. 
Canada is one of the few countries in the world that has enabled 
us to do that.
<P>
	If someone chooses not to do this of their own will, if they 
choose not to take the opportunities that are provided for them, 
then it is not the government's role to do this through other 
means. That is where we have a significant departure in logic 
and understanding. We feel it is not the government's role to go 
out and push people when they do not have the initiative, push 
people to get skills for something they choose not to do. We are 
in favour of providing everyone in this country with the 
opportunity to get those skills.
<P>
	Many people came to this country as immigrants, including 
myself. We came to get away from countries where preferential 
policies existed. The idea of preferential treatment, being 
treated unequally, has occurred in many countries. People have 
left that to come to our fair shores. In fact the idea of treating 
people equally on the basis of merit is something that is new and 
it is something we should all try to strive for.
<P>
	Some view employment equity as a way of decreasing 
discrimination but in fact the opposite is true. Employment 
equity increases discrimination causes animosities, plays up 
differences and creates resentment.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, imagine if you will if you were going to 
apply for a job and people said that you would not get this job on 
the basis of your merit, but because you are a woman or a 
minority group or an aboriginal person you are going to get this 
job. Imagine what that would say to you and your feelings about 
your own credibility. It is, as I said before, an insult.
<P>
	I would just like to say to minority groups-and I am a 
mixture of many different minority groups-that we cannot 
legislate against people's prejudices. If people call you 
derogatory names, that is their problem, not yours. However, we 
must ensure that those prejudices do not interfere with a 
person's ability to get a job and function in society.
<P>
	We must look at real life examples too with employment 
equity. Why is this government pushing employment equity 
when California, a state of numerous ethnic groups, ethnically 
heterogeneous as it can be, is throwing it out? They have found it 
is costly and ineffective.
<P>
	We have 11 programs in this country that are sanctioned by 
the Treasury Board. They are called special measures 
initiatives. Between 1985 and 1988 they cost between $11 
million and $15 million per year. In 1992 the pass rate for 
women was 63 per cent and visible minorities 79 per cent. This 
year the pass rate is 30 per cent for women and 52 per cent for 
minorities. It is a failure and it is costly. Why do we continue to 
pursue this endeavour which has proven not to work?
<P>
	I have heard this government claim it is against 
discrimination and it is for justice and caring. Employment 
equity does not do this. It does the exact opposite. It also does 
that at the expense of what should be the primary guiding role in 
getting a job, and that is merit. It also does this at the expense of 
minority groups, as I said before, and it is insulting to them. 
When we speak to the rank and file of Canadians who are of 
minority groups in this country, they all say that they do not 
want employment equity. They want to be treated fairly, equally 
and without discrimination.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	The leaders of minority groups often take a different role, but 
their role is the role of politics not necessarily the role of 
fairness. I would listen to the silent minority not to the verbose 
leaders of some groups who do not necessarily represent the 
people they are supposed to represent.
<P>
	Let us look at the facts. As government members have said, 
there is no difference between minority groups and 
non-minority groups. We need to work toward everybody with 
the same qualifications being paid the same amount of money 
for doing the same job. These are the rules we have in the 
country and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12985"> 12985 </A></B>
<P>
these are the rules we need to strongly support. The Reform 
Party is vehemently in favour of these rules.
<P>
	There are differences between employment statistics and the 
types of jobs of various minority groups. As I  asked before, is 
this the fault of discrimination or is this the fault of differences 
in qualifications and societal determinants? We have laws and 
regulations with respect to qualifications in Canada. A 
qualification from another country may not be recognized in this 
country in the same way. That is not unfair. A doctorate or a 
bachelor of science or a trade from another country may not 
have the same merit as the same program here regardless of 
whether or not it involves a minority group. We ought to keep 
that in mind.
<P>
	I would like to give an example of drive. Recently I was on an 
aboriginal reserve wracked with a lot of tragedies: high suicide 
rate, high unemployment rate and depression. However, when 
these people were asked to do the simplest things for themselves 
they continually put forth that they wanted us to do it for them. I 
asked them to teach their own children some of their history and 
culture which they were capable of doing, but they chose not to 
do it. They wanted somebody else to do it for them. By doing 
things for themselves and by taking the initiative they could 
build pride and self-respect, which would go a long way to 
decreasing the societal duress in many of these groups.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party are vehemently opposed to 
discrimination. We believe in creating a strong, level playing 
field for all people regardless of their colour, race or gender. We 
want to create laws, have laws and enforce laws that are 
anti-discriminatory. Discrimination is a cancer within our midst 
that needs to be stepped on wherever it is found. We need to 
build bridges between people. We need to cherish our 
differences. We need to learn from each other. We are very lucky 
in Canada to have over 165 different ethnic groups. What a joy 
and a privilege for all of us to learn from other people and other 
cultures in a safe environment.
<P>
	I am glad we are a lot like the United States. I am glad we are 
not like many of the other countries in the world that do not 
enjoy the freedoms we have. However we fight against 
employment equity because it flies in the face of fairness and 
equality. It separates people rather than bring them together.
<P>
	Canada is a model at bringing people together. I ask the 
government to reconsider its role and views on employment 
equity and to reconsider the idea that it is not up to government 
to elevate people to a standard they are not capable of achieving 
or choosing to do themselves. It is the role of the government to 
enable people to have an equal playing field free of 
discrimination.
<P>
	We do not live in a perfect society, but we must continue to 
work toward a fair and equitable society with peace and fairness 
for all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have a couple of comments to make after listening to 
the member.
<P>
	I found it very ironic, if I may say so, because often we hear 
from the Reform Party how it compares Canada to the United 
States. In the member's presentation he compared us to 
California and the United States. Not too long ago the leader of 
the Reform Party visited Mr. Gingrich of the United States, at 
which point he said: ``We don't do things the way you do in the 
United States''. Yet all of a sudden they want to compare us to 
California.
<P>
	I want to go beyond that point because it seems to me they 
want to suck and blow at the same time.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	I refer to an article about Reform in the House that states: 
``Reformers cast themselves as the official opposition but they 
have a few flaws''. I believe the flaws keep flopping back and 
forth.
<P>
	In my private life I came from the employment industry. I 
would like to give a specific example of some problems that had 
to be overcome. A major retailer wanted to hire a computer 
operator. In that area there were rotating shifts, sometimes 
eight-hour shifts, sometimes twelve-hour shifts three days 
consecutively or five days a week.
<P>
	The employer indicated to my firm that he was adamant he did 
not want to hire a female simply because there were rotating 
shifts. Somehow or some way we convinced the employer to hire 
a female. I am proud to say today, six years down the road, the 
female is still with the company. She has been promoted three 
times and is doing an excellent job. What would have happened 
if the placement agency decided to listen to the employer and be 
swayed by him that because she was a female she could not work 
shift work?
<P>
	I am proud to say the legislation will open avenues, allowing 
people to go ahead, move forward and compete for jobs equally. 
I believe employers will hire based on merit, not just on the fact 
that someone is oriental, black, male or female.
<P>
	I encourage the party across the way to stop posturing and 
being intellectually dishonest with the people of Canada. 
Reformers cannot have it both ways. They either compare us to 
the United States or they do not. They cannot keep 
flip-flopping.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Madam Speaker, 
employment equity is about hiring people on the basis of colour, 
gender and other demographic characteristics.
<P>
	Who cares if one is female or male, black or white, brown or 
polka-dotted? We do not. We only want to make sure that when 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12986"> 12986 </A></B>
<P>
people go for jobs they are treated on the basis of merit. That is 
all that counts in getting a job. That is all we care about other 
than providing and ensuring there are laws against 
discrimination.
<P>
	Regarding what I said about the United States, California has 
employment equity laws. We do not want them. I point out to the 
hon. member that we should learn from the mistake they made in 
the United States. They are trying to rectify it. We should learn 
from their enforcement of employment equity in California that 
it did not work. Let us learn from them. We should show 
Americans that we are different from them and better than them 
by not partaking in it.
<P>
	Our goals are the same. In some ways the goals of the 
government and the Reform Party with respect to the 
overarching theory are the same. We do not want discrimination. 
We are vehemently opposed to discrimination on any ground.
<P>
	The flaw in the government is that employment equity 
engenders discrimination. By its very nature it is saying that one 
group of people cannot compete on the basis of merit and should 
be elevated over another group. That is discrimination against 
the other group. That is unfair. We cannot right the wrongs of 
historical injustice by creating discriminatory laws now. We 
cannot right the wrongs of the past by tipping the scales in 
favour or against a group.
<P>
	We must create a level playing field, treat people on the basis 
of merit and have anti-discriminatory laws to create a country of 
which we can all be proud.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the Reform Party put forward today the 
following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House deplore the government's employment equity policy as 
unnecessary, ineffective, costly, unpopular, intrusive, discriminatory and 
harmful to designated and non-designated groups; that this House recognize 
the equality of all Canadians by affirming that hiring and promotion be based 
solely on merit rather than on gender and race; and that discriminatory 
employment practices be more vigorously pursued on an individual case by 
case basis.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I come from a family farm in rural Saskatchewan. Whenever 
work was available it did not matter much what one's gender or 
colour was. My sister was involved in the work on the farm. It 
did not matter what task was at hand. She was able to do it as 
ably as anyone else on the farm. We are proud of her abilities to 
tackle any task at hand.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	It is with that approach we should be looking at employment 
opportunities. We should be looking at the skills of the 
applicants rather than at the colour of their skin, their gender or 
some other distinguishing mark or blemish, if one would be so 
bold as to use that word.
<P>
	It gives me pleasure today to speak on the issue of 
employment equity or what I would rather call preferential 
hiring or affirmative action, a concept that is failing around the 
world wherever it has been tried. The specific area I should like 
to address is the government's definition of equality. Equality 
has been loosely defined as equality of numerical representation 
in the workforce.
<P>
	For example, if 5 per cent of our available workforce is made 
up of visible minorities each employer's workforce should 
reflect the 5 per cent. In order for the government to move 
toward equality of numerical representation, it must obtain an 
accurate statistical base showing the representation of 
designated groups.
<P>
	However, accuracy of statistical base depends on 
self-identification and here we have a huge problem. The 
government has stressed that self-identification is the backbone 
of the employment equity program. There are a number of 
problems, however, with the self-identification process.
<P>
	The Stentor group, testifying before the human rights 
committee, stated that employee data collected by means of the 
self-identification process was unreliable. Many employees are 
reluctant to participate in the self-identification process 
because often there is a loss of legitimacy in the eyes of fellow 
workers. Most individuals would rather have their promotions 
and benefits based on merit than on gender or race.
<P>
	I will use an example that is very close to home. The Clerk of 
the House of Commons appeared before the committee on April 
27 and stated that a voluntary self-identification survey was 
sent to 1,700 House of Commons employees. Shockingly, only 
23 per cent of the employees returned the survey. Of that number 
less than 50 identified themselves as belonging to a designated 
group. From these numbers it would be next to impossible to 
implement an accurate employment equity plan.
<P>
	It does not work. It does not work on the Hill. How will it work 
across the country? Yet the Liberals are committed to 
employment equity. They think they can legislate it. They are 
absolutely wrong.
<P>
	Difficulties also arise in determining who should belong to 
the designated groups. For instance, should a person of mixed 
parentage be counted as a visible minority? Why? Why not? 
Should a third generation visible minority Canadian be thought 
of as disadvantaged as a new citizen from the third world? Why? 
Why not? These questions need to be addressed by the 
government.
<P>
	There are also problems in defining what constitutes a 
disability. If I were to wear glasses I would be considered 
disabled. It is ridiculous. This list goes on and on. It shows how 
complicated and interwoven the problems surrounding the 
whole employment equity affirmative action programs become. 
Yet the Liberals in their red book are committed to this terrible 
policy, this impossibility.
<P>
	Another concern is with regard to intrusive behaviour in the 
identification process to know who are the minorities. To get the 
statistics surveys have to be done, which means employers and 
employees have to comply. Yet the right of individuals to refuse 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12987"> 12987 </A></B>
<P>
self-identification is an important privacy right. The boundaries 
of consent to self-identify are already being blurred.
<P>
	In March 1995 the Department of National Defence issued a 
diversity questionnaire to all employees. The first section was 
compulsory, requiring personal information such as name and 
address. It was pretty basic stuff. The second self-identification 
section was voluntary. By requiring partial information the 
department obtained knowledge of all those who refused to 
self-identify. It is a serious problem. It is an invasion of a 
person's privacy.
<P>
	They already know now who refuses to identify themselves as 
being in a visible minority, a group that might qualify for special 
assistance under any kind of equity employment program. It is 
intrusive. It is wrong. It is a violation of some basic rights as 
Canadians. Some members of designated groups can now be 
approached by the national defence managers and be pressured 
to respond or asked to agree to be identified under the authority 
of section 17(3) of the proposed Liberal legislation, Bill C-64, 
where only those employees who agree to be identified are to be 
counted.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Employers can use a variety of informal methods and pressure 
to persuade employees to give consent for self-identification. 
To make any part of a self-identification questionnaire 
compulsive is coercive. The use of personal information for 
anything other than department wide statistics should be 
unacceptable. Any that are made necessary by requirement are 
inherently wrong and are another weakness of employment 
equity.
<P>
	The government is saying that if a person is a visible minority 
there is a greater likelihood that person will be disadvantaged. I 
do not accept that. I think that is wrong. Why should certain 
visible minority groups which earn some of the top incomes in 
the country qualify for employment action programs? It does not 
make sense when others who are not visible minorities are 
passed over.
<P>
	I would like to give the House an example of how ludicrous 
the whole concept of employment equity, gender equity or race 
based equity can become. A law program at a university in the 
province of Ontario undertook what it called an equal 
opportunity approach to education. Essentially it was trying to 
get a certain number of visible minorities into the law 
profession, which is an admirable goal. However, what it did 
was not so admirable. On the law school application was a 
question whether the applicant was a visible minority. I am not 
too certain why being a visible minority would make someone a 
better candidate for law school. I do not understand why that 
would be the case.
<P>
	That is just the tip of the iceberg. The students in the law 
school are segregated during exams between those who are 
visible minorities and those who are not visible minorities. 
Those individuals who are visible minorities are given eight 
hours to write exams, while those who are not visible minorities 
are given four hours. In addition, visible minorities are given 
special access to tutors that is not available to other students. To 
make matters worse,  those who were not visible minorities were 
kept in the dark about the university's policies.
<P>
	The type of approach taken by the university is doing visible 
minorities a disservice. Can you imagine getting a law degree 
from that university and it becoming common knowledge that 
you had twice the time to write the exam or that you were given 
special tutoring? I am sure the demand for those students would 
be half as great as for those who followed the regular course. 
Employment equity or equal opportunity, when it becomes 
based on gender, race or some other distinguishing mark of a 
visible minority, it is ludicrous and ridiculous.
<P>
	It is insulting to visible minorities that the only reason they 
are in law school or they are hired is because of their skin colour, 
their gender or any reason other than their ability and their 
merit. Instead they should be given the message that they are 
qualified to be there, that they have skills, intellect and the 
determination to get the job done, whether it be to get a law 
degree or to get a job.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to talk a bit about something which 
is important to me, results. In the last election a bunch of 
nonsense went around that somehow the Reform Party was male 
dominated and that the party was only interested in the male 
segment of the Canadian population. Actually the statistics do 
not bear that out.
<P>
	It is very interesting to find out that of our candidates, the 
female candidates had a higher success ratio than the male 
candidates. We had no equity program. We did not demand that 
half of our candidates be female. Maybe if we had we would 
have had twice as many members here.
<P>
	We left the choice of the selection of candidates up to the local 
constituencies, which looked for the best person for the job. 
They did not look at the colour of their skin or their gender. They 
looked at their ability to represent their constituents. They 
looked at their ability to come to this place to try to change it. 
We were more successful at electing women candidates than we 
were male candidates. A lot of Canadians do not know that 
because they have been given misinformation by the Liberals 
and by others who have a vested interest in the whole issue.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	As employers, let us choose people based on merit. As 
government, let us promote a policy that will let people succeed 
because they deserve to, not because they are pampered on some 
unreasonable grounds that forms the basis for employment 
equity programs.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, if ever there was a better example of government doing 
all the wrong things for all the right reasons in employment 
equity, I do not know of it. If ever there was an example of 
government making a bad decision worse in its attempt to make 
it better, I do not know of one.
<P>
	Today in our universities students who take economics classes 
study the example of rent control, for instance, to learn how 
government can make a problem worse by adding what appears 
to be simple tools to make it better. With rent control 
government tried to make housing more affordable by imposing 
rent increase restrictions on those nasty landlords that, in 
government's opinion, wanted to take the shirts off the backs of 
their tenants. Unfortunately, as history and economics have 
shown again and again, it simply does not work.
<P>
	Instead of rent control creating more affordable housing it 
creates less. By imposing rent restrictions the government takes 
the incentive away from developers to build new homes, thus 
limiting the number of homes on the market and ensuring that 
the under class never gets affordable housing.
<P>
	Are there no benefits from rent control? Sure there are. The 
wealthy and the upper middle class people who have secured an 
apartment are guaranteed artificially low prices for their homes. 
Who benefits? The middle and upper classes. Who pays? 
Business and lower classes. It is a prime example of what 
happens when government creates a system to help one sector of 
society at the expense of another. It does not work. The market 
takes over and makes its own decisions that more often than not 
fly in the face of the good intentions of government.
<P>
	I am convinced that a couple of decades from now students 
studying economics will no longer be examining rent control 
examples. They will be studying employment equity because 
employment equity as well as being fundamentally unjust, 
fundamentally unfair and fundamentally discriminatory, does 
not work. That is what the classes will be centred on.
<P>
	Some will benefit: principally lawyers, the middle class 
minorities and women who are artificially moved ahead in the 
market by employment equity. But not the lower classes, not 
immigrants, not those the program is supposed to help. By 
placing artificial restrictions on hiring practices, by placing 
quotas on institutions that hire people, government limits the 
productivity of those organizations. Government makes them 
less productive and less productive organizations hire less 
people and fire more.
<P>
	The first to be let go will always be those with the fewest 
skills, those who have spent the least time in the market or part 
time workers. Those people are disproportionately members of 
the very group that employment equity is supposed to benefit.
<P>
	It is a classic example of government not working. It is a 
classic lesson for government. However this government, like 
its ideological cousins in the NDP, do not get it. It has been too 
blinded by rhetoric to understand reality and too influenced by 
special interests.
<P>
	Employment equity is a failure. It does not do what it is 
intended to do. While attempting through employment equity to 
cure some alleged wrongs of the past, as a society we have sold 
our souls. We have made a pact with the devil. We have 
abandoned the principles of fairness, justice and equality.
<P>
	Liberals used to love George Orwell's <I>Animal Farm</I>. They 
would cite the slogan: ``All are created equal but some are more 
equal than others'' with a bit of glee, thinking this was a 
criticism of the politics of the so-called establishment and that 
they were above such satire. Well, no more. Employment equity 
is the embodiment of the slogan: ``All are equal but some are 
more equal than others''.
<P>
	That slogan does not make sense of course. It is illogical and 
so is employment equity. However it does not stop special 
interests from demanding more employment equity. I say 
special interests because there is no question that special 
interests are at work in the debate. When there is no empirical 
evidence of a white male cabal actively discriminating against 
more than half of the population and when the majority of 
Canadians oppose employment equity, what can we conclude 
except that special interests once again have the ear of the party 
across the way? Only special interests could force the promotion 
of a policy that is so illogical and so unfair.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration is fond of citing 
statistics, with which we agree, saying that immigrants to 
Canada outperform native born Canadians in the workforce. The 
minister attempts to take credit for the fact that immigrants tend 
to be very hard working and self-reliant.
<P>
	At the same time employment equity in the public service 
discriminates against men and white Canadians and 
discriminates in favour of minorities, many of whom are 
immigrants. Even though immigrants are outperforming native 
born Canadians, native born Canadians are punished by 
employment equity because immigrants are presumed to be 
disadvantaged.
<P>
	No other bit of data shows the absolute folly of employment 
equity like the data on performance of immigrants. Look at the 
performance in the economy of recently arrived immigrants 
from Asia. These immigrants are new to the country. They often 
face difficulties with language. They are typecast as ethnic 
minorities. Yet they do better than the white males that are 
alleged to be discriminating against them and thereby are 
allowed to receive an undue and unfair benefit from employ-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12989"> 12989 </A></B>
<P>
ment equity programs. Does this make sense? Is this justifiable 
by anyone with a grain of common sense? Of course not.
<P>
	Special interests are tickled about the state of affairs because 
special interests do not care about justice. They do not care 
about facts. They do not care about the national interest. They 
care only about their interests and they have the ear of the 
government.
<P>
	The Reform Party has faced labelling. It has had to shield 
itself against rhetorical attacks unlike any ever faced by a major 
political party in Canada. Among those attacks have been the cry 
of racism, despite the fact that the Reform Party is the only party 
that has on its books a totally colour blind immigration policy.
<P>
	We want Canada to accept immigrants on the basis of their 
ability to contribute to Canada and fill needs in the workforce. 
Imagine what would happen if the Reform Party changed that 
colour blind immigration policy. Imagine if ethnic fairness was 
our goal. Here is what would happen. The majority of 
immigrants coming to Canada are typecast as visible minorities. 
Using the logic of fans of employment equity that could only 
mean that there is a systematic institutional discrimination 
against non-visible minorities in the immigration system.
<P>
	Again using the illogic of the employment equity program it 
would be fair, proper and just to establish quotas for 
immigration to Canada of more white Europeans. Imagine the 
backlash that would occur if that program were instituted, 
despite the fact that this hypothetical scenario would be based 
entirely on the exact same logic that the proponents of 
employment equity use.
<P>
	Discrimination occurs in many quarters. It occurs against 
young men who have good grades but still cannot get into 
university or get a scholarship. It occurs in increased ethnic and 
racial awareness as government forces everyone to declare 
themselves a member of a racial group instead of just being 
Canadian. It occurs when there is job loss due to ridiculous 
demands placed on industries that do business with the 
government. It occurs as the stigma attached to minorities and 
women who are called ``EE hires''. The list goes on.
<P>
	I urge the members of the House to think carefully. Do not toe 
the party line. Use your heads and think about the effect of this 
misguided policy. Think about the human costs. Think about the 
non-existent benefits. Then support our motion. Restore 
fairness, and stop discrimination of all kinds.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I take this opportunity to 
speak to the Reform Party's motion which I believe to be 
predicated on a lot of misinformation, half truths and generally 
misdirected with a great deal of pomposity. Some rather 
unfortunate ethnocentric views are being perpetrated on the 
basis of what is a very logical piece of legislation with very 
reasonable goals being set by the government to deal with 
overwhelming inequities that already exist.
<P>
	I welcome this opportunity to clear up the confusion 
surrounding Bill C-64 created by some ill informed members of 
the opposition. I am anxious to explain how this made in Canada 
legislation will respond to the country's unique workplace needs 
to ensure fairness for all Canadians.
<P>
	I have been told repeatedly by Canadians that 
communications and education are essential to the success of 
employment equity. It is within this context that I frame my 
comments today. I believe it is critical for Canadians to 
understand what Bill C-64 will and will not do. They should be 
fully aware that Canada is charting its own course with this 
progressive piece of legislation.
<P>
	The suggestion has been made by some members of the 
Reform Party that the United States experience with affirmative 
action proves workplace equality is unworkable. It is not fair to 
compare apples with oranges. This is Canada and that is the 
United States.
<P>
	In outlining the many merits of Canada's approach to 
employment equity I intend to demonstrate how, despite 
misleading comments to the contrary, in Canada we got the 
legislation right. Let me outline the key differences between the 
American's affirmative action approach and Canada's 
employment equity legislation.
<P>
	With all due respect for our neighbours, the U.S. approach is 
characterized by a confusing and sometimes contradictory 
multitude of federal, state and municipal laws, policies and 
programs.
<P>
	We also have to understand there is a great deal of competition 
for jobs. The pressure is great with two million jobs being lost 
annually in the U.S. As an example of how this pressure is 
generated in the U.S., look at the global picture and see where 
the pressure points are.
<P>
	An article in the <I>Utne Reader</I>, the May-June 1995 issue, 
states: ``In the 1950s, 33 per cent of U.S. workers were 
employed in manufacturing. Today less than 17 per cent of the 
workforce is engaged in blue collar work. Management 
consultant Peter Drucker estimates that employment in 
manufacturing is going to continue dropping to less than 12 per 
cent of the workforce in the next decade. Although the number 
of blue collar workers continues to decline, manufacturing 
productivity is soaring''.
<P>
	Another factor to consider is that changes have also been 
dramatic in the wholesale and retail sectors. There are pressures 
there and competitions for jobs. There are a lot of pressures on 
businesses, on government and on individuals. For instance, 
typical of the trend of retail giant Sears Roebuck, Sears 
eliminated a staggering 50,000 jobs from its merchandising 
division in 1993, reducing employment by 14 per cent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12990"> 12990 </A></B>
<P>
	Intelligent machines is also another issue invading 
professional disciplines, encroaching on education and the arts, 
long considered immune to the pressure of mechanization. A 
robot that will perform hip replacement surgery is being 
developed in California. Some firms now use computerized 
hiring systems to screen job applications. Not only are we 
competing with other humans, we are competing with robotics, 
new technologies and the mechanization of the workplace.
<P>
	What do we do? Do we outlaw new and intelligent machines 
that will help to improve the economy and provide efficiency 
and effectiveness? With all of our discontent and malcontent we 
could devise laws and legislation that would discriminate 
against those and eliminate them, as is being suggested here.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Another interesting factor to consider because of the 
pressures being generated is that from 1983 to 1993 banks 
eliminated in the States 179,000 human tellers, 30 per cent of its 
workforce with automated teller machines.
<P>
	This is a whole phenomenon far too complicated. I do not 
believe one can win the argument as the members of the 
opposition are proposing by taking a single, narrow example of 
how a university sets up a program or a course and use that to 
build a case against employment equity. That is very narrow and 
unjustified. It does not have much validity.
<P>
	This profusion of legislation we talk about in the States gives 
rights, protections and remedies to different groups. 
Understandably this has created problems. Critics point to 
abuses and growing disenchantment with quotas in the U.S. 
which have led federal legislators to re-examine affirmative 
action.
<P>
	By contrast, Canada has a streamlined legislative framework. 
Bill C-64 creates a single approach to employment equity at the 
federal level with clear responsibilities and duties assigned to 
employers and government agencies. With a few exceptions the 
approach to employment equity and the groups covered are 
essentially the same in most jurisdictions with mandatory 
employment equity in Canada.
<P>
	Another crucial distinction is the role of the courts. 
Employment equity in Canada is proactive in nature. The 
legislation focuses on negotiated solutions arrived at through 
co-operative employer-employee relations. It does not require 
prior presumption of discrimination.
<P>
	Consequently the Employment Equity Act creates an efficient 
and cost effective framework that minimizes the role of courts. 
We have a federal contractors program which a lot of regulated 
businesses participate in. It has become a state of mind. It is 
good business for those people to have women, visible 
minorities and disabled people working for them.
<P>
	I have attended ceremonies at which we award federal 
contractors' awards. I have done that over the year and it has 
been very much applauded by the participants. They set an 
example many federally regulated businesses want to 
participate in. That includes universities as well as a variety of 
different private sector businesses.
<P>
	The affirmative action program south of the border is rooted 
in executive order and civil rights law. Its objective is to 
eliminate discrimination against any employee or applicant for 
employment because of race, colour, religion, sex or national 
origin. The U.S. approach is characterized by court ordered 
quotas, preferential treatment to minority owned companies for 
government contracts and tax incentives to encourage 
ownership by minority populations.
<P>
	The American system is also adversarial and litigious, doing 
little to advance harmony at the work site. It is frequently 
criticized as a slow and expensive way of achieving equality in 
the workforce.
<P>
	Under the Canadian approach to employment equity, 
employers set their own numerical targets, often reached 
through consultation with workers and their unions. Bill C-64 
specifically prohibits the use of quotas and there are certainly no 
provisions for preferential treatment to minority owned 
companies.
<P>
	It is also good news that the Reform Party elected quite a few 
women. It might not have been a bad idea to have elected more 
there. That is an aside and I am sure the Reform member across 
the way will agree with that.
<P>
	Merit is still paramount. A vicious rumour is being 
perpetrated that meritorious applicants, meritorious individuals 
meritorious successful candidates under employment equity are 
being maligned as not capable, as having been selected because 
they are disabled, women or of a visible minority. That is not so. 
This legislation has merit as its foundation. That remains 
paramount.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The intent of the Employment Equity Act is not to provide 
preferential treatment; it is designed to ensure equal treatment 
of all qualified work ready Canadians regardless of race, 
physical attributes or gender. It is about removing not erecting 
barriers to employment. It is about creating equity not 
inequality and not preferential treatment. It is about improving a 
system so downtrodden with inequity.
<P>
	If the Reform Party is willing to do the research it will know 
the employment figures year after year have on the bottom of the 
list the disabled, women, aboriginal people and visible 
minorities. The Reform Party can find a few examples where 
that is not the case but the government does not build good 
policy and good legislation on a few examples. The exception is 
not the rule. That is not the way good policy is developed. That 
is not the way democracy works best.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12991"> 12991 </A></B>
<P>
	It is about removing inequities not erecting barriers to 
employment. Canada is very fortunate that its legal meaning 
of equality is unlike that of the U.S. Ours is based on a 
constitutional guarantee of equality far broader than the U.S. 
equivalent. In Canada every individual has the right to equality 
before and under the law and equal protection and benefit of 
the law. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 
section 15(2) recognizes special consideration and the 
accommodation of differences is sometimes necessary in 
achieving true equality.
<P>
	Special treatment is not a departure from equality, it is 
essential in achieving it. Employment equity has come about 
because of the overwhelming inequities in the labour market, in 
all fields of employment. That is what it is based on.
<P>
	It is unique to Canada. The U.S. constitution has no similar 
provision. In the United States there is a constitutional right to 
equal protection of the law only. Historically it has been 
interpreted by U.S. courts to require identical treatment, thus 
the development of colour blind and sex blind laws.
<P>
	Members of Parliament who have participated in committees 
have learned by that valuable process. I have learned through the 
constitutional process that same treatment does not necessarily 
express equality. That is a simplistic view and a view which 
should have gone out with the dark ages. We are into futuristic 
and very straightforward issues and views about equality which 
apply to all Canadians.
<P>
	Canada's approach to equality is progressive and far sighted. 
Equality means recognizing differences not just identical 
treatment. This has led to a greater partnership among groups 
pursuing fair access to employment opportunities and has 
resulted in far greater success. The wisdom of the Canadian 
strategy is proven in our progress. The record shows that while 
Canadians still have some concentrations of 
under-representation, advances have been significant under the 
existing Employment Equity Act and will only increase with the 
improvements provided in Bill C-64.
<P>
	That speaks volumes about the Canadian approach. We are not 
interested in overloading the courts with employment equity 
challenges. We are looking for equal employment opportunities 
for Canadian women, aboriginal peoples, visible minorities and 
persons with disabilities.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	We want to ensure fairness for all Canadians by assuring 
everyone has equal access to a job because we all know 
Canadians will benefit when we do. The best long term 
investment we can make as a country is in the creation of a more 
productive economy that fully capitalizes on the wealth of 
knowledge and skills of all members of society.
<P>
	I can assure members of this House and reassure all Canadians 
that this government has no intention of repealing or weakening 
its employment equity legislation. We will continue to work 
diligently in the proud tradition of this great nation to assure the 
dignity of each and every member of our communities and our 
country. Canadians expect no less. With this in mind, I urge all 
members of this House to vote against the Reform Party's 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as I listened to this member I kept reflecting back on 
the reason the Reform Party came into the House and why we 
were elected as a new party with 52 members to represent the 
people in our ridings across the west.
<P>
	One of the reasons was the existence of so much top down 
government with the message that it would tell people in the 
ridings across the country what government thought was best for 
them. That has been the attitude of government in the past and 
that is the attitude of the present Liberal government.
<P>
	I know the majority of people in my riding do not want 
employment equity. They feel it is intrusive, abusive, 
discriminatory and certainly that it reflects the negative side of 
government in the past.
<P>
	Since the member is speaking on behalf of many of her 
constituents, how many of her constituents did she poll on this 
particular matter? How much is the program going to cost the 
taxpayer? Did she tell that to her constituents?
<P>
	Another question came up when I was reviewing some of the 
act. A section deals with organizations or departments that 
employ 100 people or more. The employment equity aspect does 
not involve those below 100 employees. Why would it not 
include everyone in this whole picture? If this Employment 
Equity Act is so important, why is everyone not included in it?
<P>
	Those are the reasons many of us on the Reform side are going 
to vote against any possible amendments that come up on C-64.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Madam Speaker, through the political 
process, I have gone through a metamorphosis from a neophyte 
to a second term member of Parliament now. More than that, I 
am a human being who literally sits with my constituents. In the 
north we have very small confines. I live with my constituents. I 
cannot disappear into a city as one might in cities like Ottawa 
and Calgary. I live with my constituents.
<P>
	We did have a poll and it was a great poll. It was won poll by 
poll. I did have a poll and I have the utmost confidence. I won 
my election in a landslide in 1988. When I won my election 
employment equity was part of the red book. In 1993 I won 
every single poll in my riding, advanced polls, special polls, 
every poll. Those are the polls that count.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12992"> 12992 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not believe we can have a 1-900 democracy or 1-900 
governments. That is not the way to run this country. That is 
being a chicken because they cannot face up to it and make the 
decisions people elected them to make. They elected me to make 
the tough decisions. I am here and I will make them with this 
government.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	If the people are afraid in that city, I do believe the member 
has made it intrusive. He has talked about this legislation as 
intrusive, as abusive and as discriminatory as Reformers have 
done with almost every other piece of legislation that has come 
forward that people have supported.
<P>
	If the people of Canada did not like employment equity they 
would not have voted for us. They read about it in the red book in 
1993 and we were elected with a full majority. It was clear and it 
gets clearer by the day what we intend to do.
<P>
	We are making the federal contractors program and this 
employment equity legislation as broad, as fair and as all 
inclusive as possible. It is not intrusive, discriminatory or 
abusive. It is anything but that. It will be inclusive. It will create 
for once in the 125 year history of this country the kind of equity 
that is needed so that all members in this House can participate, 
all members of this country can participate. For God's sake, 
even Reform Party members can participate. That is how 
inclusive it is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened closely to the minister's eloquent remarks 
about equity and fairness, even in her response a few minutes 
ago about allowing all members to be treated equally in this 
House.
<P>
	New Democrats govern 52 per cent of the population 
provincially right now in Canada. We treat everyone equally, as 
fairly as we possibly can and much fairer than other 
governments of the Liberal stripe provincially.
<P>
	Given her years of talk about employment equity and given 
her comments and concerns respecting equality and fairness, 
would the minister support treating members of the New 
Democratic Party caucus in this House with equity and fairness 
as we have treated the Liberals in Saskatchewan's legislature? 
Would she do this by giving them at least a role in question 
period, full membership on committees, a front row seat for our 
leader and those sorts of courtesies which do not cost anyone 
any money but do provide a sense of equality and fairness in this 
House of Commons?
<P>
	As the minister knows precedents have been set in previous 
legislatures that show very clearly that New Democrats have 
exercised fairness and equality. We just do not talk about it. All I 
have heard so far from the government is talk about equality and 
fairness. Where does the minister stand in providing a fair and 
equitable role for the New Democrats in the House of 
Commons?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Madam Speaker, it is most 
unfortunate. I expect much more from the New Democratic 
Party members in dealing with this very important piece of 
legislation than to piggyback their own personal political party 
agendas on this really important piece of legislation. I am 
amazed that the hon. member would not only mix in his own 
personal political party agenda but also would drag in the whole 
issue of the provinces and the particular arrangements they 
have.
<P>
	I expect support from the New Democrats. After all the years 
of singing the praises of employment equity, I expect the 
member to support us on this bill. That is what New Democrats 
say they believe. He should lay aside his own personal agenda 
and negotiate that in the procedures that are available to him 
through the Speaker's chambers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I must interrupt you, as 
your time is up.
<P>
	Before giving the floor to the next person, I would like to 
inform the House that Mrs. Gagnon, the member for Québec, has 
given her time slot to the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism 
and the Status of Women.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.): </B>Madam 
Speaker, first off, I would like to thank my colleague for Québec 
for the courtesy. I am convinced that she is a supporter of 
employment equity.
<P>
	The motion introduced today by our colleague for Fraser 
Valley East once again shows the Reform Party's intention to 
eliminate employment parity and to backtrack regarding 
Canada's achievements in the area of equality of rights over 
almost 40 years.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	We know that in 1986, the former government passed the 
current law on employment equity. I congratulate it for this 
accomplishment. But it was the Liberal government preceding 
that government which established the principles and set down 
the cornerstones of employment equity.
<P>
	In 1986, these principles were even entrenched in the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which provides for 
the creation of laws, programs and activities to improve the 
situation of disadvantaged people. We built a framework of 
principles reflecting our vision of society and its future and 
established values for our society.
<P>
	This is most of all evident in section 15 of the charter, which 
discusses non-discrimination regarding employment. The 
charter also covers the issue of the equality of women in sections 
25, 26 and 27, and the issue of multiculturalism in section 28.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12993"> 12993 </A></B>
<P>
	I must say that Canadian values are very well expressed in our 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms and that section 15 covers all 
rights and gives us the potential to promote those who are 
disadvantaged in our society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I would like to thank you for the opportunity 
to make the business case. There is not only the fairness and 
equality case which is first and foremost as a Canadian value, 
but there is also the business case for employment equity.
<P>
	As much as it is statistically justifiable, socially desirable and 
morally the right thing to do, it is also a fundamental necessity 
in today's business world. Even a cursory examination of 
current market conditions makes it abundantly clear that 
Canadian companies must fully capitalize on this country's 
greatest resource, its rich and diverse workforce, if they are to 
remain competitive in an increasingly global economy.
<P>
	Hon. members of this House need not take it from me nor from 
this side of the House. Perhaps Reform members and their 
supporters might take a lesson from the people they admire so 
much, the independent business people and the large 
corporations. Take a lesson from what they have to say about the 
importance of diversity and gender equity to their business and 
their business values and to ours as well.
<P>
	Throughout my remarks I will highlight comments of some of 
this country's most progressive business leaders, people who 
have found out for themselves that employment equity is not 
just a matter of common sense but also one of dollars and cents. 
Private sector firms including Canadian National, Canadian 
Occidental Petroleum, Bank of Montreal, Hydro Québec, et 
cetera, see equity as an asset and have seized it as a tool for 
improving their companies' performances. They have 
discovered diversity is a value added. We all know how 
important value added is in the competitive global economy we 
have to face.
<P>
	Let me quote just one proponent of employment equity, 
Bernard Isautier, chief executive officer of Canadian Oxy:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the global village we must learn to respect, appreciate, understand and 
value differences, in terms of race, ethnic groups, gender, culture and 
language. Diversity is a source of competitive advantage. If a company is to 
be successful in today's business environment, it must develop policies and 
practices in step with an increasingly diverse workforce.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to briefly outline some of the key business 
considerations in the employment equity question which 
includes the fundamental principle of merit. Of course we are 
going to hire someone based on equivalent capacity and ability 
to deliver the job and do the task. We may have to train some 
people but there is certainly a merit principle as well as the 
ethnocultural reality of Canada's people and the equality of men 
and women.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Let us look at this. There is the matter of the changing face of 
the marketplace. People reporting ethnic origins other than 
Canadian, British or French now account for 40 per cent of the 
country's population. That number is expected to climb to 50 per 
cent within the decade. With these people come new markets and 
demands for new products or services which Canadian 
companies are finding profitable to satisfy. It is no longer just 
white rice and white bread, it is the whole range of wheat, grains 
and cereals that we can enjoy.
<P>
	Petro-Canada, as one example, saw a 15 per cent 
improvement in gasoline sales in Vancouver when it started 
offering services in Mandarin as well as English, as did the Bank 
of Montreal in the delivery of its services.
<P>
	Not only are there burgeoning business opportunities at home, 
but global trade is opening doors to markets with the potential 
for unprecedented growth abroad. International business, I 
would remind everyone in the House, is multicultural, 
multilingual and multiracial. Canada is a global village. That is 
who we are.
<P>
	We are reflective of the four corners of the world. Those four 
corners have been here for a long time. The people are 
competent and capable and have the potential to meet the 
challenges of the new global economy. Opportunity knocks and 
Canada's diverse people are a natural competitive advantage. 
They may be seen now as a hidden advantage, but let us bring 
that out into the light and look at it in the clear light of fiscal 
reality. We cannot afford to exclude anyone nor should we wish 
to.
<P>
	The Conference Board of Canada, with the assistance of the 
multicultural programs which I manage, recently released an 
18-month study called ``Dimensions of Diversity in Canadian 
Business'' which documented the financial gains to be had from 
using our diverse workforce to access untapped markets both 
within Canada and around the world. The study's author, 
Christine Taylor, noted that the single most significant barrier to 
change is the belief that diversity is not a business issue.
<P>
	If there is still any doubt among my colleagues they will be 
interested to learn that the report from the Conference Board of 
Canada notes that the gross domestic product rates in Latin 
America, China and the Pacific rim range from 6 per cent to 12 
per cent annually. The purchasing power in these countries is 
enormous and holds tremendous potential for Canadian 
business. Let us not forget the business task force which the 
Prime Minister led to these parts of the world. These fast 
developing regions require vast investments in infrastructure, in 
public systems and capital. It takes special people to make such 
transactions happen.
<P>
	More and more employers are finding that ethnocultural 
diversity, including visible minorities, with insider knowledge 
and contacts within those countries are instrumental in 
penetrating these new lucrative markets. These people are not 
being hired because of legislative  requirements or simply out of 
a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12994"> 12994 </A></B>
<P>
sense of duty or altruism. Progressive businesses are choosing 
these qualified employees for the value they add to the company.
<P>
	Unfortunately too many Canadians do not know about our 
secret power, the hidden asset of Canada. It is about time they 
did. If enough Canadian companies recognized this new reality 
there would not be any people looking for jobs. Too many are 
still bound by the straitjacket of stereotypes. That is why we 
need employment equity. It will bring better equality and justice 
and it will also meet the business needs of the community.
<P>
	I hope Reform members are listening so they might decide to 
have an open mind. Never mind doing their polling, maybe they 
should think and talk to their constituents.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	If critics are truly concerned about the welfare of corporate 
Canada, surely they cannot be opposed to employment equity 
measures that will enhance their ability to compete. As the 
conference board study notes: ``Competing to win in the global 
economy requires an ability to attract, retain, motivate and 
develop high potential employees of both genders from a variety 
of cultural and ethnic backgrounds''.
<P>
	Having an employment equity plan in place eliminates the 
barriers that may prevent employers from harnessing the full 
potential of the workforce. I have had the pleasure of working on 
the Conference Board of Canada study with Prem Benymadhu, a 
really incredible gentleman who is the vice-president of human 
resources research. He said that much more than being a nice 
thing to do it really is essential for Canada. It would be a 
mistake, however, to assume that increased access to domestic 
and international markets is the only business advantage of 
employment equity.
<P>
	Companies are learning that recruiting, promoting and 
retaining people who are representative of the Canadian 
population helps them provide better and more responsive client 
service. When we walk into a store and see ourselves reflected 
on the screen as part of the picture, when we see ourselves in the 
ads, whether we are brown, yellow, white or whatever our skin 
shade is, we feel that we are included, not excluded, and have a 
sense of belonging. We feel welcome and know we have our 
place within the peoples of Canada.
<P>
	Companies report that there is an increase in market share of 
38 per cent when they have changed their advertising and 
direction. By the way, I refer members to the Advertising 
Council of Canada study which indicated a tremendous increase 
in sales and customers when this principle and concept is 
applied.
<P>
	The conference board survey showed one-half of the 
respondents discovered it was necessary to tailor their customer 
service practices to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse 
customer base. Responding to those changing needs is 
apparently very profitable. There was a very interesting 
explanation given to us by the Bank of  Montreal on how it 
targeted its various bank branches to the population it was 
serving.
<P>
	Therefore, it is apparently very profitable. The majority of 
companies reported an increase in market share. Seventy-eight 
per cent showed significant increases in customer feedback and 
38 per cent indicated that their revenues had increased. I am sure 
everyone would love to give a business report like that.
<P>
	Employment equity proves to be equally beneficial inside 
organizations too. Among the many advantages are improved 
workplace morale, higher retention rates and greater 
productivity. In fact, many managers find that women's work 
style, which focuses on team work, collaboration and open 
communications and mutual support, is especially well suited to 
the communication demands of the workplace in the 
information age.
<P>
	Enlightened employers recognize that employment equity 
gives them improved access to a much larger pool of well 
informed and qualified personnel, which raises some very 
pragmatic issues around the whole question of an aging 
workforce.
<P>
	Despite current unemployment conditions, demographic 
projections make it clear that Canada will soon be searching for 
qualified workers. Within a decade we will start to experience a 
severe skills shortage because of retiring baby boomers. That 
will also present other issues with respect to the aging of our 
population. They are all important social policy and program 
issues.
<P>
	Given these population trends, given the decreasing birth rate 
within Canada, all but one-third of the new entrants to the 
workforce by the year 2000 will be members of the Employment 
Equity Act designated groups: women, visible minorities, 
aboriginal peoples and persons with disabilities. I would 
suggest that be carefully considered when members are looking 
at public policy. Maybe when they come out with their revision 
to what could be a good red book, they would find why and 
when.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	Our country will need every one of these people and the time 
to prepare for the transition is now. As the report prepared by the 
Royal Bank of Canada stated, with a labour shortage predicted 
in the future and a more diverse population, it is very important 
to get off the mark quickly before the labour crunch hits.
<P>
	That is why the vast majority of employers, such as the 
Canadian Bankers Association, the Canadian Association of 
Broadcasters, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, federally 
regulated employers in the transportation and communication 
industries and other stakeholders affected by Bill C-64, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12995"> 12995 </A></B>
<P>
employment equity legislation, which as members know the 
committee has finished reviewing, recognize the need for 
legislation in employment equity.
<P>
	It makes good business sense. If one looks at the whole issue 
employment equity it is designated to promote the optimal use 
of our rich human resources. Although we have contract 
compliance, good business practice would not need and does not 
need it because it is something that you would want to do to 
improve your access to the market, to invite people into your 
stores, to place before them merchandise that they like, that they 
want and that they will buy.
<P>
	The questions we are looking at and the bill concerning 
employment equity are intended to act as a stimulus to our 
national economy while correcting the injustice of 
discriminatory hiring and promotion practices.
<P>
	When practicality for business companies is coupled with 
dignity for individuals everyone wins. I remind the House that 
for all the business benefits of employment equity-they are 
obvious and I have enunciated a number of them-it is in the 
interest of fairness and equality, in the interest of the value 
system that we have put before the Canadian people. It is a 
system that is inclusive and not exclusive, that is neither abusive 
nor unfair. It is one that looks at all people in Canada and says: 
``You are welcome. There is a place for you with your skills, 
with your knowledge, with your competence and with your 
abilities''. It is not smart business to be exclusive.
<P>
	I remember studying section 15 of the Canadian Constitution. 
It was delayed three years after the acceptance of the charter of 
rights and freedoms. That study took a year out of our lives. We 
examined section 15, the non-discriminatory section, and 
suggested the changes that were to come before the House in 
terms of formal laws as different from policies.
<P>
	Employment equity was one. It had to do as well with the 
whole question of where the federal government had 
jurisdiction so that we could have contract compliance. Many of 
the provinces do the same thing.
<P>
	Anyone who thinks that it discriminates against what is called 
the traditional Canadian had better look out there and see who is 
the Canadian. It is all of us in all of our beauty and in all of our 
differences.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We planted the roots of the employment equity policy 20 
years ago. Since then, the successive governments have made an 
effort to promote it. It would seem that the only people who 
question the employment equity policy are our Reform 
colleagues.
<P>
	I recommend that all members of the House vote against the 
motion and that they support and speak out regarding the 
importance of including every single person in this country, in 
all of our society's employment policies and to show what it 
means to be Canadian.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Diversity is the beauty of this country. This is a global village. 
We are reflective of the four corners of the world. If members 
come into the constituency of almost anyone who lives in an 
urban, semi-urban or metropolitan area they will note those 
differences. They will note the diversity and will recognize the 
importance of being inclusive of the ethnocultural and visible 
diversity as well as gender equity.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	I urge all my colleagues to endorse the necessary amendment 
so that we can get on with the business of building a better 
Canada, an inclusive Canada, one that looks like all of us in this 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would argue with the hon. member who just finished 
speaking that a diverse workforce I agree is good for business. A 
workforce where one hires the best person one can hire is good 
business.
<P>
	I certainly do not need a lecture about diversity in the 
workforce. As I mentioned earlier today, in British Columbia we 
understand and appreciate the contributions of people of all 
different ethnic backgrounds. If one does not and they are a 
business person they will soon be out of business in the lower 
mainland. My goodness, we are very cosmopolitan out there and 
very proud of it.
<P>
	The problem of course is not that we do not appreciate 
diversity. The thing is we do not appreciate employment equity 
legislation. By the turn of the century, as the member 
mentioned, 85 per cent of job applicants will be from the 
so-called designated groups. Eighty-five per cent will be 
coming from those four groups. By all means, any business that 
refuses to hire from this 85 per cent, which is going to form part 
of the new economy in the next decade, is not going to get 
necessarily the best people for the jobs. That will mean their 
business will be less competitive. If they are systemically 
discriminatory I hope they go out of business because they 
should obviously be hiring people based on their merit not their 
ethnicity.
<P>
	If we have a situation, for example, in Toronto where 
statistically-this is just statistically, because there are always 
variations-people of Portuguese background have a lower 
standard of living, fewer employment opportunities and even a 
lower graduation rate from high school, which is a fact in 
Toronto from the Toronto school board, do you design 
government programs based on need? In this case they are not a 
visible minority and do not qualify under the employment equity 
program-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> You do not even know what it means, 
employment equity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12996"> 12996 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Do you design programs based on need or on 
ethnicity?
<P>
	From our point of view, we say people should be helped out 
based on need as individuals. There are some visible minorities, 
for example, in our program who would receive much help. 
There are others who would receive no help. It should be based 
on demonstrated need.
<P>
	According to StatsCan, Japanese Canadians by ethnicity have 
the highest per capita income in Canada. Do you design 
programs to help someone from that background or do you 
design them based on need? We said government assistance 
programs should be designed based on need regardless of 
ethnicity, background or gender. We should not have programs 
and quotas.
<P>
	I know the member does not like to admit it, but it was 
interesting during the leaders debate here in Ontario that Lyn 
McLeod, the Liberal leader for Ontario, mentioned that 
numerical targets are just quotas. That is why she is going to do 
away with numerical targets if a Liberal government is elected 
in Ontario. In that case she agrees with the Reform Party and 
most Canadians who say that numerical targets are not to be 
appreciated and will be eliminated under a Liberal government 
in Ontario.
<P>
	The federal Liberals happen to agree with the provincial NDP 
on this one. The philosophical trend is interesting.
<P>
	In any event, does one design government programs based on 
need or based on ethnicity?
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Madam Speaker, I just wish the members 
opposite would stop and think about what they are saying. First, 
everyone who has chosen to come to Canada to become a citizen 
or who is a landed immigrant is a Canadian. One does not 
hyphenate a Portugese Canadian versus a Japanese Canadian. 
That is totally antithetical to the Canadian point of view.
<P>
	Second, the reason for the targets, the goals, no matter what 
we want to call it, is because we have seen there has been uneven 
hiring, a systemic racism out there in terms of hiring practices. 
There needed to be some kind of mechanism to enable people to 
understand that after decades and decades of 
anti-discrimination laws nothing was moving. We certainly 
needed to have some form of mechanism so that those who were 
perpetually outside of the job stream could be included. It was 
not because they were low income versus high income. There 
are people who are low income who can end up being very high 
income earners. So do not give me that business. All one needs is 
an opportunity in life. If one is not given an opportunity to be 
hired because of the colour of one's skin then there is a reason 
why one is not getting a chance.
<P>
	This kind of program and policy is to ensure that every 
Canadian, regardless of colour, creed, race, religion, language, 
sex or handicap, gets an opportunity.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Madam Speaker, I would say that all along 
the issue has been structural unemployment, systemic 
discrimination, the vital need for changes to the way one uses 
our unemployment insurance and the way programs are put into 
place, which have demonstrated that all people have not had the 
same kinds of opportunity. The world has changed dramatically. 
We need new jobs and new kinds of skills.
<P>
	It may be the children of the very wealthy who may not get the 
jobs or the PhD who cannot find the opportunity, although the 
one who has the PhD has a much better chance of getting a job 
than those who are under-educated.
<P>
	We have a target population because the system does not work 
without it. If the member finds that antithetical to his views that 
is just fine. The people of my riding and the people we represent 
realize we need a public policy to give people a helping hand. It 
is not gratuitous. It is good, constructive public policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I find the hon. member's comments very enlightening 
of the Liberals' position. It reminds me of what took place in 
British Columbia just before and during the Charlottetown 
accord. At that time the NDP government in British Columbia 
decided in its wisdom to promote the idea of Senate reform 
based on gender equality. It decided that if we were going to 
reform the Senate and make it elected, it would legislate an 
equal number of men and women senators. However it very 
quickly found out the people of British Columbia did not 
support that type of action.
<P>
	Interestingly enough, one of the sitting women senators was 
the most outspoken against that. She found it personally 
demeaning that a government would consider legislating-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Name her.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> If you must know, 
it was Senator Pat Carney. She said she could get elected to the 
Senate of Canada on her own merits not because some 
government took it upon itself to legislate equality.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
would like to make the point to the hon. member opposite that 
the Senate in this country is appointed not elected.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> I am well aware the 
Senate in this country is appointed because this government 
continues to fill the other place with its appointments. We are 
very well aware it is appointed.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12997"> 12997 </A></B>
<P>
	The senator was trying to say that if the Charlottetown accord 
had gone ahead with a provision for an elected Senate, that she 
would have ran at that time and felt she had a good opportunity 
to be elected. However, it would not have been because she was a 
woman but because she was good at her job and would have run 
on that basis.
<P>
	I ask the hon. minister to actually cite some statistics and 
some examples of where the people of Canada support this type 
of reverse discrimination.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> I suggest you read the standing committee 
report. You will find-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. secretary must always address 
the Chair. I get lonesome sometimes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to remind my hon. 
colleague that of those who appeared before the standing 
committee, 90 per cent supported employment equity.
<P>
	I would also like to bring to the attention of the hon. member 
that Senator Pat Carney is a very staunch supporter of qualified 
women. At no time would anyone on this side or anyone who 
believes in fairness and equity suggest that factors other than 
quality and merit be taken into consideration. I would like to tell 
the hon. member that there are as many, if not more, competent, 
qualified women as there are men.
<P>
	Last but not least, if someone has reasonable job 
qualifications, competence and equivalency, there is no 
discrimination in the ultimate selection. In short, with 
numerical goals a key ingredient of employment equity 
legislation is aimed at fighting rather than facilitating unjust 
discrimination and lack of representation.
<P>
	Women make up 52 per cent of the population. I guarantee we 
can find competence among that-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
30(5) the House will now proceed to statements by members.

	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a member 
from Nova Scotia I rise today to congratulate the Nova Scotia 
government for demonstrating vision and leadership with its 
solution for the redevelopment of Route 104.
<P>
	In these times the Nova Scotia solution to highway 104 offers 
the safest redevelopment possible and safety is the most 
important issue here.
<P>
	The $29 million federal-provincial investment will kickstart 
a $110 million private and public partnering project that will 
create over 800 jobs and ensure that this dangerous stretch of 
highway is developed in only two years, contrasting sharply 
with the public sector only alternative which would see 
redevelopment over seven to ten years.
<P>
	The safety of Nova Scotians cannot be put on hold for 10 
years. It is irresponsible to even suggest it can be. However, this 
is exactly what the western based Reform Party is calling for and 
so are the Tories, Brian Mulroney's friends in the other place. It 
is a shame these out of touch parties are willing to play old style 
politics with the safety of those travelling the Nova Scotia 
highway system. Nova Scotians want immediate action. They 
deserve nothing less.
<P>
	The province should be congratulated on its innovative 
solution, which offers the quickest, safest and most cost 
effective redevelopment possible.

Access Awareness Week.
<P>
	One of the things that this event permits us to do is to take 
stock of the headway made over the past few years in the area of 
accessibility for handicapped persons. In fact, fortunately, our 
society has recently taken strides towards the social and 
professional integration of handicapped persons. There remain, 
however, many more physical obstacles and wide-spread 
prejudices to overcome.
<P>
	We must go beyond merely examining our consciences and 
actually ensure that concrete measures will be taken to permit 
these people to take their rightful places in our community, 
especially at this time when the federal government has 
committed itself to reviewing the Employment Equity Act.

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the legislative measures proposed in Bill C-68 imply 
that gun owners are a risk to both themselves and to others and 
thereby a threat to public safety.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice is unable or unwilling to provide 
empirical evidence to prove that gun owners present a greater 
risk to themselves, to the people they live with or to their 
neighbours.
<P>
	The Library of Parliament has been in contact with the 
Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association and the Insur-

<P>
ance Bureau of Canada and has learned that insurance 
companies do not ask their applicants if they  own a gun because 
they are not an identifiable risk group.
<P>
	If gun ownership represented any risk or liability, insurance 
companies would charge gun owners a higher premium for life, 
health, disability, liability and property insurance. They do not.
<P>
	How can the justice minister say gun owners are an 
identifiable risk when insurance companies disagree? Unlike 
the minister who makes his arguments based solely on emotion, 
insurance companies make their decisions based on empirical 
evidence because they make their living assessing real risk.

the Fredericton Chamber of Commerce on winning the 1995 
Chairman's Award. This award is given to the Atlantic 
province's chamber of the year.
<P>
	The award was in recognition for the Fredericton chamber's

government for showing strong leadership in the area of tourism 
development across the province and in particular on Cape 
Breton Island.
<P>
	For the past 37 years the people of Cape Breton have been 
patiently waiting for the development of an infrastructure 
system worthy of its international tourist destinations, including 
the beautiful Cabot Trail, salmon fishing on the Margaree and 
Canada's best kept secret, the magnificent Fortress of 
Louisbourg.
<P>
	Tourism is an $834 million industry accounting for over 
35,000 jobs across Nova Scotia. On Cape Breton Island this 
translates into almost 7,000 jobs and $177 million in revenues. 
The potential for growth here is almost unlimited as new 
markets are sought.
<P>
	For a region that has been devastated by a downturn in the 
fisheries and a 24 per cent unemployment rate, the completion 
of the Fleur-de-lis highway is more than just about a tourist 
trail. It is the completion of a transportation system that offers 
hope, survival and vital long term economic growth to coastal 
communities which would otherwise disappear. It is a road that 
paves the way to a self-sufficient and proud future.
<P>
	As the member for Cape Breton Highlands-Canso I say 
congratulations to the Nova Scotia government. I invite all 
Canadians to come to Cape Breton this summer for a vacation to 
remember for a lifetime.

Mr. Speaker, the Royal Commission on New Reproductive

years of deliberations which cost the taxpayers of Canada and 
Quebec over $28 million.
<P>
	Despite the promises made by the Minister of Justice and the 
Minister of Health, the government has yet to determine how it 
will follow up on this report. The government is waffling, is 
killing time. Is it waiting for the end of the world to come or is it 
waiting for brighter days? Hard to say.
<P>
	In the meantime, the flourishing embryo business is turning a 
brisker and brisker trade and genetic manipulation is being put 
to commercial uses. And once this trade has assumed such 
proportions that it will be increasingly difficult, maybe even 
impossible, to control the situation, the government will be

Board is bankrupt and the government does not have what it 
takes to fix the problem. However, we do the Reform Party has 
produced a paper on refugee settlement which contains 13 
proposals that would, if enacted, bring genuine refugees to 
Canada while halting widespread abuse of the system by 
economic migrants and the immigration industry.
<P>
	We call for increased co-operation with the UN to bring in 
more refugees from abroad, tightened airline security, a safe 
third country list from which people could not make claims, 
restricted availability of some social services for those who are 
found not to be genuine refugees, especially legal aid, the 
dismantling of the IRB and the restoration of accountability in 
the system, among others. These proposals would bring sense 
back to the refugee system, would save hundreds of millions of 
dollars and would protect those most in need.
<P>
	I sincerely hope the government has the sense to study and 
implement these reasonable, common sense proposals. Let us 
make the system work for everybody's interests, not just special 
interests.

<P>
	The Tory plan contains billions of dollars of errors, omissions 
and exaggerations. There are billions not accounted for. 
Ontarians must know what Mike Harris is afraid to tell them, 
that he will gut the province's social programs to find the extra 
money. Mike Harris says: ``Vote for me now and I will tell you 
later what I am going to do to social programs''. That is being 
dishonest.

<P>
	The government bases its claim on Canada's rank on the

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaking, following the meeting of the contact group on 
Bosnia, Canada's allies decided to respond to the affronts by 
Bosnian Serbs by consolidating the action of the peacekeeping 
forces through a redefinition of their mandate and a diplomatic 
approach to obtaining the release of nearly 400 peacekeepers, 
including ten Canadians. Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs 
followed closely in NATO's footsteps this morning, but without, 
however, setting out Canada's position in clear terms with 
respect to the consolidation of the peacekeepers' mandate.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. In the light of the 
emergency debate permitted yesterday, would he tell us what 
definite instructions he sent to his Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
who will represent us tomorrow at NATO's other meeting?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I had an opportunity yesterday in this House to explain 
the need at this point for the United Nations to establish new 
directives for the troops in order to avoid a repetition of the 
hostage taking and, perhaps, to redefine their mandate so that 
the troops could act more quickly in the event of an emergency 
than they have been able to in the past.
<P>
	Today, at the United Nations, the Secretary General is to 
submit new directives in this regard to the Security Council. We 
had an opportunity over the weekend to express Canada's point 
of view. We will see what the Security Council decides. Our 
troops in Bosnia are under the command of the United Nations, 
and the UN gives the necessary orders.
<P>
	The Secretary General confirmed to me that the role of our 
soldiers needed redefining and that they should be redeployed so 
as to be in a position to defend themselves more readily. We will 
see what the UN decides later on this week.
<P>
	As for the Minister of Foreign Affairs, he is acting on the 
instructions in the statements issued in this House during 
yesterday's debate by the Minister of National Defence and my 
responses in Question Period yesterday.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if the Minister of Foreign Affairs has only what the 
Prime Minister has just said to go on, he will have to fudge it 
tomorrow in Brussels, because there is nothing clear in what the 
Prime Minister has said, it is extremely ambiguous. Other 
countries are members of the UN forces and have made concrete 
decisions. France, Great Britain and the United States, for 
example, have sent additional troops and equipment that is more 
suitable for over there.
<P>
	I would ask the Prime Minister to tell us whether his 
government has sent or will send additional equipment on an 
emergency basis such as heavier tanks and arms so that our 
peacekeepers may defend themselves and bring their peace 
mission to a successful conclusion.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have not yet made any decision in this regard. We 
believe that our troops, where they are placed at the moment, 
have what they need in order to be able to react, particularly if 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13002"> 13002 </A></B>
<P>
their mandate is redefined. We have decided not to send 
additional troops for the time being.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it will be noted that I spoke of heavier equipment 
and more effective weapons and that the answer remains: ``We 
have not made any decision''. And so we are still in the dark. 
This is indeed worrisome, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	When decisions guiding international action in Bosnia are 
made by the contact group, how does the Prime Minister explain 
Canada's sending the fifth largest contingent to Bosnia and 
Croatia without being a member of the contact group, unlike the 
United States and Germany, which are members without having 
sent a single peacekeeper there?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday I explained that 25 countries are represented 
with troops in the former Yugoslavia, and that most of them are 
not in the contact group. These countries include Spain, 
Holland, Denmark, Canada, Pakistan and others that are there.
<P>
	We are in contact with these people at the moment, and the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs is in contact with his counterparts in 
the group. A NATO meeting was held this morning; there will be 
another one tomorrow, I think. And there is talk of a meeting of 
defence ministers on the weekend. So the Minister of National 
Defence will be there, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs is 
already there. I said that, as regards the Canadian position at this 
point, there is no need to send new equipment; what we have 
there now is satisfactory.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The public is concerned about the fate of the 380 
peacekeepers, including 10 Canadians, held hostage by the 
Bosnian Serbs as well as 45 other Canadian soldiers surrounded 
by the Serbs. The base in Valcartier has received 1,200 calls 
from relatives concerned about the safety of the soldiers 
deployed in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Given that the public worries about the fate of our 
peacekeepers in Bosnia and that negotiations to secure the 
release of the Canadian hostages have yet to produce concrete 
results, how can the government be so vague-like the Prime 
Minister's response-about its position on the current crisis in 
Bosnia, when France, Great Britain and the U.S. have already 
announced concrete actions? These soldiers' families want 
concrete actions and decisions.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I said that we participated in all the weekend 
discussions. I have been in contact with the leaders of the 
governments that have troops over there, like Great Britain and 
France, and with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
<P>
	Some of our soldiers are in a difficult position but they are not 
very far from the base in Visoko, and we are in contact with 
those who have been captured and those who are in a 
non-mobile position, so to speak. Two Canadians are held 
outside that area, one of them in Pale, and we were able to 
communicate with him in the last few hours.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we have not heard recently from Corporal 
Lapalme, who is in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, and with 
whom we are currently trying to establish contact. So far, 
however, we can assure the families that we are staying in 
contact with everyone involved, with the exception of Corporal 
Lapalme, and we are doing everything in our power to ensure 
that they remain alive. Our current approach is probably the best 
way of securing their release as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my supplementary is also for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Given that everyone agrees that the peacekeepers' mandate 
should be redefined-although the Minister of National 
Defence was unable to do so yesterday-and that we are waiting 
for the United Nations' response, how does the Canadian 
government propose to redefine the UN mandate of Canadian 
peacekeepers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday I said we took an initiative on that. Last week 
we discussed the mandate with the United Nations.
<P>
	I will repeat in the House that we have to make sure troops are 
not spread around like they are at the moment. We would like 
them to be concentrated in places where they can defend 
themselves and be defended by other people at the bases. That is 
the main preoccupation. When they are alone in observation 
towers, for instance, they are in some difficulty because they 
cannot readily defend themselves.
<P>
	That is exactly what the UN is considering at the moment, to 
give peacekeepers a role more in relation to the means they 
have. The troops are under the command of the United Nations 
there and the secretary general is supposed to present new 
guidelines to the security council possibly later today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the last 24 hours the UN's mandate in the former 
Yugoslavia is being shifted from a focus on peacekeeping to 
aggressive peacemaking.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	Britain has announced it will be sending 5,000 more troops. 
France is committing an aircraft carrier and helicopter gun 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13003"> 13003 </A></B>
<P>
ships. The U.S. may contribute commandos to the conflict. The 
UN contact group has also endorsed a plan that would give UN 
soldiers the power to aggressively attack warring factions.
<P>
	Does the government support shifting the UN mandate in this 
direction, shifts which will escalate military activity in the 
former Yugoslavia?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is no question at this moment of shifting the 
mandate of peacekeeping to enforcing peace in the way 
described by the hon. member. They are sending more troops 
there to protect their own troops.
<P>
	I explained the Canadian situation. We are not in exactly the 
same position. Our troops are not as spread out as others. It is not 
a question at this moment of Canada's sending more troops.
<P>
	The mandate is not to start a war with anybody but to protect 
the troops there, which is exactly what we are supporting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to many observers it appears the UN mandate is 
shifting. If the government simply passively accepts those 
shifts, the public will want to know what that means for Canada.
<P>
	In March the government sent our peacekeepers back to 
Bosnia without a clear mandate, without firm criteria for staying 
or withdrawing and without a voice in the decision making 
contact group.
<P>
	If the government insists on staying under conditions of 
military escalation will it now insist on being given a place at 
the table with the United Nations contact group? In other words, 
will that be a condition which must be met if Canadian 
peacekeepers are to remain?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
have been concerns on the part of a number of countries about 
the contact group and membership.
<P>
	As a result we are now looking at perhaps shifting some of the 
focus to NATO nations contributing troops. There may be a 
meeting on Saturday or a few days later in Brussels to deal with 
that.
<P>
	Canada is certainly a member of that group. We had one 
meeting last December-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> It is almost June.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> If the hon. member would listen, I will 
explain.
<P>
	We have had continual contact back and forth, personal, one 
on one and bilateral and other multilateral meetings since last 
December between the Minister of Foreign Affairs, myself and 
other ministers of defence of NATO contributing nations.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs, who is in Europe, has been 
fully apprised of what has been happening and has given input 
into the deliberations that went on yesterday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what continually disturbs us about this discussion is 
the fuzziness of the government's criteria for remaining and the 
fuzziness of its strategy in this troubled part of the world.
<P>
	I will ask the minister again a very straight question, one 
Canadians want answered. If the government has decided 
Canadian peacekeepers are to remain in the former Yugoslavia, 
with their lives even more at risk because of the escalating 
dangers, will it be conditional on the government's being given a 
place in the UN contact group, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
know why the hon. leader of the Reform Party is so preoccupied 
at this late date with the forum for discussion.
<P>
	Discussions are ongoing. There is nothing fuzzy about the 
government's position. I do not know how the hon. leader of the 
Reform Party can make that statement having sat here last night 
and listened to my speech in which I outlined the number of 
criteria for our continued participation in a redefined UN 
mandate. That was outlined again today by our Minister of 
Foreign Affairs in The Hague.

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	A study conducted by Project Ploughshares, a research 
institute in Waterloo, Ontario, shows that in 1993-94, more than 
US$200 million in military equipment manufactured in Canada 
was exported to at least 11 of the 39 countries ravaged by civil 
war last year, in contravention of the arms exports controls.
<P>
	How can the Minister of National Defence explain the fact 
that the government authorized the sale of Canadian-made arms 
and military equipment to countries like Peru, Turkey and 
Burma, where human rights are systematically violated?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canada is very clear in the 
countries that it supports with the delivery of arms and parts for 
munitions.
<P>
	Most of our trade is with the United States, with NATO 
countries or with other countries with which we have a 
production agreement. We do not send and sell arms to third 
world 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13004"> 13004 </A></B>
<P>
countries that are in a conflict  situation or any country that is in 
a conflict situation either with another state or with its internal 
population.
<P>
	We have not yet seen the report to which the member refers. It 
has not been made public to us but we will be reviewing it as 
soon as it is made available to the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> But this was reported in 
the press yesterday, Mr. Speaker. This study also shows that 
Canada is the seventh largest supplier of military weapons to 
third world countries.
<P>
	My supplementary is for the Minister of National Defence. 
Are we to understand that this violation of arms trade 
regulations by the Canadian government is totally in line with 
its new foreign policy, which puts trade before human rights?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America

which was reported upon in the press yesterday has not been 
made publicly available to the government. We will be 
reviewing it when we do get that document.
<P>
	The fact is that Canada supports the reduction of the 
production in trade of conventional weapons. We are very active 
on the international commitment to that. We are dialoguing with 
other nations to see what we can do.
<P>
	We feel that the proliferation of conventional weapons is one 
of the most serious problems confronting our world and is 
causing so much of the conflict that we are having to address.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have a 
defence minister who is sending a double message to Canadians. 
On one hand he is beating his chest and talking tough about a 
beefed up mission to Bosnia while in reality his poor leadership 
and defence cuts have reduced the morale and effectiveness of 
our military.
<P>
	The minister cannot have it both ways. Is he going to cut the 
military or is he going to beef it up?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the critic 
for the Reform Party says that I have some explanations to give. 
Perhaps he would like to give an explanation to Canadians as to 
why he advocated yesterday on behalf of his party that 
Canadians retreat from Bosnia, leave our hostages there and 
allow the rest to get him out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Reformers or 
Canadians do not leave hostages behind when they conduct a 
retreat.
<P>
	This morning, the Bosnian ambassador to the UN commented 
on the uselessness of the UN operation. He said: ``Under these 
circumstances, the humanitarian mission is over''. Considering 
this, will the Prime Minister admit that no humanitarian aid is 
getting through and that this reality is a direct contradiction to 
what he argued yesterday in this House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps 
it says something about the state of the Reform Party that the 
hon. foreign affairs critic seems to know a lot about the science 
of retreat. Perhaps he would like to edify the House as to how 
that will apply to other Reform Party policies.
<P>
	The fact is that we are not going to leave those people in the 
former Yugoslavia to brutality, to torture or to carnage. We 
believe we have an obligation as part of the United Nations 
mandate to help bring some stability to that area. We are 
certainly not going to do anything to endanger the safety of our 
captured troops, least of all retreat.

	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The people of Saint-Siméon and the surrounding area in the 
Charlevoix riding, are bracing themselves for the 
unemployment insurance reforms imposed by the minister in the 
February 1994 budget. These dramatic reforms are hitting them 
very hard. Entire families have been forced onto social 
assistance, because of the inadequacy of the unemployment 
insurance system.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that his reforms have pushed 
thousands of citizens, like those of Saint-Siméon, closer to 
misery, and that he must revoke these cuts in order to stop 
thousands of unemployed people from flocking to social 
assistance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I have pointed out in the 
House in the past, our changes to the unemployment insurance 
provide a substantially higher benefit for low income 
unemployment insurance claimants. In the last account I think 
some 280,000 Canadians, including 80,000 in the province of 
Quebec alone, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13005"> 13005 </A></B>
<P>
have been able to receive an additional $1,000 per year as a 
result of the changes we implemented.
<P>
	I have read the comments of the people of the St. Simeon area 
and their concern about the design of the UI zone, but that is a 
very different issue. That goes back to the UI reforms which 
were brought in by the Conservative government when the hon.

	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, here is

it is now time to act.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that, while he doles millions of 
dollars out to the Winnipeg Jets, the unemployment insurance 
cuts made by this government and the one before it, in particular 
those contained in this government's last two budgets, are 
making life miserable for the unemployed and unbearable for 
seasonal workers?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Please ask your question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will start over again.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that the unemployment insurance 
cuts-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, I could not hear you. Please 
ask your question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, here is my question.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that, while he doles millions of 
dollars out to the Winnipeg Jets, the unemployment insurance 
cuts contained in this government's last two budgets are making 
life unbearable for seasonal workers and are causing people 
from Charlevoix to starve?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member could 
serve his constituents in that area most effectively if he were 
able to use his powers of persuasion with his colleagues to join 
with us as we attempt to provide a major modernization of the 
unemployment insurance system. It will provide the kinds of 
tools and resources that will enable people to get back to work.
<P>
	The problem is the Bloc Quebecois has opposed every effort 
to provide for an improved unemployment insurance system, 
every effort to give people more resources to get back to work. I 
would appeal to the hon. member to use his good offices to try to 
change his party's policies and co-operate with us in trying to 
provide a much more effective unemployment insurance system 
for Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it seems the government will leave our Canadian forces 
in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Our mandate in Bosnia is to assist in the delivery of goods, but 
the Sarajevo airport is and has often been closed and when 
convoys do move they are often prevented from reaching their 
destinations. Last night the defence minister suggested that to 
reduce our vulnerability we will pull in our observers and 
concentrate our forces for protection.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	Will the minister explain how we are to carry out our mandate 
when supplies are not getting through and our troops are all 
hunkered down in bunkered compounds?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
critic for the Reform Party is taking considerable licence with 
what I said last night.
<P>
	When we talk about perhaps bringing the UNMOs out of 
exposed situations, that to me is good common sense. When we 
talk about concentration of troops as the Prime Minister has 
explained, this does not necessarily apply to Canada because our 
troops are reasonably well concentrated at our two posts at 
Kiseljak and Visoko. But it does make good sense for the UN to 
continue the mandate to have some concentration of its forces so 
there is less exposure.
<P>
	I would like to take exception to what the hon. member has 
been saying in terms of the discharging of the mandate in 
Bosnia. The fact is that for most of the last three years those 
flights have operated with Canadian Hercules from Ancona to 
Sarajevo. That has been a lifeline which has kept those people 
fed. The other convoys have been getting through. Of course in 
the last couple of weeks things have been difficult, but the last 
couple of weeks does not tell the tale.
<P>
	I continue to be completely surprised as to how members of 
his party stand in the House and offer a plan to retreat when they 
should be offering the Canadian people a plan to retrieve our 
peacekeepers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Reform Party is suggesting a withdrawal.
<P>
	Will the government acknowledge that withdrawal at this 
time does not mean abandonment of the region but rather opens 
the door to other options which are currently unavailable 
because of the threat of hostages? For instance, has the 
government considered replacing withdrawn ground forces with 
an air squadron, thus continuing Canadian presence and 
providing a needed capability?

detailed plans for a retreat. Now the hon. member is asking for 
the application of air power.

<P>
	The action taken by the RCMP and CSIS against Pierre 
Laberge, a retired RCMP employee who came down in favour of 
Quebec sovereignty, was apparently not enough for Normand 
Chamberland, Director General of CSIS in Quebec, since he has 
just fired Mr. Laberge's wife for no reason after 10 years of 
service.
<P>
	How can the solicitor general let Normand Chamberland, who 
planted bombs in Quebec in the 1970s, be so unfair to Mr. 
Laberge's wife, simply because Mr. Laberge expressed his 
support for Quebec sovereignty?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, it is a well known fact that CSIS is cutting staff. It 
seems that the employee in question is part of the cuts. I have 
been told that this decision has nothing to do with opinions she 
or her husband expressed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it so 
happens that Mr. Laberge's wife was the only one not wanting to 
leave and that the job cut, effective June 1, was announced last 
Tuesday. The fact that the government condones this action 
suggests that she indeed was fired.
<P>
	Is the government so worried about the outcome of the 
referendum campaign that it condones such acts of pure 
intimidation against people whose only crime is to have a 
sovereignist spouse?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I do not accept the hon. member's allegations. As I just 
said, the decision is due to the staff cuts at CSIS and has nothing 
to do with the opinions in question.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	It is sometimes not possible to lay off only those employees 
who want to leave. In cutting staff at CSIS and in other services, 
it will not be possible to get everybody who has to leave to do so 
voluntarily.

I would like to thank the hon. member for his concern in this

time. Consultations are ongoing but if the consultations are 
successful we expect to bring it in by August 1 of this year.
<P>
	It is an initiative that is consistent with the U.S.-Canada 
border accord that the Prime Minister and the President of the

certain recommendations about the availability of Canadian

paper. That means that in certain circumstances for conflicts of 
this nature we should have ready additional personnel if 
required. The white paper calls for that and those people are 
there. We are taking steps to address the fact that we have been

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am amazed at the responses from the Minister of 
National Defence and the Prime Minister today. Are we talking 
about the same conflict? When we listen to them we think ``now 
we have them right where they want us''. That is the situation we 
are in.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence said that Canada has no 
plans to send additional troops at the moment. This is what he 
said: ``Unless there is a need for a withdrawal of forces under the 
auspices of NATO, and then of course we would be part''-
<P>

question.
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Given that the minister disbanded the airborne 
regiment, Canada's sole rapid reaction force, what resources 
does he have left to send over?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
perhaps would not want to get into a convoluted answer to a 
convoluted question.
<P>
	I will take this opportunity to say that one of the people who 
has been detained, hostage Captain Rechner, was contacted a 
few hours ago through a Serbian interpreter. He is in good shape 
and is well fed. He has been able to bring supplies from his own 
quarters but he is still being detained. He is no longer being 
chained to a pole.
<P>
	I thought the House would want to know this. We remain 
concerned about Captain Lapalm. Of course the other people 
who are detained in Ilijas are in relatively good shape, as we 
have previously described.

<P>
	If you consider that Michel Robert was appointed to the 
Quebec Court of Appeal, and if you add to that the fact that 
Jacques Courtois took ill and Rosemary Brown clearly lost 
interest, it would appear that the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee has become virtually inoperable. There is no one 
monitoring the activities of the Canadian secret service. While 
the cat is away, the mice will play and the spies will spy.
<P>
	Does the solicitor general recognize that, for all intents and 
purposes, the Security Intelligence Review Committee is not 
functional and that there is therefore an urgent need to fill the 
vacancy and replace members who are no longer interested in 
carrying out their responsibilities?
<P>

	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

the Security Intelligence Review Committee is inoperable. It is 
in the position to carry out its functions. There are a sufficient 
number of members there to fulfil the requirement of the law 
with respect to its quorum. However, the matter of the vacancy 
is under review by the cabinet. I hope there will be an

this question. This position will be filled very shortly. I am very

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
defence minister has been widely quoted as saying that Canada 
supports the NATO air strikes. On Saturday, however, Canadian 
UN ambassador Robert Fowler stated that the Canadian 
government opposed punitive air strikes against Bosnian Serbs. 
``Air strikes as NATO carried out last week'', he said, ``were not 
useful''.
<P>
	Is Bob Fowler still running Canadian defence policy? If not, 
can the minister correct this discrepancy by explaining Canada's 
actual position?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there has 
been no change with respect to Canada's policy on the use of 
NATO air power.
<P>
	We had a number of discussions a year ago. The Prime 
Minister was in those discussions. As a result, we agreed to the 
use of NATO air power when requested by the UN forces on the 
ground for close air support, for protection of UN personnel and 
in certain situations relating to the safety of people in the 
various enclaves in Croatia and Bosnia. However, we did agree 
in certain circumstances that they could be used for other less 
defensive needs.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	In the last couple of days we have said that if such air attacks 
as were deployed last week were to be used again, we would 
prefer some modification to the approval process so that Canada 
would certainly be part of that decision in a more formal sense.
<P>
	With respect to the general application of the policy with 
close air support, as I have earlier described, we are quite happy 
with the way that process has been working in the past.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
Bob Fowler would feel so free to express his own personal 
opinion I think speaks volumes about the mess at the 
Department of National Defence. There is a huge vacuum of 
leadership. I think Mr. Fowler thought he would step in and fill 
it.
<P>
	What is the minister doing to improve the communications 
and clear up the confusion in his own department at a time when 
the safety of our own troops depends on it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
seeing a pattern of questions in the House today that is very 
unfortunate.
<P>
	The lives of Canadian men and women are in danger. Despite 
our partisan differences on other matters, all of our questions 
and all of our thoughts should be on how to improve the 
situation, not to make petty criticisms on the floor of the House 
of Commons.
<P>
	The hon. member speaks of a vacuum, but when we hear the 
comments of his defence critic, who a few moments ago said 
``retreat is not withdrawal and withdrawal doesn't mean you 
leave'', one wonders where the vacuum is and who is actually 
setting policy on that side of the House.

	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Agriculture. As he 
knows, last April 27 the Canadian Wheat Board issued an 
embargo on pasta from the European Union.
<P>
	This action has spawned an artificial distribution system, 
weakened the financial stability of hundreds of family retail 
enterprises dependent on the sales of pasta for survival and put 
thousands of Canadian jobs at risk. Moreover, for consumers it 
has caused a price increase for a reduced variety of product. Will 
the minister either rescind the order or modify it so these effects 
can be corrected?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the source of the problem 
described by the hon. member in his question is obviously 
European subsidization on European pasta exports which 
recommenced as of April 1.
<P>
	We have asked the Europeans to withdraw their subsidies, but 
to date they have declined. The Canadian Wheat Board has had 
no choice but to respond, which the board did on April 27 by 
reimposing Canadian import restrictions on certain pasta 
products.
<P>
	These restrictions limited imports to retail sized packages 
imported by retailers. Since the time that measure was imposed 
we have been made aware by the hon. member and by others of 
certain unintended effects to small retailers who normally use 
wholesalers to import pasta on the small retailers' behalf.
<P>
	Accordingly the Canadian Wheat Board is making certain 
administrative adjustments to address this issue to allow import 
permits for pasta imported by wholesalers if that pasta has been 
imported on behalf of a small retailer and will be sold only to the

question of privilege today because I feel that my privileges as a 
member of Parliament and my privacy have been severely 
undermined by the government through its report on plain and 
generic packaging of tobacco products.
<P>
	Because of the House recess last week, I have not been able to 
bring this matter to the attention of the House until today. The 
Minister of Health-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I would appeal to you. One of 
our members is rising on a point of privilege which could affect 
all hon. members in the House. I would ask you to please listen 
attentively, as I intend to do.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Wayne:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	The Minister of Health released the report two weeks ago. 
Over 1,300 copies were given to the press in the National Press 
Gallery. It contained eight pictures used in a visual impact 
study. To my astonishment, my picture was one of them. In the 
report I was stereotyped as a smoker, which I am not, grossly 
overweight, which my doctor says I am not, and I guess they 
have me almost as an 80-year-old woman, which I am not.
<P>
	At no time did I give permission for the photo to be used nor 
did anyone from the Department of Health consult me. This type 
of stereotyping is an assault on my dignity as an individual and 
as a member of the House. It opens me up to ridicule and thus 
may impede my ability to perform my duties effectively.
<P>
	To facilitate your work, Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw 
your attention to a ruling by your predecessor, Speaker Bosley, 
on a similar case in 1985. The issue involved an advertisement 
in a newspaper that identified a member of Parliament as 
someone else. Speaker Bosley said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Anything tending to cause confusion regarding a member's identity creates 
the possibility of an impediment to fulfilment of the member's functions and 
constitutes a breach of privilege.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Speaker Bosley ruled that it was a prima facie case and 
referred the matter to the Standing Committee on Privileges and 
Elections. That case is similar to mine because a member of 
Parliament was misrepresented.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	That is essentially the issue in this case. I have been identified 
and stereotyped in a manner that misrepresents me, not to 
mention the photo was used without my permission.
<P>
	I have asked the Prime Minister for a public apology for the 
unauthorized use of this photo in a public document and a full 
accounting and explanation of how the health minister could 
have allowed this to happen. I have yet to receive a response.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I 
rise today to participate in this debate on the Reform Party's 
motion, it is to protect the aspirations and vested rights of 
women in Quebec and Canada. As we know, this motion 
concerns employment equity. It embodies-pardon me for being 
so blunt-every myth conveyed against employment equity.
<P>
	The motion even refers to the concept of unnecessary, 
ineffective, costly, unpopular and discriminatory measures. Our 
colleagues from the Reform Party therefore conclude that this 
whole system should be abolished and replaced with a system 
based solely on merit. Before going any further, I take this 
opportunity to denounce the implication that employment 
equity target groups, namely women, aboriginal people, persons 
with disabilities and visible or ethnic minorities, do not have as 
much merit as others.
<P>
	Let us start with a definition. What is employment equity? In 
a document prepared by the Public Service Alliance of Canada 
for the 1992-93 regional conference of women, employment 
equity is defined as a process intended to bring about an equal 
distribution of workers who are too often refused training and 
promotion occupations within certain groups and areas. It added 
that, to be successful, employment initiatives must go beyond 
mere recruiting to ensure an environment free from 
discriminatory practices at work.
<P>
	It should also be pointed out that one can take one of two 
views on employment equity; one being centred on results and 
the other on equal opportunity. I like to think that our society is 
seeking a balanced mix of the two.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois fully supports the principle underlying 
the employment equity legislation. Recognition of the fact that 
entire segments of our society are basically denied equal access 
to decent jobs is crucial to the issue of women and poverty.
<P>
	Women, as we have said time and time again, are poor. 
Women members of visible minority groups, aboriginal women 
and women with disabilities are even poorer. Is it necessary, in 
May 1995, to back this up with statistics? I think not, and I will 
spare the House the statistics today.
<P>
	In the face of this problem of poverty, which all too often is 
chronic among women, one must realize that employment 
equity measures are not only necessary, but essential, in order to 
fight poverty. Only through economic equality will this problem 
be resolved, but except in rare cases, economic survival is 
dependent upon employment.
<P>
	Let us now move to the heart of the matter. Before statistics 
can be compiled on women or aboriginal people in key positions 
or their promotion rate, members of the target groups mentioned 
designated in the legislation must first find jobs. In order for 
them to have access to jobs, measures have to be developed to 
foster equal employment opportunity, as job access is dependent 
upon certain preconditions.
<P>
	For one thing, it may be useful to remind members that the 
mere existence of a sufficient number of available jobs is in 
itself a basic requirement. Some other conditions are the 
existence of full-time permanent jobs, a social infrastructure, 
adequate daycare and job training and access to non-traditional 
jobs. I will elaborate on the above points.
<P>
	As I already mentioned, saying that a sufficient number of 
jobs are necessary to promote the access of women and of other 
groups to employment is a truism. Unfortunately, it is all too 
true that the current government has relegated this issue to the 
sidelines.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has vehemently decried the shameful 
omission of job creation programs from the two Liberal budgets. 
In effect, apart from the national infrastructure program, this 
issue has been at a standstill. And the jobs which have been 
created, temporary for the most part, only target men. There is 
nothing available for women, nothing at all. We have already 
seen much better job access visions.
<P>
	Here is an example of an invalid policy on job access. To have 
access to jobs, there must first be jobs available. That is the very 
foundation of the principle. For women or other groups desig-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13011"> 13011 </A></B>
<P>
nated under the act to have equal access, the jobs that are 
accessible to them must be  full-time and permanent, just like 
most of the jobs held by white men. Why? Let us take a look at 
the statistics.
<P>
	A study carried out by Statistics Canada and published in the 
autumn of 1994 revealed that for the period between 1980 and 
1993, most of the people working part-time against their 
wishes, I stress against their wishes, were women. In 1993, some 
510,000 women in Canada held part-time positions, twice the 
number of men in the same category. Therefore, it is women who 
are having to deal with the problem of part-time work. The 
effect of this, as you might have guessed, is first on salary and 
then on advancement possibilities and thus on the possibility of 
attairing a better standard of living.
<P>
	Likewise, permanent jobs are essential. Women are in the 
unfortunate position of being the leaders in casual, seasonal and 
badly paid jobs.
<P>
	We have already referred to the march organized by Quebec 
women to demand that the government act to reduce poverty 
among women. The organizers of the ``bread and roses march'' 
are demanding, on behalf of the women of Quebec, what they 
have combined under the heading of social infrastructure, which 
includes the resources to be put in place to help improve the 
quality of life in their communities.
<P>
	I refer here to resources for self-help initiatives, help for the 
disadvantaged, popular education, day care, literacy programs 
and integration of new arrivals. These resources, in addition to 
providing obvious support for social organization also give rise 
to many jobs for women where their particular skills are 
recognized. These resources must be strengthened and 
supported. This is a measure promoting women's access to jobs.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	When it comes to job access, the immediate stumbling block 
for many women is child care. We must continually remind 
ourselves that real access to child care services is often the first 
step women must take on the road to work. If they run into a wall 
at this stage, there is no point in talking about job access. And 
we are still waiting for the government to move on this, as it 
promised to do in the red book, and provide day care spaces.
<P>
	Similarly, it is hard to talk about equal access to employment 
when individuals lack the training required to hold the jobs that 
are still available. Women have always been disadvantaged in 
this regard. The ``bread and roses'' marchers have drawn 
attention to the problems of women without cheques, women 
who are excluded from subsidized training programs, because 
they receive neither UI nor welfare
<P>
	The figures are alarming. Forty-four per cent of the adult 
population have not completed high school or professional 
studies. However, jobs created in the year 2000 will require 17 
years of education. When you do not have a diploma, it is hard to 
talk about equal opportunity.
<P>
	To conclude this overview of the prerequisites to access to 
employment, we must not forget women's access to 
non-traditional jobs, because they are for the most part the new 
jobs being created. As an example, I would like to mention the 
proposal made last week to the Conseil régional de concertation 
et de développement de Québec by the Regroupement des 
groupes de femmes du Québec and the Comité régional des 
partenaires pour l'accès et l'intégration des femmes aux 
secteurs d'emplois non traditionnels.
<P>
	This proposal asked that the Conseil régional establish an 
equal opportunity policy and enforce it in the implementation of 
projects submitted by sponsors. This is what is innovative about 
it: in order to promote the access of women to non-traditional 
employment, sponsors who wish to have a project approved by 
the Conseil régional will have to develop and implement an 
equity program within their business. Now that is taking the bull 
by the horns. It is also the sort of concrete action target groups 
need if they are to have equal access to employment.
<P>
	Let us now move on to the second stage of the process, the 
working environment per se, which brings us to some statistics. 
We will assume that there are measures to promote access to 
employment and that they are effective. Women and other 
groups therefore have jobs. Is there still a need for employment 
equity measures? As you will have guessed, the answer is yes.
<P>
	Who gets the jobs that pay well and that are higher up the 
ladder? Unfortunately, the statistics in no way back up the 
Reform Party's motion. First of all, with respect to salary, we 
know that women, even those with university diplomas, are still 
earning 73 per cent of what men earn. This is an inequality that 
is partially explained by the fact that women are concentrated in 
the lower ranking, and therefore less well remunerated, jobs.
<P>
	In the Public Service of Canada, 84 per cent of women occupy 
such jobs. However, women represent only 16.1 per cent of the 
executive group of this same employer. And yet, I would point 
out, the Public Service of Canada is governed by an employment 
equity act.
<P>
	In Quebec City, which has adopted an equity policy, women 
account for 81 per cent of employees earning less than $41,000. 
Imagine the situation when employers are not subject to this 
legislation. Women therefore occupy jobs that pay less and carry 
no decision making authority. They must also contend with the 
highly disturbing phenomenon of sexual harassment.
<P>
	We know that sexual harassment prevents women from 
attaining equality since victims often end up leaving their jobs 
or suffering the consequences when they file a complaint. The 
problem is a major one. It has been hardly a year since the daily 
newspaper <I>Le Droit</I> reported that, according to a Statistics 
Canada survey, 25 per cent of women said they had experienced 
harassment in the workplace, that is one woman in four. Of this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13012"> 13012 </A></B>
<P>
number, 39 per cent of incidents involved a person in authority.  
Surely no one would think for one moment that the job 
performance of a woman who is the victim of sexual harassment 
will be the same as that of a male colleague, that she will be 
evaluated objectively, that her opinion will be taken into 
account? Sexual harassment is a loathsome expression of the 
inequality that often plagues women. All the measures aimed at 
eliminating sexual harassment foster employment equity.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	I could also talk about the importance of working conditions 
that are compatible with parental or support roles, such as 
parental and maternity leave and flexible hours. Unfortunately, I 
do not have enough time. I can, however, tell you that such 
working conditions are an essential part of employment equity. 
The measures designed to help individuals juggle family and job 
responsibilities facilitate access to the labour market and 
especially job retention. Such equity measures ultimately 
promote women's economic equality.
<P>
	I cannot conclude without commenting on the insidious merit 
principle. The motion tabled by the Reform Party calls for 
rejecting Bill C-64 because hiring and promotion should be 
based solely on merit rather than on gender and race. If the hon. 
member for Fraser Valley East is so determined to put merit 
before gender and race, how does he explain the fact that women 
still earn only 73 cents for every dollar earned by men? I would 
like him to explain this to me.
<P>
	Of course, in an ideal world, hiring and promotion would be 
fair, and there would be no discrimination on the basis of race, 
gender or physical disability. Yet, statistics show that we do not 
live in an ideal world. Non-disabled white men still hold 78 per 
cent of management positions in the public service. The powers 
and the economic levers are in their hands.
<P>
	Let us look at the merit principle. As Kate Erickson of the 
National Association of Women and the Law claims, merit is 
assessed in a traditional way based on value judgments. The 
merit principle is part of discrimination history. In other words, 
during a job interview, a white man with the same lifestyle, 
clothing and education as the CEO will seem better qualified. 
On the other hand, a member of a visible minority will not 
benefit from the same stereotype and will seem unqualified. Yet, 
if these people were judged solely on their qualifications and 
experience, without a family name revealing ethnic origin, for 
example, it might be possible to look at their real qualifications 
independently of their social status.
<P>
	The notion of merit is rather arbitrary. Systemic barriers have 
always prevented some individuals from landing jobs. The 
employment equity legislation does not suggest that individuals 
without qualifications be hired. It does not suggest that we 
should hire people on the basis of their race, gender or physical 
condition. It suggests that systemic barriers be removed so that 
individuals who meet the job requirements can be hired in spite 
of their differences.
<P>
	In an ideal world free of racism and discrimination, we would 
not need this kind of legislation. However, in a world where 
employers do not want to hire a certain individual because it 
would mean having to widen doorways in order to allow 
wheelchair access, where 25 per cent of women are sexually 
harassed in the workplace, where women with disabilities and 
immigrant women are poorer than their male counterparts, we 
need such legislation. The fact is that, at present, the workplace 
does not operate on merit and is not fair and equal. Without 
legislation, there can be no fairness.
<P>
	Only a very small part of the motion is acceptable in its 
wording. ``Equality for all Canadians'' are fine words 
describing an ideal situation. Unfortunately, we are still a 
million miles from there, especially as far as women, aboriginal 
peoples, persons with disabilities and members of visible 
minorities are concerned. And it is for these people that we pass 
legislation on employment equity, so that, someday, they can 
have equal access to jobs available to men and finally break out 
of the poverty in which they are kept by the present system.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a member of the committee reviewing employment 
equity legislation, I am aware that 90 per cent of the witnesses 
who came before the committee supported the legislation. I am 
also aware that is likely more by the choice and selection of 
those witnesses than by the actual representation of the 
Canadian population to support that.
<P>
	I have have just done a random telephone poll in my 
constituency. My constituency is on the outskirts of Vancouver. 
It is one of the more multicultural communities in our area, with 
a high percentage of immigration, at least 50 per cent women, I 
am sure, and so on.
<P>
	The results of that random polling were opposite to what the 
committee experienced. There was a 90 per cent rejection of any 
kind of hiring other than on the basis of merit alone. I was 
interested in some of the member's comments regarding merit. 
The Canadian people think highly of that as a criterion for 
hiring.
<P>
	She commented on women in the workplace; 73 per cent of the 
average wage and 78 per cent of men being in management 
within the public service. Is my colleague aware that some of 
that may be due to choice or the time factor involved in entry 
into the workforce? Is she aware there are far more women being 
allowed to enter grad school now than there are men? The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13013"> 13013 </A></B>
<P>
average wage coming out of university is equal if not slightly to 
the advantage of women.
<P>
	Does she think women have the right to claim a choice if they 
do not want to work full time? Is that a right they have if they 
want to stay home with their families? Does she feel a woman 
should enter full time into the workforce and demand equal right 
for pay or can she choose to work less than that if she feels her 
priorities are elsewhere?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will answer my 
colleague's three questions. I would be interested in seeing the 
mini-survey of ethnic communities she says she conducted, 
because a survey is supposed to be scientific. I would also like to 
see from what perspective and in what order the questions were 
asked. We all know that survey results can vary greatly, 
depending on the way the question is asked and on the selection 
of participants.
<P>
	Therefore, I am going to go back to the committee. We have 
heard a lot from ethnic communities, which all demand that the 
act be maintained, because they are one of the groups which has 
made the least progress. Therefore, I would like to see the 
mini-survey conducted by the hon. member, and we could 
perhaps analyze her constituents' answers scientifically. I 
would very much like to see it, but what I do know is that the 
ethnic communities which came before the committee said the 
opposite of what my colleague claims.
<P>
	In reply to her second question, the percentages I quoted are 
from the Canadian public service which is already governed by 
the Employment Equity Act. I could bring to my colleague's 
attention that women are under-represented in management 
positions and that this was what drew my criticism. My 
colleague can cite other statistics, the widely accepted statistics 
still remain, and they lament the under-representation of 
women in management positions.
<P>
	My colleague also raised the issue of a woman's choice to stay 
at home. I myself have nothing against a woman choosing to 
stay home and raise her children. I believe that it is not my place 
to dictate the daily lives of women. What I really want to see are 
balanced measures which promote the integration of various 
groups, which include women, and give them access to 
well-paid stable jobs and good working conditions. We all know 
that many women hold unstable jobs and that the expression 
``unstable job'' means that they do not have access to their 
employer's benefit packages.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Thus, I could not agree more with women having the choice of 
staying home. However, should they decide to enter the 
workforce, both women and disadvantaged designated groups 
should be given every possible chance and access to measures 
permitting them to hold well-paid jobs and to be trusted and 
treated with respect by their employers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In consultation with the 
table officers I understand the rotation has been shifted a few 
times today. With the greatest respect to all members, I am 
looking for a speaker from the party whose allotted day it is. If 
someone from that party is seeking the floor, I will recognize 
them and then I will go to the government.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak today to the Reform Party's opposition 
day motion on employment equity.
<P>
	The motion states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House deplore the government's employment equity policy as 
unnecessary, ineffective, costly, unpopular, intrusive, discriminatory and 
harmful to designated and non-designated groups; that this House recognize 
the equality of all Canadians by affirming that hiring and promotion be based 
solely on merit rather than on gender and race; and that discriminatory 
employment practices be more vigorously pursued on an individual, case by 
case basis.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Reform Party approaches the issue of employment equity 
from this principle of the equality of all Canadians. We believe 
all Canadians are equal regardless of what personal 
characteristics they possess such as race, ethnicity, sex or what 
part of the country they live in.
<P>
	We believe in the equality of opportunity in the marketplace 
but realize that equality will not necessarily result in equality of 
results. The concept of our government sponsored employment 
equity philosophy takes a much different approach.
<P>
	It seeks to identify specific groups that ostensibly have been 
discriminated against and are therefore considered 
disadvantaged. Specifically, it has identified the four groups, 
women, aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities and 
members of visible minorities.
<P>
	I have a number of concerns about the concept of employment 
equity and about its practical implementation. I want to 
demonstrate employment equity as such is based on a number of 
flawed assumptions.
<P>
	Of great concern to me is that the government purports to 
support the concept of the equality of all Canadians. Yet this 
very principle, employment equity, and its underlying 
philosophy fly directly in the face of the principle of true 
equality.
<P>
	How can the principle of equality be respected if some groups 
are given preferential treatment in hiring, recruitment and 
promotion in the public or the private sector through 
employment equity laws and regulation?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13014"> 13014 </A></B>
<P>
	This contradiction is best exhibited in the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms, section 15(1):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the 
equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in 
particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, 
colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is a statement in our Constitution on the equality of our 
citizens and the prohibition of discrimination based on certain 
characteristics. Yet the contradiction to that philosophy of 
employment equity is revealed in the next section of the charter, 
section 15(2):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its 
object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups 
including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic 
origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	How can the charter of rights and freedoms recognize the 
equality of Canadian citizens on one hand and then turn around 
and state that principle of equality does not apply under certain 
circumstances?
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	Some argue employment equity is needed because certain 
portions of our population have been historically disadvantaged. 
Let me discuss that for a moment.
<P>
	Prior to 1967 most immigration into Canada was from Europe 
and caucasian in character. Since that time our immigration 
patterns have changed, to the better I am sure. Many immigrants 
from all parts of the world are high wage earners. Most visible 
minorities in Canada, because of government policies, are either 
immigrants or children of immigrants. Going back to the 
original philosophy, how then can they be deemed at an historic 
disadvantage?
<P>
	Surveys have shown some visible minority groups are among 
our highest wage earners. Also, many come from highly 
advantaged, educated backgrounds and yet are promoted and 
protected by the employment equity legislation. Conversely, 
other identifiable groups, ones not included in the visible 
minority category, have low incomes and may face real 
discrimination in the marketplace. They are left out of the 
legislation. They are deemed less than equal because they are 
not part of what is defined in this group.
<P>
	The government purports to put forward the concept of 
numerical goals and employment equity and will go to the wall 
to say that never are these things to be deemed as quotas or 
affirmative action.
<P>
	I will take a few moments to review some of the historical 
context of the present debate for it sheds much light on the 
intention and direction of the present legislation.
<P>
	As early as 1979 the Canada employment and immigration 
commission established its affirmative action directive as an 
advisory tool to the department. Then in 1983 the hon. member 
for Windsor West, then President of the Treasury Board, 
introduced a mandatory program of affirmative action in the 
public service. Even at the outset there was a determined refusal 
not to admit to the real meaning of racially based job quotas. As 
we hear him say from those days: ``The numerical goals we will 
be introducing as part of the affirmative action are not quotas''. 
Those words are still said today but do they really mean 
anything?
<P>
	Of special interest is the 1984 report of the federal royal 
commission. Judge Abella was the chair and the only member of 
the commission which produced the report entitled ``Equality in 
Employment''. In it the term employment equity appeared for 
the first time. Abella rejected the older phrase affirmative action 
on clearly pragmatic grounds.
<P>
	I quote from the report her reason for using the new term: ``No 
great principle is sacrificed in exchanging phrases of disputed 
definitions for newer ones that may be more accurate and less 
destructive of reasoned debate''. Obviously a pragmatic choice 
of words, and for that reason the term employment equity was 
invented and the term affirmative action was tossed aside.
<P>
	In addition, the phrase numerical goals used in employment 
equity legislation is really a euphemism for quotas. Bill C-64, 
which was recently debated by the human rights commission, 
incorporates numerical goals or quotas. Clause 10(1)(d) 
requires employers to incorporate quotas within the 
employment equity plan. This clause reads that an employer 
shall establish short term numerical goals for the hiring and 
promotion of persons in the designated groups in order to 
increase their representation in each occupational group in the 
workforce in which under-representation has been identified 
and sets out measures to be taken in each year to meet those 
goals.
<P>
	Another illustration of the quota approach is the Treasury 
Board's annual report on employment equity in the public 
service. It outlines in some detail the philosophy of targets or 
quotas in all aspects of employment, in the recruitment, 
promotion and even the separation of employees from the 
employer. It is presented in pure numbers with percentages and 
totals broken down into a litany of categories. The problem with 
this approach is that the world is not so neatly configured. 
Numbers do not reflect the real world.
<P>
	This leads to a third flat assumption of the employment equity 
philosophy. If these numerical goals or quotas are not met and 
consistent with the calculated diversity of our society it is 
therefore concluded there must be discrimination that is 
systemic in our society.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13015"> 13015 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Let me discuss the concept of systemic discrimination. 
Underlying the Abella report and all subsequent legislation has 
been the conviction that racism in the form of systemic 
discrimination is rampant in our society.
<P>
	Abella's report stated: ``Non-whites all across Canada 
complained of racism. They undeniably face discrimination 
both overt and unjust''. This report was from a commission that 
went across the country.
<P>
	Who would present themselves to a committee such as that? 
Would people who are happy in their circumstance go out of 
their way to present? I do not think so. Perhaps even in this first 
statement of systemic discrimination we have a distortion.
<P>
	Is Canada a racist country? Perhaps this would be the 
strongest argument for an affirmative action program as we see 
here. We have equity departments throughout the public service 
and the private sector and race relations councils where 
individuals come forward to attest to alleged discrimination and 
racism.
<P>
	As I have mentioned, typically the people who come forward 
are self-selected individuals who address these committees. 
They are motivated by circumstance. Do we hear from the whole 
population? It is true racism does exist. I believe all societies 
have an element of racism to some degree. I also believe Canada 
is by far not the worst. Part of our opposition to this bill is in 
terms of guarding against a piece of legislation we believe 
would promote an attitude of racism in the sense of dividing 
people rather than bringing them together in our great society.
<P>
	Is racism limited to only one race? Even as the media 
discusses this issue we hear the terms white and racist put 
together interchangeably. Even the term reverse discrimination 
which has been discussed today assumes discrimination goes 
only one way, from whites to non-whites. I reject that notion. If 
we look at racism in real terms it can be from one race toward 
any race. I do not think whites or other races have any particular 
claim to it.
<P>
	Is racism real in Canada? It is an element in our society like in 
any other. Let me cite two reports. The Economic Council of 
Canada put out a report in 1991, ``New Faces in a Crowd: 
Economic and Social Impacts of Immigration''. It concluded 
Canada had been remarkably successful in assimilating 
immigrants from diverse backgrounds. It found there was no 
significant discrimination against immigrants and that tolerance 
toward immigrants was high and was found to be increasing.
<P>
	Another report from the Economic Council of Canada in 
1992, ``Earnings of Immigrants: A Comparative Analysis'', 
focused more on what immigrants were paid. It found 
unemployment among immigrants was actually lower than for 
Canadian born citizens. This report's central conclusion was 
there was no evidence of a  systemic pay discrimination against 
immigrants on the basis of colour.
<P>
	There is a necessity to recognize diversity in our society. The 
whole basis of employment equity rests on the raw numbers of 
diversity. It is argued it should be reflected in employment in the 
public sector and to a lesser extent in the private sector.
<P>
	However, the diversity measured by employment equity is 
measured through a voluntary process called 
self-identification. Individuals must declare themselves as 
belonging to a particular group that makes them eligible for 
employment equity. This can be a very great problem with the 
proposed system. This information is accumulated primarily 
through the census of population data. For gender the process is 
a given, but the self-identification process begins to break down 
when determining who are visible minorities or who are persons 
with disabilities.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	For instance, to determine if one is a member of a visible 
minority one has to go through a four-step process as defined by 
the employment equity data program established by Statistics 
Canada. Step No. 1: persons are asked which ethnic or cultural 
group their ancestors belonged to. They are even asked to mark 
or specify as many as applicable among 15 possible choices. 
Step No. 2: persons are asked in what country they were born; if 
Canada, what province or territory; if outside Canada, what 
other country. Step No. 3: a question is asked about the person's 
mother tongue. Step No. 4 attempts to group those the first three 
steps failed to classify.
<P>
	The process is not foolproof. It does not produce accurate 
results. It is not precise. It is fully voluntary. Yet it is the 
foundation of employment equity.
<P>
	The government uses self-identification for implementation 
of its employment equity in the public service and here too the 
process fails miserably. For example, a voluntary 
self-identification survey was recently sent to 1,700 employees 
of the House of Commons. Only 23 per cent returned the survey. 
What basis could the employer use to implement a policy such 
as employment equity?
<P>
	There could be a number of other reasons that could explain 
alleged discrimination. Since self-identification is voluntary it 
will not be precise. The process, as I have mentioned, is not and 
should not be foolproof. There are social, cultural and 
educational explanations that may have an effect upon the 
disparities in society that have absolutely nothing to do with 
discrimination.
<P>
	A glaring example of the inadequacies of the voluntary 
self-identification program were illustrated in a letter I read 
recently in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> of February 28. I would like to 
read part of it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13016"> 13016 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Your editorial Time for a Debate on Employment Equity-argues that 
``Canadians who oppose affirmative action must fight it through the ordinary 
political process''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But there is a more effective way to fight affirmative action. Those who 
oppose it should simply indicate on their workforce surveys that they belong 
to all of the designated groups. If even 10 per cent of those who oppose 
affirmative action were to do so, then virtually every workforce would be 
found to be adequately represented for employment equity purposes. This 
would release employers from the obligation to meet quotas, allowing them to 
hire the most competent applicants regardless of biology.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Current legislation does not define membership in the designated 
groups-indeed, membership is mostly subjective. Employers are obligated to 
accept employees' and applicants' self-identification as being correct. 
Moreover, workplace surveys are meant to be confidential, and Canadian 
human rights legislation prohibits employers from requiring employees or job 
candidates to prove their biological status. So sabotaging the employment 
equity bureaucracy in the way suggested is arguably not illegal and is 
certainly without risk to either employees or employers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Thus the problems associated with a statistical base such as 
voluntary self-identification cannot be resolved. Therefore the 
whole basis and foundation for employment equity is seriously 
flawed and this certainly illustrates it.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes in the true equality of all 
Canadians regardless of their personal characteristics. Public 
opposition to the bill is seen in the upcoming Ontario election 
where two old line parties have moved closer to our position on 
the issue.
<P>
	The government would like us to believe that affirmative 
action, as it would have it, would eliminate barriers and combat 
a broad based disadvantage to certain groups. However, I 
believe that legislative quota programs like employment equity 
actually confer benefits or impose disabilities because of race 
and formally divide people into racial definitions and racial 
mindsets.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Some of the strongest opponents I have heard regarding the 
legislation have been those familiar with the realities of similar 
programs elsewhere, such as in South Africa.
<P>
	Legislated employment equity suggests to everyone, 
including the individual involved, that the reason they got the 
job was their race or disability and not their ability or aptitude. 
Thus this kind of legislation cheapens the accomplishments and 
efforts of individuals. It degrades individuals by conferring on 
them a definition of victimhood. It separates Canadians into 
competing subgroups while putting unnecessary burdens on our 
national economy and on our good business practice sense.
<P>
	We have a history of chequered motives and subversive 
citizenship. We have a program that is based on flawed 
assumptions of systemic discrimination. We have a denial of a 
basic principle of merit with the introduction of quotas and 
numerical goals and coercion  and government interference 
through reports, fines and intrusive government practices.
<P>
	Our position as a country will best be served in the global 
economy by market demands in the places of employment. Our 
future and unity as a country will be best assured by ensuring 
true equality of Canadians, not by job quotas but by the equality 
of the personhood and the real abilities of all Canadians.
<P>
	In summary, employment equity is seriously flawed and 
conceptually flawed in practice. I encourage Canadians to 
express their views on employment equity and Bill C-64 with 
which Parliament is currently dealing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first by way of comment, with respect to the witnesses 
who appeared before the Standing Committee on Human Rights 
and the Status of Disabled Persons, let it be recorded that a list 
was submitted by the Reform Party and many people on the list 
declined the invitation to appear before the committee. It was no 
fault of the committee.
<P>
	Second, even at the last minute some witnesses cancelled out. 
That again was beyond the control of the committee studying the 
employment equity bill.
<P>
	Third, the member said on the steering committee that we 
would look at this in committee of the whole. To now fret over it 
after the fact I leave to the imagination of the House.
<P>
	The member said equality of opportunities may not 
necessarily lead to equality of results. That is right. However 
she failed to ask the question: What if the cost of the inability to 
lead to equality of results is systemic discrimination? Would the 
member agree that the best approach would not be on an 
individual case by case basis but a systemic approach such as 
legislation and policy initiatives of government?
<P>
	The member kept on referring to preferential hiring. This is 
the myth one perpetuates if one would like one's political 
agenda to win, but it is not being honest with Canadians. To say 
that it should only be based on the principle of merit and 
qualifications as though people in designated groups, women, 
visible minorities, persons with disabilities and First Nations 
people have no qualifications and no merit.
<P>
	Studies have shown that they have been discriminated against 
for decades. Why would the member continue to insist that 
numerical goals are the same as quotas? The bill before the 
Chamber states in subclause 30(1):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No compliance officer may give a direction under section 23 and no 
Tribunal may make an order under section 27 where that direction or order</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(e) would impose a quota on an employer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13017"> 13017 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	The bill is very clear that it is not about quota. If the Reform 
Party would only pose this question to the Canadian people, I am 
sure it would get the right answer.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to answer some of 
the questions.
<P>
	I actually sat on the committee. I find it interesting the chair 
of the committee does not deny that 90 per cent of the witnesses 
supported the legislation and there were others who were asked. 
Of the 30-some people we suggested 4 came before the 
committee.
<P>
	It may indeed have been the case that some could not come or 
that some cancelled out. We were not informed of that 
beforehand. The fact the government now indicates that 90 per 
cent of the committee supported legislation tells me it is using a 
number not representative of Canadians to support something 
for its own purposes. I find that objectionable. Those numbers 
do not reflect Canadian society.
<P>
	There was a question asked about systemic discrimination. I 
find the term systemic discrimination quite objectionable. I 
tried in my speech to express that it is a word that supports the 
whole notion of employment equity but removes the necessity of 
proving there was any discrimination in a particular case.
<P>
	It puts a blanket over a hiring practice. The claim of systemic 
discrimination allows an employer to discriminate against 
groups not within the group. It compares employees as a group 
with society as a group so that in individual cases there is no 
reality necessary in terms of discrimination. I do not believe 
discrimination is systemic. If there are individual cases of 
discrimination they should be brought forward as individual 
cases, as our motion states.
<P>
	I did not deny there was merit in the categories included in the 
legislation. Our party has said that there has to be equality of 
opportunity. That means addressing education, advertising job 
positions equally and fairly and access to jobs for all groups 
designated or non-designated. Those are where government 
legislation and government initiatives should be taking place, 
not in determining the result.
<P>
	As we give people access to these places, the marketplace will 
reflect the true reality of the Canadian people. That is what is 
important in the marketplace and for the good of the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise today to address the motion put forward 
by my hon. colleague from Fraser Valley East. I cannot say I am 
surprised that the hon. member and his party have chosen to 
deplore the government's employment equity policy.
<P>
	From the beginning of the hearings on Bill C-64, an act 
respecting employment equity, held by the Standing Committee 
on Human Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons the 
member and his party have been opposed to the principle and 
practice of employment equity. They have gone so far as to 
breach parliamentary tradition by going to the press with 
complaints about the bill before the beginning of clause by 
clause study of the bill by the committee.
<P>
	Ostensibly the Reform Party was desperate to draw attention 
to its political agenda. Frustrated by the lack of media coverage 
of the press conference, it became more interested in dilatory 
tactics than substantive debate during clause by clause study of 
the bill.
<P>
	I will now address point by point the motion before us. The 
Reform Party claims that employment equity is unnecessary. 
This could only be so if members opposite could show that the 
Canadian workplace proportionately reflects the demographics 
of qualified members of designated groups in the Canadian 
workforce: women, visible minorities, First Nations peoples 
and persons with disabilities. In fact documents show otherwise.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party claims the policy is ineffective. A study 
done by the Conference Board of Canada on the impact of the 
existing legislation shows that the major impetus for 
employment equity initiatives by employers was the passage of 
the 1986 Employment Equity Act.
<P>
	The Reform Party claims the policy is unpopular. I counter 
that witnesses before the committee studying the new 
employment equity legislation, representing thousands and 
thousands of Canadians, were nearly unanimous in their praise 
of the thrust and strength of the legislation.
<P>
	Moreover, it should be noted that equity in employment is 
about justice, fairness, human decency and human dignity. 
Employment equity as a policy and as a law is for all and 
benefits all Canadians, workers and employers alike.
<P>
	The Reform Party claims employment equity is intrusive. I 
would counter that more than 90 per cent of the witnesses that 
appeared before the committee welcomed the policy, welcomed 
the legislation and said that it made good business sense.
<P>
	Employers which appeared as witnesses included the 
Canadian Bankers' Association, the Canadian Association of 
Broadcasters, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the 
Canadian Manufacturers' Association and many more. 
Witnesses from labour included the Canadian Labour Congress, 
the Public Service Alliance, la Confédération des syndicats 
nationaux among others. Designated groups which appeared as 
witnesses included Women in Trades and Technology, the 
Assembly of First Nations, the Council of Canadians with 
Disabilities and the Canadian Ethnocultural Council among 
others. These wit-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13018"> 13018 </A></B>
<P>
nesses; employers, labour and designated groups, all  welcomed 
the employment equity policy of the government.
<P>
	It should be noted that the non-designated group continues to 
be hired and accounts for 55 per cent of the workforce according 
to the latest figures from Statistics Canada.
<P>
	The Reform Party claims that employment equity is 
discriminatory. I counter that the bill explicitly aims to achieve 
equality. Equality is the antithesis of discrimination.
<P>
	The purpose of this act ``is to achieve equality in the 
workplace so that no person shall be denied employment 
opportunities or benefits for reasons unrelated to ability''. The 
purpose is clearly stated in clause 2 of Bill C-64. Therefore, I 
highly recommend that the Reform Party once more read the 
clause, if not the entire bill. In fact, discrimination in hiring and 
promotion is the very injustice the employment equity policy 
and the attendant legislation seek to redress.
<P>
	The Reform Party moves that ``this House recognize the 
equality of all Canadians by affirming that hiring and promotion 
be based solely on merit''. I am pleased that at least on this score 
the Reform Party has it right. It pays once in a while for the 
Reform Party to heed government legislation and government 
advice.
<P>
	Bill C-64, the employment equity legislation which is before 
the Chamber, specifically stipulates in clauses 6(b) and (c) that 
the obligation to implement employment equity does not require 
an employer to hire or promote unqualified persons and to 
ensure that merit is fulfilled.
<P>
	The Reform Party claims that discriminatory employment 
practices could be more vigorously pursued on an individual 
case by case basis. That is the same type of logic which says, 
``We do not need more crime prevention; what we need is more 
police action after crimes are committed. Forget preventing 
crime, policing is all that counts. Catch the rascals and lock 
them up''. In effect that is the logic of the Reform Party. 
However, I am pleased to say it is not the policy of the 
government. I am confident it is not the belief of the vast 
majority of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	I counter that a more appropriate approach where systemic 
barriers to fair hiring practices still exist would be by way of 
legislation and other government policy initiatives such as 
education and training as was indicated by the Reform Party. 
However, education and training alone are not enough.
<P>
	Francine Arsenault, as chairwoman of the provincial 
organizations on the handicapped, once said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Disabled Canadians and other disadvantaged groups have worked long and 
hard to improve our appalling rate of representation in Canada's workplace. 
We have tried education and awareness programs. We have tried fostering 
goodwill, yet little has changed. The real causes of discrimination are not 
individuals but inflexible systems.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I pause here to call the minds and hearts of the Reform Party 
members to this observation in the hope that they will change 
their minds and hearts and withdraw the motion.
<P>
	Employment equity legislation expresses the will of the 
government that equity in employment is a priority and a right 
for all Canadians qualified for a job, irrespective of race, 
gender, origin or presence of disability.
<P>
	How ironic and unfortunate that the motion from the Reform 
Party has been introduced at this time when we are celebrating 
National Access Awareness Week. This is a week during which 
we specifically focus on the barriers which have prevented full 
participation of persons with disabilities in community life, 
including the workplace.
<P>
	This is a week during which we reaffirm as a nation our belief 
in equality of opportunities and results for all. This is a week 
during which we resolve as a nation that we shall tear down the 
barriers that limit full participation of all persons and supply the 
necessary tools, including legislation, to facilitate equity in 
employment. I ask, where is the heart of the Reform Party?
<P>
	I say to the Reform Party, fear not reverse discrimination, fear 
not employment equity policy, fear not employment equity 
legislation, but fear that equity in employment for women, 
visible minorities, First Nations people and persons with 
disabilities remains an elusive national dream.
<P>
	In conclusion, Canada shall continue to aspire at all costs and 
work hard to realize this national dream.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians are not fools because they may not follow along with 
the presentation of my hon. colleague across the way.
<P>
	A Gallup poll published in 1993 reflects on the comments this 
gentleman has made. It showed that 74 per cent of Canadians 
opposed government employment equity programs. The Ontario 
government advertised a job vacancy in a government 
newspaper with the explanation that the job competition was 
limited to the following employment equity designated groups. 
This is where Bill C-64 is going to take this country. The 
designated groups were aboriginal peoples, francophones, 
persons with disabilities, racial minorities and women. In other 
words, who is excluded? That was in a government 
advertisement. Is this where employment equity is going to take 
us?
<P>
	I would like this member's comments on the following two 
studies. These studies were done in the labour market where it 
was clearly indicated that no discrimination took place. The first 
study was conducted by Arnold deSilva of the Economic 
Council of Canada. On page 34 of the study he concluded: ``The 
evidence goes against the view that there is systematic 
discrimination against immigrants on the basis of colour''. On 
page 37, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13019"> 13019 </A></B>
<P>
the summary concludes: ``Persons who came from the third 
world regions but who arrived  here young enough to obtain all 
their education and experience in Canada performed as well as 
native born Canadians in nearly all the cases''. This study was 
conducted in 1992.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	The results of another study by Daniel Boothman are: ``The 
results of our job loss model show that women are less likely to 
lose jobs than men, all else being equal. Visible minority status 
had no significant effect on the probability of job loss''.
<P>
	Another point on page 50 states: ``Being a woman increases 
the probability of promotion in the model. This effect is 
significant at the 10 per cent level. Visible minority status had 
no significant effect''.
<P>
	In the final statement: ``In closing, this study found no strong 
evidence or a disadvantage for women and visible minorities in 
movement between jobs''.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member if he has studied and recorded 
these views in his presentation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadians cannot be fooled. I 
have faith in our people.
<P>
	The Reform Party has to be sure it has seen the questionnaire, 
the subquestions and whether the explanations have been given 
very well. That not being done, I will not comment further on 
that point.
<P>
	Second, he alluded to advertisements being posted limiting 
hiring to certain designated groups. This is against the Canadian 
Human Rights Act. This is not the intent of the legislation. Bill 
C-64 will not condone such advertising. If the member has 
knowledge of that he has an obligation to report it to the 
Canadian Human Rights Commission and file a proper 
complaint. I will be with him challenging that kind of 
advertising.
<P>
	The last point is that there is no discrimination now in the 
workforce according to the study which I have not seen. I will 
admit for the sake of argument in his reading of this that there 
has been no discrimination against visible minorities. Let us 
assume for the sake of argument it is a statement of fact. He said 
the study was done in 1992. The present law was passed in 1986.
<P>
	My conclusion is the law is working. Let us keep it to sustain 
positive equality in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
fairly evident from any survey of any group of people that there 
is no support for the government's bill among the population at 
large. Survey after survey comes back stating that 80 per cent of 
Canadians are opposed to bills of this type.
<P>
	I ask the member who is the chairman of the committee 
specifically about some things that happened there. Could this 
be the reason why the government, in an agreement with the two 
opposition parties, decided to take the bill after first reading 
directly to committee?
<P>
	The opposition parties thought there was going to be a fair 
opportunity to review the bill on a clause by clause basis. Once 
they got into committee they found that the chairman had 
decided that debate was going to be restricted to five minutes per 
clause which is completely out of touch with reality. Is this a fair 
and open way to study legislation or is it just a way for the 
government to slide things by so that the 80 per cent of 
Canadians who are opposed to this bill do not know that the 
government is sliding this one by them?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a fundamental rule in 
law. If one relies on hearsay it is very dangerous. It is not my 
recollection that this member had attended a meeting of our 
committee. Perhaps I missed one.
<P>
	Second, for him to say the chair decided on a five-minute 
limit to debate on clause by clause, please check the record.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Liberal members decided.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. The time has 
expired for questions and comments. I would add that we are 
treading very close to the line in terms of dealing with the actual 
motion of the Reform Party today and the business of the 
committee of the House. I would like to remind members to be 
somewhat judicious. Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is an honour for me to participate in this debate 
today. I thank my colleague from Winnipeg North for sharing his 
time with me.
<P>
	It is a great honour to rise in the House to respond to the 
motion put forward by the hon. member for Fraser Valley East 
which seeks to condemn the government for its policies in the 
area of employment equity, in particular Bill C-64. To be 
honest, I find the hon. member's motion hard to fathom since it 
flies in the face of two of the most cherished core values we hold 
as Canadians, justice and equality.
<P>
	The member of the opposition is correct in one regard, namely 
that this government is deeply committed to assuring equality of 
opportunity for all Canadians. This should come as no surprise 
for our red book clearly states that we seek a country where all of 
us see ourselves as contributors and participants and not 
liabilities and dependants. It further underlines our commitment 
to building a Canada characterized by integrity, compassion and 
competence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13020"> 13020 </A></B>
<P>
	Cherishing those values as we do, it is little wonder we would 
support employment equity which is, after all, simply a tool for 
assuring fairness in daily life. That is what we seek to do in Bill 
C-64.
<P>
	Why is the bill needed? While some progress has been made 
by the existing Employment Equity Act, recent statistics 
indicate that much remains to be done. 1993 actually saw the 
number of employees covered under the Employment Equity 
Act drop by 4.27 per cent. That is almost 26,000 people. Much of 
this was the result of the layoffs which flowed from the recent 
economic downturn from which we have just emerged. Sadly, 
members of the designated groups covered by Bill C-64 were 
often the hardest hit.
<P>
	While the number of people in designated groups increased, 
fewer of them found themselves in the labour market. Among 
those who did, most did not see the wage gains and promotional 
opportunities enjoyed by other working Canadians.
<P>
	Many women, aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities 
and members of visible minorities still find themselves on the 
bottom rung of the economic and social ladder. Of course this is 
not just their problem. Rather, it is a problem for all of us since 
restricting their participation in the economic life of our country 
also damages the competitiveness of Canadian business.
<P>
	It is increasingly obvious that a diverse workforce benefits 
companies by providing them with improved access to a greater 
number of qualified people. Indeed many businesses now 
realize that recruiting, promoting and retraining people who are 
representative of the Canadian population helps them provide 
better and more responsive client service since diverse 
experience and perspectives are a bonus, not a burden.
<P>
	How does this bill present a balanced approach? Contrary to 
what the hon. member and other members of his party might 
think, the bill before us is not some piece of wild-eyed 
radicalism totally divorced from the realities of economic life. 
Rather it is a moderate and thoughtful document which seeks to 
promote equal opportunity in the workplace without imposing 
an onerous regulatory environment on businesses that are 
already hard pressed in the increasingly competitive global 
marketplace.
<P>
	This balanced approach can be seen in all of the amendments 
contained in the bill. For instance, while the act seeks to 
encourage employers to address under-representation by 
members of designated groups, it does not require them to hire 
unqualified people, create new positions, create undue hardship 
or contradict the merit principle.
<P>
	Likewise, it does not impose a quota system as has occurred in 
other jurisdictions. While we have listened to representatives of 
designated groups who have called for an effective enforcement 
mechanism, we have also listened to business representatives 
who have asked that we not bury them under a mass of new 
regulations and paper burden. We have developed a series of  
amendments which combine practicality with justice. As a 
result, we are all winners.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	At the same time, many of the amendments contained in the 
bill represent little more than housekeeping. They will simply 
extend to the public sector those requirements which have 
already been placed on the private sector. This is only fair.
<P>
	Finally, the act will broaden the mandate of the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission to allow it to conduct audits of 
public and private sector employers in order to verify and gain 
compliance with the act. Even here we are ensuring a balance 
with the establishment of the employment equity review 
tribunal.
<P>
	Canadians are justly proud of the core values which are at the 
heart of our country. Central to our value system is a concern for 
ensuring equal opportunity and justice for all Canadians. The 
existing Employment Equity Act passed in 1986 has led to real 
progress in ensuring greater equality of employment. Still, 
much remains to be done. The act before us represents an 
important step forward in assuring that all Canadians can enjoy 
equal opportunity in employment and promotion. At the same 
time it seeks to provide a vital balance between idealism and 
economic reality.
<P>
	The government's employment equity policies are not about 
intrusiveness, discrimination or adding to the cost burden to 
Canadian business as the hon. member's motion suggests. 
Rather they are about fairness, about the government's 
commitment to ensuring that every Canadian, regardless of 
gender, race or physical attributes has a chance to fulfil his or 
her potential, to get a rewarding job and to contribute to the 
social and economic well-being of Canada.
<P>
	Employment equity is not an impediment to progress. It is a 
catalyst for progress in the workplace and a boost to the 
competitiveness of Canadian companies in an increasingly 
demanding global economy. Most of all, it is about putting into 
practice the values that make us Canadian: fairness, justice and 
equality for all. It is for this reason that I cannot support the 
motion, but I will be supporting the legislation before the House 
and would encourage all members to do likewise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a couple of questions for the member.
<P>
	Obviously there is no time to get into the whole bill but he 
mentioned that numerical targets were not quotas, that we were 
not to worry because this was not about quotas.
<P>
	Lyn McLeod said in the leader's debate with Bob Rae in 
Ontario on May 18 that numerical goals are quotas, pure and 
simple. I would like to know whether he agrees with the Liberal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13021"> 13021 </A></B>
<P>
leader of Ontario who says that numerical targets are merely a 
euphemism for quotas.
<P>
	The RCMP do not call them quotas but this year the RCMP is 
hiring 426 people. One hundred and twenty-five will be from 
visible minorities, 125 will be females, 95 will be aboriginal and 
the rest can be from society in general. Does the hon. member 
think those are quotas or does he think they are something other 
than quotas? They sound like quotas to me.
<P>
	I have just the two questions. Does he agree with Lyn McLeod 
and does he think the numbers I quoted from the RCMP sound 
like quotas?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am genuinely surprised by the inability of the member's party to 
address the question of the need for some collective redress to 
the lack of representation.
<P>
	I am an Atlantic Canadian. We have always believed a little 
bit that in the nation we are on the outside. I have some 
sympathy for those people who feel that the power structures at 
play do not always work in their favour.
<P>
	Everything I have read and have heard expressed by the 
member's party in terms of where they were born speaks to 
expressions like western alienation and so on. It seems to me 
there should be some affinity between the member and his party 
and those people for whom the system just does not work as well 
as it does for others. I think it is political posturing on the part of 
the member to draw in someone else's comments in some other 
debate.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Ultimately this is about a fundamental principle. We have to 
understand that the system does not work equally for everybody. 
I have heard it said by many people in the member's party that is 
the case and that therefore certain actions have to be taken. I find 
it unfortunate that a member representing a party that speaks of 
this often would deny the same access to people for whom the 
system obviously does not work as well as it does for someone 
like me, a seventh generation, white, male Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member has still left the question unanswered as to whether we 
have quotas or whether we are simply looking at loosely defined 
numerical goals.
<P>
	I would like to enlarge on this just a little. I honestly believe 
that in areas where we have not had these kinds of programs, 
employment equity, quota systems, whatever you call it, that at 
least in the area where I come from in Alberta, the number of 
people employed in large organizations is roughly proportional 
to the number of people who are there from the different groups. 
It is just a rough observation which I think is true.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> Through the eyes of the observer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> No, I am sorry, I believe it is true.
<P>
	I would like the member to answer this question. Are quotas 
the same as numerical goals? If not, how are they different?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am quite familiar with the issue of quotas, targets and so on. In a 
previous life I was involved in the official languages policy in 
the province of New Brunswick. A lot of the attempts made here 
to try and characterize efforts to collectively address the 
systemic weakness are always characterized this way. There are 
always attempts to fix positions so they can then be thrown back 
in the face of the government.
<P>
	The answer is no. There is an objective, you try to meet but it 
is not a quota.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Prince George-Peace River. I understand you will be splitting 
your time. Could you indicate that to the chair?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will not use the 20 minutes.
<P>
	I welcome this opportunity to rise in debate and support the 
motion put forward by my hon. colleague from Fraser Valley 
East.
<P>
	I am becoming more and more concerned about the direction 
in which the government is taking Canada. The Liberal 
government seems to think that it can legislate Canadian values 
and social change. History proves that imposed solutions do not 
gain broad acceptance. They are viewed with suspicion.
<P>
	From the mail I receive, the mindset that dominates Ottawa's 
policy shifts does not appear to reflect the values or convictions 
of most Canadians living outside a few metropolitan centres. In 
fact, I am not even sure it reflects the views of most people 
living in Toronto or Ottawa.
<P>
	This government is promoting the idea that society is 
responsible for what people do with their lives. Somehow 
personal achievement no longer has anything to do with 
individual merit, initiative or effort but has more to do with 
whether one falls into this government's definition of a group it 
has singled out for special treatment. This is a misguided 
attempt to right past wrongs. When I was young I was taught that 
two wrongs do not make a right. Evidently Liberals have not 
learned that lesson.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Reform believes in equality of opportunity. Given the same 
educational and employment opportunities, whether an 
individual succeeds should be largely up to them. Each person 
must 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13022"> 13022 </A></B>
<P>
accept responsibility for what they choose to do with their life, 
be it pursuing a life of crime or having a lower standard of living 
while they put themselves through university. When they get out 
of school they have a right to expect equal treatment when they 
look for work. Preferential treatment on the basis of  your skin 
colour is just as racist as discrimination. Employment equity is 
by definition discrimination and therefore against the law.
<P>
	Social change cannot be legislated. Previous Liberal attempts 
at social engineering have been disastrous and have created 
greater divisiveness in Canadian society. Past Liberal 
legislation gave us multiculturalism which promotes our 
differences instead of our similarities. It makes us hyphenated 
Canadians and asks us to define ourselves in terms of skin 
colour, country of our ancestors or, if all other categorizations 
fail, language. We are not allowed to be just Canadian. The 
government does not believe such a person exists.
<P>
	Now that multiculturalism has made us focus on our 
differences the government wants to institutionalize inequality 
and preferential treatment. It wants to further divide the 
workforce with a quota system that will replicate an artificial 
division of the Canadian people based on arbitrary 
characteristics unrelated to their ability to do the job. Equity is 
not equality.
<P>
	The hon. member for Western Arctic said earlier today special 
treatment is not a departure from equality. How can special 
treatment of entire designated groups lead to equality? Special 
treatment by its very nature is not equality.
<P>
	The same member said same treatment does not create 
equality. I agree with that but not for the same reasons she said. 
Canadians should be guaranteed equal opportunities. These 
include education, equal employment opportunities and the 
right not to be discriminated against for reasons unrelated to 
their qualifications.
<P>
	As the member must agree, given her own achievements, even 
when we all receive the same treatment we do not all follow the 
same paths in life. We do not end up running a corner bakery or a 
multinational corporation, at least not all of us. We are different 
and we do not all share the same goals. Siblings end up in 
entirely different lines of work and levels of employment 
despite the same treatment. Equal opportunity does not always 
lead to equal results.
<P>
	Every time the government decides there is a problem it tries 
to solve it with more government regulations and inappropriate 
misguided legislation. We see the same philosophy of over 
regulation in the Liberal approach to crime control. Instead of 
specifically targeting gun smugglers and criminals who misuse 
firearms the government will force all gun owners to register. 
This shotgun approach to problems does not work. It creates 
more jobs for bean counters while the government desperately 
hopes a criminal will register a gun or in the case of employment 
equity a prejudiced employer will incriminate themselves when 
filling out paper work.
<P>
	I completely support the elimination of discrimination but we 
cannot legislate attitudes and we cannot create equality through 
legislation. Go after the law breakers. Do not make more rules 
and red tape that do not directly address the problem. Social 
engineering does not work.
<P>
	Canadians want equality, not more groups with special rights 
and privileges. Canadians want to end discrimination, not 
extend it on a scale only the Liberal government could conceive. 
Canadians want to succeed based on their personal merit and 
achievements, not on the colour of their skin or some other 
arbitrary classification the government has decided on.
<P>
	A policy of employment equity will lead to inequality. It will 
increase intolerance in our society and it will lead to greater 
misunderstandings between people. The elimination of 
intolerance and discrimination in society is a desirable 
objection.
<P>
	I question the way the government is going about it. I see the 
end result as more intolerance. With employment equity how 
will anyone in a designated group ever be certain they got where 
they did because of their own efforts and hard work? Even if 
they know they earned every promotion and every raise, how do 
they convince jealous naysayers? When someone is bypassed 
for a promotion will they believe it is because the other person 
deserved it or will they blame employment equity? Will 
employers be forced to defend every decision they make?
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	With employment equity every promotion will be viewed with 
suspicion, whether it is because the person was in a designated 
group and other employees challenged their qualifications or 
because the person was not in a designated group and the 
government wants to know why the company did not promote a 
designated person instead.
<P>
	Private industry should have the right to hire whomever it 
wants. However, I fully support prosecution where there is 
evidence of systemic discrimination. No one should face 
discrimination in the workforce. People should be hired and 
promoted on the basis of personal merit. While it is true we have 
not completely stamped out prejudice, there are other ways of 
dealing with unfair hiring practices besides enforcing a quota 
system. We should enforce laws which specifically target people 
who engage in discriminatory hiring practices or employment 
conditions.
<P>
	By promoting employment equity the Liberal government has 
admitted it has no faith these designated groups can make it on 
merit alone and so it will coerce companies using quotas and 
monetary penalties. Will such measures lead to even more 
intolerance as a few disgruntled workers wrongly seize on 
employment equity as the reason they were bypassed for a raise 
they thought they deserved?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13023"> 13023 </A></B>
<P>
	Once again the government is promoting disunity by 
highlighting differences instead of similarities. By forcing 
employees to self-identify as a member of a designated group 
the government perpetuates differences and, more important, 
the perception of differences. An employment equity program 
forces people to focus on the very things the government says it 
is trying to eliminate. We want our society to disregard 
characteristics not relevant to someone's ability to do their job, 
but the government wants employers to emphasize those 
characteristics as somehow related to whether someone should 
get a promotion.
<P>
	Companies will begin to look at employees as a number on the 
way to fulfilling a particular quota, not as individual human 
beings with dreams, families and abilities which transcend the 
designation the Liberal government has imposed on them. As 
the hon. member for Halifax stated earlier today in the House, 
we cannot legislate attitudes. That is our point.
<P>
	Canadians would support the elimination of discrimination 
and prejudice in the workplace but they cannot support a costly 
social engineering project which will institutionalize 
discrimination and promote employment opportunities based on 
physical attributes. Employment equity is not workable. It can 
lead only to more intolerance and misunderstanding.
<P>
	It is reassuring to see the government's commitment to 
creating a fair job market. All Canadians want a level playing 
field on which excellence is promoted. However, a look at the 
government's current legislation shows a fundamental 
weakness. It stops one step short of the top. One would expect 
the government would seek to lead by example, so it is 
somewhat baffling that Bill C-64 applies to every government 
department except the office of the Prime Minister.
<P>
	If the House really sees affirmative action as a way to promote 
excellence, one would think it would rush to embrace its 
application in the Prime Minister's office. The Prime Minister's 
office plays a large role not only in shaping the agenda of 
government and of Parliament but in shaping public opinion. If 
the government really believes affirmative action programs 
attract personnel of the highest calibre, it naturally follows the 
principles of Bill C-64 should apply to the Prime Minister's 
office.
<P>
	Clause 4(1)(b) of the bill seeks to apply affirmative action to 
the portions of the Public Service of Canada set out in part I of 
schedule 1 to the Public Service Relations Act. Schedule 1 is a 
fairly inclusive list of government departments and agencies 
and includes the office of the governor general's secretary, 
which provides policy and program assistance in the office of 
His Excellency, the Governor General of Canada. It includes the 
privy council office, which provides policy advice and analysis 
to the office of the Prime Minister and to cabinet.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	When I note Bill C-64 applies to the office of the governor 
general's secretary and to the privy council office, I am sure it 
must be simply an oversight that the Prime Minister's office is 
not covered.
<P>
	Members will surely understand that if we intend to ensure the 
promotion of true equity in the workplace we must start at the 
top. If it is our goal to show Canadians that government now 
holds high the torch of equality, what better way than to apply 
Bill C-64 to the Prime Minister's office? Applying Bill C-64 to 
the Prime Minister's office would show all Canadians 
leadership truly starts at the top.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's office could serve as an example to 
other departments in showing how an enlightened affirmative 
action program could contribute to an enhanced work 
environment, foster harmonious workplace relations and 
harness the benefits proponent of the increased employment 
diversity promise.
<P>
	The application of Bill C-64 to the PMO would further 
produce a number of side benefits. It would give the Prime 
Minister a true hands on experience both in devising and 
implementing a productive affirmative action strategy in a 
medium sized $5.5-odd million office. The Prime Minister's 
office would get a true first hand view of the increased 
administrative burden, if any, caused by this act. That 
experience would undoubtedly prove useful if further 
amendments to this bill were ever needed. Further participation 
by the Prime Minister's office would give the Prime Minister 
enhanced credibility when selling Bill C-64 to Canadian 
employers.
<P>
	The Prime Minister would get valuable insight into the 
practical benefits and, more important, the challenges of Bill 
C-64. It is so easy for Parliamentarians to pass a law that applies 
to everyone but ourselves. The business maxim of walk the talk 
speaks to the need for managers to roll up their sleeves and do 
some of the dirty work.
<P>
	On one hand there is a real sense of leadership when one's 
boss shows he or she is willing to do the same job as the labourer 
or technician. More important, many company presidents and 
CEOs have found that actually spending a day in the shoes of the 
worker has exposed them to challenges and benefits of the line, 
so to speak, in very tangible ways. Therefore by way of analogy 
this proposal makes sound business sense.
<P>
	Participation by the Prime Minister's office would show all 
Canadians who have experienced discrimination in employment 
that they have a friend at the top. Due to the bill's application to 
the Prime Minister's office all Canadians would see their 
government really believes in the right of the disadvantaged to 
participate in the workforce.
<P>
	Earlier I mentioned how the Prime Minister's office plays a 
large role not only in shaping the agenda of government and of 
Parliament but in shaping Canadian public opinion. Given this, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13024"> 13024 </A></B>
<P>
the Liberals should amend the bill and give the disadvantaged an 
increased voice at the  top which could play a vital role in 
reducing many of the so-called systemic barriers many 
Canadians face in the job market.
<P>
	If they will not include the PMO what example are they 
showing? If the Prime Minister's office is to be spared, why not 
all private firms with budgets smaller than $5 million? How can 
we as politicians mandate change on Canadians which we would 
shirk from imposing on ourselves? How can we deal with this do 
as I say, not as I do attitude?
<P>
	Without the practical experience of Bill C-64 working in the 
PMO how can we tell Canadian employers we are all working 
together? How can we reverse discrimination in the hearts of 
Canadians when the Prime Minister's office holds out a ``not 
welcome here'' sign?
<P>
	Reformers believe this ``not in my backyard'' philosophy is a 
national curse. The House must show Canadians Bill C-64 has 
been well thought out, is well intended and will be well managed 
at every stage. Application of the bill to the Prime Minister's 
office might ensure that, or it might prove the opposite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
really enjoyed the speech by the member for Prince 
George-Peace River.
<P>
	It will be interesting to see if anybody grabs the bait. It was 
mentioned somewhat in committee, just tossed out as an idea. 
We will see if anybody picks up on the suggestion for the Prime 
Minister's office sometime between now and when the bill gets 
muscled through Parliament .Gratefully, I will not have to hold 
my breath on that one, I do not think.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I do have a couple of questions for the member. Earlier today 
we heard from the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and 
Status of Women that she was offended that I would talk about 
hyphenated Canadians. The people opposite know that if any 
party is against the term hyphenated Canadians it is the Reform 
Party. We say all Canadians should be treated equally. We do not 
care whether you are a recent immigrant, third generation or an 
aboriginal person. We think all people should be treated equally. 
Definitely the idea of hyphenated Canadians is repugnant to us.
<P>
	I would like to get the member's opinion and check on what 
the member is hearing back home in northern British Columbia. 
The last census of Canadians that StatsCan brought forward 
found there were over 700,000 Canadians who refused to 
identify themselves as anything other than Canadian. They 
would say: ``I am not a hyphenated Canadian of any kind. I am 
just a Canadian''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Good for them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> I was probably one of them on that census. I am 
sure that 700,000 and some refused to say: ``I am an English 
Canadian, a French Canadian or a native Canadian''. They just 
said: ``I am Canadian. That is all that I am''.
<P>
	StatsCan is now going to change its forms to make sure this 
does not happen again. It is going to make sure Canadians put 
down an ethnic background so that we can get more statistical 
information on which to base things like employment equity.
<P>
	In the member's riding in northern British Columbia do 
people there like to be known as Peace River Canadians, Prince 
George Canadians, or do they generally just approach it as 
straight, old Canadians? I would like the member's opinion on 
whether he thinks this trend is an up and coming thing in Peace 
River or whether it is kind of passé.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
constantly hear this question in my riding. I know it is a real 
source of irritation with Canadians in the riding of Prince 
George-Peace River. I suspect if we were to do a survey across 
the country we would find that people right across the nation 
find it offensive that they are required to document their lineage 
or history when they want to be classed as Canadians. They find 
it very demeaning.
<P>
	That is why so many people will just put down Canadian, 
regardless of what type of form StatsCan may come up with. 
People are telling me they want to be classed as a Canadian. 
They are proud of their heritage and proud to be Canadian. This 
can be seen most predominantly with the new immigrants who 
came here recently and went through the process of getting their 
citizenship papers and becoming a citizen of Canada. Those 
people in particular do not want to be associated with the past. 
They want to be classed as Canadians. That is how they want to 
be thought of and treated. It is how they feel they should be 
treated when they apply for a job in the Canadian workforce.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to debate employment equity today. I 
must admit I am somewhat confused that the subject has come 
before the House again today. It was only on April 6 that we 
debated a similar Reform Party motion.
<P>
	Moreover, for well over a month, as the member proposing the 
motion well knows, the Standing Committee on Human Rights 
and the Status of Disabled Persons has been hearing testimony 
on the existing Employment Equity Act and on Bill C-64, a new 
act respecting employment equity. That draft legislation is 
about to return to the House for further consideration. Yet today 
the Reform Party has seen fit to raise employment equity again 
in the most contentious terms.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13025"> 13025 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party makes a serious error in its judgment, I 
believe, of the capacity of the Canadian people to appreciate a 
program that for eight years now has served to strengthen our 
social fabric. With Bill C-64 it will continue to do so but in a 
more fair and even-handed manner.
<P>
	Let me first deal with several misrepresentations of the 
employment equity legislation that I have heard beginning the 
first thing this morning.
<P>
	First, the member who introduced the motion today spoke 
about the false assumption on which employment equity is 
based, the assumption that somehow employers are systemically 
discriminatory and are bad. That is not at all the assumption on 
which the bill is based. I will be giving more concrete examples 
later, but the bill is based on the facts that certain people in our 
society have not had an equal opportunity in employment. They 
have tended to be employed and to remain in the lowest paying, 
least skilled jobs notwithstanding their abilities. They have not 
progressed as others in society have done.
<P>
	Employment equity is about giving people an equal 
opportunity by not assuming motive but by simply asking 
employers to look at why that pattern exists in their workforce. 
If it does exist it asks what they can do to be more fair in making 
sure that everybody has an equal opportunity.
<P>
	Second, the member recommended that individual cases 
could be settled through the courts and the human rights 
tribunal. That is like saying there is an outbreak of a certain 
epidemic in health care but we are going to solve that by sending 
each one of those people to hospitals to be cured on an individual 
basis and that we do not have to deal with the overall situation 
that is causing the individual's illness. That is an expensive, 
time consuming approach which does not solve the underlying 
problem but simply perpetuates it.
<P>
	Third, there has been some discussion about group rights 
versus individual rights. When the facts indicate clearly to us 
that people are discriminated against, whether intentionally or 
not, and usually it is not intentionally, as a group, the only way 
an individual can have equal opportunity is if we address the fact 
that the group the individual belongs to is discriminated against.
<P>
	The bill and the whole issue of employment equity is not 
about group rights. It is about individual rights. It is about 
recognizing that in our society certain groups, who happen to 
represent the majority by the way, have not had an equal 
opportunity. Until we solve the problem of disadvantages for the 
group, no individuals in that group, except by rare exception, are 
going to have an equal opportunity to fulfil their potential.
<P>
	This is not about arbitrary division as that argument would 
have us believe. Employment equity is in fact about treating 
everybody not the same because everybody is not the same, but 
treating everybody equally. It is about getting rid of those 
divisions that say a certain kind  of person is more suited to 
management or to certain positions in our society. It is about 
allowing people to flourish based on their own abilities and not 
the colour of their skin, the shape of their body or their origins.
<P>
	Employment equity has been described as coercive in nature, 
as a setting of imposed quotas. I do not know if it is deliberate 
misrepresentation, total misunderstanding or total deafness 
because it has been explained often enough. Employment equity 
in Canada as it exists and as it is intended to apply now to the 
public service under the new legislation does not set quotas. It 
specifically prohibits quotas.
<P>
	What it does do is it says to employers that there have been 
employment practices which have gone on for a long time. 
Unfortunately they have had discriminatory results, even 
though they were not intended to. We are asking employers to 
look at their employment practices. We are asking them to get 
rid of those things in their employment practices that are having 
discriminatory effects and that are tending to favour one kind of 
Canadian over others in terms of hiring, promotion, training 
opportunity, advancement and higher salaries.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	The facts are indisputable that this is the situation for 
Canadian employment and for Canadian employers. I want to 
emphasize that all we are asking employers to do under 
employment equity is to look at their own situation, to do a 
self-examination and to say that they would like to do better, to 
show where they would like to do better and how they are going 
to do it.
<P>
	Quotas are the American model which we have specifically 
turned our backs on as Canadians. Quotas are enforced from the 
outside and imposed from the outside. That is not what 
employment equity in this country is about.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is in the RCMP.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> It has been said by the other side that people 
will feel stigmatized. Let me respond to that. Somebody just 
referred to hiring in the RCMP. An earlier speaker laid out all 
kinds of figures and asked for a response.
<P>
	The fact is that in the year the member quoted, and the 
member knows that very well because the information was given 
to him by the human rights commissioner, 65 per cent of hirings 
in the RCMP were white, able bodied males even though they 
are not even half of the Canadian population. Of course the 
member chose not to use that figure. Two-thirds of hirings 
continue to be white, able bodied males which members on the 
other side have tended to suggest in today's debate are going to 
be disadvantaged by employment equity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13026"> 13026 </A></B>
<P>
	Another point which has been made by the opposite side is 
that people will feel stigmatized. People feel stigmatized right 
now. People feel stigmatized when they come into a job in the 
public service with the best qualifications and after 25 years 
have not progressed.
<P>
	People feel stigmatized when they are in clerical positions, 80 
per cent of which are occupied by women. They see that women 
do not even rise to the upper levels of the clerical category. They 
are bypassed by others who are no more qualified but just 
happen not to be female.
<P>
	People feel stigmatized by the current situation which does 
not allow them to be hired, promoted or given advancement 
opportunities on the basis of their merit. They see themselves 
categorized and kept at a lower level because they do not fit the 
traditional model of who will succeed in our society.
<P>
	Finally, I come to the matter of merit. Employment equity is 
not the denial of the merit principle but the fulfilment of the 
merit principle. The legislation the committee has been dealing 
with is very clear about this. People should be hired solely on the 
basis of merit. Employment should be colour blind, gender blind 
and size blind. It should only look at what a person is capable of 
doing.
<P>
	The facts are clear that has not been the pattern in Canadian 
employment. Let me give some facts. Members of the 
designated groups continue to be at a distinct disadvantage in 
the workplace. Far from being a threat to those who complain of 
reverse discrimination, women, aboriginal peoples, visible 
minority members and persons with disabilities still lag far 
behind in initial hiring, promotion opportunity and pay rates.
<P>
	In March, Statistics Canada reported that the primary reason 
women earn far less money than men, just 78 per cent of what 
their male colleagues earn, is blatant discrimination. Even 
factoring in work experience, education and demographics, 
there is no explanation for the wage gap other than gender bias.
<P>
	What other than prejudice can explain the fact that persons 
with disabilities experience an unemployment rate twice the 
national average? Is it less qualification or less education? No, it 
is not. The unemployment rate of persons with disabilities with 
university degrees is more than twice that of white males with 
the same qualifications.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	These are facts I know the other side does not want to hear but 
it will hear them. Even among those who are working the 
perception seems to be that people with disabilities are capable 
only of clerical, sales and service jobs. Eighteen per cent of 
university educated, physically challenged workers are in those 
occupations compared with just 11 per cent of white, able 
bodied males with university degrees.
<P>
	Statistics show there are many qualified members of 
designated groups. Visible minorities are better educated than 
Canadians in general, not less educated. Eighteen per cent have 
at least a university degree compared with 11 per cent of the 
Canadian population.
<P>
	While visible minorities represent 8.8 per cent of the 
population over 15 years of age, in 1990 they accounted for 
almost 11 per cent of the university graduates. They earned 13 
per cent of the masters degrees, 20 per cent of the doctorate 
degrees and yet too few of these highly educated, highly skilled 
potential workers are offered jobs. Their hiring rates have 
actually decreased steadily since 1990 from 10.4 per cent to just 
8.4 per cent. Last year in the public service alone 11 per cent of 
applicants were a visible minority but represented only 2.7 per 
cent of hirings.
<P>
	Aboriginal people, surely among the most disadvantaged of 
any group, are also too often shut out of the job market. Despite 
the fact that more aboriginal people than ever before are 
university educated their unemployment rate stands at 7 per 
cent, almost double the rate for white males with university 
degrees.
<P>
	These are the tip of the iceberg of the statistics that could be 
quoted today. It is interesting that the vast majority of those who 
testified before the standing committee, including employers 
who have been under the Employment Equity Act for eight years 
now, describe employment equity as a sensible and balanced 
measure. Even the few who oppose the draft legislation did not 
resort to the sort of inflammatory and misrepresentational 
language found in this resolution and in the debate.
<P>
	Canadians do have an excellent understanding of what 
equality is all about. They appreciate that for there to be a 
harmonious and well balanced society all its members must 
have an opportunity to contribute as well as share in the benefits. 
That is what employment equity is all about.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The justification behind employment equity is that it permits 
people to be given equal consideration when employment 
possibilities arise. Its aim is not to give privilege or advantage to 
anyone in the selection of candidates for employment. To say 
otherwise indicates a complete misunderstanding of the 
principles concerned and the way it works.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The fundamental aim of employment equity is to ensure no 
one is denied access to a fair chance at employment and 
promotion opportunities for reasons unrelated to abilities. To 
claim otherwise represents either a serious misunderstanding or 
a deliberate misrepresentation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13027"> 13027 </A></B>
<P>
	Employment equity exists to identify current disadvantages 
in the employment system for the benefit of all Canadians and to 
provide fair and equal employment opportunities. To pretend 
fairness and equality are fully operational in employment in 
Canada today is simply to ignore the facts.
<P>
	Employment equity seeks to achieve the diversity in the 
workplace found in society. That involves the removal of 
barriers to employment opportunities. These barriers are most 
often not deliberate and are frequently buried in systems and 
long standing practices. Employment equity seeks to eliminate 
what is called the adverse effect which flows from conditions of 
requirements for employment that are not necessary and not 
intended to discriminate but do have a discriminatory effect.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	The other aspect of employment equity is to put in place 
measures which encourage equitable access to opportunities for 
employment and advancement. This may mean training 
positions so those who are disadvantaged can compete on an 
equal footing. It is important for sound management that full use 
be made of all human resources available.
<P>
	Unfortunately what we have been doing by having a less than 
equitable workplace both in the private sector and in the public 
sector is denying the Canadian economy and the public service 
the opportunity for the very best to be hired, to be trained, to be 
developed, to serve in the highest positions they can and to 
provide the very best to the private sector and the public sector 
so that both can excel.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must remember that the make-up of Canada's labour force 
is in a state of constant flux. Major demographic changes are 
helping to create an increasingly heterogenous labour force. 
Women, native people, people with a disability and members of 
visible minorities now represent the vast majority of new 
arrivals on the labour market.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If we are not making full use of the full diversity of our 
growing workforce, we are handicapping ourselves as a nation. 
It has been convincingly demonstrated that diversity in the 
workplace makes good business sense. Witnesses who appeared 
before the human rights committee reasserted this; witnesses 
who found employment equity to be an advantage to them in 
improving their human resources practices. Experts have long 
considered workforce diversity as a competitive advantage in 
today's global economy. It leads to increased productivity. It is 
to the benefit of companies and governments to remove the 
barriers to the full development of diversity in the workforce.
<P>
	As I said earlier, it is important to remember that although we 
tend to speak of diversity in terms of groups the focus is on the 
individual. It is not the group which is recruited as a filing clerk, 
it is the individual. However it is not necessarily the individual 
who is denied promotion opportunities. The individual may be 
constrained because they happen to belong to a particular group. 
Surely we all want to change that in society and in our places of 
employment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's motion presupposes that 
employment equity follows selection on the basis of criteria 
other than merit. Allow me to state that this is not the case.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is about a truly merit based system. For 75 years we have 
prided ourselves in this country and in our public service on 
having a merit based system designed to ensure people are hired 
based on their ability to do the job. Had we had a truly merit 
based system we would not have to worry about employment 
equity.
<P>
	I will be happy when we no longer need an employment equity 
law. I will be happy when I can say that anybody has a fair and 
equal opportunity to compete based only on their ability to do 
the job. Unfortunately that is not the kind of world we have and 
certainly not the kind of public service we have. That is why I 
believe it is important to expand the Employment Equity Act.
<P>
	Really that is what is being done. We are not introducing 
anything new. We are making some administrative changes to 
employment equity. The big thing we are doing is applying it to 
the public service. That is only fair and just.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I remind members if they 
want to seek the floor they should be in their own seats.
<P>
	It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the 
House that the question to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment is as follows: the hon. member for Davenport-the 
environment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am quite interested 
that the governing party is so persistently raising the question of 
the majority of testimonials its bill has received in committee. 
This sounds more like an admission. These witnesses are 
supposed to be more or less balanced. Members have been 
saying they padded their witness list, which we knew, but it is 
very interesting to hear it brought out in the House and 
emphasized in that way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13028"> 13028 </A></B>
<P>
	This pedigreed Heinz 57 Canadian looks somewhat askance at 
Bill C-64. It has its origin in the noblesse oblige of middle class, 
predominantly lily white Canadians who know what is best for 
everybody.
<P>
	It certainly does not fit the viewpoint of some notable 
Canadians like Neil Bissoondath or Dr. Rais Khan or some not 
so new Canadians like Sammy Chung. It seems to fit the 
viewpoint of the Liberal government and too many people from 
any other part of society. It is condescending, patronizing and 
infers people in designated groups have less merit than 
non-designated persons and therefore cannot make it on their 
own. That is reprehensible.
<P>
	I have two questions for the hon. member. Did she in private 
life and does she here now in her own office consciously practise 
employment equity? Does she accept what appears to be the 
standard Liberal philosophy that the best government is that 
which interferes most in the lives of ordinary Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, when I was asked that question 
on the last Statistics Canada census under ethnic origin I put 
mongrel.
<P>
	I do practise employment equity in my office. It is pretty hard 
when it is only three and a half people. The young man in my 
office said: ``I am glad we do not have employment equity 
around here or I would not have a job''. I said: ``I should explain 
to you that I was looking around for a young man because I felt I 
have had a predominance of women in my office for some time 
and so you are the result of affirmative action''.
<P>
	The member fails to understand that I believe in the 
fundamental Liberal principle of the dignity and right of each 
human being to be considered on their merits and to be respected 
for themselves. I do not see that happening necessarily in 
employment. I see very capable people for reasons that have 
nothing to do with their qualifications or abilities not having the 
opportunity.
<P>
	When I was on city council I asked our bus company why bus 
drivers had to be six feet tall. It said it was so they could reach 
the pedal. I said that meant most women could not qualify, most 
orientals could not qualify and no short person could qualify. 
That was pretty discriminatory. I asked what height had to do 
with it when what it wanted was someone who could reach the 
pedal; why not find out if a person could reach the pedal instead 
of measuring how tall they are. We changed that because it made 
sense to change it. Until then we had made sure a lot of very 
good bus drivers never had a chance to get hired.
<P>
	The same kind of false criteria for policing have made sure a 
lot of very capable Canadians never had the opportunity to be 
police officers. It is about getting rid of those kinds of attitudes 
which have not allowed people to be considered on their merits.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.15 p.m., it is my 
duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every 
question necessary to dispose of the business of supply, pursuant 
to Standing Order 81.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those in favour of the 
motion will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANHUMANRIGHTSACT">CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ)</B> moved that Bill 
C-248, an act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act, the 
Canada Labour Code and the Public Service Employment Act 
(whistleblowing), be now read the second time and referred to a 
legislative committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the purpose of Bill C-248 is to protect 
against retaliation employees acting in good faith and in the 
public interest who report reprehensible practices by their 
employers, particularly when public health and safety are at 
issue.
<P>
	This bill applies solely to public sector employees under 
federal jurisdiction. It is based on two fundamental principles.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	The first principle is to encourage federal public servants to 
report institutional or individual actions or practices that would 
cause a specific and substantial danger or prejudice to public 
health, safety or welfare, or entail considerable or unjustified 
public spending.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The second principle without which the first one cannot be 
serviced is the protection of employees against employers' 
reprisal measures in retaliation for disclosures done in 
accordance with the bill's provisions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Implementing the two principles underlying this bill requires 
a dual mechanism. The legislation must provide, first, for the 
filing of complaints and then, of course, for the protection of 
employees. To that end, Bill C-248 proposes an amendment to 
the Canadian Human Rights Act that would give the commission 
responsible for enforcing this act the power to receive and 
examine complaints of illicit practices and to rule on their 
admissibility.
<P>
	In addition, Bill C-248 would empower the commission to 
cancel any retaliatory action by an employer against a 
whistleblower acting in good faith.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-248 answers the expectations of Canadian citizens and 
of many Canadian organizations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The people want the federal government to reduce waste and 
end all illicit practices. To them, it is a matter of government 
openness and federal institutional ethics.
<P>
	Allow me to quote from the 1995 auditor general's report: 
``Canadians are concerned about integrity in government and 
they have the right to expect the highest ethical standards in 
their governments. Leadership by members of Parliament, 
ministers, and deputy ministers is critical to maintaining ethical 
standards and performance in government''.
<P>
	And the auditor general adds, and I quote: ``If Canadians do 
not trust their governments to act ethically, governments will 
find that their actions have less and less legitimacy and 
effectiveness. Thus, we believe that it is important to discuss the 
ethics in government and to take action to maintain and promote 
ethics in government''.
<P>
	You can see why Bill C-248 now before us is a good bill for 
the government, for its employees and particularly for the 
public. I would like to comment briefly on the various clauses of 
the bill.
<P>
	Let us first consider the first six clauses of the bill. The 
purpose of these provisions is to amend the Canadian Human 
Rights Act. Clause 1 would add a new provision to the Canadian 
Human Rights Act, by which it would become a discriminatory 
practice to discharge, suspend or impose a financial penalty on 
an employee, or to directly or indirectly differentiate adversely 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13034"> 13034 </A></B>
<P>
in relation to an employee in retaliation for a disclosure in 
connection with a complaint made in good faith by the employee 
pursuant to the provisions of our bill.
<P>
	The same clause also suggests that an employee shall be 
presumed not to act in good faith where, in making a disclosure, 
the employee violates any act of Parliament or rule of law 
protecting privileged communications, unless the employee can 
prove on a balance of probabilities that the violation was 
prompted by reasonable concerns for the public health or safety.
<P>
	In clause 2, we propose that section 40 of the Canadian 
Human Rights Act be amended to encourage employees who 
have reasonable grounds to do so to bring their concerns 
regarding employer misconduct to the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission. The commission would be required to maintain a 
confidential registry of all complaints.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Clause 3 proposes to amend section 53(2) of the Canadian 
Human Rights Act in order to empower the Commission to roll 
back retaliatory measures by an employer against a 
whistleblower when the human rights tribunal deems it 
appropriate.
<P>
	Clause 4 proposes to add to the Act a new section stating that 
no person shall discharge, suspend or impose a financial penalty 
on any employee in retaliation for a complaint or for a 
disclosure.
<P>
	Clause 5 proposes to amend section 60(1) of the Act to include 
a reference to the new section 59.1 so that a person who 
contravenes this new section would be guilty  of an offence for 
which he would be liable on summary conviction to the 
punishment set out in the Act.
<P>
	Clause 6 proposes to replace paragraph (3) of section 61 of the 
Act by new paragraphs (3) to (7). Where a tribunal established 
by the Commission finds that a complaint is substantiated or 
that there are reasonable grounds to believe it true, these 
paragraphs would compel the Commission to report the finding 
to the Speaker of the House so that he may refer it to the 
appropriate committee.
<P>
	Clause 7 proposes an amendment to the Canada Labour Code. 
This clause would amend the Canada Labour Code by adding 
two paragraphs after subsection (1) of section 240. These two 
paragraphs stipulate that retaliatory discharges for <I>bona fide</I> 
whistleblowing shall be considered unjust dismissals for the 
purposes of that Act.
<P>
	Finally, clause 8 proposes an amendment to the Public Service 
Employment Act. Under this clause, the oath or solemn 
affirmation taken by a public servant in respect of his employer 
would be qualified as follows: it shall not be deemed to be a 
breach of the oath or solemn affirmation for an employee to 
make a disclosure in good faith regarding the employer's 
misconduct.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Since the first reading of the bill in May 1994, which was a 
year ago, several organizations representing some 200,000 
federal civil servants have contacted my office to offer support 
as well as valuable comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Various organizations have commented that the bill should 
contain stronger measures. One of the areas they singled out was 
complaint registration. I will elaborate on these improvements 
later.
<P>
	In its recent publication, <I>Breaking the Silence</I>, the 
Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada stressed 
the urgency of bringing in an initiative like Bill C-248.
<P>
	In its report called ``In the Public's Interest'', which was a 
summary of what its membership said at its hearings, the Public 
Service Alliance of Canada, which alone represents over 
150,000 public servants, also recommended implementing a 
measure like the one contained in this bill.
<P>
	It is also worth noting that parliamentarians and political 
parties have also spoken in favour of legislation in the area 
mentioned above. For example, during the 34th Parliament, a 
New Democrat member introduced a bill, which made it to 
second reading, which was for all intents and purposes 
equivalent to Bill C-248. At that time, two Liberal members, 
one of them the ethics critic, the other, human rights critic, 
enthusiastically supported the principles in the bill. The bill was 
debated in February 1992.
<P>
	Might I add that in 1991, the official opposition's critic for 
government administration declared that it was  imperative to 
implement a policy to adequately protect public servants who 
bring wastage to the light of day. In the past, hon. members like 
the former Liberal who is now a senator, Jean-Robert Gauthier, 
the former New Democrat member for Skeena, Jim Fulton, and 
the former Conservative minister, Alan Redway, all proposed, in 
one form or another, legislative measures along the lines of Bill 
C-248.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	For its part, the Reform Party has always insisted on 
transparency in the federal government and the elimination of 
waste of public funds. In this regard, the Reform member for St. 
Albert said the following on May 11 in the House in a question to 
the President of Treasury Board:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Given the fact that a notable proportion of public servants would not report such 
unethical behaviour, will the government introduce legislation to protect 
whistleblowers?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13035"> 13035 </A></B>
<P>
	My colleague from the Reform Party was referring to chapter 
1 of the latest auditor general's report which indicates that 
public servants are somewhat fearful about reporting practices 
that contravene the government's ethics guidelines.
<P>
	The members of our political party, the Bloc Quebecois, at its 
first general council on June 18, 19 and 20, 1993, recommended 
to the parliamentary wing that it ensure legislation providing for 
protection of public servants who blow the whistle be tabled in 
the House as soon as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It therefore appears that all parties in the House have in recent 
years or weeks given their support to a measure like the one 
proposed by Bill C-248. Hence there is ample reason for the 
House to consider Bill C-248 as votable.
<P>
	However, to make the bill votable requires unanimous 
consent of the House. Without unanimous consent the bill, 
which is really expected by the Canadian public, will not go any 
further.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This means, therefore, that, without the unanimous consent of 
this House, unions, management, organizations, groups, in fact 
everyone will be prevented from expressing their opinions on 
the measures proposed in Bill C-248.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Acknowledging the unanimous support of all parties for a 
number of years relative to the necessity of the whistleblowing 
legislation, acknowledging also the obvious necessity of legal 
protection for good faith whistleblowers, and acknowledging 
the inescapable necessity for the bill to be votable if it is to be 
discussed in committee before coming back at third reading, I 
will ask members of the House to unanimously accept the bill as 
votable. I will make the request prior to the end of this period.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address this bill, which is a very laudable initiative. 
Indeed, even though the government may have some 
reservations about it, the proposed legislation includes many 
good points and we must take a very close look at it. I sincerely 
hope that we can pursue this debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of the stated purposes of the bill is to provide for 
appropriate sanctions against retaliation or retaliatory 
discharges by public sector employers of employees who ``blow 
the whistle'' or report a serious misconduct of their employers.
<P>
	Bill C-248 would, it is claimed, protect employees acting in 
good faith and would recognize there are times when it is in the 
public interest to encourage whistle blowing, especially if 
public health or safety were at issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is important to remember that the idea is to improve public 
health and safety.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me say at the outset that I am most interested in any 
proposal that would lead to improvements in the way 
government programs are delivered that would lead to greater 
efficiencies and effectiveness and that would lead to the 
elimination of waste, mismanagement or misconduct.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This idea is a basic principle which we must support.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	At the moment there are a number of legislative provisions 
with complementary policies and guidelines that have 
application in this area. I am interested in how they are working, 
how they can be improved and how the bill before us today could 
lead to improvements in these areas.
<P>
	It is with this in mind that I have reviewed and now comment 
upon the bill before the House today.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Here are my comments, along with some specifics.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of the clauses contained in the bill proposes amendments 
to section 23 of the Public Service Employment Act. This 
section requires every deputy head and employee, before 
becoming a member of the public service, to subscribe to the 
oath or affirmation of allegiance and the oath or affirmation of 
office and secrecy, the latter being set out in schedule III of the 
present act. Under Bill C-248, which restates the wording of 
section 23 as it now stands, two lengthy new clauses would be 
added qualifying the oath or affirmation of office and secrecy.
<P>
	One of these clauses refers directly to the administration of 
section 40(1.1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. No change 
would be contemplated with respect to the oath or affirmation of 
allegiance, though any misconduct that could constitute 
betraying it may well pose a serious problem as abuse of the oath 
or affirmation of office and secrecy.
<P>
	The oath or affirmation of allegiance is covered by the Oath of 
Allegiance Act. It prescribes a form by which every person in 
Canada who, either of his or her own accord or in compliance 
with any lawful requirement made of him or her or in obedience 
to the directions of any act or law in force in Canada, except the 
British North America Act and the Canadian Citizenship Act, 
desires to take an oath of allegiance shall have it administered.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13036"> 13036 </A></B>
<P>
	The prospective deputy head or employee of the public 
service must before assuming office affirm and swear to be 
faithful and bear true allegiance.
<P>
	Confidentiality is required of all federal public servants by 
virtue of the Official Secrets Act and by the oath or affirmation 
of office and secrecy taken by all public servants on entering the 
service. The prospective employee swears or affirms that he or 
she will faithfully and honestly fulfil the duties that evolve upon 
that person by reason of public service employment and not 
without due authority disclose or make known any matter that 
comes to the individual's knowledge by reason of such 
employment.
<P>
	Of course it must be recognized that major departures from 
existing practices in tried and true legislation could have 
important implications for the future well-being of the public 
service.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is something which must be carefully examined. If were 
to go ahead with the proposals contained in this bill, would we 
experience problems with some of them?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is necessary to determine the precise nature of the problems 
that are believed to exist or might exist, in view of those 
proposing Bill C-248, to ascertain precisely the dimensions and 
nature of the systems that would be required were abuses to 
occur and how they might best be handled. The means for 
resolving any problem that might arise in this area under present 
legislation and regulations should be examined carefully in 
order not to duplicate or complicate unduly existing measures 
that inhibit or permit various actions. These include those 
inherent in the judicial system, the current system of checks and 
balances in existing legislation, regulations, policies and 
guidelines, as well as in our open system of government and 
strong voice of the media.
<P>
	In examining this proposal for major legislative change, it 
must be recognized that there is already some legislation 
covering the abuse of authority and responsibility by public 
servants at all levels. Paragraph  121(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, 
for instance, makes it an offence for any official or employee of 
the public service to demand, accept, offer or agree to accept 
from a person dealing with the government any reward, 
advantage or benefit either directly or indirectly through anyone 
else for his or her own benefit without appropriate 
authorization.
<P>
	Members will know that it is the duty of public servants and 
there are disciplinary and legislative tools available to ensure 
that they comply to be honest, efficient, effective and loyal in 
carrying out their responsibilities and managing the resources of 
the public service.
<P>
	Employees are expected to inform their superiors of any 
seeming impropriety and to suggest ways of improving public 
services. Indeed, the incentive awards program recognizes 
exceptional contributions to the public service.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	There are sanctions as well in place now to prevent, avert or 
penalize proven dishonourable conduct, criminal actions, waste, 
extravagance, discrimination or abuse of trust. As you will 
appreciate, Mr. Speaker, there are already a number of sanctions 
and legislation in place covering the actions of concern to 
whistleblowers and to provide recourse for public servants 
against unfair treatment.
<P>
	Canada is already known for having one of the finest public 
services in the world. It is critical that employees and managers 
recognize the importance of identifying problems and of 
working together to resolve them.
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity today to comment on the 
proposals for legislative changes presented by the hon. member 
in Bill C-248.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I support this bill in principle, and I sincerely hope that we can 
continue to discuss it. As I just mentioned, some mechanisms 
are already in place. It is up to us to decide whether to go any 
further. I thank you for this opportunity to comment on the 
proposed bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to deal with this very important subject 
about whistleblowing legislation. I am pleased also to see that 
the President of the Treasury Board on May 13 mentioned that 
he is still open to the idea of whistleblowing legislation. He is 
not convinced yet that it is necessary. I am pleased to see that he 
is open to the idea. Certainly as my colleague mentioned earlier, 
the Reform Party feels that any time we can open up government 
and open up the process we would be in favour of that.
<P>
	Bill C-248, having to do with the rights of so-called 
whistleblowing, has been raised several times as private 
members' business in this House over the last decade or  so. 
Unfortunately, it has not been raised by the government of day, 
past or present, and that is a shame.
<P>
	There is a very old proverb I learned when I was a child. I 
know, Mr. Speaker, you will be interested in this one. I believe in 
it and I hope every member of the House subscribes to it as well. 
I try to follow it in my own life and it has done me nothing but 
good when I manage to follow it, even though it sometimes 
hurts. The simple old proverb goes like this: ``Honesty is the 
best policy''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13037"> 13037 </A></B>
<P>
	I have a question to ask members today. Is honesty really the 
best policy? If it is, and I believe that it is, we should develop 
institutions to protect honesty, to encourage honesty, to deter 
dishonesty and to even punish dishonesty when we find 
evidence of it.
<P>
	In general, the Criminal Code and other statutes of Parliament 
require it, but very few provide an incentive for government 
organizations to be honest and not only honest but safe and 
frugal with taxpayers' dollars as well. I therefore agree with the 
intent of Bill C-248. It provides a mechanism for employees to 
demonstrate these qualities. It would help the government and 
the private sector to be honest by placing before it the possibility 
that dishonesty could be exposed.
<P>
	Allow me to quote from an article in the <I>Journal of Canadian 
Public Administration</I>. It puts it well. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is solid evidence to show that, in the absence of an effective 
whistleblowing mechanism, employees have suffered emotional and physical 
turmoil in trying to deal with knowledge of fraud, conflicts of interest, 
rampant waste, pollution violations, and other illegal or unethical activities. 
Companies have a duty of care to provide such a mechanism to assist ethical 
employees.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Employees, who have real concerns and who make the 
wrongdoing public, suffer real problems in the workplace as a 
consequence. The Association of Mental Health in Maryland did 
a study on whistleblowers in the late 1980s found that 82 per 
cent of whistleblowers experienced harassment after exposing a 
wrongdoing, 60 per cent were fired from their jobs, 17 per cent 
eventually lost their homes and 10 per cent reported they had 
attempted suicide. So there are serious repercussions by not 
accepting the word of a whistleblower or by persecuting them 
afterwards.
<P>
	Even with these problems, whistleblowing means savings for 
the American government. In 1980 the U.S. government began a 
hotline for the American public service. The government 
received 94,000 telephone calls in the first 10 years of 
operation, 1,100 calls were substantiated and $20 million was 
saved. The cost of the hotline was minuscule in comparison to 
those savings.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	There are some dangers in this type of policy. It may be used 
irresponsibly by people who have their own axe to grind or 
people who are just plain disagreeable and want to cause trouble 
and headaches for honest employers by alleging things that 
simply are not true and then escape by hiding behind a law.
<P>
	The idea I want to get across today is of controlled 
whistleblowing or a mechanism by which whistleblowing 
legislation can be passed that protects all parties involved. We 
must have the right to expose illegalities, the gross abuse of 
funds or a significant risk to public health or safety within limits 
that would protect employers and, in the case of Parliament, 
ministers of the crown and public service managers.
<P>
	I want to suggest what might be part of an ideal act of 
Parliament. Then I want to compare that ideal with the bill 
before us. Ideal whistleblowing legislation should define the 
nature and limits of the activity that would be protected by such 
legislation specifying the gravity of wrongdoing to be exposed. I 
admit this would not be easy.
<P>
	For instance, an employee may want to expose a fellow 
employee for being a couple of minutes late one morning 
because he is angry at him for some unknown reason. The law 
would have to be designed in such a way that it would be kept 
from degenerating into a sort of informer's paradise. The 
legislation probably would specify some type of internal 
process which must be followed before it would be legal to go 
through the public whistleblowing activity. It is only fair that an 
employer be able to clean up his act before getting tarred in the 
press.
<P>
	Ideal legislation would specify public whistleblowing rather 
than leaked documents as well. Leaks are the curse of any 
minister's existence. If I was a minister I would not appreciate 
leaked documents either. However, whistleblowing legislation 
would not protect leaked documents unless it was one of those 
concerns that I mentioned earlier about gross misconduct or 
something. Public servants are expected to keep documents 
confidential at all times and that should continue under any 
legislation.
<P>
	I like the idea of an employee coming forward in a forthright 
manner through proper protected channels if it is necessary to 
expose things.
<P>
	Legislation should contain some kind of statute of limitation 
so that employees could not try to get revenge on certain people 
by exposing things that happened long after the employee has 
left the employer.
<P>
	I also think the act must create an incentive system for 
legitimate whistleblowers. This is another difficult area and I do 
not claim to have all the answers. It is difficult enough for 
whistleblowers to come forward even with the protection that 
the President of the Treasury Board says is in place already. We 
see it is very difficult to get them to come forward.
<P>
	The United States has the false claims act. Under it 
whistleblowers receive 25 per cent of the savings of any 
whistleblowing benefit they unearth. Over the first six years of 
the operation of the act, 407 lawsuits were filed and 37 were 
settled for a total of $147 million in savings. The average 
whistleblower received $400,000.
<P>
	I have considerable hesitation in supporting this type of high 
priced incentive to whistleblowers. However, if this is referred 
to committee, the committee should investigate whether there 
<P>

<B><A NAME="13038"> 13038 </A></B>
<P>
should be some sort of a monetary incentive or public 
recognition or some kind of paper recognition. Some sort of 
incentive should be investigated in committee to see if it has 
some validity on the Canadian scene.
<P>
	There also needs to be legal protection for legitimate 
whistleblowers, including confidential advice for public 
servants and an appeal process for those who are harassed or 
fired. For that we need an independent body which would act as 
sort of a place of sober second thought. I am not going to suggest 
the Senate but we need something that would give an employee 
confidential advice on whether his or her concern constituted a 
legitimate exposure and so on.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	This independent person or office, something like an 
ombudsman or an independent ethics counsellor-emphasis on 
the independent-would also act as a repository for the 
information that was revealed. Anyone could come and receive 
that information. It would be a very popular office indeed. I 
know many public servants have been in contact with me about 
the need for this legislation.
<P>
	If it was done in this way it could be exposed in a 
non-partisan, orderly way that would protect the employee 
concerned and also protect the government or other employer by 
suppressing frivolous or mischievous claims such as the one I 
mentioned earlier about someone overstaying a coffee break or 
something.
<P>
	Next we would need an appeal process where an employee 
who was being harassed or who was fired could go. We need 
something there. Investigations could be conducted and 
reparations made. However there would also have to be a 
companion law that would punish or somehow discipline an 
employee for publicly exposing things for which they have 
given an oath not to expose. For example, they would still have 
no right to expose confidential documents from the cabinet and 
so on. We have to make sure under this legislation that 
employees do not feel they have the right to expose what by 
necessity must be confidential.
<P>
	How does Bill C-248 measure up? I have mentioned several 
things that could be fleshed out in the bill. I find the bill is like a 
shell. It has the skeleton of some very good ideas. It is not 
specific enough in many areas. For example, there are no limits 
specified as to the time of reporting, the gravity of the offence to 
be reported or even the kinds of things an employee could 
report.
<P>
	We should investigate whether there should be an incentive 
system of some kind which is not mentioned in the bill. We 
should do something to encourage the natural inertia of the bill 
against whistleblowing and jump start it. Maybe some sort of 
incentive program would help to do that.
<P>
	I am not convinced the Canadian Human Rights Commission 
is the best body to solve this problem. Canadian human rights is 
becoming a grab bag. It seems to be solving everything or it is 
expanding its role. Under Bill C-64 it has been asked also to 
expand its area of expertise into the employment equity issue.
<P>
	I see a little problem with the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission becoming the catchall for all this. I wonder if 
rather than a human rights issue it could more properly be 
administered under the Department of Labour because this is 
typically an employee-employer type problem. We could 
change this to the Department of Labour because it would be 
best equipped to handle these types of employment related 
matters.
<P>
	Finally, as I mentioned earlier, the bill contains no deterrents 
against destructive or frivolous whistleblowers, people who just 
want to pass the time of day and harass employers. We will need 
something there.
<P>
	To conclude, the intent of Bill C-248 is noble. We agree with 
its general direction but it is like a shell that needs to be filled 
out. I appreciate the member's work in this area and I only feel 
disappointed the government did not present this legislation.
<P>
	This situation is much like the access to information 
experience. There have been many private members' bills over 
the years that sought to improve access to information. Given 
the benefit of hindsight and the great amount of good the Access 
to Information Act has done, the Liberal government would be 
well advised to take this bill as an umbrella piece of legislation 
and work with it. I realize it would be taking a bit of a risk.
<P>
	Once this type of legislation is worked over in committee and 
becomes law we will all wonder how we got by without it. It is a 
good idea. We on this side of the House look forward with 
anticipation when real whistleblowing legislation becomes a 
reality.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-248 is a good bill, because it meets a blatant need. It is an 
open secret that there is considerable waste and abuse in 
government. I am vice-chairman of the committee on public 
works. As the hon. member for St. Boniface who spoke for the 
government knows full well, we have seen many cases of waste 
and abuse in the public service, particularly when contracting 
out is concerned, with an estimated $5 billion to $10 billion a 
year in contracts awarded by the government to private 
enterprise.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	In that sector alone, hundreds of millions of dollars may be 
wasted through abuse and errors. The Public Service Alliance 
told us about some absolutely incredible cases of waste. For 
example, painters employed by the federal government were 
moved aside as contracts were awarded to private sector 
entrepreneurs, who were paid to do the work while public 
servants stood by watching  them. Some contracts and leases 
were a real waste of government money. The waste is legendary.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13039"> 13039 </A></B>
<P>
	If public servants had the right to denounce such cases of 
abuse, the government could save millions of dollars every 
year. The public is well aware of this, and one of its most 
common criticism is that the government is not careful enough 
about its spending, especially since Canada faces a huge deficit.
<P>
	It would be a good idea to draft such a bill in light of the 
potential savings. This bill would also help restore the 
credibility of the government and of politicians who, to a certain 
extent, are held responsible for public service waste and abuse.
<P>
	If public servants could denounce cases of abuse, this would 
not only save money but also probably bring to light events or 
actions endangering public health or safety.
<P>
	Public servants reporting cases of abuse must be protected. 
Thus, they would fell more inclined to report or blow the whistle 
on the conduct of their superiors and coworkers. That is why 
government employees need the kind of protection this bill is 
designed to afford them.
<P>
	There are many examples around the world of governments 
that have already passed legislation to allow employees to 
disclose instances of abuse and squandering within the public 
service. In fact, this public administration philosophy is 
increasingly popular in the United States.
<P>
	More than 20 states in the U.S., including major states like 
New York and California, are reported to have put in place 
similar legislation enabling public servants to report abuse and 
protecting them; in some states, the protection of the law even 
extends to disclosure of abuse and squandering in the private 
sector. We are light-years behind them in that respect.
<P>
	And the U.S. is not alone. England also has similar 
legislation. But we, in Canada, do not. It would be great, of 
course, if the federal government could act on this. There is 
every reason to do so. In fact, there is no valid reason not to pass 
this bill, except perhaps a lack of will on the part of the 
government. This is not even a partisan issue; it does not have 
anything to do with being a federalist or a sovereignist. It is 
strictly a matter of common sense. As other members 
mentioned, public servants themselves and the Public Service 
Alliance have come forward and expressed full support, for the 
reasons stated previously.
<P>
	There really is no reason not to pass this bill, because this is a 
bill that will help the public service operate better and more 
economically. Why not agree in principle with this bill, as 
suggested by the hon. member for Saint-Boniface and the 
representative of the Reform Party? Why not refer it to 
committee, where improvements can be made if required so that 
we can go some way toward providing Canada with a piece of 
legislation enabling public servants to disclose instances of 
abuse without being subjected to unfair retaliation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The member for Portneuf, 
on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned previously, I 
would like to ask the House if these is unanimous consent to find 
this bill votable.
<P>
	As we know, Canadians have been waiting for such a piece of 
legislation. We have the opportunity to have an important 
in-depth debate which would enlighten members of Parliament 
as well as the public. Later on, we will have the opportunity, if 
the House so desires, to vote to refer this bill to a committee.
<P>
	What we are talking about now is to have two more 
opportunities to debate this bill. Therefore, I ask the House for 
its unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the motion presented by the member for Portneuf 
seeking unanimous consent to find this item votable and to 
debate it for two more hours.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hour provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 96, this item is dropped for the 
<I>Order Paper</I>.
<P>
	It being 6.50 p.m., this House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.49 p.m.)
