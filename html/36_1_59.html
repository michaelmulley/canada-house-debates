</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP)</B> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemns the 
government for promoting an economy where the gap between 
the superrich and ordinary Canadian families is widening, 
risking the future of our youth, and strongly urges the 
government to introduce in the coming budget measures 
ensuring every Canadian an opportunity to share in a new 
prosperity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, we 
have introduced a topic in the House for debate today which is a 
very important and growing issue right across the country, the 
issue of increasing inequality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years in the sixties and seventies the gap between the 
rich and the poor was narrowing in this country and we were proud 
of some of the progress we had made.  New social programs like 
the Canada pension plan and universal health care had narrowed 
the gap between the wealthy people and the poor people of this 
country. 
It was a legacy that we were all proud of as Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very well back in 1968 when the then leader of the 
Liberal Party and the prime minister of the country, Pierre 
Elliot Trudeau, campaigned across this country about a just 
society and decreasing these disparities.  That went on for a 
while, but in the last 10 years or so, and in particular since 
this Liberal government came to power, we have seen the creation 
of what I call the unjust society where the gap is widening once 
again between the wealthier people and the poorer people in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are only two weeks away from the budget, it is important 
that we start putting some of these issues into the public record 
and debate what I think is a big issue in this country, two 
classes of Canadians, the wealthy Canadians, the very wealthy 
Canadians and the rest of Canadians, particularly the poorer side 
of the spectrum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to do this morning very briefly is put some 
information into the House and hopefully put some parameters on 
the debate we are having today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1989, which I am going to use as our base year, average 
family incomes in Canada have fallen by roughly 5%.  They have 
gone down, not up.  This is despite the fact the Minister of 
Finance says the economic fundamentals are right, unemployment is 
finally starting to go down, inflation is below 1%, that the 
budget is going to be balanced and there will be a fiscal 
dividend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all that and despite the fact the economy, as the 
minister says, is doing better, the question is better for whom. 
It is certainly not better for the average Canadian family whose 
income has gone down by 5% in the last seven or eight years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1989 we have 538,000 more children living in poverty in 
this country, one of the wealthiest countries in the world. The 
number of food banks has tripled in Canada since 1989.  The 
number of people filing for bankruptcy has tripled since 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also see that the number of low income persons in 1996 was 
40% higher than in 1989.  What we are seeing now, I maintain, is 
the creation of an unjust society that is going to be the legacy 
of this Minister of Finance unless he changes his priorities and 
starts to redistribute income and opportunities in Canada.  That 
is what this debate is all about this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the reasons for this?  I think there are four or five 
very obvious reasons.  One has been the determination of the Bank 
of Canada over the last number of years, with the support of this 
finance minister and previous finance ministers, to fight 
inflation and put inflation ahead of the creation of jobs and 
economic growth.  That has slowed down the economy, created 
unemployment, made the borrowing of money more expensive and 
slowed down the expansion of small businesses and the farm 
economy right across the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there is no priority in this country to create jobs. 
There are no targets for reducing unemployment and poverty like 
we have had targets for reducing inflation in Canada.  The big 
one has been the cutback by this Minister of Finance in the 
transfers to the provinces on health and education.  This has 
increased disparities right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that, we have had the gutting of the unemployment 
insurance system by the Minister of Finance in an effort to save 
money to balance the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I suppose the symbolism of what is happening where the 
rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer was the 
announced proposed merger of the Bank of Montreal and the Royal 
Bank about two weeks ago.  I predict that unless the Canadian 
people and the Liberal backbenchers in Parliament get up and 
speak about this, the Minister of Finance will acquiesce to this 
demand of his friends in the Bank of Montreal and the Royal Bank 
come about October or November of next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the reasons why the disparity is growing.  I 
have had a chance to look at focus groups over the last couple of 
months and a major concern has been the growing gap between the 
rich and the poor, growing inequities which have created despair 
and poverty and crime and the social unrest we are starting to 
see not only in our big cities but right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about income disparity, this is something we should 
all be concerned about.  Last year the top 20% of the Canadian 
people saw their incomes go up by almost 2%.  The bottom 20% had 
a decrease in their incomes of around 3%.  The disparity widens 
and it widens under the tutelage of the Minister of Finance.  We 
see tremendous disparities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief executive officers had a 14% increase in salaries in the 
last year while their workers had an increase in salary in those 
same factories and same companies of some 2.1%.  CEOs received 
14% and workers received 2.1%. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1010

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CEOs of the Toronto stock exchange 300, those companies in 
TSE 300, who exercised their stock options in 1996 enjoyed an 
average increase of $653,700 in the last year, up from $238,000 
in the previous year.  In contrast, the wages of the CEOs' 
employees were raised by an average of 2.1 % in 1996, again a 
tremendous disparity that all Canadians should be concerned 
about; once again, the creation of what I call the unjust 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another good example is the whole question of some of the 
salaries of some of the leading CEOs in the country.  I can 
mention Matthew Barrett, the president of the Bank of Montreal or 
John Cleghorn, the head of the Royal Bank in Canada.  Both of 
them, with stock options and salaries and bonuses, enjoy salaries 
of well over several millions of dollars each and every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then of course there is our good old friend Frank Stronach, the 
president and CEO of Magna International.  I want to tell a 
little about Frank Stronach, the friend of the minister across 
the way of financial institutions.  Frank Stronach had 
compensation last year of $43.2 million. Frank Stronach said: 
“If I add up all the hours I've spent working over the last 40 
years, I probably haven't made much more than the minimum wage”. 
That salary is $43.2 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us do a little calculation.  At $7 an hour, minimum wage, it 
would take Stronach, even if he worked 24 hours a day each and 
every day of the year, some 688 years to make some $43.2 million. 
And the ministers across the way just smile and they say that is 
fine, they contribute to our party.  That does not matter.  We 
are friends of Frank Stronach, we are friends of John Cleghorn, 
friends of Matthew Barrett. Whatever they want they will get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These growing disparities in our country ought to be of great 
concern to us.  It is not just Frank Stronach or the Cleghorns or 
the Matthew Barretts, but wealthy 2% or 3% of the people in this 
country are increasing their salaries, increasing their 
compensation, increasing their bonuses month after month and year 
after year and the disparity is widening. That is not a very good 
legacy to leave to the next generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to close, because I want to share my time with the member 
for Vancouver East, by pointing out some international statistics 
that we should take note of in terms of the gap between the rich 
and the poor.  This is based on household income.  We will find 
here that Canada has the second largest gap of the seven or eight 
countries in the OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States the gap between the rich and the poor is 
over $54,000.  In Canada it is $42,500.  It is the eighth largest 
gap of these nine countries.  We are the second worst in terms of 
the gap between the rich and the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead with the minister who is going to respond today on 
behalf of the Minister of Finance, the minister of financial 
institutions, to get up and tell us how they are going to create 
in this country more equality and more fairness between the rich 
and the poor.  It is an extremely important issue.  It is a sad 
commentary on our country, a country of great prosperity, with 
great potential, to see that out of the nine leading countries 
like France and Britain and Germany and the United States, we 
have the second largest gap between the rich and the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing now is the creation of the unjust society, 
the legacy of this Minister of Finance and the legacy of this 
Prime Minister. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member spoke at length about CEOs and how much they earn. I 
wonder what he is exactly suggesting here.  Is he suggesting that 
we just print money and pay everybody $2 million a year?  In 
which case we know for certain that it will not be long before we 
will be like Russia, communism all over again with total collapse 
of the economy, no incentive to work, no incentive for private 
enterprise or business whatsoever. 
I would like to know if he is suggesting that.  If not, I would 
like to know whether he is suggesting that we reduce everybody's 
wages to $10 an hour, in which case I hope he and his colleagues 
would set an example by getting out of their business class seats 
on their flights back to Vancouver and by starting to act like 
socialists.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely they can see that 30 years of government overspending to 
get us $600 billion in debt did not create any jobs.  We had the 
worst unemployment when we had $40 billion deficits every year. 
It is only now that unemployment is coming under control, thanks 
to Klein and thanks to Harris who finally have brains in their 
heads unlike the socialists who were in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am always very happy 
to receive a comment and a question from the Reform Party. People 
watching the debate should know that Reformers are against this 
motion.  They want to create more inequalities, more disparities, 
more money for the rich and less money for the poor. That is 
exactly what he is saying in criticizing our approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about printing money.  That is where he came 
from: Social Credit and funny money back in B.C. and Alberta many 
years ago.  That is not what we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a Canada in which disparities will be 
decreased as they were in the 1960s and 1970s when the 
disparities between the rich and the poor were gradually 
decreasing because of programs and tax policies that were of more 
benefit to lower income people than they were to wealthy people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the direction we want to go in.  We can do it through 
the tax system.  We can do it through emphasizing growth and the 
creation of jobs.  We can do it through the federal government 
spending money on health and education.  That is what Canadians 
want according to all the polls we have seen and all the people 
we have spoken to.  They want more money put back into health and 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has cut back on health and education. 
Reformers would want even more cutbacks on health and education. 
They worship at the altar of Mike Harris.  They worship at the 
altar of Ralph Klein.  They worship at the altar of the far right 
in the world like Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Regan, but that is 
not the way the Canadian people want to go.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
to the comments made by my two colleagues, one from the Reform Party and 
the other from the NDP, and I see two worlds. One is the capitalist 
world so aptly described by my colleague from the NDP, which is 
heartless and would have us take as much as we can out of the pockets of 
the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you an example. There was a report in yesterday's <I>Le 
Soleil</I> about a family of five in Rivière-à-Martre, in my riding, that 
had lost their home. This happened just recently. This is not a 
hypothetical case. They lost their home because someone did not have 
enough hours to qualify for employment insurance, which to me will 
always remain poverty insurance. 
This morning's <I>Le Soleil</I> reports the case of a lady in Carleton who also 
lost her home. These are facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from the NDP said that 
banks are allowed to make billions while the government is withdrawing 
from everything. Would he agree that—incidentally I congratulate him on 
his speech—when we try to help out a small business, there is so much 
red tape and government standards are so high that we end up doing more 
harm than good. I would like to hear what he has to say about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B> Mr. Speaker, I fully agree with my hon. 
colleague from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From time to time, things do get too complicated at the federal 
level and in many provinces. I also agree with my colleague when he says 
that the Reform Party stands at the extreme right of the ideological 
spectrum in this country. It is an old-style ideology, a Margaret 
Thatcher ideology. We saw how the Reform Party reacted when I mentioned 
Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. The Reform Party is also good 
friends with the likes of Frank Stronach and Conrad Black, the very rich 
in this country. Those are differences. But the extreme right is not at 
all the position held by the people of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
NDP opposition motion before us today is an important one because 
it comes just before the introduction of the budget.  It gives us 
an opportunity to take stock of the reality facing most 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more than enough evidence to show why the government 
should be condemned for promoting an economy where the gap 
between the rich and ordinary Canadians is widening.  As my 
colleague, the hon. member for Qu'Appelle, has so eloquently 
pointed out, there is enormous statistical information and 
evidence in our local communities about what the impact of 
Liberal government policies has been in every part of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that between 1973 and 1993 the richest 30% of 
Canadian families saw their share of the nation's income increase 
by 5.4%, while the poorest 50% saw their share drop by 9%. This 
represented a $14 billion transfer from low and middle income 
Canadians to high income Canadians.  We have information and 
evidence to show that over the last decade there has been an 
enormous growing disparity, something that Conservative and 
Liberal governments have abysmally failed to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear a lot of rhetoric in the House about the growing concern 
for children living in poverty.  We have to understand that 
because of the policies of the government we have seen an 
increase in the number of poor families in Canada.  Most of us 
would find it shocking to know that in this wealthy country we 
now have five million Canadians who live below the poverty line. 
Recent statistics from the Canadian Association of Food Banks 
show that the number of Canadians who depend on food banks is now 
something like 2.5 million people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At our last caucus meeting we had a delegation from the Canadian 
Association of Food Banks that rightly told us its mandate was to 
see that food banks were eliminated.  The main issue in terms of 
what causes the need for food banks is income inequality, the 
lack of income for poor people, the working poor and the 
unemployed.  That has to be addressed in the upcoming budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that in Canada there are now half or more 
children living in poverty.  In a country such as Canada that has 
tremendous wealth and resources this is something we simply 
cannot tolerate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask what are the reasons for this growing inequality. 
It was very interesting to read a recent Angus Reid poll in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> which showed that 69% of Canadians felt that 
the federal government was deliberating pursuing economic 
policies that were widening the gap between rich and poor 
Canadians.  This growing understanding within local communities 
and within Canadian society as a whole has been completely 
ignored by the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance and other members of government continue 
to say that they are the defenders of social programs, young 
people, seniors or the unemployed.  The real evidence is in the 
changes to our employment insurance program.  The report tabled 
yesterday in the House demonstrates in a very tragic way that 37% 
of people who contributed to EI are now eligible for it, whereas 
a few years ago it used to be 87%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a situation where the cuts in the Canada health and 
social transfer have had a devastating impact on our health care 
and education programs.  More than that, we have seen debate take 
place about the multilateral agreement on investment.  There is a 
seriousness about that debate. Canadians understand the Liberal 
government is pursuing with an aggressiveness we have never seen 
before a race to the bottom or a race for globalization, which 
means there will be a transfer of power to vary powerful 
corporations and a growing income disparity within our country 
and in global terms.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who spoke before me addressed the very serious 
situation of the last few weeks with the merger of banks or the 
proposal to merge two of Canada's major banks.  It was a real 
test to see whether or not the Liberal government was willing to 
stand up for the people of Canada and to say that the merger was 
not in the best interest of any Canadian, that it was not in the 
public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead we saw a response that was ambiguous, that was waffling, 
and that called for review and study.  We want to see leadership 
such as we have seen from the New Democratic Party.  The 
government should state clearly that the merger of these banks 
will fail the Canadian people and will increase the growing 
inequality in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to spend a few minutes talking about some of the local 
impacts of the policies of the government and why its economic 
policies should be condemned by relating them back to my own 
riding.  My riding of Vancouver East includes the lowest income 
neighbourhood in Canada, the downtown east side.  Every day I 
meet constituents who come to me with their issues and concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of Frank who came in to see me and told me that 
his income was $770 a month.  Of that he is paying $540 a month 
in rent.  That is an issue of being one step away from 
homelessness.  That is an issue of stark reality in my riding. It 
is not just my riding.  It is right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a man I meet on the street from time to time whose 
name is Gary.  He lives in a cardboard box.  He is homeless.  He 
wishes the federal government had not abandoned the social 
housing program, our national program for housing, in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Vancouver East every day I meet people who are 
living in what is called single occupant rooms in incredibly 
substandard housing that in any middle income or middle class 
community would not be tolerated.  Yet the reason people are 
living in this kind of housing is that the federal government 
abandoned its social responsibility and its fiscal responsibility 
to provide a social safety net to make sure that no person goes 
hungry or homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the real evidence of what I see in my riding of 
Vancouver East in an urban community as a direct impact and 
result of Liberal government policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also met many students at Carleton University, the 
University of Toronto, the University of British Columbia and 
Simon Fraser University who have told me about their rising debt 
load.  They are now carrying debts of $25,000, $30,000 and 
$40,000 as a direct result of the massive cutbacks to 
post-secondary education by the Liberal government of $2.29 
billion since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being a new member of the House and listening to the debate, I 
have heard many times members of the Liberal government talk 
about their professed concern for young people and the future. 
Young people are sick to death of waiting.  They are fed up with 
the rhetoric.  Their debts are climbing.  Their inaccessibility 
to post-secondary education is growing.  They understand clearly 
it is as a result of Liberal policies that have eroded our public 
education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few months ago the NDP held a number of round table 
discussions across the country.  One of them was on youth 
unemployment.  Again the message was the same.  Young people were 
saying they were fed up with government programs that provide a 
few months of training or a job opportunity and then there is 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking to the motion today as to why we should condemn the 
government for its policies, we want to say roundly and strongly 
that its policies have had a devastating impact on low income 
people, on poor people and on the middle class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity today and in coming days to reorder the 
priorities and say that we are willing to set targets to reduce 
unemployment.  We are willing to set targets to reduce poverty. 
We are willing to ensure there is a national child care program. 
We are willing to say there is a national housing program.  As 
has been demonstrated by the alternative federal budget, these 
things are affordable to us if we have the guts, the courage and 
the leadership to say they are our priorities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Reform actually agrees with the NDP that the Liberal government 
made a big mistake cutting transfers in support of education and 
health.  Since 1990 it has always been Reform policy that we 
would not cut those transfers and that has always been printed in 
our policy.  So it is one thing we do agree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the NDP is constantly bleating about the growing gap 
between the rich and poor but it does not offer any solutions 
other than taking other people's money in the form of taxes and 
spending more.  We do not help the poor by killing the rich. We 
do not help the poor by destroying the rich.  We do not help 
people get jobs by destroying businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Zealand, which is the country I emigrated from, found out in 
1983 that socialism does not work.  I had a two hour meeting with 
the prime minister at the time, Mr. David Lange. He was an NDP 
equivalent. He told me that he had learned that without a vibrant 
private sector there were no social programs.  It just does not 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Capitalism does have a heart, but we see a different way of 
getting there.  If we do not have businesses with good job 
creation we have not got any social programs whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member to give some solutions please.  Stand up 
and tell us how we get to where she wants to be.  We have a plan 
to get there and it is beginning to work.  We can see it in 
Alberta and in Ontario. Unemployment nationally is going down. 
Let us hear her solution and tell us of a country where it has 
actually worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. Frankly I am very surprised to hear that the 
Reform Party agrees that cutting transfers was a huge mistake and 
it has had a very negative impact on Canadians right across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have heard from the Reform Party time and time again is 
that it also takes a slash and burn approach. When the member 
offers up Ontario and Alberta as examples of what should be done, 
my goodness, is there any other evidence that we need to 
understand the direction the Reform Party wants to drive us in in 
terms of throwing everybody into unemployment or into low wage 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the question as to what are the solutions, I 
would suggest the Reform Party might join the NDP in having the 
courage to stand up and say that to have banks which make profits 
of $7.5 billion is obscene, that there is wealth in this country 
and the solution is in how that wealth is distributed.  If we 
could harness that wealth and make sure it is reinvested and 
redirected to help ordinary Canadians, then we would be a lot 
better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The response to the question is that we need to have fair 
taxation.  The Reform Party promotes an agenda and a program of 
unfair taxation by basically letting off profitable businesses 
and saying that somehow this will not create jobs. The reality is 
that what this country needs is a program of fair taxation 
whereby businesses and corporations pay their fair share of the 
need to support a public infrastructure which is something that 
benefits all of us whether we are rich or poor.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today, February 13, for two 
reasons.  First, it is my mother's birthday.  Happy Birthday, 
Philomène. Second, I strongly support my colleagues to my left, the 
members of the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I particularly support the tax system they are advocating.  I 
think the Canadian tax system is unfair. 
Here is an example.  Why is a single mother earning less than 
$30,000, who sends her child to daycare, able to deduct $170 per 
$1,000 of income while someone earning $60,000 under the same 
system gets a tax break of $290 per $1,000 of income, a difference 
of $120? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not give up, we are behind you.  We too think the gap

hon. member for his comments.  We in the NDP agree with the 
comments that have been made.  The evidence before us in the 
House concerning the growing disparity particularly for families 
and for working people is something we should be ashamed of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned the need for child care.  I am sure we 
would agree that this is a priority which has been completely 
lost in the government's agenda.  I remember well the promises 
that were made to women and families of this country, that the 
need for a national child care program was a key ingredient in 
ensuring that women could become part of the workforce and in 
ensuring that families were able to cope in today's society. 
This has been completely abandoned by the federal government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the NDP has 
raised a very important issue for all Canadians as well as for 
people in other countries.  It is the issue of income disparity. 
Unfortunately there have been no solutions presented today.  Is 
the NDP solution to regulate and cap salaries and profits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Fair taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Fair taxes.  If fair taxes is the 
issue, then let us look at Canada's overall tax structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that in the global world we have to have a tax 
structure which is relatively competitive with those of our 
neighbours.  When we look at Canada among the G-7 countries, we 
are square in the middle of the seven. Our total tax burden is 
36% of GDP.  At the highest end there is France where it is 43%. 
At the lowest end there is the U.S.A. where it is 28%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The competitive realities are that we cannot get too far out of 
line with the Americans to the south.  Our overall tax burden is 
about 30% higher than that of Americans. However, I would never 
advocate that we should go down to American levels.  Part of the 
difference is because we have a health care system which the 
Americans do not have.  It gives Canadians tremendous security 
and it also gives us a competitive edge over the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless when we consider our comparative tax levels we will 
find that the personal income tax in Canada is 13.4% of our gross 
domestic product and in the U.S. it is 9.8%.  In Japan it is 
6.4%. On top of that we have a capital gains tax which is among 
the highest in the western world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The progressivity of our tax system is something which I think 
hon. members from the NDP should take into consideration.  They 
have great envy for the rich.  Maybe a lot of people do. However, 
these are the facts.  Only 2% of tax filers in Canada have 
incomes over $100,000 and they pay 21% of all federal taxes. The 
lowest 60%, those with incomes under $25,000, pay only 4% of our 
taxes. We believe that a highly progressive tax system is an 
ingredient in creating equality of opportunity and fairness, and 
we do not back away from that one bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have we heard in terms of solutions?  I have talked about 
their cry for tax fairness.  Do they want to tax the rich more? 
That alternative is there.  Ours is still the most highly 
progressive personal income tax system in the western world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the concern of NDP members is for those who have been 
marginalized in our society or for those who have the greatest 
difficulty in coping, then we have no dispute with them. We would 
hope that they would support the measures that we have brought 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our major concerns has been low income working families. 
The Caledon Institute and studies by the finance department 
revealed that there was a welfare wall.  A family on welfare 
taking in all of the benefits provided by governments was about 
$3,000 ahead of a family with two children and parents working at 
low wage levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what was called the welfare wall.  It was a barrier to 
leaving welfare and going into the workforce.  We addressed the 
matter not by lowering benefits to the lower income people on 
welfare but by increasing the tax incentives for those who were 
actually working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we brought in the working income supplement.  This 
is why in an agreement with the provinces we have entered into 
the national child tax benefit.  This government has committed 
$850 million to the child tax benefit which goes to those low 
income families.  We promised during the course of our mandate to 
beef that up by another $850 million.  This is at a time when all 
parties in this House recognize that our deficit and debt are 
major economic problems and challenges for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we have increased the tax incentives available 
to Canadians with disabilities.  We recognize that the costs of 
working and being disabled, or existing and being disabled are 
very high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Why don't you brag about raising taxes 38 
times? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Would the hon. member please show a 
little bit of respect if he has nothing intelligent to 
contribute.  If the Reform Party member has nothing better to add 
to this debate than inane accusations not based on fact and 
shouting and screaming, I wish he would— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Thirty-eight tax raises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Bring in civility to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Civility is not within that new 
member's lexicon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recognize that Canadians with disabilities need to have 
the added costs they bear each day taken into consideration. We 
have done that through the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education is a great leveller in our society creating equality 
of opportunity.  We will never as a government be able to create 
equality among individuals but we can at least create equality of 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why in spite of our fiscal difficulties over the last 
four years this government has introduced numerous measures to 
help students in the education system.  These include increasing 
the levels for registered educational savings plans, the 
educational tax credit, deductibility of ancillary fees and 
expenses for students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the innovation foundation to which we have 
contributed $800 million. In conjunction with the private sector 
and other levels of government, there will be a $2 billion fund 
for investment in research and development in our hospitals and 
institutions of higher learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall our Prime Minister announced that access to education 
is very important to him and to this government.  He announced 
the creation of the millennium scholarship fund.  The finance 
minister a couple of weeks ago said that we can look forward to 
ongoing measures to assist students in the next budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the concerns we have had about creating 
opportunity for all Canadians.  We have put our money where our 
mouth is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the NDP we have heard about, and I will quote the member 
for Qu'Appelle who was supported by the member for Vancouver 
East, “the obscene profits made by banks”.  Yes, they made 
record profits last year but they have also paid record taxes in 
Canada.  Canadian banks pay 64% of their net income in Canadian 
taxes.

47%.  Canadian credit unions pay 45%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are hon. members in the NDP suggesting that credit unions should 
be brought up to a 64% of net income tax level in Canada?  Let us 
hear about it if the Canadian bank profits are obscene.  Do they 
want even higher taxes on the banks in light of these figures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the hon. member for Qu'Appelle that on December 4, 1996 
the leader of the NDP said in a press release that she welcomed 
bank profits if they were earned through good management, sound 
long term investment and progressive participation in the 
Canadian economy.  The leadership race in the member's party is 
over.  He lost.  Maybe it is time he started to support his 
leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We take no back seat to anybody in terms of taxes in these 
areas.  We are the ones that increased the corporate surtax, the 
large corporation tax, and introduced the temporary surtax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Now you are bragging about tax increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  I am proud of these three tax 
increases we brought in because we had to get our deficit under 
control.  We in this party have legitimate concerns about the 
poor in Canada and sustaining the programs that keep them going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we have started the process of bringing down 
gradually tax levels in a way that is sustainable, fair and does 
not undermine the social and economic underpinnings of our 
economy.  We are making those investments and we are proud to do 
it.

the hon. member's speech.  He proudly mentioned to the House the 
taxes introduced by his government.  Congratulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who ultimately pays for increased taxes?  The public.  Those 
taxes fall on the shoulders of the public.  The government has 
balanced the budget on the backs of the public.  What has been 
the outcome?  The worst unemployment we have seen since the 
depression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot let pass the NDP comments.  Proud NDPers wear their 
hearts on their sleeves.  They profess to be the saviour of the 
poor and underprivileged.  What would they do?  During the 
election campaign it presented a budget to the public that was 
proven not to work and to increase the deficit of Canada by tens 
of billions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For once I would like the public to see the absurdity of trying 
to increase taxes while trying to help the poor.  Increasing 
taxes, increasing government spending and increasing deficits do 
what?  They compromise the very people all in the House would 
like to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all the negativism we have seen across the House, the Reform 
Party is the only party that put forth a workable plan that would 
eliminate taxes for those in the lowest socioeconomic groups in 
Canada, put more money in their pockets and save our social 
programs.  Deficits, debt and increased taxes are what compromise 
the lowest socioeconomic groups and social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only party that has ever put forth a constructive plan to 
save health care, pensions and social programs is this party.  We 
propose solutions to put our economic house in order so that the 
government will have the money to spend on people who need it the 
most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member acknowledge that increasing taxes, increasing 
deficits and increasing debt compromise the lowest socioeconomic 
groups preferentially? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we recognize the terrible 
impact of huge deficits on our economy.  When we took office the 
deficit was at $42 billion.  We are still paying about a third of 
every tax dollar to service the interest on our debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why, in a time period that is less than any Reform 
package put forward, we will have our budget in balance.  We are 
starting to pay down the debt. 
At the same time we will never adopt the Reform formula for doing 
it.  This is the party that was to cut taxes.  At the same time 
how would Reformers have paid for it?   First, they would cut 
drastically the programs to help with the pensions of seniors. 
Second, they would cut transfers to the provinces for education 
and for health care.  Third, and probably the most draconian of 
all, as seen through all their budgets which keep shifting with 
the political winds and the latest polls, they would cut 
equalization to the poorest regions and the poorest people.

most.  We never will.  We will have a balanced approach.  At the 
same time as we are gradually cutting taxes, starting with those 
most in need, the disabled, the students, the working poor, and 
helping charities and the voluntary sector do more to increase 
tax incentives, we are helping those who need it most by 
sustaining the programs that help Canadians have a secure 
retirement, strong education and strong health systems.  Those 
are our priorities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to address this NDP opposition 
day motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always a little bemusing to me when the NDP castigates 
Reform.  Quite frankly Reform and the NDP have exactly the same 
goal in mind, that is to give ordinary citizens a break they very 
richly deserve.  It is long overdue after years of Tory and 
Liberal mismanagement and taxation of their incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the NDP to listen very carefully to what I am about to say 
because we have the same goal in mind.  We care about the people. 
It is because the traditional political parties no longer serve 
our interests that we have a Reform vehicle, Reform members in 
the House and a Reform vision which we are working hard to 
achieve.  That vision is a strong country with strong social 
programs, with a safety net that we can count on, and with 
incomes that are not constantly eroded by government 
mismanagement, overspending and overtaxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heartily agree with the NDP goal of ensuring that every 
Canadian has an opportunity to share in a new prosperity.  That 
is what life is all about.  It is about creating a strong, 
vibrant future and life for ourselves and our families.  That is 
important to every Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP also talks about the future of our youth.  The future of 
our youth is the future of our country.  In that I know we all 
concur.  It is the young people who day after day come to us and 
say they have done everything they can but cannot find a decent 
job with a decent income.  That concerns us very deeply because 
it is their future we need to be looking after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the NDP solution?  It is to rant against the super rich, 
the bogeymen, like the land owners in some South American 
countries, like the nobility in eastern Europe, like some evil 
force is keeping honest, decent, low income people from having 
the opportunities they need.  I appeal to the NDP to get 
realistic about the problems and the way to achieve the goals we 
all believe in, instead of creating scary bogeymen and railing 
against people who are trying their best to create opportunities, 
employment and income that can be taxed back to help the less 
fortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that we need to give assistance to people who cannot 
care for themselves.  It is something that we pride ourselves on. 
We must assist those who cannot meet their own needs in a 
generous and compassionate manner.  It concerns me that we are 
losing the ability to do that as more and more of our money is 
diverted into paying interest on a mortgage that we are placing 
on our children's future and that the NDP wants to add to. 
It wants to continue to mortgage our children's future by massive 
overspending and to tax away the income young workers manage to 
get.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a role for government to play in its policies on 
taxation and spending and in achieving the goal of ensuring 
Canadians a high standard of living and real prosperity. However, 
the NDP way of doing this and its proposals to do this have 
proven over the last 30 years, not just in Canada but in country 
after country in the world, to do the absolute opposite of what 
it says it is trying to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand.  I have met a number of my NDP colleagues. 
I have the highest regard for their compassion, for their heart 
for people, for their desire to do the right thing, and for their 
competence and ability in the legislative arena.  Yet all they 
can trot out is tired old failed policies of tax and spend and 
government intervention.  This will simply give us more of what 
we have had over the last several decades.  The same old failed 
policies of the past are being touted by the NDP.  It simply will 
not wash.  It will not serve Canadians.  I appeal to the NDP to 
become more realistic about what can be achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is asking for state planing; big government; high 
spending and huge bureaucracies that lead to waste and abuse of 
taxpayer money; high taxes which means less to meet the needs of 
families; and low incentives to invest and take risk.  This means 
less creation of wealth, a smaller pie, less to share for those 
who truly are less fortunate and a lower standard of living, 
which is exactly what we are seeing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform instead says that we need self-reliance and individual 
initiative.  That is the spirit and that is the energy that will 
give us real prosperity.  We need smaller, more efficient 
government.  We need lower tax takes, in particular for low 
income people who are struggling to give their children the 
necessities of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead we have the NDP saying “The government can manage your 
money better than you can.  Just hand it over because we know 
much better what to do with it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fiscal platform of NDPers will simply give us what they say 
they do not like.  They call for huge increases in spending, 
which will lock in the current record high tax burden that 
contributes so much to the poverty they claim they want to 
address, and higher inflation which eats away at the purchasing 
power of retired Canadians, causes an increase in interest rates 
and a slowdown in job creating investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NDPers talk about fair taxes.  Have they not caught on to the 
fact that when we raise taxes on business people and service 
providers they simply pass the cost on to the consumer?  That is 
us.  That is Canadian families.  That is people who are 
struggling to make ends meet.  There is no way we will be able to 
strengthen the weak by weakening the strong.  It does not work 
that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the examples of country after country have not shown that 
conclusively to NDPers, we have to wonder whether they are living 
in never-never land and are not really prepared to deal with the 
realities that face Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way to create real jobs and to alleviate poverty in a 
meaningful way is to reduce taxes on low income families to 
create the conditions necessary for those families to earn 
employment income, to shore up health and education, and not 
implement passive welfare programs that encourage dependency and 
discourage work and independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I hesitate to interrupt the hon.

period when debate on the motion resumes, followed by a five

recently in my riding of Vancouver East a Liberal cabinet

convince us, by announcing an extension of the RRAP program, that 
the Liberal government cares about housing in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since its early history Bridgewater has been an enterprising 
town with boat builders, tanners, coopers, millers and foundries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years Bridgewater was the centre of a brisk lumber industry

grows some of the best timber in Nova Scotia.

this town is the main street of the south shore.

Canadians can be so inaccessible to his constituents that he does 
not even have an office, staff or a phone, that such a person 
living outside of Canada returns but one day a year to collect a 
$70,000 paycheque, that such a person will receive a lifetime 
pension amounting to nearly $50,000 per year, all paid by 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps members of this House wonder how such a person could 
remain in this place year after year.  This is a safe riding and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if 
the finance minister is ever going to realize his dream of 
becoming the prime minister, he must make sure he is a household 
name.  It is happening but I am not sure if the accompanying fist 
waving and arm waving is what he had in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a StatsCan study, Canadians pay more in taxes than 
they do for anything else, including food, shelter and clothing. 
From 1992 to 1996 while the finance minister has been in charge 
of the coffers, Canadians' tax load has grown at twice the rate 
of inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the finance minister finally going to listen to overtaxed 
Canadians?  Is he going to offer broad based tax relief in the 
upcoming budget?

<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is no money in my pockets.  The statistics to 
which the hon. member is referring obviously deal with the trend 
that began in the middle 1980s and was exacerbated substantially 
in the recession of 1989 to 1992.  I am quite confident that as 
we look ahead we will see Canadians paying less in taxes.  They 
will be paying more for things they choose for themselves.  I am 
about to be cut off but I would like to go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Fraser Valley. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will try to save him.  If the finance minister is going to be the 
prime minister, he has to be known as the greatest.  He is the 
greatest tax collector the country has ever seen.  That goes 
without saying.  His favourite slogan is never have so many been 
taxed so heavily for so long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But yesterday the Alberta treasurer showed him that it could be 
done.  Alberta can look forward to a balanced budget, and the 
lowest taxes in the country are going to become even lower while 
retiring more of the provincial debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the finance minister again if he will commit 100% of the 
budget surplus to tax relief and debt retirement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I suggest to the hon. member that he might want to take 
a look at the Alberta budget and what the Alberta government is 
doing.  It is putting more money into health care. It is putting 
more money into education.  It is putting more money into the 
priorities of Albertans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear that the whole country supports health care, the

not are the members of the Reform Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, of 
course it has to put more money into health care.  He slashed a 
whole bunch of the last budget out from under it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian taxpayers spent millions of dollars developing a French 
version of a debt management software program for African 
countries.  This software program is designed to help nations 
with huge debts become more responsible.  It is kind of like 
taxaholics anonymous for finance ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my question to the minister responsible for 
CIDA who developed this debt management software.  Would she lend 
a copy of this debt management software program to our finance 
minister?  He is $600 billion in debt and he needs all the help 
he can get.

some kind of a flip-flop on their basic policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps if the Reform Party had been able to engage in some 
proper analysis since it came into this Parliament it might well 
understand that what Canadians are looking for is a consistent 
and well thought out plan, which is what we set out in 1994.  It 
is working and Canadians support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, we learned that Quebeckers are massively opposed

is completely out of touch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With each passing day, the government is becoming increasingly 
isolated with respect to its Supreme Court reference.  Yesterday, 
it was the turn of the Association canadienne-française de 
l'Alberta, which represents 60,000 Franco-Albertans, to ask the 
federal government to abandon its reference to the Supreme Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this popular rejection now spreading outside Quebec, will

</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of making the entrance requirement higher for 
youth is to make sure they do not get caught in the trap of 
taking the easy way out.  For example in the summertime they get

stay in that field.  They quit school because they can make some 
money in the short term.  Then they find out down the line when 
they get a bit older that they do not have the education they

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CALGARY DECLARATION

<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, yesterday when the B.C. unity panel 
released its report, it showed that British Columbians are 
prepared to support the Calgary declaration “A Framework for 
Discussion”. However this support is based on the entire 
declaration especially the equality aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this government has strongly embraced the unique character 
aspects of the Calgary declaration, it has virtually ignored the 
equality provisions. I ask the Deputy Prime Minister, does this 
government have any initiatives to promote the equality 
provisions of the Calgary declaration? 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government 
has always shown support for the provincial initiative undertaken 
in the Calgary declaration.  The government remains prepared to 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary declaration is a declaration of principles that may 
or may not lead to constitutional action at a later time.  At 
this point the federal government is happy that the provinces 
have been working on it. Most provinces are prepared to pass a 
resolution.  We will be waiting to see the final result before 
taking action.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE SENATE 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, two weeks ago the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs stated that Reform's attempt to have an 
elected Senate would result in gross under-representation of the 
west in Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since British Columbia is already the most under-represented 
province in both this House and the upper house, will the 
minister assure British Columbians that this government will take 
steps to remedy the inequities before the end of this Parliament? 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the matter of reforming the Senate is not one for this 
government alone.  It is a matter for Parliament as a whole and 
the provinces as part of an amendment to the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I complete my answer by asking my hon. friend this.  If and when 
the day comes that we propose a change to the Constitution on the 
Senate, will she undertake on behalf of members of her party that 
they will not vote against it like they did the last time when 
the Charlottetown declaration was before Canada?

question is for the Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several drugs used in the treatment of HIV and AIDS have been 
available in the United States, Europe and South America for more than 
a year already. But the Health Protection Branch has yet to authorize 
the marketing of these new drugs, thereby penalizing thousands of 
infected individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister realize that, due to the particular inefficiency 
of the drug licensing process in Canada, thousands of people living with 
HIV or AIDS are seeing their treatment threatened?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Department of Health has the responsibility to ensure that drugs are 
safe before they are put on the market for use by those who are sick. It 
is the responsibility of the Government of Canada and we intend to 
fulfil this responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we are also fully aware of the fact that there 
are urgent needs to be met. At Health Canada we have procedures in 
place—

<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
September 1996, a parliamentary committee clearly recommended that the 
minister radically reform the Canadian drug licensing system, which is 
notoriously inefficient. Why has no action been taken since? 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
tabling of the report mentioned by the hon. member this morning, we at 
the health department have made changes to the system to give some 
people access to the drugs they need. We plan to keep improving this 
system in the interest of the sick.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it has happened again in my community of Abbotsford, British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>William Gibson Brown was sentenced to 11 years for a violent 
rape.  He got out of prison and then recently sexually assaulted 
some of our children.  He received a conditional sentence, no 
time in jail on the condition he does not do it again. Yesterday 
he was back in court again.  What for?  Molesting a five year old 
boy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Justice.  Why does the government refuse to prevent serious 
sex offenders from receiving conditional sentences, no time in 
jail? 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
obviously the hon. member describes a tragic case and no member 
in this House is pleased when they see that happen in the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional sentencing as the minister has said is a new 
provision.  The minister has stated that she and all her 
provincial counterparts are monitoring closely what is happening 
in the lower courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer the hon. member to the attorney general of Alberta who 
has publicly discouraged the federal government from unilaterally 
establishing further guidelines for this provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister has said in the House, if she has to she will 
amend the law. 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are sick and tired of this government monitoring 
these things.  This is a legal loophole and we are sick and tired 
of coming back and forth in this House of Commons on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A five year old boy has been molested because a judge issued 
this pervert a conditional sentence after he molested children 
and raped a woman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this government agree that a repeat rapist, a repeat child 
molester, should do no time in jail?  What about protecting our 
women and children for a change? 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think the hon. member's allegations to this part of the House are 
based on false presumptions. First of all, no member of this 
House has ever said they are happy with some of the decisions 
that are rendered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to repeat what the Minister of Justice has said in 
this House.  She has stressed this.  If she has to, she will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote the attorney general of Alberta, from your 
province, who said “I like the flexibility in conditional 
sentencing.  As opposed to having”— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  He is from British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  We are sick and tired of this.  We want 
it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order.  The parliamentary secretary 
has the floor.  It is difficult for the Chair to hear her 
response.  A member has asked a question, perhaps members might 
listen to the response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member 
would please listen, his leader's provincial attorney general 
said “I like the flexibility in conditional sentencing.  As 
opposed to having the federal government developing some very 
specific guidelines, we have the courts reacting to the needs of 
their respective communities across the country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, if we have to we will.

the Prime Minister had a choice.  He had a choice between meeting 
with Mr. Wei, the father of the democratic movement in China, or

</I></B></P><P align=left>The vice-president of Cuba came here to sign two treaties with 
the Canadian government, one of them an anti-hijacking treaty and

his MP office.  He did not even give him the courtesy of an 
official meeting.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Internal reports from his department say that about $2 billion

this totally unauthorized leak of this letter.

will be answered today.

<Question No. 18—<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much has the government spent implementing all the 
provisions passed in Bill C-68, an act respecting firearms and 
other weapons, which received royal assent (Chapter No. 53) on 
November 8, 1995; and (<I>a</I>) provide an accounting of how this 
money has been spent; (<I>b</I>) provide information on how many 
federal employees are working on the implementation of this 
statute and what part of it they are working on; and (<I>c</I>) 
provide a revised estimate of the total cost and number of

statute in each province and territory? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK284"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of 
Canada, Lib.):</B>  The Firearms Act received royal assent December 
5, 1995. To date, the government has expended $34.3 million on 
the implementation of this legislation.  Monies expended to date 
have been utilized for the design and development of the new 
Canadian firearms registration system, CFRS, for the development 
of communications vehicles to make the requirements of the new 
legislation understood by firearms owners and for associated 
program administration and liaison costs with 
federal-provincial-territorial partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, 53 federal Department of Justice employees 
are working on the implementation of this statute at the Canadian 
firearms centre, CFC.  The overall salary cost to date for 
1997-98 is $1.9 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No federal employees would be involved 
in the administration of the Firearms Act within the provinces 
and territories under normal circumstances.  However, in view of 
the position taken by the governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba and the Northwest Territories, we are developing plans 
with the RCMP for the provision of administrative services within 
those jurisdictions.  These plans are not yet complete and, 
accordingly, the specific resources required to perform the 
required work and costs related thereto are not known at this 
time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK289"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
participate in this debate on the poverty issue, which is brought into 
focus by the motion put forward by the New Democratic Party, especially 
since this year is the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration on 
Human Rights. This declaration sets out the basic social and economic 
rights that should be guaranteed to ensure that the most basic needs of 
every human being are met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Must I remind the federal government that, under the agreements 
signed in Copenhagen in 1995, it is required to find concrete ways in 
which to improve the living conditions of the poorest of the poor in 
Canada. We must recognize that, as noble as the words may be, reality is 
distressing and this government is more concerned with its visibility 
than with the need to put up a real fight against poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To better understand this reality, let me briefly describe the 
situation with respect to poverty and then outline government actions 
that make the situation worse. The Bloc Quebecois has suggestions to 
make and I will suggest a few solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will become obvious, in comparing the actions taken by this 
government and the solutions put forward by the Bloc Quebecois, that two 
diametrically opposed visions are taking shape in Canada regarding the 
distribution of wealth. 
Two different readings which clearly illustrate that there is one 
country but two peoples, as well as the necessity for Quebec to 
attain sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Québec, poverty has a face and a name.  It is 
a reality we face every day. In some districts, the unemployment 
level exceeds 15%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of this high unemployment rate, there is an increase in 
the number of welfare recipients. This sad reality impacts on our 
socio-community organizations and our soup kitchens, whose mission 
it is to alleviate poverty, but who have great difficulty keeping 
abreast of the demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first victims of this tragedy are children, young people 
and women.  We must not forget the too many families living below 
the poverty line, either.  Need I remind you that 20% of the 
population of Canada lives below the poverty line.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all very well to support “zero tolerance” of poverty, 
but what strikes me as essential are the concrete actions that must 
be taken to improve the situation of the most disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak of concrete actions, we mean such things as 
remedying the inequality of taxation practices, not taxing low wage 
earners to death and encouraging job creation.  Canada's track 
record as far as poverty is concerned is not as great as this 
government would have us believe.  Canada ranks 2nd out of 14 
industrialized countries where poverty is concerned.  Canada has 
the lowest basic child allowance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is equally dramatic where young people are 
concerned. 
Of the 400,000 Quebeckers without jobs in 1995, 35% were young 
people between the ages of 15 and 29.  And for all kinds of family, 
the 25 and under category is far and away the poorest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House what the present government 
has done to put its fiscal house in order.  In their single-minded 
battle to bring down the deficit, the Liberals have turned a blind 
eye to poverty since they took office in 1993.  I would even go so 
far as to say that the measures they have introduced have played a 
large role in widening the gap between the rich and the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to put their fiscal house in order, here is what the 
Liberals have done.  First, they have cut provincial transfer 
payments in such key areas as health, education and income 
security.  During its two terms in office, the Liberal government 
has cut social transfers by $42 billion. 
Cuts to transfer payments to the provinces represent 54% of all 
cuts by the present government between 1994 and 1998.  And although 
the government forecast spending cuts of 19%, actual cuts were only 
9%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, they savagely attacked the unemployed.  Over the 
last year, the Liberal government has recovered $1.5 billion on the 
backs of the unemployed by tightening the EI rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They raised taxes and increased tax revenue by refusing to 
index tax tables, GST credits, and the child tax benefit.  Measures 
such as these saved this government $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Liberal government has done.  Briefly, its 
savings come from $46 billion in cuts on the backs of the most 
disadvantaged members of society.  That is how they have reduced 
their deficit. 
Bluntly put, they have reduced their deficit on the backs of the 
provinces, the unemployed and the poor, not to mention the middle 
class, which is steadily losing ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has some suggestions.  As the Liberal 
government gets ready to bring down the budget, the Bloc Quebecois 
is proposing a number of measures that would protect the public 
from new rounds of slashed social programs, improve the situation 
of the most disadvantaged and ensure a better distribution of 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are therefore calling on the government to avoid the 
temptation to do something visible at all costs by instituting new 
social measures that would duplicate and overlap what is already 
being done provincially and that would ultimately penalize those 
whose need is greatest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the government to give the provinces tax points 
as reimbursement for the amounts kept back during the Liberal's 
first term from the health, education and social welfare transfers. 
The provinces are in a better position than the federal government 
to provide sustainable and reasonable solutions to people's 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the government to change the employment 
insurance plan.  The Bloc wants the employment insurance fund to be 
kept separate from the government consolidated fund.  It also wants 
half of the annual surplus in the account to be used to reduce 
contributions and the other to go to improving the current system 
and supporting the efforts of small and medium size business to 
preserve and create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can never say it enough.  The unemployment insurance fund 
must be returned to workers and not used to reduce the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the government to make targeted income tax 
reductions. 
Tax tables, GST credits and child tax credits must be re-indexed to 
inflation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that, because the credit is not indexed, 
50,000 children are no longer entitled to the maximum benefit each 
year and its value has decreased for those families continuing to 
receive it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, 840,000 low income families have begun to pay 
tax because tax levels and personal exemptions are not indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports the New Democratic Party's motion, 
but it reminds members of this House that Quebec will have a tax 
policy that will enable it to really fight poverty, once it has the 
tools.  The day may not be so far off.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened to the debate which was introduced by 
the hon. member for Qu'Appelle.  We have heard from all parties in this 
House at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before they go on with further talk, we should look at what 
measures have been taken by places in Canada, in the United 
States and around the world to deal with this particular problem. 
In North America we will find that the people who have the lowest 
unemployment and the people who are giving and entertaining the 
most employment are governments that have taken a look at their 
tax structure.  They have the best employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer the member for Qu'Appelle to my province of 
Saskatchewan— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> With respect, 
questions and comments should be directed to the hon. member for 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, they look alike. 
We have a government that has sold many of its crown 
corporations.  It has lowered the taxes to multinational 
corporations.  It has lowered the taxes in potash. It has lowered 
the taxes in oil and thus Saskatchewan is almost parallel to 
Alberta in having the highest employment.  This comes by 
governments lowering taxes, thus feeding the industry and thus 
creating jobs.  You do not create jobs by continuing high 
taxation.  That is the point we have to get across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Before the hon. 
member for Quebec responds I remind members to address each other 
through the Chair. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, you are going to confuse 
him.  He cannot look at two people at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully agree that the taxation system must be reviewed, but 
there must also be a sensitivity toward the working poor, those 
whose earnings keep them below the poverty level.  What the Bloc 
Quebecois is calling for is a review of the taxation system.  We 
are, therefore, most anxious to see the Minister of Finance bring 
down his budget, so that we can implement real solutions to the 
problems people are facing, the least advantaged of our society in 
particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Job creation is the real solution to poverty, full time and 
well paying work.  We know, for instance, that earning the minimum 
wage will not get a person above the poverty line.  That is where 
the problem lies.  Often people do have jobs, but these do not pay 
enough to provide them with a certain quality of life. 
The Liberal government should review its taxation system, not 
overtax low wage earners, and tie its taxation system to the cost 
of living.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

for Quebec's comments.  She talked about many things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the member and members of this House that 
when it was time to get our house in order, when it was time to 
make sure we could get the deficit down to zero, and 
hopefully we will see that soon, measures were taken.  For 
example, we introduced a new tax treatment of child support.

Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, since it has been in 
power, the Liberal Party has done nothing but add to the poverty in 
Canada, and the figures prove it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we refer to band-aid solutions, we are thinking for 
example of the Liberals' promise of $1.7 billion for children.  The 
Liberals have got off to a slow start on this.  They tell us that, 
this spring, they are going to put $850 million in, but there is 
already a deficit because there was a promise of $250 million 
relating to the child tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is far lower than the amount required; at this time, 
the amount they would need to invest in the child tax credit is 
$1.2 billion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK292"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin—St. George's, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise today to speak to the motion put forward 
by the member for Qu'Appelle which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemns the government for promoting an economy 
where a gap between the superrich and ordinary Canadian families 
is widening, risking the future of our youth, and strongly urges 
the government to introduce in the coming budget measures 
ensuring every Canadian an opportunity to share in a new 
prosperity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the timing of the resolution is very good when in a 
few days, February 24, the Minister of Finance will table the 
first budget in nearly 25 years, 16 of which the Liberal Party 
held power, in which the country's debt will not increase. That 
is a very compelling statement, that the Liberals have been in 
power 16 years of the last 25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party is urging this government to 
take immediate action to address a number of social and economic 
factors now facing Canadians.  We are asking the government to 
reverse the pattern of governing by reactionary measures, crisis 
management and economic tinkering that has become the norm for 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said before but I think it is worth repeating that 
Liberal governments do not plan to fail, they just fail to plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year's budget will be another example of what has become a 
Liberal tradition, no doubt. They will promise the voters the 
world and then not too long after we will see flip-flop after 
flip-flop after the positive media coverage has ended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Examples of Liberal flip-flops include scrapping the GST.  Now 
the Liberals claim that tax. The Prime Minister now claims the 
GST was his tax and is his tax.  They flip-flopped on 
renegotiating the NAFTA treaty.  They are now so keen on NAFTA 
that they want to expand and increase trade throughout the world. 
Of course we all remember the flip-flop of scrapping the Pearson 
airport redevelopment project.  Most recently, Canadians have 
been reminded about the flip-flop the Prime Minister has done on 
writing a cheque for zero helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all remember the Prime Minister saying how he was going to 
write zero to helicopters, zero helicopters. We know now the bill 
for Canadians.  We know now how big the cheque Canadians must 
write is for zero helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile Canadians have the highest personal income taxes among 
the G-7 nations.  Canadians have actually become poorer while the 
Liberals have been in office.  Disposable income among Canadians 
has decline by 1.3% since 1993 when this Liberal government came 
to power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I have another interesting statistic. The average 
American is now 25% richer than the average Canadian.  The 
average American manufacturing worker is paid $1 more than his or 
her Canadian counterpart. These are interesting facts and these 
things have taken place since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are preparing to 
announce the details of the new millennium scholarship fund next 
Tuesday afternoon, I am told.  We are going to get details from 
the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance next Tuesday 
afternoon on the new millennium scholarship fund.  Of course the 
government is hoping that this program will initiate the 
formation of the Prime Minister's legacy as the education Prime 
Minister.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality it is another Liberal gimmick.  They have 
inadequately addressed a major social and economic issue but have 
given the appearance that action has been taken.  They will not 
address the real issue here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The expected $3 billion scholarship fund represents just a small 
portion of what the Liberal government has cut from the cash 
portion of CHST payments to the provinces.  The Liberals have cut 
$17.3 billion from the cash portion of the CHST over the past 
five years.  Now they are going to invest $3 billion back into 
the system for a scholarship fund and they expect Canadians to 
congratulate them.  I am one who will not be congratulating the 
government on its reinvestment.  I am sure the people 
of Newfoundland and Labrador will not be congratulating 
it either.  They have watched the Minister of Finance cut our 
cash portion of the CHST from $419 million in 1993 down to $275 
million in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The students in Newfoundland and Labrador have felt these cuts 
as well.  A recent study by the maritime provinces higher 
education commission found the effects of the cuts to be 
devastating on Atlantic students.  In 1993 there were eight 
students in the Atlantic region with a student debtload of 
$30,000.  Today, thanks to the Liberal cutbacks which have forced 
universities to raise tuition fees and driven education costs 
higher, there are 904 students with a debtload greater than 
$30,000.  This administration should be proud of that, especially 
the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance.  What a statistic 
of failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarship fund as currently proposed will not 
solve the structural problem of student debt levels that are too 
high.  It will do nothing for students already in the Canada 
student loans system who are carrying huge debtloads.  So let us 
hope the Minister of Finance has some options and answers in his 
budget that will come down on the 24th. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should forget about making the millennium scholarship wholly 
contingent on marks and performance.  Eligibility for part of the 
scholarship should be based on financial need.  No one can argue 
that excellence is great but with the debt situation facing 
Canadian students today, access is better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada continues to have a youth unemployment rate of 15.9%. The 
Liberal policy to maintain high payroll taxes and high income 
taxes runs counter to the most basic of free market logic.  By 
reducing EI premiums to offset the CPP tax hike and lowering 
income taxes, this government could spur job creation.  Our party 
has called on the government to increase the basic income tax 
credit from $6,459 to $10,000 a year.  This would allow lower 
income families to have more disposable income which they could 
spend as they saw fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Finance is so worried about poor children and 
poor families he need look no further than his own tax system for 
the answer.  As the gentleman behind me said, if you tax people 
less, they won't be so poor.  That is something this Minister of 
Finance, this Prime Minister and this Liberal government have 
somehow forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To further strengthen the economic situation of Canadians, the 
Liberal government should re-evaluate its plan to overhaul the 
seniors benefit program, an issue that will soon be a very hot 
topic throughout this country.  The Liberals' current proposal is 
to abolish old age security, the pension income tax credit, the 
age credit and the guaranteed income supplement and replace them 
all with the new seniors benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This benefit will have a 20% clawback on incomes above $26,000. 
When combined with the existing marginal tax rates, this will 
result in a marginal tax rate of between 60% and 70% for middle 
income seniors. 
This will destroy any incentive to save for retirement and 
seriously discourage seniors from working even part time after 
retirement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A senior remaining in the labour force past 65 years of age 
could be working for as little as 30 cents on the dollar.  That 
is what the new seniors benefit will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very few seniors have any knowledge of these changes and what 
impact they will have.  Before long it will become perfectly 
clear what the impact will be.  I expect there will be tremendous 
pressure on the government to shelve the new seniors benefit 
package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major initiatives we have talked about, tax relief, 
protection of seniors benefits and student debt relief, will 
certainly foster economic growth and give the economic tools to 
all Canadians to prosper in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  If a number of 
members wish to ask questions and comments, I ask them to stand 
so that the Chair will have some idea of the number of members 
who want to rise on questions and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK293"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the member from Newfoundland on his very progressive 
speech.  I want to ask him a question about tax reform and trying 
to decrease the inequalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in October the revenue critic for the Reform Party said in 
the House that he thought millionaires were overtaxed, 
specifically that Conrad Black was overtaxed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he agree with his cousins in the Reform Party that 
millionaires are overtaxed, that Conrad Black pays too much in 
taxes?  Does he agree with his cousins in the Reform Party that 
they are overtaxed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Qu'Appelle for his question but I have to correct him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not that familiar with millionaires and the amount of tax 
they pay.  I must correct him on referring to members to my 
immediate left as cousins.  I assure him that I cannot speak for 
all the Conservative caucus but I can certainly speak for one. 
They are not cousins of mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe millionaires are too heavily taxed.  If there 
is anyone who can afford to pay more taxes it is millionaires. 
As I said, coming from the province I come from and particularly 
representing the riding of Burin—St. George's, which is 
devastated right now because of the downturn and collapse of our 
ground fishery, I do not have that worry about the taxes the 
millionaires of Burin—St. George's have to pay. 
<P><A NAME="LINK294"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to 
the member opposite in the Conservative Party speak earlier.  I 
understand the Mulroney years is something they want to put 
behind them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to relate my questions directly to two points.  Does the 
member opposite agree or disagree that when his party was in 
office it raised unemployment four times and that since this 
government has been in office it has been reduced three times? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, if I remember correctly, in the fall of 1993 the 
member opposite's party was forecasting the deficit to be around 
$30 million and it really came in at $42 million.  Does he agree 
that really happened and that over the four years we have been 
able to take that deficit close to zero and hopefully soon to 
zero? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B> Mr. Speaker, let me just say to the 
hon. member that the Mulroney government was not perfect. 
However, I have to remind him that neither is the present Liberal 
government close to perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal member reminded me the other day how bad the 
Conservative government was.  I said “Yes, in Canadians' wildest 
dreams they probably did not think they would see a government 
worse, but I am sorry to say they are seeing one right now 
sitting in the Chamber”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said initially in the first paragraph of my speech, for 25 
years the Liberals have been in power for 16 of the 25.  For the 
first time the budget will not see an increase in the country's 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look the hon. member straight in the face and say to him that 
he should say thank you for the Mulroney initiatives, the PC 
initiatives of GST and NAFTA.  Without them this finance minister 
would not be bringing in the budget on February 24 that he will 
bring in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sure hon. 
members would thank each other through the Chair.

We should ask ourselves some tough questions, considering that one 
Canadian child in five goes to school on an empty stomach. These 
children cannot do well in school, because they are hungry, and yet this 
in one of the richest countries in the world. There is a delayed impact, 
since these young people are not able to go to school and get a solid 
education. I wonder what kind of society we will have 20 years from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time is up, but I will get back to this issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have just a quick 
response for the Bloc member.  We are all very concerned about 
poverty.  It is a big problem in the country, particularly for 
children from poor families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just one comment to make.  If his party gets its way, I 
do not think it will do much to resolve the poverty situation. My 
prediction is that it will be much worse in his province than in 
other areas of the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK296"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
too commend the hon. member for Burin—St. George's on his 
speech.  I know he is not a cousin of the Reform Party.  I come 
from the island of Cape Breton and he comes from the island of 
Newfoundland.  I suppose we could refer to ourselves almost as 
cousins.  I should also indicate that I will be splitting my time 
with the hon. member for Churchill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the last speaker that those of us on the east coast, in 
Newfoundland, in Cape Breton, in New Brunswick and on Prince 
Edward Island understand perhaps too clearly the growing 
disparities in the country.  That is part of the reason we 
brought forward the motion we have today.  I am proud to speak to 
the motion on behalf of my party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The upcoming budget presents an opportunity for the government 
to address the very real economic challenge of how to stop the 
disparity, the growing inequality between the super rich whose 
incomes have increased and other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not only saying the poor, although we know the poorest of 
the poor continue their decline in income and in services.  Today 
we are seeing that even the middle class is shrinking.  We are 
seeing the middle class, young families and young single people 
working at part time jobs and trying to make ends meet.  We see 
young people who are at a point in their lives when they should 
be leaving home, getting apartments and setting up their own 
independence, and they cannot afford to do  it. They are staying 
at home with their parents who are seeing their own incomes 
shrink and their costs increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening is clearly the rich is getting richer and the 
vast majority of Canadians is getting poorer.  I am pleased to 
speak to this motion which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemns the government for promoting an economy 
where the gap between the super rich and ordinary Canadian 
families is widening, risking the future of our youth, strongly 
urges the government to introduce in the coming budget measures 
ensuring every Canadian an opportunity to share in a new 
prosperity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premier of Nova Scotia who called an election yesterday 
sometimes refers to members of our party as the doom and gloom 
people in his election rhetoric.  We are talking about the new 
prosperity in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a prosperous country.  We live in a country that is 
the envy in many ways of the world.  That is why it is so 
inexcusable to have this growing gap between the rich and the 
poor.  If the country were not as wealthy as it is, we could 
perhaps say our hands are tied and there is not much we can do. 
However, we live in a country with tremendous resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada I grew up in was one that guaranteed quality 
universal health care.  It was one that guaranteed quality 
affordable education to everyone.  Had it not been for that, I am 
not sure many of us could be in the House today. 
Many of us are the products of those very good social programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provided every citizen with an opportunity to earn a decent 
living, which is what Canadians want.  Most Canadians are happy 
to have a good job and a good paycheque.  They are not seeking to 
be millionaires.  They are seeking to provide for their families, 
to be able to send their children to university, and to ensure 
that what we give to the next generation is at least as good as 
what was given to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My parents' generation grew up in a country where they could 
make a good and decent living.  Each generation gave to the next 
hope and prosperity.  That prosperity and that hope are no longer 
shared by all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Qu'Appelle mentioned some statistics.  I 
will briefly refer to them because they are compelling statistics 
in this country of plenty.  Today in Canada over half a million 
children live in poverty.  The number of food banks in Canada has 
tripled and the proportion of the population relying on them has 
doubled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the first food bank in my community.  It was a small 
little church hall called Loaves & Fishes.  It was supposed to be 
a temporary measure to get us through a recession of a couple of 
years.  It began as churches were concerned about what they saw 
then, the growing number of poor.  They were ahead of their time. 
The growing number of poor has increased to the point now where 
in this country of plenty food banks are institutionalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member indicated that our caucus met with 
representatives of the food banks.  It is shocking to me that we 
now need a national organization representing people who run food 
banks.  It is reminiscent of the dirty thirties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, where I come from, unemployment 
continues to be double the national average.  This widening gap 
between the rich and the poor not only separates the population 
into classes.  It is beginning to divide the country along 
regional lines.  I indicated that those of us in Newfoundland and 
the east do not share in the prosperity of this new Canada which 
the government proclaims.  In my community that has meant a 
decrease in the population of young people.  In the last five 
years over 2,700 young people have left my community and will not 
come back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean for the growing gap between the rich and the 
poor?  It means that we have an older population and we do not 
have that youth and vitality creating new business, entering the 
workforce, purchasing, and creating jobs.  This is because of 
policies of the government that encourage a migrant workforce. 
Young people would hop the train in Cape Breton if we still had 
it, but we do not any more.  They rely on their thumb to get to 
somewhere else in the country where they might get a minimum wage 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party talks about Alberta and how it has done some 
wonderful things following a policy of lower taxes and supporting 
the very wealthy.  Many of the young people who leave my island 
end up in Calgary in a minimum wage job without a bed to sleep 
in, if it were not for shelters, because they cannot afford the 
housing costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are answers.  One of them would be to change the GST the 
government adopted.  The premier of Nova Scotia came to the 
government in November, although he supported the GST when he was 
on the Liberal benches.  He asked the Minister of Finance to take 
it off heating oil and electricity.  He failed in his request. 
That is one measure where we could have some progressive taxation 
policies by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of education, the comments from the member for 
Burin—St. George's echo the fact that more and more Atlantic 
Canadian students are simply not going to university.  When the 
government says that education is a great leveller it is not 
happening for many students in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the young people of this nation, I ask for support of our 
motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in favour of our motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts that helped balance the budget have been harmful to 
Canadians and will have longstanding negative effects.  We have 
seen the deconstruction of much of our social system in the fight 
against the deficit.  Billions of dollars were withdrawn from the 
social envelope before and after the introduction of the Canada 
health and social transfer in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equally serious was the loss of the Canada assistance plan. The 
war on the deficit was won largely on the backs of social 
programs. As a result, low and even middle income Canadians have 
borne the brunt of continued cuts to federal transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By offloading part of its responsibility for social expenditures 
on to the provinces, for example, forcing unemployed Canadians to 
turn to welfare, the government might have spent less but poverty 
problems remain the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government by its drastic cuts is ahead of schedule in its 
quest to balance the budget.  It has cut too deep, yet still not 
deep enough for the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform has in its ongoing fanatical statements called New 
Democrats communists because we believe that government should 
reinvest in social programs, called New Democrats communists, 
why? Because we want a caring, just society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from the Saturday <I>Star</I>: “Canadian church leaders 
have launched a prebudget letter writing campaign to urge the 
finance minister to live up to his word and make Canada a caring 
society. The letters plead with the minister to use the expected 
tax dividend from a budget surplus to combat poverty. The needy 
are now being marginalized and even abandoned by callous 
provincial governments such as Ontario's which are obsessed with 
pushing through big income tax breaks for high income 
Canadians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> states:  “Canadian religious leaders 
have launched an unprecedented challenge to the finance minister 
to live up to his own promise and make Canada a caring society. 
For the first time ever the Canadian Council of Churches, the 
Evangelical Fellowship of Canada and the Reform Council of 
Judaism are together urging the Liberal government to launch a 
campaign against poverty in its February budget”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if these church leaders know that the Reform Party 
considers them communists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote the Caledon Institute of Social Policy: “Ottawa 
now has a wonderful opportunity to reinvest and rebuild not the 
social system of the past but the better and new system of the 
future, geared to the economy and society facing us in the next 
century.  It is time to reinvest in making Canada a better place 
to live for all Canadians in a fair chance for all Canadian 
children, in healthier, safer communities and in reducing the 
growing inequality that threatens to turn our country into two 
nations, the invidious two nations of affluent and poor.  It is 
time to reinvest the peace dividend from the war against the 
deficit and build the social base of our country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues from the NDP and I share this belief that it is 
time to reinvest in social programs.  The coming budget should 
introduce measures to ensure every Canadian the opportunity to 
share in a new prosperity through renewed investment in health 
care, education and other vital programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gap between the super rich and ordinary Canadian families is 
widening.  Since 1989 that gap has grown.  Average family incomes 
have fallen by roughly 5%. The number of poor children grew by 
47%.  The number of Canadians filing for personal bankruptcy has 
tripled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in my early teens I read an article in which Mother 
Teresa was being interviewed. The journalist asked Mother Teresa 
what she would do about poverty.  Her response was that 
government should look after poverty and she would look after the 
poor.  Mother Teresa will always be with us through her efforts 
in spirit and there will be those who continue to look after the 
poor, but this government appears to have given up on the war on 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young Canadians do not have much to look forward to.  Youth 
unemployment is high at 16.5% last month.  That is a lot of young 
persons whose first experience in the job market is no job.  The 
reward for young graduates of university or college is not a 
decent job.  It is a debt of $25,000 to $30,000.  Affordability 
should be a national standard for education.  Young people 
deserve the opportunity to learn, to develop skills, to build a 
future.  We cannot afford to risk their future or ours by wasting 
their talents or by creating more financial barriers to 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youth unemployment deeply affects my riding in Manitoba.  The 
average age of the aboriginal population is 10 years younger than 
the general population.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We welcome the government's statement of reconciliation, but 
this is only the first step.  Young people in my riding and 
elsewhere in Canada deserve a better future.  We are hoping that 
with the coming budget we will see concrete actions to improve 
the lives of young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable that most aboriginal people are at or below 
the poverty line.  In major western cities four times as many 
aboriginals as other citizens are below the poverty line. 
Unemployment does not only affect young people.  It affected 8.9% 
of Canadians last month. But the official unemployment rate is 
just the tip of the iceberg of Canada's job crisis.  Hundreds and 
thousands of Canadians have simply given up looking for work. 
When people give up looking, they are no longer included in the 
workforce.  As far as Statistics Canada is concerned, they 
disappear from the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that with so many unemployed people in Canada, the 
lucky ones who have jobs are working overtime.  Statistics Canada 
published a document entitled “Hours of Work”.  It documents 
the extent of total overtime work including unpaid overtime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any given week in the first three months of 1997, almost one 
in five, 18.6% of employees, worked overtime defined as time 
worked in excess of scheduled hours.  On average, these workers 
put in almost nine additional hours, the equivalent of more than 
an extra day per week.  The worst in this is that more overtime 
was unpaid than was paid.  In any given week, 10.7% of employees 
worked unpaid overtime while 8.4% worked paid overtime and how 
interesting to find out that the unpaid overtime is particularly 
prevalent in the public services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another sad trend in the job market is multiple job holdings.  A 
lot of Canadians need to work more than one job to afford the 
necessities of life.  Five per cent of our labour force holds 
more than one job.  A labour force survey shows that multiple job 
holders average more than 46 hours per week, this while the CEOs 
of some companies are bringing home enormous pay raises while 
their employees are struggling to make ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The richer are getting richer and ordinary Canadians are getting 
poorer.  This is the Liberal legacy into the new millennium. 
There is no question that history should show the reign of the 
Liberals as the decline of a just and caring society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened very carefully to my colleague from the NDP. 
Canadians know that maintaining a strong economy and providing 
opportunities is really critical for social success and for the 
success of so many of the issues she brought to the fore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She did give us a whole list of grievances and things that are 
wrong in Canadian society and in the economy, but she did not 
give us any suggestions as to how we can deal with those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so very easy to give us a long list of what is wrong or 
what she thinks is wrong.  I wonder if she could tell us what is 
the NPD's position in the whole series of things that would help 
the economy, like NDP policy on trade promotion, NDP policy on 
access for small business enterprises, technology partnerships. 
Can she tell us the NDP's suggestions to the government as to 
what we can do to ensure that we give the economy the kind of 
energy it needs in order to respond to the whole list of issues 
she has outlined? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think the NDP 
has ever shirked from coming up with an alternative approach. 
Number one in our position has always been that the tax system in 
Canada is unfair.  We do not believe we need to totally tax the 
horribly rich and everybody else does not want to pay their fair 
share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to pay their fair share for education, for 
health, for transportation, for social programs.  What they do 
not want to pay for are things like an unfair tax system when one 
of Canada's supposedly finest, an Order of Canada recipient, 
transferred to relatives or turned over his assets into cash. 
The process involved more than just houses, cottages, mortgages, 
small commercial investments and condominium lots. Eagleson has 
also been selling furniture for many years.  He collected 
valuable antiques for his office, depreciating them by 20% each 
year and then, when they were no longer deemed worth anything on 
paper, moving them into his homes.  The Eaglesons furnished their 
Rosedale houses from 1976 to 1997. 
They have owned three pieces of English Gregorian mahogany 
furniture which were described by one of the experts as being 
high quality for Toronto.

the hon. parliamentary secretary. 
<P><A NAME="LINK299"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there 
probably will be time because I intend to be brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like to set the record straight for me and, I am 
sure, on behalf of my party.  I can put some distance between me 
and the name calling which the hon. member claimed.  It is false 
and I disagree with her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many good friends who have an NDP philosophy.  We have 
many good discussions.  In fact some of them have more respect 
for me than I deserve.  That is wonderful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of them said he voted for me because he thought I was worthy 
of the vote.  I was very honoured by that.  There were many NDP 
people in my riding who voted for Reform because they believed 
that our way of dealing compassionately with people in need is 
the better long term solution, and that is to give people 
personal integrity, more ability to help themselves and to help 
others by having smaller government and reducing taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the member to try to put rhetoric aside and answer 
this question.  It is a very serious question.  The fact is when 
we have so much debt we are really taking all the taxpayers' 
money and one-third of the money that we take from them we 
transfer to the rich, namely the banks, the investment houses and 
so on, in terms of the interest payments on the amount we owe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely she, as an NDP member, must be opposed to that transfer 
to the rich.  I would like her response to that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no question 
that the hon. member has just stated my point.  The tax system 
has traditionally been unfair.  It allows the very wealthy, 
through numerous loopholes, to not pay their fair share.  As a 
result the rest of us ordinary Canadians are going to work and, 
without any grudge whatsoever, are willing to pay for education 
and health care. We are giving our dollars to the government and 
we expect it to deal with our dollars fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not mean we want to give up education, health care and 
social programs.  It means that we want this government to be 
held accountable.  It does not mean we do not want those 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How on earth would Reform expect a country to survive if nobody 
but nobody paid for anything whatsoever to help each other?

country, and then we heard the doom and gloom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member a question on a specific item.  I do 
not want her to go all over the place with her answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not clear on her comments with respect to overtime.  Is it 
her position that there should be no overtime?

put our fiscal house in order.  Interest rates are at historic 
lows and our inflation rate is among the lowest in the 
industrialized world.  From a trade standpoint, we are one of the 
most open economies in the world.  We have many improvements to 
make in terms of trade.  We must get into the details and make 
sure the rules of trade are well understood and applied.

all understand that.  We must mobilize our resources toward a 
clear objective of being the best in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Parliament convened in September, our government set out 
its priorities for seizing the opportunities presented by the new 
economy.  Our priorities focused on setting the conditions to 
create jobs and wealth in economic sectors ranging from high 
technology to services and primary resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our key goals is to make Canada the most connected 
country in the world and to make sure Canadians have access to

the most connected nation in the world, we will be helping youth, 
workers and firms acquire the skills needed for the knowledge 
economy.  Improving competitiveness and productivity of Canadian 
firms in all sectors of the economy is most important. It is a 
real must that we make Canada a choice location for investment 
and create new markets and opportunities in a global economy. We 
must open these opportunities to our rural areas and the remote 
areas of our country.  This includes our aboriginal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Connecting Canadians will allow us to build from strength.  It 
is well recognized that we have the overall best communications 
infrastructure among the G-7 nations.  We are among the leaders 
in terms of penetration, quality, market development and rates. 
We have the lowest rates in the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Connecting Canadians will also redefine how governments provide 
services and interact with citizens.  It will open new ways for 
citizens to express their views in a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Connecting Canadians has a strong social, cultural and unity 
element.  It brings citizens together from coast to coast to 
coast in either official language.  It gives our creative

</I></B></P><P align=left>Another initiative is SchoolNet.  By the year 1999 this joint 
program with the provincial governments and the private sector 
will make Canada the first country in the world to have all its 
schools and libraries connected to the Internet.  SchoolNet is 
also about content and connecting Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our SchoolNet web site includes a collection of Internet based 
educational services and resources for both teachers and 
students.  It includes career guides and university and college 
course calendars, information readily available at their homes. 
There are thousands of teacher designed projects and lesson plans 
and virtual tours of institutions that range from the Louvre to 
the Canadian Museum of Civilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The SchoolNet digital collections program is also training young 
Canadians to provide innovative education material on line.  To 
date, young Canadians across the country have participated in 
projects to digitize some 180 collections of historical and 
cultural significance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Computers for schools is another initiative.  Working in 
partnership with provincial governments and private sector 
partners, including the Telephone Pioneers, we are recycling used 
computers in schools and libraries. Later today the Prime 
Minister will celebrate the delivery of the 50,000th computer 
under this program.  We have challenged corporate Canada to help 
us reach a target of some 250,000 computers by the year 2000. 
This program will allow people from all walks of life to have 
access to computers and to be able to learn about computers at a 
very young age.  This is a must for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The student connection program will hire 2,000 university and 
college students to help some 50,000 small and medium size 
businesses get connected to the Internet and train them how to 
use the Internet for their business. Many of the SMEs are 
learning that by being more flexible and being able to use the 
Internet they are actually getting into more business and more 
exports. The students have the opportunity to earn wages to 
defray their education costs while gaining valuable work 
experience with a community business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another initiative designed to help Canadian youth find jobs is 
the national graduate register.  This Internet database is 
already becoming a valuable way for young people to post their 
resumés and for employers to find the skilled young people they 
need.  It is getting more than 32,000 hits per day.  May I repeat 
that it is getting 32,000 hits a day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the months ahead Canadians can look forward to new 
initiatives to expand our agenda for connecting Canadians and to 
build on the successes we have achieved and the partnerships we 
have forged with the provinces and with private enterprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is well on its way to becoming a world-class connected 
country.  We are accelerating our efforts to be the best in the 
world.  Connecting Canadians is an integrated package where the 
whole is greater than the sum of its components and each element 
helps build the capacity of the others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agenda will enable Canada to be the recognized and 
acknowledged as the most connected country in the world.  It will 
enable us to create new opportunities for learning and cultural 
expression, job creation and economic growth; economic growth by 
being aware and being right up to date on trade around the world, 
being up to date on technology around the world, and being closely 
connected with research being done around the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to add a commentary with respect to the comments made by 
the previous speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke in detail about connecting Canadians. I would like to 
inform him that this morning I connected with some Canadians. I 
connected with some Canadians on the grounds outside this House. 
They were members of the Ottawa-Carleton Health Coalition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are very concerned about the cuts in health care 
and the effect on the medicare system.  Their theme was to put 
the heart back into medicare.  This gathering was intended to 
attract members of Parliament, to have them there to hear the 
concerns.  I did not notice too many members of Parliament but 
certainly those of us who were there did hear the concerns of 
connecting in a real way with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all well and good to talk about technology and connecting 
Canadians through technology.  I note that the hon. member 
mentioned 32,000 hits a day.  To me that would certainly 
illustrate the high degree of unemployment and the high degree of 
need out there if 32,000 people a day are trying to contact 
people through this computer system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the hon. member's comments with respect to 
connecting with Canadians in a way that deals with restoring 
medicare funding to the provinces to the previous level, 
enforcing the provisions of the Canada Health Act and the 
elimination of C-91 so as to reduce the cost of prescription 
drugs.  How does the government intend to connect with Canadians 
in that way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure the member 
opposite understands when there are 32,000 hits a day those are 
not only people looking for jobs, but employers searching the web 
to interview people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is happening today.  Employers, whenever they have 
time to search the Internet, scan it to get resumés and 
information on people who are looking for jobs.  It makes it 
easier for them. We put it in place so that the people looking 
for jobs and the employers who are going to hire the people can 
do so very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the matter of C-91 we are in a period where information is 
required.  The regulations have been gazetted.  We have another 
two weeks to go before the end of the gazetting.  I make it very 
clear that the C-91 debate was held openly. Almost 200 witnesses 
were in attendance.  The member's party was absent most of the 
time.  As far as I am concerned there was very little attendance 
by his party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since I 
started to speak, I thought there might have been another motion. 
I thought we were going to debate poverty, offer solutions, and see 
the government perhaps react to some of the suggestions we made to 
it during the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that the hon. member across the floor has named several 
government programs, and that is exactly what we deplore, the fact 
that there have been $42 billion in cuts to provincial transfer 
payments for social assistance, health and education.  At the same 
time, that same government is going to interfere in those same 
areas, which are provincial areas of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask the hon. member if it would not be desirable for the 
provinces to be given back the amounts taken from them in the 
shameful cuts that have been made at the expense of the most 
disadvantaged members of the population, and of the population as 
a whole. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I see the member wants it 
both ways.  Get involved but do not get involved. 
During the election it was made very clear that 50% would go 
against the debt and tax reduction and 50% would be spent on 
social programs and targeted programs for the good of Canadians, 
and that is the program for the government.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>LOUIS RIEL DAY 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK305"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK306">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
revoke the verdict of “guilty of high treason” pronounced on Louis 
Riel on August 1, 1885, and commemorate him by declaring November 
16 of each year to be Louis Riel Day throughout Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, this motion is to stress the importance of 
Louis Riel and his role in the fight for the rights of the Metis, 
francophones and westerners in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very much an issue, as the importance of resolving the Louis 
Riel issue was recognized in the Statement of Reconciliation between the 
federal government and the aboriginal peoples published on January 7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, in this statement, the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development wrote, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No attempt at reconciliation with Aboriginal people can be 
complete without reference to the sad events culminating in the 
death of Métis leader Louis Riel. 
These events cannot be undone; however, we can and will continue to 
look for ways of affirming the contributions of Métis people in 
Canada and of reflecting Louis Riel's proper place in Canada's 
history. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like these fine words to be more than just talk for a 
change. Ever since coming to this place, I have been making 
representations to move the issue along and hopefully resolve the issue 
of Louis Riel's unfair conviction by moving, to date, four bills and one 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each time, the government and the Liberal members of this place 
lauded my good intentions but defeated my every initiative. Each time, 
they said it was important something be done without ever specifying 
what this something should be or when it should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some even stooped to party politics, urging Metis groups not to 
support these initiatives on account of the fact they were put forward 
by a Bloc Quebecois member. 
They promised them that they would act. I would not play that game and 
publicly stated, on television, that I would support any initiative to 
fully clear Louis Riel. I also offered to withdraw my private member's 
bill as soon as a government bill was introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Liberal government would rather continue playing its 
hypocritical game. This government claims to be open to all cultures, 
boasts about understanding and representing all Canadians, drafts 
statements of reconciliation with aboriginal peoples, but at the same 
time continues to ignore Metis demands in refusing to pardon and clear 
Louis Riel.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All parties in the House, however, say they want to pardon 
Louis Riel, and the list of their efforts to do so over the past 15 
years is a long one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1983 and 1984, two bills were introduced by the 
Conservative member for Edmonton East, Mr. Yurko.  In 1984, two 
bills were introduced by the NDP member for Regina—Lumsden, Mr. 
Benjamin.  In November 1985, on the 100th anniversary of Louis 
Riel's death by hanging, the Liberal member for Edmonton East, now 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage, also called for Louis Riel's 
pardon.  In 1987, a bill was introduced by the NDP member for 
Kamloops, Mr. Riis. 
In 1989, the NDP member for Comox—Alberni, Mr. Skelly, introduced 
a motion calling for Louis Riel to be recognized as one of the 
Fathers of Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, the biannual Liberal Party convention passed a 
resolution concerning Louis Riel but, in 1997, it voted against a 
bill introduced by a Bloc member.  On March 9, 1992, the House of 
Commons unanimously passed a motion introduced by the then Minister 
responsible for Constitutional Affairs, Joe Clark, a Conservative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Clark's motion, while highly laudable, was only a first 
step towards Louis Riel's pardon.  Although the motion recognized 
Riel's role as the founder of Manitoba, it referred only briefly to 
his death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet Riel led the same fight for the rights of Saskatchewans as 
he did for Manitobans. 
The only difference between these two struggles was that, in 1884 
and 1885, the federal government decided to send in the army rather 
than negotiate with the population, thus causing a bloody 
confrontation, which culminated in the rigged trial of Riel and his 
death by hanging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treatment of Louis Riel is a very powerful symbol for the 
Métis people.  With his death, the Métis lost all their rights, and 
recognition of these rights is inextricably linked with restoring 
their dignity.  For, beyond land and monetary claims, a people's 
pride is bound up with their culture and history.  Only a full 
pardon for Louis Riel will restore his honour and begin the healing 
process for the Métis people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of our viewers and of my colleagues who are 
new to Parliament, I will provide a brief portrait of Louis Riel so 
they may understand why, 113 years after his death and 154 years 
after his birth, this man is still the subject of so much talk.  By 
the way, there is a snow sculpture at the exit just opposite 
Parliament of Louis Riel by the artist who did the statue of Louis 
Riel that is now behind the Manitoba legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was born in St. Boniface on October 22, 1844, the son of 
Jean-Louis Riel, whose grandmother was a Chipewa, and Julie de 
Lagimodière, whose mother was Indian.  He was the oldest of a 
family of 11 and was sent to school at the Petit Séminaire de 
Montréal between 1858 and 1865.  He was a gifted student, always 
the first in his class.  He learned Greek, Latin, French, English 
and Cree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1866, he returned to the Red River region and arrived in 
St. Boniface in July 1868.  On his return, he discovered strong 
animosity between the newly arrived English Protestant colonists 
wanting to control the colony with the help of the central 
government and the Metis, French Catholics and English settlers 
already there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That same year, the federal government bought the rights over 
the western territories from the Hudson's Bay Company. 
Unfortunately, it did not bother preparing the way for the change 
the jurisdiction and waiting for the inhabitants' approval of the 
new policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, the 10,000 Metis in the Red River region lived as 
an independent people.  They traded with the States more than they 
did with Canada.  When their land was handed over to people in the 
east without any notice, their national pride was sorely hurt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation was exacerbated by the arrival of the government 
surveyors, who imposed the new arrangement arrogantly, dividing up 
the lands, keeping the best for themselves or their friends and 
intimating that the legitimate owners would soon have to hand over 
their farms to the English colonists from the east.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Métis decided to defend themselves, calling upon 21-year- 
old Louis David Riel, whom they trusted, to lead them.  Riel took 
up the cause of his compatriots, protested against the surveyors' 
actions, and made claims against the federal Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1869, the Hudson's Bay Company ceased to 
administer the country.  Louis Riel then formed a provisional 
government, with Métis, English and French members, which was later 
approved by the cabinet in Ottawa.  The federal government promised 
complete amnesty and compliance with the Métis' demands, but those 
promises were never kept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strong action on the part of Riel and the Métis and their list 
of rights forced the federal government of the day to grant 
provincial status to part of this territory, namely the district of 
Assiniboine, rather than make the west a mere territory under a 
governor appointed by Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1870 Manitoba Act conferred bilingual status on the 
province's laws and courts, a dual denominational school system, 
and a legislative council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1871, supporters of annexation with the U.S. 
crossed the border and seized the post of Pembina.  Riel recruited 
and organized a company of armed horsemen to defend the borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1872, Riel had a $5,000 price put on his head; he was 
accused of the murder of Thomas Scott, who had been sentenced to 
death by the provisional government.  This forced him into exile in 
the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1873, Riel was elected to represent Provencher, and 
went to plead his case at Ottawa. 
This became impossible because he was under the threat of death or 
arrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he was re-elected in February 1874, Riel went to Ottawa. 
He entered Parliament on March 30, disguised in a hood and escorted 
by the member for Rimouski, Jean-Baptiste-Romuald Fiset, and signed 
the register.  He was expelled under a motion tabled by the Ontario 
Orangemen.  In September 1874, he was again re-elected for 
Provencher, but was expelled from the House a second time.  In 
February 1875, Prime Minister Mackenzie granted him amnesty, 
provided he went into exile for five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1876, Riel was committed, first in Montreal and then in 
Quebec City, for hallucinations, believing he had been entrusted 
with a divine mission to defend the Métis.  He returned west in 
1878. In 1881, he settled in Montana, where he married Marguerite 
Monet and fathered three children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1880 on, the Métis sent numerous petitions to the federal 
government, which was delaying the return of titles to their 
properties. 
The Métis were afraid of losing their lands to Canadian Pacific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1884, the Métis and Indians of Saskatchewan called on Riel 
to help them defend their rights, as he had done so well for the 
people of Manitoba in 1869.  Faced with the Conservative 
government's apathy, the Métis decided to take action to end their 
economic woes.  They created a small republic and launched a 
peaceful protest to have it recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 16, 1884, representatives of the people of 
Saskatchewan sent the federal government a 25-clause petition 
setting out their claims and grievances.  They requested permission 
to sent delegates to Ottawa to defend their rights.  These 
representatives would be able to conclude an agreement for the 
eventual entry of their territory, as a province, into 
Confederation. 
At that time, Saskatchewan had 60,000 inhabitants, and Manitoba had 
12,000 at the time of its entry into Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reaction of the central government to the reasonable 
claims of Saskatchewans was to send in the army to subdue them, in 
order to be able to hand over their lands to the railway companies 
and colonists from the east.  Since the federal government was 
losing interest in their cause, the Métis and Indians rose up and 
won a few victories, but the troops sent by Ottawa defeated Riel at 
Batoche and regained control of the territory.  Riel was taken 
prisoner on May 15, 1885. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 16, 1885, at the age of 41, Louis David Riel, hero 
of the Métis, was hanged, after a trial marked by irregularities. 
In December, at the insistence of his family, his body was moved 
to Saint-Vital in Manitoba and buried in the cemetery of the 
Saint-Boniface cathedral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because justice was not fully done in the case of Louis Riel, 
I have, since being elected to Parliament, introduced bills and 
this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 10, 1996, my bill was defeated by a slim majority 
of 112 to 103.  This remarkable support, despite the party line 
imposed by the Liberal government, is a clear indication that there 
are a growing number of members in the House who recognize the 
validity of Louis Riel's cause.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last two decades, the issue of Louis Riel and the 
recognition that he deserves have often been raised in this House. Given 
his great involvement in the building of this country, it would 
certainly be appropriate to better highlight his role as a builder of 
our nation and founder of the Metis movement. Such recognition would go 
a long way toward giving Louis Riel a status more in line with his 
remarkable achievements. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government continues to expend time and energy to find ways 
to heal the unfortunate events of the past while also trying to 
find appropriate ways to honour Louis Riel's memory in

truly pay homage to one who warrants such recognition. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Riel was a unique person, who deserves to be remembered for 
everything he did for Canada and for the Metis nation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Riel was educated in theology and law.  He was fluent in 
English, French, Greek, Latin and Cree.  He was an elegant and 
polished statesman who directed the negotiations with the 
Government of Canada on the entry of Manitoba and the Northwest 
Territories into the Dominion of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was a tireless defender of the rights of Metis and of all the 
other residents of the territories. It was his hope to see them take 
their place in Canadian society and enjoy the same rights and privileges 
as all other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Riel's leadership, the Metis from the Red River adopted, in 
1870, a list of rights to be protected—freedom of religion, language 
rights, minority rights. They used that list during the negotiations 
with the Government of Canada to have Rupert's Land and the Northwest

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Manitoba Act which Riel was instrumental in negotiating 
provided for certain guarantees for Metis people, including 
schooling and religious rights as well as recognition of French 
and English language rights.  The rights of other citizens were 
also clearly set out in the list of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was Riel's vision of a united country with each citizen 
participating on an equal footing. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After Manitoba joined the Canadian federation, the constituents of 
Provencher, in that same province, elected Riel by acclamation, on three 
occasions, as their member of Parliament in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Metis also called on him to ensure the respect of their 
fundamental rights in the part of the Northwest Territories that later 
became Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Louis Riel dedicated his life to protecting the Metis, and he paid 
the ultimate price for leading a movement to have the rights and the 
interests of the Metis protected. He understood their concerns, and it 
was clear in his mind what place they were entitled to in the Canadian 
federation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As most in the House would agree, Riel's accomplishments and 
contributions to the building of this nation as a free, 
independent and united country are many.  Given these significant 
contributions, governments have over the years honoured Riel in a 
number of ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1970 a postage stamp was issued in his commemoration. 
Cultural performances have been funded over the years, including 
the back to Batoche days celebrations which Metis view as a 
sacred event.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 10, 1992, a special resolution was passed in this

founder of Manitoba and his contribution to Confederation.

commemoration, at Winterlude, our winter festival here, which is 
moving into its second weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People here saw 12 blocks of snow on the grounds in front of 
Parliament Hill at the start of the week.  Some joked that it was 
a winter depiction of the caucus of the member for Rimouski—Mitis,

magnificent sculptures representing the provinces and territories. 
The statue sculpted to honour Manitoba was a bust of Louis Riel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage everyone in the national capital region to come 
and see these sculptures over the weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These sorts of positive and progressive measures are the way 
we honour the memory of Louis Riel.  They have the support of all 
Canadians and bear true witness to his contribution to the building 
of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 7 of this year the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development and the Minister of Natural Resources of 
Canada unveiled “Gathering Strength—Canada's Aboriginal Action 
Plan”.  This action plan provides a solid framework through 
which we can make greater progress on the serious problems facing 
all aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the important themes of “Gathering Strength” was 
healing and reconciliation.  In that regard the federal 
government committed to seeking appropriate ways of affirming the 
contribution of Metis people in Canada and of reflecting Louis 
Riel's place in Canada's history. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in these ways that the government will continue to work 
closely with the Metis leaders and the descendants of Louis Riel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government intends to continue the dialogue it has already 
begun with the Metis leaders to find a way to resolve the problem 
of the guilty verdict given Louis Riel. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Louis Riel was an eloquent, articulate defender of Metis rights, 
as well as those of all members of the community whether 
aboriginal or non-aboriginal, anglophone or francophone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Metis people formed a substantial part of the population 
then and Louis Riel championed the rights of minority groups. 
Riel believed in the Metis having equal rights and participation 
within Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear on one thing.  He was never an advocate of 
separation.  He did not want to tear the country apart.  Rather 
he gave his life trying to build it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the real purpose of this measure is to enhance the stature of 
Louis Riel in the minds and hearts of Canadians, there are many 
positive measures we can and will take.  We will find ways to 
show Canadians from all walks of life how much we honour the 
memory of Louis Riel and recognize and appreciate his 
contributions to the development of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind hon. members of the resolution adopted in 1992 by the 
House.  It recognized the unique and historic role of Louis Riel 
as the founder of Manitoba and his contribution to the 
development of Confederation.  This was an important moment in 
the annals of Metis history as the resolution was overwhelmingly 
adopted by the House and, equally important, because the 
resolution was the product of significant consultation with the 
Metis community. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever decision we make on a matter of this importance must 
be acceptable to the descendants of Louis Riel and to the Metis 
people. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that by working together with Riel's descendants and 
the Metis leadership we will find an appropriate solution to this 
important matter. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to thank the member for Rimouski—Mitis for 
her persistence and constancy in this matter.  One day we 
will together all find a way to more fully and faithfully honour 
the memory and the legacy of that great individual, Louis Riel.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to the motion of the hon. member of the Bloc 
Party.  The motion calls for the 113 year old verdict on Louis 
Riel for being guilty of high treason to be revoked.  In 
addition, the motion like past ones before it calls for a 
commemorative day each year in honour of the man Louis Riel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly this is an emotional issue for some people on both sides 
of the debate.  Some say he was a hero who was justified in his 
cause.  Others argue that he was largely self-serving and he went 
too far in pursuing a cause and a personal vision of himself. 
Each side quotes facts and data which serve to embellish their 
case and wrap them in an emotionally appealing package.  This can 
be an emotional issue because as Canadians we want to have our 
own Canadian heroes.  We need them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are patriotic.  We may not wear it on our sleeves like 
our American neighbours, but if one scratches even a bit below 
the surface there is a bright red, passionate Canadian heart 
beating.  Being Canadian means something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my most enjoyable duties as a new member of Parliament of 
this great House is to attend citizenship court in my riding. 
After the ceremony I embrace our new citizens and ask them what 
their citizenship is.  I have seen tears of gratitude and hope 
well up in their eyes when for the first time they say “I am a 
Canadian”.  It is a powerful moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of being a Canadian is that we demand our heroes to be 
real, for their stories to have integrity.  We intrinsically know 
they must be out there, these Canadian heroes, and I believe 
there is a desire to know them better, to know their stories. 
Somehow I feel their stories have been kept from us.  We do not 
celebrate them as we could and, I suggest, for the strength of 
our nation as we should.  All this in spite of the millions we 
spend on Canadian culture and heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that some prefer their tax dollars be used to fund 
cultural products that appeal to the arts community such as a 
recent Canadian movie that documented a fictional tragedy, made 
all the more tragic by a subplot of incest and sexual perversion. 
Some seem to think this type of art is good for Canada.  It is 
not my preference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, I prefer a greater focus on our heritage and culture. 
The money of government ministries should go to portraying the 
history and positive real life stories of men and women who gave 
so much to this country and the world.  With this we would all be 
inspired and stand a little taller when we say “I am a 
Canadian”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Louis Riel, why not Jean de Brébeuf whose ability with 
languages allowed him to communicate with ease with the Huron 
Indians?  He assimilated into their culture.  Brébeuf composed 
the first dictionary and grammar of the Huron language.  During a 
small pox scourge Brébeuf stayed behind helping the sick Hurons 
while an Iroquois war party approached.  The few Huron Indians 
who escaped witnessed his torturous death and the story of his 
courage and service impacted on the lives of thousands of Huron 
Indians in years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve, the founder of Ville 
Marie on the island of Montreal in 1642?  Maisonneuve was a 
revered leader who governed wisely and kept order in a growing 
colony for 23 years.  Interestingly he ordered brawlers to pay 
the medical bills of their victims and slanderers to praise each 
other in public.  He sounds like a Reformer to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Or, more recently, in the early part of this century, Mr. 
Georges Vanier.  At this time I would like to quote an article by 
Mr. George Cowley contained in a forthcoming publication 
<I>Canada Portraits of Faith</I>.  He records: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. George Vanier was a man that, when the first world war broke 
out, felt that his immediate duty was to his country.  He took 
the leading role in recruiting and organizing a first battalion 
to be raised by and of French Canadians: the Royal 22nd Regiment, 
the Van Doos.  Shortly after, he lost his right leg to a German 
shell.  After convalescing, he refused evacuation.  “I simply 
cannot go back to Canada,” he insisted, “while my (Canadian) 
comrades are still in the trenches in France”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(After a very distinguished career, Vanier) retired from 
diplomatic service in 1954, hoping to continue serving Canada in 
“some modest capacity”.  The capacity offered him in 1959, at 
age 71, was to become Canada's governor general, the first Quebec 
native so honoured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In early 1967, Vanier's heart showed signs of weakening.  His 
last official engagement was to address, from his wheelchair, a 
delegation of students from the University of Montreal on the 
favourite theme of his latter years: the importance of Canadian 
unity.  Few figures in Canadian history have been better 
demonstrated, by words and deeds, the urgency and sacredness of 
this cause.  “The measure of Canadian unity has been the measure 
of our success—if we imagine we can go our separate ways within 
our country, if we exaggerate our differences and revel in 
contentions—we will only promote our own destruction. 
Canada owes it to the world to remain united, for no lesson is 
more badly needed than the one our unity can supply:  the lesson 
that diversity need not be the cause for conflict, but, on the 
contrary, may lead to richer and nobler living. I pray to God 
that we may go forward hand in hand”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many more Canadian heroes that we all need to know 
more about.  It would serve to strengthen our passion and resolve 
to stand on guard for our great nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thankful that people like Michael Clarke of Reel to Real 
Ministries from Chilliwack, B.C. whose publication I mentioned 
earlier “Portraits of Faith” provides accurate insights into 
the lives of many Canadian heroes. This publication will

</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Mr. Louis Riel, he was no doubt a passionate man and 
worked to see that the west had an independent voice within 
Confederation but his tactics were outside the law. We can 
recognize that some good was brought about through his life, as 
it is with every human life, but as Canadians we have a great 
deal of history to celebrate without having to rewrite it. The 
pen that rewrites history will always be driven by today's 
biases.  It is better not to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fellow Canadians, we have much to be thankful for.  In fact, 
we have an obligation to celebrate the strengths of this great 
nation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK309"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of the Metis treatment by the Canadian government is 
appalling.  While we generally support the concept of this 
motion, and I want to commend the hon. member for bringing forth 
a motion concerning the recognition of Louis Riel, we would have 
preferred a much stronger and differently worded motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion specifically addresses the verdict of high treason 
pronounced on Louis Riel on August 1, 1885.  In effect what this 
motion would do by revoking the verdict of guilty of high treason 
would be to pardon the federal government for its abominable 
treatment of Louis Riel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately what the motion fails to do is to address the 
substantive issues which continue to oppress Metis today and 
continue to threaten their children tomorrow.  This motion would 
in effect pardon the federal government by removing the blot on 
the government's own record while doing nothing concrete to 
change the lives of the Metis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The First Nations peoples continue to be treated by government 
as second class citizens and that would place the Metis families 
at an even lower caste in the government's eyes.  The federal 
government, even after the release of the Royal Commission on 
Aboriginal Peoples report, continues to do its very best to 
ignore Metis and place their concerns far on the back burner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether or not Louis Riel day is proclaimed, the government 
should commit to several fundamentals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost this government should recognize that the 
Metis nation is entitled legally, morally and politically to have 
access to land bases and land use rights sufficient to fulfil the 
Metis nation's legitimate aspirations as aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore as my colleague the hon. member for Churchill River 
who himself is Metis would argue, one of the first steps the 
government should take is to bring all aboriginal peoples, 
including the Metis, under section 91(24) of the Constitution 
Act.  Such a move on behalf of this government would truly show 
to the Metis that the government is sincere in supporting a 
bright future for these people instead of trying to deny them 
both their history and their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of treating the Metis as an afterthought, the government 
should negotiate self-government and land claims with the Metis 
nation on a nation to nation basis.  Furthermore why does the 
government not negotiate with the Metis how they will exercise 
their aboriginal rights to harvest fish and wildlife?  Why has 
this government not chosen to ensure the Metis have the benefits 
of programs and services which governments now allocate to First 
Nations peoples? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as this government tries to deny Metis their historic 
and moral rights, this government will continue to actively 
condemn Metis to poverty and to the back of the legislative bus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the negotiation of Manitoba's entry into Confederation, a 
grant of 1.4 million acres of land was reserved for the exclusive 
use of the Metis.  The full creation of a Metis land base was 
undermined by systemic government delays and neglect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The points that I have called for are not new.  Indeed it is a 
fact that these very proposals sit before this government even as 
this government sits silent. 
These proposals from the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples 
offer a new dawn. This government chooses not to even have the 
dignity to respond to these solutions, but sits quiet.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Metis are not asking for special status. They are not 
seeking some gift from the government, nor are they asking for 
anything but what is their historic and moral due. They want to 
be treated as the equals they are and negotiate with government 
as other natives negotiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what is a people without a land base?  If history has shown 
us and taught us anything, it is true that a land base with all 
the access to resources that accompany it is an absolute, 
uncontroversial precondition for nationhood. Where does this 
government stand on Metis nationhood? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are these people that Louis Riel led at one time? Is the 
government afraid to act because it has difficulty identifying 
just who among us are these Metis who deserve better treatment 
from this government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The royal commission has made it easy for us. It recommends that 
every person who identifies himself or herself as Metis and is 
accepted as such by the nation of the Metis should be recognized 
by that nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While these negotiations go on, the government should work with 
the Metis and provincial and territorial governments to enter 
into temporary land use agreements with the Metis nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as no nation can exist without land, no nation can exist 
without language and culture.  What of Metis education and 
culture? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly as the motion indicates, Louis Riel played a crucial 
role in Metis culture. But this government has a responsibility 
to negotiate with the Metis full-fledged post-secondary 
education. Great care must be exercised to assure the development 
of Metis culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly suggest should Louis Riel day come into force, the 
government use that day to examine the following issues laid out 
in the report by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, a 
report to which the government has yet to respond in any 
meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, consultation with Metis elders when educational programs 
are planned. Second, establishment and funding of Metis schools 
where numbers warrant. Third, assisted access to post-secondary 
education in some form. Finally, support for a college or faculty 
of Metis study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Metis are involved in every facet of our society and 
represent an enormously varied cross-section of Canada, whether 
economically, geographically, in terms of professions and 
education, and certainly in terms of hopes, dreams and support 
for family and community. What they do not have is support from 
this government for the preservation of their culture and 
traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to once again stress that this motion, 
as good as it may be, sets out in effect to pardon the federal 
government for its historical error and does not address the 
real, substantive and immediate issues crucial to the Metis today 
and to their children tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However in true democratic spirit, we feel that the members of 
this House should decide on the merit of this motion and I would 
ask again that we have unanimous consent to have this motion 
voted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Hon. members of the 
House would like to welcome members of the Métis National 
Assembly to the deliberations here. This is not the custom but

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to reply to Private 
Members' Motion M-108 of the member for Rimouski—Mitis, that, in 
the opinion of this House, the government should revoke the 
verdict of guilty of high treason pronounced on Louis Riel on 
August 1, 1885 and commemorate him by declaring November 16 of 
each year to be Louis Riel day throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly this is one of the definitive questions in Canadian 
history and one which affects the way we identify ourselves as 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Rimouski—Mitis has raised two issues.  Since the 
motion is non-votable, I will deal with one. Should we pardon 
Louis Riel.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no illusions about the sensitivity of this issue to the 
Metis nation and have heard from the Métis National Council members 
personally.  I also fully understand the struggles of 
Conservative leaders from John A. Macdonald who ultimately 
allowed the death penalty to be carried out, to Joe Clark who on 
March 9, 1992 recognized Louis David Riel as the founder of 
Manitoba and a contributor to the development of Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to speak from my heart on 
this matter.  I commend and applaud the member for 
Rimouski—Mitis for raising this important issue.  Time is past 
due that we deal with this piece of Canada's history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been and I still am an avid reader of history.  With that 
said I would like to go on the record as being appalled by some 
of the revisionists and plain bad history that is being written 
by so many so-called historians today.  History should be 
understood in the context that it occurred, analysed and 
remembered.  History should not be revisionist, whitewashed or 
politically correct.  History is a record, it is not a judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As much as I disdain the revisionists of this world, I fully 
support efforts that lead to a more correct interpretation of 
events.  In 1650 when Oliver Cromwell told his portrait painter 
Peter Lely to paint his portrait warts and all, he was sending a 
message to posterity. History is about facts.  Historians, 
parliamentarians and all Canadians need to be careful of 
demonization and cautious of canonisation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because history is objective that I support part of this 
motion even though it is not votable.  Certainly the government 
is able to revoke the verdict of guilty of high treason.  The 
question is, should we pardon Louis Riel?  I say why not.  I have 
heard criticism that this would lead to a plethora of requests 
for other pardons, but I disagree.  Louis David Riel is a unique 
case.  He was elected to the Parliament of Canada three times 
but never took his seat and only succeeded in signing the register 
of this Parliament once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His case in all respects is uniquely Canadian.  It speaks of the 
beginning of the Metis national identity at the battle of Seven 
Oaks and the difficulty and unease between the original First 
Nations of Canada and the French and English traders and 
settlers.  Riel speaks from a page of Canadian history that 
should be read and understood warts and all by all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Louis Riel was born on October 22, 1844 to Jean-Baptiste Riel 
and Julie de Lagimodière.  At age 14 Riel was sent to Montreal to be 
educated at the College of the Suplician Fathers, the oldest college 
in Montreal.  He became a student at law in the office of the 
famous leader Rodolphe Laflamme of the Rouge Party in Quebec.  He 
met Louis Joseph Papineau of the 1837 rebellion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Riel was 
accepted in Quebec Catholic society but only to a point.  He fell 
in love with Marie-Julie Guernon, but they broke up in 1866 after her 
parents refused to allow her to marry a Metis.  In that same year 
Riel returned to Manitoba and immediately became a leader in the 
Metis community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not my intent to present a history of Louis Riel's life. 
It has been well documented.  My intent is to portray a unique and 
truly Canadian story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Riel belonged to a new nation, the descendants of French and 
Indian and Scots and Indian marriages. There were two groups, the 
mainly Protestant Metis supporters of the Hudson Bay Company and 
the the mainly Catholic Metis supporters of the North West 
Company. I identify these two groups in the House today to 
highlight the typically Canadian dichotomy in the Metis nation. 
The Metis were not without religious suspicion and a language 
barrier.  I state this to point out the similarity of the greater 
Canadian experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1869 Riel returned from Montreal and became secretary of the 
National Committee of Metis.  In December 1869 he became 
president of the provisional government.  A significant date in 
Riel's chronology that would later become a forerunner to his 
fate was March 4, 1870.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that day, Riel as the president of the provisional government 
ordered Thomas Scott, an Orangeman and thus a Protestant, 
executed for leading a rebellion against Riel's provisional 
government.  This act would force Riel into exile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Riel, in exile in the United States and despite a bounty of 
$5,000 on his head offered by the province of Ontario, was 
elected three times.  I repeat this.  He was elected three times 
in the House of Commons, representing Manitoba.  By 1878, he was 
back in Manitoba, the province he helped to bring in the 
Confederation in 1870.  He led the northwest rebellion in 1884 
and he was hung for treason in 1885. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is only a thumbnail sketch of Louis Riel.  Like many others 
before and since, Louis David Riel was caught in the currents of 
history and swept to his death.  Eventually his order to execute 
Thomas Scott fueled by religious and linguistic intolerance led 
to his death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sir John A. Macdonald himself agonized over the decision to 
execute Riel.  In the end he made the decision that he would be 
able to carry out damage control in Quebec for, without question, 
Quebeckers led by the young Wilfrid Laurier rallied to Riel's 
defence.  Macdonald, however, had a greater problem and that was 
assuaging the Protestant Orange vote in Ontario, who were crying 
for retaliation for Riel's execution of Orangeman Thomas Scott. 
Sir John A. Macdonald eventually succumbed to that pressure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth nothing that Riel was only tried by 6 jurors and not 
the mandatory 12 established in the Magna Carta.  We should note 
he was declared insane but refused to admit insanity at his trial 
and, therefore, accepted responsibility for his actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some inconsistencies in the trial of Louis Riel, but 
certainly there were also some inconsistencies in the man 
himself.  In 1870 he had Thomas Scott executed.  In 1885 he 
ordered one of his own Metis leaders, Charles Nolin, executed but 
never carried through with that threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to acknowledge the role of the other Metis in 
the rebellion and their contribution toward raising the profile 
of the Metis people.  The military expertise of Gabriel Dumont 
played a crucial role in the rebellion, as did the leadership of 
Charles Nolin and Louis Schmidt.  As well, Chief Poundmaker 
exemplified the courage and tenacity of the Metis and the Indian 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Riel accomplished was not without the help of others and 
their roles should not be forgotten.  Should we pardon Louis 
Riel?  I say yes, we should.  This is not 1885 but 1998.  Times 
have changed and events once clouded in racial and religious 
bigotry can now be seen objectively.  Louis David Riel was and is 
an important figure in Canadian history and a driving force in 
bringing Manitoba into Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like most men, he made some mistakes and carried his own baggage 
of personal biases and weaknesses.  He led an ill fated rebellion 
against the government of Canada, but he led it to defend and 
represent his people.  We in this House and the other place hold 
the power to pardon him.  A pardon at this time in the history of 
our nation would show progress, maturity and reconciliation for 
all people.  This pardon is not about a judgment.  This pardon is 
about reconciliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One hundred and three years have passed.  Let us move on.  Let 
us move forward.  Let us, in this House, pardon Louis Riel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I also would like to ask for the unanimous consent 
of this House to vote yea on the motion before you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Does the hon. member 
have the unanimous consent of the House to make this a votable 
motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> We have two other 
hon. members who have indicated interest in speaking.  The first 
to advise me was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Industry and the second was the hon. member for Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands. 
<P><A NAME="LINK311"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in co-operation, as this House 
has seen many times, I will shorten my speech to give the hon. 
member a chance to also speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today to speak to Motion No. 108 to revoke Louis Riel's 
conviction of August 1, 1885 and to declare a day in his honour.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In discussing the merits of this motion, there is definitely one 
thing on which we can all agree.  That is the important 
contribution of Louis Riel to the building of this country. In 
tribute to this contribution this House on March 9, 1992 
overwhelmingly adopted a motion to recognize Louis Riel as a 
founder of Manitoba and a contributor in the development of 
Confederation.  At that time the House was reminded of Riel's 
many accomplishments and of his stature within the Metis 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been other tributes in the recent past to honour Riel 
and other Metis leaders in recognition of their contribution to 
Canada and the Metis movement.  As this House is well aware, 
Thelma J. Chalifoux, a Metis woman from Alberta, was recently 
summoned to the Senate.  Ms. Chalifoux is both the first Metis 
person and the first aboriginal woman to sit in the Senate.  Her 
appointment was in large part due to her unwavering dedication to 
Metis issues. Judging from the welcome remarks of her fellow 
senators, she is expected to represent well this cause and the 
spirit of Riel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Louis Riel had a vision for this country over 100 years ago. 
That vision is alive and well today as articulated by the 
thousands of Metis who promote Metis culture and revere his 
memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Riel was a man of action, a man who looked forward and into the 
future.  Given my understanding of Riel, I believe that if he 
were here today he would counsel this House to look forward, not 
backward, in finding ways to recognize and honour his 
accomplishments and those of other Metis leaders who contributed 
greatly to the development of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would be urging us to focus our energies on finding solutions 
to our present day problems and building for the future.  He 
would insist that Metis have an opportunity to participate in the 
development of these solutions.  With that in mind I will spend a 
few minutes talking about what the federal government is doing 
today to advance the interests of Metis and off reserve 
aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many are aware, the Minister of Natural Resources has been 
assigned by the Prime Minister to fulfil the role of federal 
interlocutor for the Metis and off reserve aboriginal peoples. In 
that role, the minister acts as a point of first contact and 
where necessary as a facilitator between the Metis and off 
reserve aboriginal peoples and the appropriate federal ministers 
and departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that role he oversees the federal government's 
participation in the tripartite self-government process which is 
the forum being used to negotiate self-government with Metis and 
off reserve aboriginal groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 10, 1995 the federal government announced its approach 
to the implementation of the inherent right and the negotiations 
of self-government for aboriginal people including Metis and off 
reserve aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal approach contemplates various practical ways of 
implementing self-government for Metis and off reserve aboriginal 
people, including the development of self-government institutions 
to provide services, the devolution of programs and services and 
forms of public government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past several years the federal government has 
participated in bilateral processes with both the Metis National 
Council and the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples.  The bilateral 
process provides a forum for the congress and the council to 
discuss issues of utmost importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 7, 1997 the interlocutor and the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development unveiled “Gathering Strength: 
Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan”.  It is an action plan to renew 
our relationship with the aboriginal people who are both on and 
off reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the theme of healing and reconciliation in “Gathering 
strength”, the federal government is seeking appropriate ways to 
affirm the contributions of the Metis people and to reflect Louis 
Riel's proper place in Canada's history.  The work is under way. 
It is founded squarely on consultations with the Metis, not 
arbitrary partisan actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I return to my initial comments. Louis Riel was a 
builder.  He was working to build a society where his people 
could make the important decisions that confront us all in 
building a better future.  He was not a separatist. He wanted in, 
not out.  With the spirit of partnership embodied in “Gathering 
Strength” we will find appropriate ways to reflect his proper 
place in our history as a builder.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, human history is nothing but a litany of injustices.  In 
fact, I would venture to say that if there were no injustices 
there would be no history.  This is what gets written down, 
usually by the winners if there is a contest.  It is recorded. 
This is how we know about things which happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about injustice, some of my ancestors were 
Highland Scots.  They suffered injustices and brutality equal in 
every way to those suffered by the Metis people and for more or 
less the same reasons.  However, I do not lay awake at night 
bringing down fire and brimstone on the heads of the wicked 
English.  It is over.  It is done.  There is no need to go back 
to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have very great problems with people who want to sugar coat 
history, who want to rewrite history.  What happened, happened. 
It will not help Louis Riel or his descendants for this 
Parliament to come up with some sort of vacuous proclamation 
saying that we really did not mean it.  The man was hung.  He did 
not, when he had the opportunity, grovel.  He did not ask for 
mercy.  He could have taken a plea of insanity and he would have 
escaped, but he was a man of principle.  He walked to the gallows 
quite firmly and strongly.  He was not dragged kicking and 
screaming.  He did not make any particular effort to avoid 
capture at the end of the rebellion.  He would not have even had 
to go to trial.  He could have gone to the United States with 
Dumont and been scot free, but he chose not to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this date, if we come forward and say Louis, it was a 
terrible thing, we are so sorry, that cheapens the man's memory. 
He was a tough man.  He was not a cry baby.  I do not think we 
should, even though I know we have it in our power, say we pardon 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually, he did not have totally clean hands.  He set in motion 
a rebellion which cost lives.  Because he was not a very good 
general he unnecessarily cost the lives of many of his own 
people.  If he had listened to Gabriel Dumont, the results of the 
rebellion might have been far different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The man, let us face it, had a big ego.  He wanted to be in 
charge.  He did what he chose to do.  He refused to stop 
Middleton before he got to the Saskatchewan River.  He could have 
done so with Dumont's strategies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that at this late stage it makes any sense at all 
for us even to be debating this in the House.  We have more 
important things to do than to debate gestures.  Let us face it, 
this would just be a gesture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My advice to this House is to get on with it.  We have some very 
real problems in this country which affect not only Metis people 
but all of us.  Those problems are what we should be dealing 
with.  We should not be debating what happened 113 years ago.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I seek unanimous consent to allow the member another 
three or four minutes to do her wrap up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is it agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair needs to 
make the point that in Private Members' Business, if time 
remains, it is customary that the mover of the motion has five 
minutes to wrap up in the absence of any other member rising to 
speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, if we are to go beyond that time, we have to ask for 
unanimous consent, which the member from Grasslands has so 
generously requested and the House is quite happy to oblige. 
Those are the rules. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased that we have taken this hour of debate to place the 
matter in proper perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened most attentively to the speeches made by my 
various colleagues.  I acknowledge that the motion merits 
improvement. I trust that the Liberal Party, which is in the 
process of drafting a bill to settle this problem to everyone's 
satisfaction, will be able to take the texts that have been used 
today, analyze them thoroughly and try to see how this difficulty 
of having such ambiguity still surrounding one of the founders of 
this country, Louis Riel,  can be truly resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was somewhat surprised to see that my colleague knew Louis Riel 
so intimately as to be able to tell what his feelings were at the time 
of his trial, but the fact is that among those who asked that Riel be 
tried in Saskatchewan instead of Manitoba and who wrote Minister 
Campbell and the Prime Minister at the time, Mr. Macdonald, was the 
person who presided the appeal court to which Louis Riel appealed his 
sentence. Riel was a very strong and very fair-minded man who realized 
he had been treated unfairly. He appealed in spite of the fact that this 
person was judge and jury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest my colleagues read this month's issue of <I>Canadian Lawyer</I>. 
They will realize that the government was wrong, that Louis Riel was 
wronged. 
The historical context must be taken int account of course, but 
something can and should be done. Unlike my hon. colleague and his 
people, the Métis are no longer recognized as a people and they have 
lost a large part of their culture. What they are asking us is to 
restore their right to their own way of life and I wish the House would 
act on this as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and this item 
is dropped from the <I>Order Paper</I>. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 2.33 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday next
