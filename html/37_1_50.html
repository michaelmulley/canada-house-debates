<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>TOBACCO TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 2001 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK5">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (for the Minister of Finance)</B>  moved 
that Bill C-26, an act to amend the Customs Act, the Customs 
Tariff, the Excise Act, the Excise Tax Act and the Income Tax Act 
in respect of tobacco, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak 
in the House today to present Bill C-26.  In fact my heart soars 
with enthusiasm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26, the tobacco tax amendments act, 2001, implements the 
tax elements of the government's comprehensive new tobacco 
strategy which was announced on April 5 by the Ministers of 
Finance and Health and the Solicitor General. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new strategy is designed to improve the health of Canadians 
by reducing tobacco consumption, particularly among young 
Canadians.  Briefly, it consists of increasing spending on 
tobacco control programs, tobacco tax increases to discourage 
smoking, and a new tobacco tax structure to reduce the incentive 
to smuggle. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The package has received positive support from health groups, 
such as the Canadian Cancer Society, the Heart and Stroke 
Foundation of Canada and the Alberta Tobacco Reduction 
Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My remarks today will focus on the new tax structure and tax 
measures which are contained in amendments to the Customs Act, 
the Customs Tariff, the Excise Act, the Excise Tax Act and the 
Income Tax Act.  Before I discuss the individual measures in the 
bill, I would like to take a moment to put the legislation in 
perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All tobacco products manufactured and sold in Canada have 
federal and provincial taxes and duties levied on them.  Prior to 
1994, tobacco products for export were sold on a tax free and 
duty free basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early 1990s exports of Canadian cigarettes grew 
substantially.  There was strong evidence to suggest that most 
Canadian tobacco products that were illegally exported on a tax 
free and duty free basis to the United States were being smuggled 
back into the country and sold illegally without the payment of 
federal and provincial taxes.  Two serious problems developed. 
Organized criminal activities were increasing and the market in 
Canada for fully tax paid tobacco products was being undermined 
by the availability of illegal lower cost products.  This 
undermined the government's health objective of using higher 
prices to reduce smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the government implemented the national action plan 
to combat smuggling in 1994.  That plan included increased 
enforcement measures, a surtax on the profits of Canadian tobacco 
manufacturers, a tax on certain exports of tobacco products and 
reduced tobacco taxes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has proven to be very effective in reducing the level of 
contraband activity and restoring the legitimate market for 
tobacco sales.  As a result, the government has been able to 
increase excise taxes on tobacco products five times since 1994. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures in the bill before us today include a new tobacco 
tax structure to further reduce the incentive to smuggle tobacco 
products back into Canada and tobacco tax increases to advance 
the government's health objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, one of the government's national health 
objectives is to reduce smoking.  Our new tobacco strategy is 
specifically designed to help reach this objective, particularly 
reducing smoking by youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to quote from the Minister of Finance when the new 
strategy was announced.  He stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government's anti-tobacco strategy will help improve the 
health of Canadians by discouraging smoking.  By increasing taxes 
sharply and introducing a new tax structure for tobacco, we are 
taking important steps now and positioning ourselves to take 
further steps as need be. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs this comprehensive strategy to deal with the broad 
range of factors that contribute to smoking.  The measures in the 
bill are part of that strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now discuss these measures in detail and begin with the 
new tax structure. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the new tobacco tax structure is designed to 
reduce the incentive to smuggle Canadian-produced tobacco 
products back into Canada from export markets, the main source 
of contraband in the past.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key element of this new structure is the replacement of the 
current tax on exports of tobacco products, effective April 6, 
2001, with a new two tiered excise tax on exports of Canadian 
manufactured tobacco products.  Before discussing the measure 
further, let me provide some background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the Canadian smuggling problem of the early 1990s 
was primarily caused by Canadian exports to the U.S. that were 
illegally re-entered into Canada.  In the 1994 national action 
plan to combat smuggling, which I discussed earlier, the 
government imposed an excise tax on Canadian tobacco products. To 
ensure that Canadian tobacco manufacturers were not denied access 
to legitimate export markets, several exemptions from the export 
tax were allowed, including one for exports up to 3% of a 
manufacturer's annual production.  That was reduced to 2.5% of 
production in April 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 implements the budget 2000 proposal to further reduce 
the exemption threshold under the tax on exports of tobacco 
products before April 6, 2001, to 1.5% of a manufacturer's 
production in the previous calendar year.  This 1.5% threshold 
represents the approximate level of exports required to meet the 
legitimate demand for Canadian tobacco products abroad, 
principally in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new export tax structure, all exports of Canadian 
tobacco products will be taxed, thereby reducing the incentive to 
smuggle exported products back into Canada.  This new tax will be 
two tiered.  For exports up to the 1.5% threshold, a tax will be 
imposed at the rate of $10 per carton of cigarettes.  To avoid 
double taxation when these products enter legitimate foreign 
markets, the tax will be refunded upon proof of payment of 
foreign taxes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imposing a refundable tax on exports of tobacco products allows 
for a seamless transfer of tax-paid products from Canada to other 
countries.  This reduces the threat of these products being 
diverted and used for contraband, while allowing Canadian 
exporters to meet legitimate demand for their products abroad. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exports over the 1.5% threshold will be subject to both the 
current excise duty on tobacco products and a new excise tax that 
together amount to $22 per carton of cigarettes.  Imposing a tax 
at this rate will remove any incentive to illegally bring these 
products back into Canada.  Further, there will be no rebate on 
this tax.  This measure will reduce the potential for smuggling 
and help set the stage for future tobacco tax increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before moving on, I should mention that discussions are ongoing 
between Canada and the United States to help achieve the 
objectives of our tobacco products not being available tax free, 
while avoiding double taxation of exported products and helping 
reduce compliance burdens for U.S. importers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next element of the new tax structure concerns tobacco 
products sold at duty free shops and as ships' stores. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, duty-free shops are located at border 
crossings and international airports across the country.  These 
shops are authorized to sell certain goods, including tobacco 
products, tax-free and duty-free, to people leaving Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tobacco products supplied as ships' stores have traditionally 
been provided for use by crew and passengers and are sold to 
passengers through on board duty free shops on ships and aircraft 
with international destinations.  Under the new structure, 
Canadian tobacco products delivered to duty free shops and as 
ships' stores both at home and abroad will now be taxed at a rate 
of $10 per carton of cigarettes.  In addition, imported tobacco 
products delivered to Canadian duty free shops will also be 
taxed.  However, this tax will be refunded on the first carton 
sold to an individual who is not a resident of Canada.  Both 
measures take effect as of April 6, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imposing a tax on tobacco products for sale in duty free shops 
or as ships' stores is an integral part of the government's 
strategy to reduce tobacco consumption.  It demonstrates just how 
serious the government is about this issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing Canadians who travel to continue to have access to low 
cost, tax free tobacco through duty free shops would be 
inconsistent with our strategy of raising tobacco taxes 
domestically to achieve the government's health objective to 
reduce smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure would also reduce the risk that smugglers might 
seek to access Canadian tobacco products in duty free markets as 
other sources of untaxed, low cost tobacco products are 
eliminated.  We want all Canadian tobacco products to be taxed, 
no matter where they are sold, to ensure that they are not 
smuggled back into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another measure in the bill would ensure that tax is paid on 
tobacco products imported by returning residents.  Currently 
Canadian residents returning to Canada after an absence of more 
than 48 hours may bring back one carton of cigarettes tax free 
and duty free as part of a traveller's allowance.  Effective 
October 1, 2001, a new duty of $10 per carton of cigarettes would 
be imposed on these products when they are imported by returning 
residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that Canadian residents are not subject to double 
taxation upon returning to Canada with Canadian tobacco products 
on which tax has already been paid, neither this duty nor regular 
excise duties and taxes would apply to tobacco products that bear 
a Canadian stamp signifying that excise duties and taxes have 
already been paid.   Non-residents would not be affected by the 
change to the traveller's exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tobacco tax increases are another key element of the 
government's strategy to reduce tobacco consumption, particularly 
among youth.  Since the implementation of the national action 
plan to combat smuggling in 1994, the federal government has 
worked with the five provinces that implemented matching tobacco 
tax reductions at that time, namely Ontario, Quebec, New 
Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, to assess the 
feasibility of regular joint increases in tobacco taxes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of April 6, 2001, the federal government has raised tobacco 
tax rates jointly with these five low tax provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The combined federal-provincial tax increases are $4 per carton 
of cigarettes sold in New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova 
Scotia, Ontario and Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 would implement the increases in federal excise tax 
rates on tobacco products.  These increases would restore federal 
excise tax rates to a uniform level of $5.35 per carton on 
cigarettes for sale in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and P.E.I. This 
is equal to the federal tax rate that now applies in the 
provinces and territories that did not reduce taxes jointly with 
the federal government in 1994.  After this tax increase only 
Ontario and Quebec would have cigarette excise tax rates below 
the national excise tax rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes on fine cut tobacco and tobacco sticks would also be 
increased in all provinces and territories.  In addition, Bill 
C-26 would eliminate the reduced rate of federal excise tax on 
fine cut tobacco for sale in Ontario. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated earlier, this is the fifth increase in tobacco 
taxes since 1994.  In total, federal and provincial taxes on 
cigarettes will have increased from $7.40 to $9.80 per carton in 
these five provinces since 1994. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that a successful new tobacco tax structure would 
enable the government to hike tobacco taxes even further in the 
future.  The bill would also increase the surtax on the profits 
of tobacco manufacturers to 50% from the current rate of 40% 
effective April 6, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help ensure that these measures are effective, we are giving 
more resources to federal departments and agencies so that they 
could better monitor and assess the effectiveness of these 
measures in reducing smuggling.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These resources would be targeted specifically to the RCMP, the 
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, the Department of Justice and 
the Solicitor General of Canada at a cost of $15 million in the 
first year and $10 million each year after that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, all the proposals in the bill reaffirm the 
government's commitment to reduce tobacco consumption in Canada 
while maintaining vigilance in combating the level of contraband. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new tobacco tax structure will help reduce the incentive to 
smuggle Canadian produced tobacco products back into Canada and 
the tobacco tax increases will help advance the government's 
health objectives. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the tax measures would increase federal revenues 
from tobacco products by $215 million per year.  I believe that 
this new strategy demonstrates the depth of the government's 
commitment to reducing tobacco use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the stakes are high in the campaign against tobacco use. 
Through the tax measures contained in the bill, we now have the 
means to conduct the campaign effectively.  Tobacco taxation is 
about health.  Health is our priority, especially protecting the 
health of our young people. These new measures reflect our 
commitment to reduce smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an endorsement from the Canadian Cancer Society.  With 
an endorsement like that, I believe the government is definitely 
on the right track toward reducing smoking by Canadians, 
particularly young Canadians.  I encourage all members in the 
House to give their full support to the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent to share 
my time with the member for Elk Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent for the member to 
share his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we support Bill C-26. It 
is high time it came about.  However I think a little history is 
warranted here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to 1994 tobacco consumption in Canada was plummeting as a 
direct result of high taxes.  We also know that the average age 
young people begin to smoke is between 12 and 13.  High tobacco 
prices do discourage smoking.  The price elasticity of demand 
says that if the price is increased the demand will decrease 
dramatically, which is particularly important with regard to our 
youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994, in response to cigarette smuggling, particularly in 
eastern Ontario, the government committed what was probably the 
most horrendous blunder in health care policy in the history of 
the country.  Almost nothing this government could ever have done 
would have committed such a number of youth to smoke and have 
such a devastating impact upon the health of Canadians, not only 
in the short term but also in the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government did in response to smuggling was drop the 
taxes on tobacco significantly.  What did that do?  It increased 
the consumption among youth and adults, as well as the number of 
people smoking and the amount that they smoked.  Why do we say 
that?  It is because something interesting happened.  Tobacco 
taxes were reduced in five provinces in central and eastern 
Canada.  The west and Newfoundland kept their prices relatively 
the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had an interesting laboratory, looking at central Canada 
where the price was much lower, and the west and Newfoundland 
where the price was much higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we looked at any graph we would see that tobacco consumption 
and tobacco profits after 1994 went up dramatically.  Almost a 
quarter of a million young people started to smoke.  Tobacco 
companies were popping champagne corks in their offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government should have done in order to deal with the 
tobacco issue, which was a legitimate problem, was what it did 
prior to 1993.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 the same problem arose.  At that time the government put 
an excise tax on tobacco.  That cut the legs out from under 
tobacco smugglers.  It eliminated the differential between Canada 
and the United States.  Within six weeks tobacco smuggling 
dropped 75% without changing the price of cigarettes.  After six 
weeks the government of the day buckled under pressure from the 
tobacco companies that threatened to leave, and it removed the 
excise tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government had the backbone, it could have cut the legs 
out from underneath tobacco smugglers while not compromising the 
health of Canadians, particularly the youth.  It could have done 
that by keeping the taxes where they were and by adding the 
excise tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the excise tax that would have prevented smuggling while 
enabling to keep the taxes where they were.  It would not have 
committed a quarter of a million young people to smoking, 50% of 
whom will die of tobacco related deaths, with 21% of them dying 
of some form of cancer.  It is a public tragedy and a public 
health problem that we will see in the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also deprived the public coffers of nearly $5 
billion worth of revenue.  I can imagine what we could have done 
with that money.  We could have put it into health care, into 
research and into prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party supports the bill, but we want make sure that the 
money coming from taxes would not be put into some big vat to be 
used for special projects by the government.  The money could be 
used for prevention models.  It could be used for a head start 
program that focuses on strengthening the parent-child bond which 
has proven to be of dramatic importance and very effective at 
improving the health care of children and their families while 
preventing a lot of social problems that occur later on.  That is 
what the government could and should be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could also put money into increasing physical 
activities among kids.  Physical activity is at an all time low. 
This would have a dramatic impact on the future health of 
Canadians because when children become adults, if they were not 
active as youth, there is less of a chance they will be active as 
adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responsible for sport is very interested in 
physical activity and is working hard with our Olympic athletes. 
Why does he not take the Olympic athletes to the schools as part 
of a speaking program to teach children the importance of 
physical activity?  The athletes could be paid to do this and the 
kids would be directly impacted by Canadian heroes, which would 
push and encourage them to be physically active.  It is a win-win 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister in charge of sport would consider this 
proposal.  It is an informal proposal but doable.  The Olympic 
athletes would get money.  They would be getting paid to do a 
good job and the children of our country would benefit.  It would 
have a long term and positive impact on the health of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to look at what we could be doing in terms 
of improving the health of our children, our youth, as well as 
adults in the country.  Looking at it from an international 
perspective, smoking consumption is not a domestic problem but an 
international problem.  The World Health Organization has said 
clearly that in many countries such as China and other nations it 
will be a health care disaster with millions of people dying from 
tobacco related diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public would be very interested to know that tobacco 
companies actually sponsor dances in foreign countries and give 
out free cigarettes to children.  They give out free cigarettes 
to children, not because they are good corporate citizens but 
because they are attempting to cause children to become addicted 
to cigarette smoking.  Some of these tobacco companies are 
pretending to be the paragons of virtue and good corporate 
citizenry while going to other countries or nations, sponsoring 
dances, providing free admission to children and giving them free 
cigarettes.  That is what is happening in the world today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the government to pursue and fast track Bill C-26, 
to make sure that the bill goes through, and to increase the 
taxes to ensure that our children do not smoke.  It should make 
the price so high that it becomes even more difficult for youth 
to smoke.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Libertarians would suggest that what happens to people is their 
business and that they should have freedom of choice.  I agree. 
However let us take into consideration that we are talking not 
about people who are 25 or 30 years of age but about children who 
are 12 and 13 years of age.  That is when children start to 
smoke.  That is when they start to take up the weed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a slightly related issue, the issue of medicinal marijuana, I 
applaud the government in this regard.  It is high time.  However 
the government must make sure it is well regulated and not simply 
a tool to legalize marijuana consumption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the minister can do, and I am speaking personally and not 
on behalf of the party, is decriminalize the simple possession of 
marijuana.  If we decriminalize marijuana consumption there would 
be a penalty or fine which could be used to fund youth prevention 
programs.  It would also save expensive court costs.  It would 
take people out of the courts and save legal fees and court time. 
The courts would then have more time to go after people who 
commit murder, rape and other heinous crimes.  If we 
decriminalize marijuana use, and the Canadian Police Association 
supports this, we would have higher penalties, lower costs and a 
revenue source we could funnel into prevention programs for kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last pitch, once again, is for the head start program.  If 
the government is truly interested in preventing the social 
problems that result from youth crime, if it wants to ensure kids 
are more employable and less dependent on welfare or drugs, then 
a head start program is the fastest, best and most effective way 
of doing so.  We could draw from the best of head start programs 
around the world which focus on strengthening the parent-child 
bond.  This should start at the prenatal stage.  If fewer parents 
took drugs and alcohol during pregnancy we could reduce the 
incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome, a tremendous problem in our 
country.  The programs would also ensure parents had the skills 
to be good parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This can be done simply, effectively and for the most part with 
existing resources.  It can be done if the federal government 
calls together its provincial counterparts for a conference on 
the issue.  The government needs a specific plan of action that 
can enable the program to be a reality.  The cost savings would 
be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  The lives saved would 
be in the thousands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support Bill C-26 and hope it goes through quickly.  We only 
regret that the government in 1994 dropped the taxes to begin 
with.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will begin by accusing my colleagues in the House of the wrong 
motive in agreeing to split my time with the member who just 
spoke.  I think they did so to avoid listening to me for 40 
minutes.  I could speak to the issue for at least 40 minutes and 
now I will be limited to 20.  That is really regrettable. However 
I shall do as well as I can in the time allotted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that as a member of the Canadian Alliance I am 
standing in the House of Commons this day to speak in favour of 
higher taxes.  I cannot believe I am doing that, yet I must 
support the bill because of its objectives.  It bothers me to 
speak of higher taxes because we are already taxed to death.  We 
are taxed at every turn.  We even have taxes on taxes.  The 
government collects GST on excise and gasoline taxes. 
The same is true for cigarettes.  There are taxes on cigarettes 
and then the 7% GST on top of that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am, however, in favour of this tax.  I cannot believe it and 
yet I am.  My apologies to friends, constituents and Canadians 
who expect us in the Canadian Alliance to consistently oppose 
higher taxes and the burden they create for our citizens and 
young people.  However this is an issue that we are appropriately 
addressing.  This is a health issue and our concern is to reduce 
smoking, especially among young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if my colleagues have thought about it, but what 
attracts young people to put a bunch of weeds wrapped in paper 
into their mouth, light the end of it and suck on it?  It is a 
strange motivation and I have often wondered about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues will be disappointed in this, but when I remember 
my own youth I must confess, with humble heart and bowed head, 
that on an occasion or two, actually two, I succumbed to the 
temptation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  It is shameful.  I am embarrassed about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Did the hon. member inhale? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  I do not know if I inhaled.  I do not think 
I did, I was coughing so hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up on a farm in Saskatchewan.  When I was in grade 8 
our school was closed and we were bused into the big city.  One day 
while walking at noon I saw a pack of cigarettes on the sidewalk. 
I kicked it, as young lads are prone to do.  I could tell by the 
pressure on it that it was not an empty box.  I picked it up and 
opened it and, lo and behold, there were still some cigarettes in 
it.  In retrospect I presume someone had decided to quit smoking 
and had thrown away the cigarettes.  I hope that was the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, I read somewhere that people who decide to quit 
smoking and throw away an unfinished pack have much higher 
success rates than those who say that they will finish their 
current pack and then quit.  I say that as an interesting 
psychological side trip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I picked up the pack of cigarettes and hid to make sure no one 
could see me.  I took one of the things, put it in my mouth and 
lit the end of it.  It was probably the most incredible thing I 
had done in my life.  I began hacking and coughing.  It was the 
most undesirable thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a young fellow in grade 8, about 12 or 13 years old or maybe 
14, I made a decision that day before I finished the first 
cigarette.  I decided I would not smoke.  It occurred to me that 
smoking was stupid.  Why would a guy do it if it only caused him 
to cough uncontrollably?  Besides that, I was sure it would cost 
money.  It may amuse young people today to know that my allowance 
then was 10 cents a week and I could scarcely afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was my first experience with smoking.  The later one 
occurred when I was in university, and it was also quite 
incredible.  I drove a truck, a big rig on the highway, for my 
summer job.  I enjoyed that job.  I loved driving and I still do. 
I still have my class one licence, so if I lose my job here I can 
go back to that if nothing else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my fellow drivers challenged me.  He will know who he is 
if he finds out I am telling the story.  We had stopped at a 
coffee shop and he bought a cigar at the counter when we were 
leaving.  He said that I should buy one as well and, for some stupid 
reason, I did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While driving down the road I put the silly thing in my mouth 
and drew in the smoke.  I was silly to do that.  To my knowledge 
those are the only two occasions on which I succumbed to the 
temptation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, what is it that causes young people to decide to take 
up smoking in view of what it does to their health?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many years ago I heard a motivational speaker address a crowd of 
young people about smoking.  He said one of his strongest 
arguments against smoking was that no one he had met who had 
smoked more than five years had ever suggested to him that he 
start.  Not one person who has smoked for five years or more 
would recommend that someone else begin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that I have said this on worldwide television, and I know 
millions of Canadians are listening, I imagine I will begin to 
get e-mails suggesting that I start and that it is wonderful. 
People have told me they enjoy it and that is why they do it. 
Okay, so be it.  That is the reason they do it.  However not even 
those people have suggested I start in order to share their joy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of its addictive nature I am very much opposed to 
anything that would promote the taking up of this habit, 
especially by young people.  I have been told and have read that 
once one begins smoking it is a lifelong habit.  It is one of the 
most difficult addictions to break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used to teach mathematics.  How I wish we could use audio 
visual aids in the House.  I would love to have a prop with a 
piece of paper just big enough for the cameras.  I could show the 
House an exercise I used to give my students when I taught 
mathematics in high school and at a technical institute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we did exponential functions, when I taught finance and 
when I taught students how to use electronic calculators or 
computers, I made them do a calculation.  I am describing it 
without a visual aid, but it went something like this:  365 times 
5 times (1 plus 10/100), to the power of 65 minus 20, minus 1, 
all divided by 10/100. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My students evaluated it to see if they were using their 
computers or calculators correctly.  When I asked them if they 
knew what they had computed they said they did not.  It was a 
random formula as far as they were concerned.  I told them they 
had computed the following:  5 is the cost of a pack of 
cigarettes; 365 is the number of days in a year; the 10/100 is 
10%, which is pretty high but there are times one can get it in 
an RRSP; the minus one is just part of the formula; divide by 
10/100, again that is 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They had computed the costs of smoking for their lifetime from 
age 20 to age 65.  The formula told them how much they would have 
in the bank at a 10% rate of interest if they started saving at 
age 20 and retired at age 65.  My students were amazed because 
the sum was $1.3 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then had them do another calculation which demonstrated that 
such a strategy would ensure them an annual pension of $139,000 
until age 95.  That is a fantastic pension.  It is even better 
than the MP pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I told my students they had learned some math but that they also 
had a choice to make.  They could smoke and at age 65 live on 
whatever meagre pension the government gives them, or they could 
instead retire on $139,000 a year by putting that money into the 
bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Smoking is wrong in terms of both its health effects and its 
lack of consideration for fellow citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to be on the non-smoking side of the issue.  There is a 
temptation for what I am about to say to come out wrong.  I would 
like my friends to know that I do not dislike people who smoke 
but I do dislike their smoking.  I would like to differentiate 
that.  I love people but if they would not smoke it would be that 
much more pleasant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Sunday I was out with my wife and some friends at a 
restaurant.  We asked for the non-smoking section and it was 
given to us.  That was nice but there were people smoking.  The 
smoke drifted across and we could smell it.  We briefly talked 
about it.  It was too bad but we had to live with it. My advisers 
told me not to say in my speech that having a non-smoking section 
in a restaurant is like having a non-peeing section in a swimming 
pool.  I was advised not to say it, but it is a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I went to pay the bill the guy from the smoking section was 
there in front of me.  Did he put his cigarette out while we were 
paying?  No.  He was right there and by the time we got home our 
clothes reeked.  I set them in another room because they stunk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members not to get this wrong.  It shows a lack of respect 
for other people when one insists on smoking in the presence of 
non-smokers.  Some people would say that I am moralizing and not 
like me for it.  I apologize but there are many people who feel 
that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the hotel where I am staying I always get a non-smoking room, 
but in spite of the laundry process, the smell of cigarettes on 
the pillow was not eradicated.  I wake up the next day with a 
headache because of the smell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even around the House of Commons we may wish to consider doing 
something about smoking.  Every member and visitor to this place 
has to walk through a wall of smoke at the main entrances because 
of all the people smoking.  It is not pleasant. Could we arrange 
for them to have a room somewhere, maybe with fans?  They should 
not have to go outside into the wicked Canadian winter.  We 
should show them some respect, but let us not allow them to smoke 
at the main entrances to our buildings and force everyone, 
smokers or not, to go through that wall of smoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to come back to the health issue.  I was forced in my 
previous employment to share an office for a time with a smoker. 
One can imagine what that was like.  I suggested to him, as 
kindly as I could, that it bothered me.  This was before the days 
of the non-smoking environment.  I suggested to him that he could 
go outside and smoke because it bothered me.  He told me that it 
did not bother me.  I thought to myself how arrogant he was.  He 
arranged for our organization to buy an air purifier and he set 
it beside him when he smoked.  I had a headache pretty well every 
day.  It affects me adversely.  There are many people who have 
that allergy or that medical response to second hand smoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a dream where I died and went to heaven.  When they asked 
me why I was there I said it was because of second hand smoke in 
my office.  I told my office partner that the next day.  He 
laughed about it and thought it was very funny, but there is some 
evidence that second hand smoke is a health hazard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember teaching statistics in a math course.  One of the 
things that we did was to try to interpret statistical data.  One 
of the examples that we used was death by heart and lung disease. 
It was interesting that the percentage of deaths caused by heart 
and lung disease at that time, a number of years back, peaked 
between the ages of 40 and 50 and then it dropped off.  I asked 
my students to interpret the statistical data.  They concluded, 
correctly, with the premise that if someone has a biological 
predisposition to getting lung cancer or heart disease due to 
smoking they would get it and die in their forties, most likely.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we condone smoking when it literally puts at risk 
thousands of people who die in their forties because of it? 
Obviously we need to take some action.  I thought of an example. 
What would the Minister of Transport or the House of Commons do 
if there were an airplane crash today in which 100 people died 
and tomorrow there was another airplane crash of the same type? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a suspicion that on the second day all airplanes around 
the world would be grounded voluntarily by the airlines and by 
compulsion of governments.  Yet every day in Canada 100 people 
have a premature death due to smoking and we are doing absolutely 
nothing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even this measure is tepid in comparison to what we should be 
doing.  This is an issue of great proportion and we should do 
everything that we can to reduce smoking and to discourage young 
people from taking up the habit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember as a student going to the museum of science in 
Portland, Oregon.  I remember vividly seeing two lungs hooked up 
in parallel to the same pipes and a pump that was providing an 
increase and decrease in pressure.  We know that it is 
atmospheric pressure that allows us to breathe.  When we drop the 
diaphragm there is a space to be filled and it is the air 
pressure around us that pulls the air into the lungs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was happening was a simulation of a person breathing.  They 
had two lungs from cadavers, actual human lungs.  One was from a 
healthy person who died in a car accident and the other was from 
a person who died of emphysema or lung cancer.  One was a 
diseased lung and the other one was a normal lung. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the pressure went up and down the normal lung expanded and 
contracted to allow the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide to 
give a healthy life.  The other lung barely moved.  It was 
atrophied.  It was all solid because of the effects of smoking. 
This had quite an impact on me.  It happened a little less than 
40 years ago and I still remember it.  The impact that it had was 
amazing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we do something about it?  I absolutely and profoundly 
say yes.  Am I in favour of tax increases?  No, I am not.  I am 
in favour of the bill only because of the impact that it could 
have and hopefully would have.  I hope the government in 
increasing those taxes would also have the fortitude to enforce 
the rules and to make sure that we do not have an increase in the 
smuggling of cigarettes in addition to the supply that would keep 
coming in.

always sad to be cut off after a few minutes, because the case 
to be made on tobacco taxes and smoking in general is a very 
serious one.  The time at our disposal here is so important that 
cutting my speech in two might have a negative effect on the 
message. Nevertheless, in the five minutes remaining to me 
before oral question period. I will try to introduce my message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members are aware, Bill C-26 consists essentially in 
raising the taxes on tobacco as an anti-smoking measure.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right off, I will say that my party, the Bloc Quebecois, will 
support the bill because we care about people's health and 
about the fight that has gone on for many years against what I 
would call a plague, a major social problem, a problem creating 
considerable cost for the health care sector. It is a problem 
that also results every year in Canada in deaths that would not 
occur had people not taken up this bad habit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 29% of people smoke.  This is fewer people than in the 
past but it is still too many.  It is still too many because 
tobacco kills and before it kills it makes people sick. 
These people impose considerable costs on the health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People get emphysema, caused primarily by smoking.  Smoking is 
also the cause of heart disease, and in particular, myocardial 
infarction, of lung cancer, and of strokes, some of which are 
linked to smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year, there are over 40,000 deaths related to the use of 
tobacco.  Why are there so many deaths?  Why does tobacco kill? 
It kills because it is a really poisonous mix of highly toxic 
chemicals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for tar, do people know that the tar found in a cigarette 
includes over 4,000 chemicals? Tar alone, which is but one of 
hundreds of components found in tobacco and a product of the 
combustion of tobacco, contains 4,000 toxic products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nicotine is the worst of the poisons found in cigarettes. Why? 
Because, depending on a cigarette's nicotine content, it is the 
nicotine that creates a dependency, an addiction similar to 
cocaine and even heroin addiction. Some studies even suggest 
that nicotine makes it just as hard to stop smoking as to stop 
using hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All sorts of junk is found in cigarettes. I could talk about it 
at length, because I smoked for many years. I stopped eight 
years ago. At the time, I did not have this information. It is 
thanks to awareness, information and advertising campaigns on 
the ills of tobacco that I became aware of the makeup of this 
poison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I can see that you are getting anxious. I will 
resume my speech after oral question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member will have 35 minutes to complete 
his remarks after oral question period.

tomorrow, April 28, marks the 10th annual National Day of Mourning. 
We observe this day to honour those who have been killed or 
injured in the workplace.  It is because of these tragic deaths 
that I rise today to remind my colleagues that making a greater 
commitment to workplace safety benefits all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Day of Mourning takes on even more meaning when we 
look at the alarming statistics.  An average of three Canadians 
are killed every working day and one is injured every nine 
seconds.  This accounts for nearly 800 deaths and some 800,000 
injuries every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the number of workplace accidents has been reduced over 
the past 10 years, this day serves as an important reminder that 
we must prevent these accidents from ever happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pay tribute to those we remember today by putting forth our 
best efforts to strive for safer and healthier workplaces through 
continued education, awareness and co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members of the House to take time tomorrow to remember the 
workers who lost their lives or who were injured on the job over 
the last year.  We extend our deepest sympathies to the families 
and friends of those workers.

Speaker, three years ago this week the Liberal government turned 
its back on thousands of Canadians who were poisoned by blood 
tainted with hepatitis C.  On April 28, 1998, the Liberals voted 
no to a motion which would have extended financial compensation 
to victims poisoned beyond the years of 1986 and 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of victims were let down by the federal government. 
Among those who did qualify for compensation, many have yet to 
see a dime.  Joey Haché was one of those individuals.  Joey was 
in the gallery that fateful day three years ago and he is here 
again today to register his protest.  Days after that vote Joey 
was advised that he qualified for that compensation.  Three years 
later Joey is one of thousands who have received nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joey is asking “Where is the compensation that was promised?” 
and thousands of other hepatitis C victims still want to know 
“What about us?”

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, every year in 
Canada there are more than 800,000 work related accidents. More 
than 750 of these will be fatal.  That is the sad record of the 
working conditions of Quebecers and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow, April 28, will be the tenth anniversary of the 
National Day of Mourning.  This is a very significant event, for 
it affords us an opportunity to stop for a moment and reflect on 
the importance of occupational health and safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the Canadian government is not much concerned 
about the misfortunes of those who have suffered work related 
accidents and their families.  Take, for example, the matter of 
pregnant or breast-feeding workers.  Despite the Bloc Quebecois 
demands for these women to be afforded true protection in the 
workplace, the federal government has turned its back on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking for myself and for my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, 
I would like to send a word of encouragement to the victims of 
work related accidents, and their family members.  Our thoughts

The reason for this is the National Day of Mourning, held to 
remember the people who have been injured or killed on the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of this day is to have us reflect on the importance of 
occupational health and safety.  The figures are staggering.  In 
Canada, some 800,000 accidents occur on the job every year, over 
750 of which result in the death of the victim.  This means that 
three workers are killed every working day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Steps taken by the government resulted in an 11% reduction in 
the number of industrial accidents between 1993 and 1997.  But 
one accident is one too many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would assure those who have lost a loved one in an industrial 
accident and those who suffer because of such accidents of our

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the job news in Canada this week is not that great.  JDS Uniphase 
just cut 2,500 jobs.  Bell Canada proposes to lay off 1,800 
workers.  Cisco Systems will chop 250 jobs.  This morning we 
learned that TD Waterhouse will cut 800 employees.  These are 
thousands of hardworking, taxpaying citizens who will be looking 
for work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister say with that record that all the 
fundamentals are in order? 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is no doubt that whenever any job is lost in 
Canada it is of great concern to the government in terms of the 
families involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, I think we need to recognize that we are going 
through a situation where there is extreme volatility. There has 
been a slow down in the United States and we are all aware of the 
situation in Japan.  Those things will have an effect in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important, when we look at the job numbers, that we 
understand, for instance, that in the last eight months Canada 
has had twice the amount of job creation as the United States, 
which means that we are coming through this well.  That does not 
mean that we are not very concerned about any job loss. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
just learned that the help wanted index in the United States has 
reached a record low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The labour market south of the border is experiencing very 
serious problems. Economists tell us that the same situation 
could occur in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister leave the rhetoric aside and tell Canadians 
what the government will do to improve the situation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
situation is very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it must be said that the current growth figure in the United 
States is much higher than what economists expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can definitely see the light at the end of the tunnel, but 
this is not to say that there is not a slowdown in the United 
States that is affecting us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why our efforts to reduce taxes for instance are worth 
mentioning. Our figures in relation to debt reduction are very 
impressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the job creation rate in Canada is twice that of the

Speaker, it is all well and good for the minister to talk about 
how well Canada is doing in relation to other countries. However, 
I just mentioned that almost 5,500 jobs are being lost.  These 
are high paying jobs that taxpayers had before the government 
messed up our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The IMF's own chief economist warned yesterday that the U.S. and 
Canada must act more responsibly with their economies or risk a 
recession.  Those are very plain words.  Will the government take

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I certainly do not know where the hon. member is getting 
his information.  The chief economist of the IMF has said that 
Canada's tax cuts were fortuitous and very well timed.  The chief 
economist also said that the policy actions taken by the 
government are exactly what were required.  The chief economist 
also pointed out that the amount of stimulus in our economy is 
virtually double that of any other major economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What economists around the world are saying is that the policy 
actions that have been taken by the government are exactly the 
actions that were required. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
our economic growth is continuing slowly, while the American 
growth rate is about three times as high as ours.  Our dollar is 
languishing around 65 cents and eroding the assets of every 
Canadian.  Why?  It is because our tax rates are still too high 
and there is no legislated plan for debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Finance respond to these concerns and table 
some concrete plans to address these issues? 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is very difficult to understand the <I>Alice in 
Wonderland</I> from which the Alliance members happen to come. The 
fact is that their numbers are wrong.  Our growth rates compare 
very favourably with those in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back.  I raised this the other day in terms of 
legislated debt paydown.  The problem with it is that as soon as 
governments get into trouble they amend it.  They welsh on the 
deal.  If the member wants an example all he has to do is go back 
and take a look at what the Leader of the Opposition did when he 
was the treasurer of Alberta.  Six months after he brought in 
legislated paydown he welshed on the deal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the minister keeps saying that our fundamentals are all 
right.  If that is true, then why are we losing jobs?  This is 
actually happening.  My colleague just mentioned that.  Why is 
the rate of growth of our economy less than the Americans by 
one-third?  This is true.  I do not think the minister should be 
denying that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our growth rate is increasing but at a very slow rate.  The 
Americans' growth rate is increasing at a higher rate.  Why is 
that?  It is because of a lack of a tax plan that would give 
aggressive tax rate cuts to our citizens.  When will he do it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is very hard to deal with a firm that spends most of 
its research money on spies and not doing basic economic 
research.  The fact is that he is wrong in terms of growth.  If 
he looks at the job creation rates, last month our job creation 
numbers were substantially higher than any economist expected 
across North America.

official languages regarding the place of French in amateur 
sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the 16 recommendations made by the commissioner, 9 were to

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the head trainer for official languages what action he 
intends to take vis-à-vis his colleague at amateur sport so that 
the commissioner's recommendations are acted upon and so that 
French speaking athletes do not have to leave their mother

<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first, we are glad that the Bloc Quebecois wants to 
see its athletes on the podium because, until last week, it did 
not even want to talk about athletes from everywhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have a very specific policy on official languages. 
If a national sports organization does not meet the rules on 
recognizing both official languages, it will not receive any 
funding from the Government of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
official languages commissioner's report concluded that French 
speaking athletes are governed by a system which, most of the 
time, operates exclusively in English, to the detriment of their 
development as athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this first day of the national summit on sport, will the new

</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to play politics with sport.  That is why today, 
tomorrow and Sunday we will be trying to reach a consensus with 
all Canada's athletes.  It is a given that athletes must be able

and that is Canada's policy.

official languages issue in amateur sport has had a negative 
effect on the efficiency and performance of francophone 
athletes.  They are being discriminated against on the basis of 
language, not performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the summit on sport is over, what concrete actions do 
the minister responsible for official languages and the 
Secretary of State for Amateur Sport intend to take to eliminate 
the obstacles faced by francophone athletes within the Canadian 
sports system? 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, just for once I would like to see the Bloc Quebecois 
capable of setting petty politics aside in order to work along 
with all of Canada's athletes who have come to establish a 
consensus for sports on behalf of all the athletes of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can there 
be any consensus when the phrase “Building Canada” is already

</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of making use of the national summit on sport as a

fees, no problem; private hospitals, no problem; means testing, 
no problem, according to Mike Harris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well there is a huge problem.  Canadians want this government to 
meet that problem head on by using the only language that Mike 
Harris really understands, withholding public funds for violators

assurance today, no ifs, ands or buts? 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government has already given that assurance by its 
actions.  It has taken action to withhold funds under the Canada 
Health Act when it has been proven that the Canada Health Act has 
not been lived up to.  The government will continue to carry on 
its responsibilities.  The hon. member should recognize it has 
been doing so and it will continue to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal lack of leadership on health reform, massive funding 
cuts and endless tolerance for Canada Health Act violations are 
what have made our health care system vulnerable to Mike Harris 
and his privatizing parasites.  For good reason, the Canada 
Health Act gives the federal government clout to withhold public 
funds from violators.  Will the government once and for all use 
the clout and cut the cash?

the department of commerce expressing very clearly the view of 
our country on that front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed we are in touch with the stakeholders all the time. Three 
weeks ago we raised the idea of having a stakeholder meeting.  At 
that time they told us that they thought it was premature and

the minister of trade on April 9 in a news conference said there 
was no urgency in the softwood lumber industry because nothing 
would happen until August. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that the countervail duties can be applied 
as of last Monday, not next August, and every load of lumber that 
leaves Canada right now is vulnerable to a retroactive duty for 
countervail and anti-dumping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of us is right and one of us is wrong.  Could the minister 
correct that and say who is right?  Are the duties applicable as

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade,

the commerce department can make a preliminary determination as 
of the end of June or the beginning of July.  When it is a very 
simple case it takes two months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally with a case as complex as this one, the indication we 
have is that the determination should not be made before the end

do it retroactively but that is done very rarely.  Canada would 
absolutely insist that it not be done in this case as it is done 
so very rarely.

a wilful disregard for government procurement regulations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point this out for the member.   He knows very well from

Canadians, especially Canadians in remote areas.  It has made our

is very clear in the audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really troubling is that despite the process of 
bypassing rules to fast track the project, access.ca is six 
months behind schedule and may never be fully implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the government could tell us what is the future for this

us who think that Canada should increase foreign aid to less 
developed countries were dismayed to read in the press that in 
fact we seem to be going the other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our overseas development assistance which was 0.28% of gross

more in development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economy is growing much faster and that is why there is a

the member knows that we do not discuss particular cases in a

</I></B></P><P align=left>The process is very simple.  When serious criminality or 
terrorism is involved, officials seek to continue the detention 
of these individuals.  The department also seeks detentions of 
those likely to disappear and those who pose a danger.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister makes weak excuses, public safety is being

regulations to permit the sale of concentrated liquid strychnine

grain land every year and to a great extent farmers are powerless 
to stop them.  The damage to crop and hay lands caused by this 
infestation is very costly to farmers in lost productivity, 
equipment repairs and injury to livestock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the hope of these petitioners that the petition will 
convince the federal government to relax those restrictions on 
strychnine poison so that farmers can get the gopher problem 
under control.  We appreciate the opportunity to bring this 
serious problem to the attention of the House.

existence of such a lease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I would ask for the unanimous consent of the House to 
table it so that everyone could have a look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, if I 
understood correctly, the Liberals do not want to know the truth 
about the Auberge Grand-Mère. That is really what we heard. 
Nor do they want the lease to be tabled in the House. They do 
not want to see for themselves that the Prime Minister is 
talking through his hat when he says there was no financial 
connection between the auberge and the golf club after 1993. It 
is rather strange, but I will now get back to my remarks about 
Bill C-26. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say at the outset that Bill C-26 contains good measures to 
fight tobacco consumption. It provides various instruments, 
including a tax increase on tobacco products in general and on 
cigarettes in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support this bill. Why? Because tobacco kills. But before it 
kills, it creates considerable costs for our health system. 
These costs run into the billions of dollars every year. Tobacco 
kills through various smoking related diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is emphysema, heart disease and myocardial infarction in 
particular.  There is lung cancer.  There are strokes, many of 
which are linked to smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end there are over 40,000 deaths a year in Canada 
caused by smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still too many people smoking today.  There are still 
too many people uninformed.  There are still too many people 
today, especially young people, who are beginning to develop 
this bad habit of smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet, tobacco kills.  It is a real poison.  According to the 
Canadian Cancer Society, there are a variety of components to 
cigarettes, chemicals, which should be made known to those who 
have the bad habit of smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are real poisons. 
To name but one, tar in cigarettes by itself contains 4,000 
chemical compounds, 4,000 noxious compounds.  Nicotine is the 
worst element in a cigarette causing dependency, because of its 
high level—between 5 and 7 milligrams per cigarette—of such 
magnitude that it is likened to cocaine and heroin dependency.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know what it is like to break a habit like smoking because I 
myself smoked for many years.  Given the withdrawal symptoms 
that one can experience over a long period of time, I know 
whereof I speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cigarettes, and tobacco in general, contain acetone.  This 
substance is normally used as a paint stripper.  This is what 
one is inhaling along with cigarette smoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cigarettes also contain methanol, something else one is 
inhaling.  Methanol is wood alcohol, one of the most potent 
alcohols on the market. 
Tobacco also contains acetylene, another chemical, which is used 
to fuel flares.  This is what one is inhaling in tobacco 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is inhaling hydrocyanic acid, which is used in gas chambers, 
benzene, a very strong solvent on the market, and ammonia as 
well.  When one smokes a cigarette, one is breathing in ammonia. 
This is a colourless gas used for cleaning.  I think that 
everyone is somewhat familiar with this chemical, which is 
extremely harmful if inhaled.  It is very bad for the health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cigarettes also contain mercury, lead and cadmium.  These are 
the substances one is inhaling when one smokes a cigarette: 
three highly toxic heavy metals.  There is also carbon monoxide. 
Everyone has heard of carbon monoxide, a colourless, odourless 
and deadly gas.  Nitrogen oxide, a toxic gas, is also present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, if we could conduct an aggressive information campaign 
to provide this kind of fundamental data and make an analogy 
with a poison cocktail, we could not find anything more 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine a large glass in which there is a certain amount of tar. 
This is the viscous, yellowish liquid which becomes black once 
it has been mixed with other products and which is used on 
roofs. Imagine a large glass with some tar in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine another glass in which there is acetone and two or three 
spoonfuls of paint remover to enhance the flavour. To this, we 
would then add wood alcohol, a product used for torches, and 
hydrocyanic acid. We would also pour some acid into our 
explosive cocktail. And benzene, which is a solvent. We would 
also put a certain amount of heavy metals into the same glass. 
We would mix the whole thing with some ice and give it to 
someone to drink. This is the image that we should bear in mind 
whenever we light up a cigarette. This is what we are inhaling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental question that I ask myself is: Would we give 
that cocktail to our children to drink? Would we be able give 
that explosive mixture, that poison which I just described, to 
our children to drink? This is what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the end of the eighties, the only age group that has 
significantly increased its tobacco consumption is the 15 to 19 
year olds. Where are the parents? We must provide that 
information, but we must also have it. 
I could not give that to my child. I could not accept that my 
child would take such a quantity of poison. Yet, according to 
statistics, this is what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a society, we have an obligation to act. In the case of young 
people aged 15 to 19, statistics on tobacco since the end of the 
1980s are staggering. At the end of the 1980s, the percentage of 
habitual smokers among female teenagers 15, 16, 17 and 18 of age 
24%. Today, it is 31%, an increase of almost a third since the 
end of the 1980s and early 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is cause for concern, when one considers the devastating 
effects of tobacco. 
At the end of the 1980s, 21.6% of teenagers aged 15 and over 
smoked. Today, it is 27.2%.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This too is a cause for concern because we know that diseases 
that can be developed, like emphysema, myocardial infarction, 
lung cancer and even strokes are linked to a lifelong 
investment, from youth to maturity. It is a cause for concern 
when teenagers, who will become young adults and mature adults, 
are increasingly becoming smokers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we should take urgent action to put an end to the 
deplorable increase of smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was recently reading a report that showed that the situation 
with young people between the ages of 20 and 24 is stable but a 
stable catastrophe is still a catastrophe. When one looks at the 
data for young people between 20 and 24, and these are young 
adults we are talking about here, it is surprising to see that 
39% of men and 32% of women in that age category are still 
smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, when people hit 40 or 50 years of age, which is the time 
when tobacco illnesses surface, they end up with the health they 
built in their youth. If they neglected their health when they 
were young, it will not improve as the years go by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am trying to say is that starting to smoke at a young age 
is a negative investment in one's health. 
It is a bad investment in one's health that can cause two major 
problems: first, it ensures a slow and painful death, and 
second, society has to pay for one's bad habit and one's choice 
not to quit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Smoking kills and it costs billions of dollars in health care 
and other services. That is something those with government 
responsibilities have to bear in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the packaging of cigarettes and the horrible and repulsive 
pictures to be displayed on the cigarette packs were debated in 
the House, the Bloc Quebecois tabled a report containing a 
number of recommendations to better discourage smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, of course, recommended an increase in taxes, which has 
proven to be an effective tool. It has been proven in the past 
that tax increases have a deterrent effect on young people. 
Young people do not have a lot of money, particularly 15, 16 and 
17 year olds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also said that putting photos on cigarette packs and 
increasing taxes was not enough. We need other solutions, such 
as requiring cigarette manufacturers to reduce the nicotine 
content of cigarettes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying earlier, there are hundreds if not thousands of 
toxic products in a cigarette but nicotine is the one chemical 
that creates addiction. It is as addictive as cocaine or 
heroine. 
This should be our first priority so that young people who try 
that first or second cigarette do not become addicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are means of reducing the nicotine level which, according 
to various scientific studies, should not exceed five milligrams a 
day for a person not to get addicted to cigarette smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will certainly remember the scandal. If the tobacco 
industry was able to increase the nicotine level to get more 
people addicted to their product, an act which is totally 
reprehensible, irresponsible, appalling and despicable, it means 
that science is sufficiently advanced to enable the industry to 
lower the nicotine level. 
It could be a first step toward helping people to quit smoking 
or preventing them from becoming addicted to smoking.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funding for anti-smoking campaign has to be increased as well. 
At the moment, some $40 million is spent on developing awareness. 
With new tax money available under C-26, $100 million could be 
set aside.  There is an urgent national need to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With slightly less than 30% of the population still smoking, 
still having the habit, and with the mortality rate of the 
various smokers' illnesses, and increased smoking by young 
people, it seems to me it would be worthwhile investing a little 
more money there. 
Instead of swelling surpluses or the government's consolidated 
fund, it seems to me that it would be a good idea to invest this 
tax surplus in information, training and public awareness, not 
only among children and adolescents, but among parents as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parents, we have huge responsibilities and we cannot know 
everything.  Despite all the information campaigns, I think 
there are still parents around, as there are adolescents, who 
are not completely in the picture about the problems of smoking 
and all its ins and outs.  They are also unaware of the 
consequences of this bad habit smoking.  We have to lay it all 
out in order to change these habits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past 20 years, progress has been made.  Fewer people 
smoke but there are target groups. 
Budgetary resources must be deployed such as information resources 
and 
educational resources, to ensure that there is reinvestment in 
health so that we do not end up 20 years from now with the 
same problems we have had for the last 20.  I am thinking of 
such things as the increasing incidence rates of lung cancer, 
emphysema and stroke.  Something must be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our second recommendation at that time, and one I believe is 
still current today, was additional funding.  There will be new 
funds connected with the new taxes imposed by the Minister of 
Finance on smokers and on the tobacco industry.  Please, let us 
use this money to invest in the health of our young teens.  It 
seems to me this would be a good thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our third point was that smoking is not the only thing that 
creates victims, so do changes to the industry.  If government 
continues its approach—and I choose this terminology because we 
are talking about smoking here—to burn an industry right off the 
map, even one as harmful as the tobacco industry, it must not 
penalize workers in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be tens of millions of dollars at stake.  Why 
could some of that not be earmarked for worker retraining and 
relocation?  Why could some not be set aside for policies on 
conversion from tobacco? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers in various regions of Quebec and of Canada are hurt by 
these measures.  They will hurt even more because the 
government, like ourselves, seems determined to continue to 
battle against smoking. 
Why not earmark an amount to help them retrain? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some farm families have invested a lot of money in machinery and 
land improvement to produce the best possible tobacco. Now that 
we are indirectly fighting this production, we must provide 
adjustment policies because there are none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago the level of taxes on tobacco was so high that 
contraband was thriving. There is a direct link between the 
level of taxes and smuggling. If smugglers can sell cigarettes 
at a cheaper price than on the market, contraband will become 
more prevalent as the gap grows between these two markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my fourth point. 
We support an increase on tobacco taxes. We support any other 
measure that might be effective in the fight against smoking. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we must realize that as taxes increase so 
will the urge to engage into contraband activities. This means 
that we must also step up law enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these four measures—although there is no quick fix for such 
an issue—we would be on the way to helping those who are addicted 
to tobacco, an addiction that is often the result of the 
industry's greed. In the United States—I do not know if the same 
thing was done in Canada—it even increased the nicotine content 
of its products to get more people addicted. It seems to me that 
the victims of that industry could benefit from these four 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These four initiatives would also help the some 30% of Canadians 
who currently smoke kick this harmful habit so that some day 
there will not be any smokers left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is my 
great pleasure to rise today and support the steps being taken in 
Bill C-26, an act to amend the various acts including the Customs 
Act and the Income Tax Act in respect to tobacco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in this Chamber knows that smoking kills.  Everyone 
knows that more needs to be done to help those Canadians addicted 
to nicotine to quit smoking.  More needs to be done especially to 
stop our kids from starting to smoke.  Our goal in this place 
should be a smoke free generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ways in which this can be done are to make this dangerous 
substance cost more, take away the incentives of tobacco 
companies and often less savoury organizations from making huge 
profits through smuggling, increase the taxes on what profits 
tobacco companies make and hopefully to divert the funds 
allocated to fight tobacco use in our population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 is a step in this direction and I commend the 
government for that but, and yes there is a but, there is much 
more to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax increase on tobacco could and should have been higher. 
I believe higher prices are a major deterrent to smoking, 
especially for young people.  The tax increase has been far too 
timid.  We need just look across the border at the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The price for a carton of cigarettes in Maine is $60.31 in 
Canadian dollars.  In New York state a carton in Canadian dollars 
costs $65.21.  In Michigan a carton costs $59.00 in Canadian 
dollars and so on.  What would the price of a carton of 
cigarettes be in Canada once this bill is in effect?  Our prices 
would range from a high of $54.38 in Newfoundland and Labrador to 
a low of $37.00 in Ontario.  There is more room to tax smokers 
without the terrible fear of smuggling, which dominated the 
headlines in the early 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's use of an export tax, once again a bit timidly, 
is a welcome step in allaying the fears of the development of new 
booming cigarette smuggling operations.  The financial measures 
contained in Bill C-26, including the clauses on taxing duty free 
cigarettes and eliminating the traveller's exemptions, are only 
the first steps to protecting ourselves, our neighbours and 
especially our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the excellent work which has been done by 
organizations, such as the Canadian Cancer Society, the Canadian 
Council for Tobacco Control, the Canadian Lung Association, the 
Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, the National Cancer 
Institute of Canada, the Non-Smokers' Rights Association and the 
Physicians for a Smoke-Free Canada, in developing an 
implementable plan of action which the government can use to 
further reduce tobacco consumption in our population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also feel compelled to congratulate Senator Kenny and my 
colleague from Winnipeg North Centre for their outstanding 
individual contributions in the fight against tobacco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most constant and recurring themes that these 
organizations and individuals have recognized as a priority is 
the need for adequate and sustained funding for tobacco control. 
The government currently takes in billions of dollars in taxes on 
cigarettes but does not spend anywhere near as much to directly 
discourage smoking.  These organizations say that at least $360 
million is needed to fight against smoking but the government has 
refused to commit those funds.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I reluctantly support Bill C-26, I wholeheartedly support 
Bill S-15, a bill that has the seeds of a comprehensive 
anti-smoking plan and a funding mechanism through an arm's length 
agency.  Bill S-15 would create a $360 million funding stream 
through a dedicated levy taken from tobacco manufacturers to an 
arm's length agency which would be committed to implementing real 
tobacco control programs aimed specifically at young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I would love to stand in this place and say we do not 
need any arm's length agency to deliver unnecessary health 
policy, but the government has shown itself to be playing both 
sides of the tobacco fence in the past.  Too many lives are at 
stake to trust this initiative to politicians.  We need these 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to leave the impression however that nothing has 
been done up until now.  I commend the government for the new 
bigger warning labels on cigarettes, and I look forward to them 
bringing in labels on alcohol bottles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the government for ending tobacco advertising even 
though I know the real pain that this initiative caused for many 
arts organizations across the country.  I also know that most 
arts organizations never liked accepting tobacco money but they 
were given no alternatives after years of Liberal cuts to the 
arts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The steps in Bill C-26 are not enough to move us toward a 
smoke-free generation.  We need to support community initiatives 
aimed at making smoking uncool to young people.  We need to work 
with all jurisdictions to make public places and all work places 
smoke-free.  We need fund multitudes of community initiatives to 
help those addicted to tobacco quit.  We need to eliminate the 
opportunities for our children to start smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, we have to get a lot more radical on this front.  I am 
not going to quote the horrific financial costs, both personal in 
health terms and as a country, that Canadians suffer due to 
tobacco.  I am sure we all know them here, even the smokers.  I 
will continue to urge the government to see Bill C-26 as only a 
small step towards this effort.  Furthermore, New Democrats will 
continue to push for Bill S-15 hopefully with improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is going to take real sustained funding programs, creativity 
and tenacity through many anti-smoking initiatives to lead us to 
our first smoke-free generation.  Let us get to work on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be splitting my time, Madam Speaker, with the hon. member 
for Churchill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the speech the member just 
made.  I spoke on this subject before question period.  I feel 
very passionately about it because of the impact that it has 
particularly on our people who take up a lifelong addiction when 
they start smoking.  The implications that this has range all the 
way from health to premature death and loss of loved family 
members to even issues like fires which are caused by careless 
smoking and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member care to address the one burning question, 
if I can use a pun here, on this issue?  Will the increase in 
taxes and the resulting increase in the cost of cigarettes 
actually curtail the number of young people who would start the 
habit?  Does she have confidence in the Liberal government 
actually stopping the resulting smuggling of cigarettes which may 
again increase.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill:</B>  Madam Speaker, we have room to further 
increase the cost of cigarettes without bringing about a massive 
smuggling effort.  As I said, the cost of a carton of cigarettes 
in Maine is $60.31 Canadian.  With the addition in Bill C-26, we 
would still not see our cigarettes go up that high.  We would see 
a range anywhere from $54.38 to $37.00 in Ontario.  Quite 
frankly, we need to put the prices a lot higher, then I think we 
would see a decrease in availability and a decrease of young 
people starting the habit. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the bill today. 
There has been much work done on behalf of the Standing Committee 
on Health.  I recognize that the government is making efforts to 
improve the situation to reduce smoking among Canadians.  Also, 
our health critic, the member from Winnipeg North Centre, has 
been very active and keeps us abreast of everything that has been 
going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to dwell so much on Bill C-26 as to the specifics 
of it.  We are going to support the bill.  Any incentive or 
anything we can do to decrease the opportunity for young people 
to begin smoking and to discourage people from smoking, is 
definitely the route to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no shame in admitting now that I started smoking when I 
was 12 years old.  By the time I quite I was smoking a pack and a 
half to two packs a day.  I could barely breathe when I got up in 
the morning.  I did not have the guts to go to my doctor and say 
that I had a problem with my lungs.  My biggest incentive to quit 
was not being able to face my doctor and listen to him give me a 
good tongue lashing over the fact that I was smoking and 
complaining about not being able to breathe.  It took a number of 
attempts but I have not smoked for close to 20 years.  I have had 
my moments when it seemed like a not so bad idea.  Maybe price is 
a deterrent but I am not sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly think we must do everything to discourage people 
from smoking.  I have to admit I am truly concerned that this 
increasing will just not cut it.  I have seen young people buying 
one cigarette at a time from someone down the street.  For 25 
cents a cigarette, children as young as seven or eight years old 
can pick up a cigarette from certain people they know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that video games, trips to the arcades and little 
hand held Game Boys are a lot more expensive than a 25 cent 
cigarette.  Those same young people, who have money for those 
things, are the ones who are out there buying the cigarettes. 
They may not have to pay the $6 or $7 a pack but they can buy 
them individually a little at a time.  It is not hard to find a 
quarter lying around in the shopping carts or wherever.  There 
will be money available for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is of the utmost importance is that we have proper 
education in place and that we have proper pharmaceutical 
supplies available, whether it be Nicorette or the patch.  It is 
important to have these available to assist people when they do 
want to quit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tried to quit a number of times and I know there are people 
out there, even teenagers, who by the time they are 16 or 17 are 
thinking about quitting but they cannot afford buy a box of 
Nicorette.  I am sorry to use just Nicorette but it is the only 
name that comes to mind.  I am not giving them advertising and I 
am not getting paid for using that product.  A lot of people want 
to quit but they cannot afford to buy Nicorette or the patch. 
They do not have a prescription plan available where they can go 
out and get it.  As a result it makes their job to quit that much 
harder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I personally would like to see is a more sincere effort to 
dedicate dollars to education and to help people quit smoking. 
Maybe what we need is dollars or legislation to say to those 
tobacco companies that they will have to pay for all of the 
products that people who smoke need to use to help them quit. 
They should be required to pay for the oxygen required when 
someone's lungs get so bad they cannot breathe because they are 
responsible for it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tobacco companies, after all these years, now admit, for the 
most part, that they deliberately encouraged people to take up 
smoking and made it habit forming by increasing the concentration 
of certain chemicals within the cigarette. I would much rather 
see an increase in education than an increase in the cost of 
cigarettes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those of us who do not smoke, no one complains more about a 
smoker than someone who has quit smoking.  I know a number of 
smokers who want to quit but who have a hard time quitting.  They 
do need help and we need to provide that help. Increasing the 
price of cigarettes will not make their lives any easier. 
Granted, we should not hand cigarettes to them at will. They do 
need to pay a reasonable price because of the additional health 
care costs, not just for smokers but for others around them, 
associated with secondhand smoke and numerous other factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children in homes of people who smoke are jeopardized.  I wonder 
if at some point we may need to seriously consider whether we are 
injuring our children by continuing to smoke or having them in 
smoke filled places.  We need to decrease the opportunities where 
people are able to smoke or where they inhale smoke, but slamming 
an increase in the cost of cigarettes on smokers will not do it. 
We need to have the dedicated dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the issues that I get the most mail on, to the credit of 
Senator Kenny, is his bill.  I have received literally hundreds 
and hundreds of letters supporting Senator Kenny's bill to ensure 
that dedicated dollars go to education.  Recognizing that there 
is that support, we need to push along in those areas and 
dedicate dollars.  People do not have faith that the government 
will use tax dollars for the benefit of health care, to assist 
smokers and those around them, and perhaps look after the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of creating a bullheadedness between smokers and 
non-smokers, between tobacco industry workers and those opposed 
to smoking, we need an alternative plan for those workers and 
alternative uses for tobacco other than smoking, so that we are 
not creating these head on forces.  We do not need these 
divisions with smokers literally cursing every non-smoker around. 
This might make smokers put more of an effort into trying to 
quit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish it could be quicker but I think we are a long way from a 
generation of non-smokers unless we seriously commit to educating 
people and deceasing the number of places where people can smoke. 
One of the best routes that we have taken which has had the most 
impact is having fewer places where it is okay to smoke. It is 
wonderful, even for smokers, to enter a place that is not filled 
with a haze of smoke.  Our eyes do not get as sore.  Smokers have 
to go outside for a smoke but overall even smokers appreciate the 
curtains and the ceilings not being covered with smoke.  Smokers 
appreciate areas where there is non-smoking as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the things that we need to be doing, along with 
possibly increasing the cost of cigarettes.

their door even though it does not always go well with their 
friends.

that because I have quit, but the bottom line is that it has to 
come from somewhere.  As a true representation of what we think 
people should be doing, we should all make a commitment to be 
non-smokers .

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
this morning the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> had an op-ed piece 
commenting on warning labels.  One of the members of the NDP had 
a motion before the House dealing with health warning labels on 
containers of alcoholic beverages.  I found that to be an 
interesting argument with regard to warning labels in general. 
The applicability of warning labels with regard to tobacco is 
important, but the key point is that there is no empirical 
evidence that such labels work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put a comment forward and perhaps the hon. member 
would like to comment on it.  To have empirical evidence would 
mean measuring things before and after doing something but 
keeping all other things constant over a long period of time to 
look at the marginal impact.  This is not an issue of 
subjectivity about whether something will work or not.  Labelling 
in itself is part of a more comprehensive strategy, including 
taxation and other healthy, lifestyle choices initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view Canadians have a right to know and a right to make 
choices, but in terms of having a comprehensive approach to 
healthy lifestyle choices for people, proper taxation, proper 
labelling and proper health incentives are a big part of it. 
Public education and awareness are probably the most significant 
factors which are key to changing behaviour.  If we are going to 
change behaviour, we need to ensure that the public are properly 
informed in every possible way so that they can make healthy 
lifestyle choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Madam Speaker, I missed sharing this 
little story with everyone and the member has given me the 
opportunity to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member when he said that people have the right 
to know what is coming, whether they are inhaling it, eating it, 
drinking it or whatever, so they can then make conscious 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention the different tobacco packaging.  A young 
woman goes into a store and asks for a pack of cigarettes without 
a picture of ugly teeth.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is funny the way things work.  It is enough that it just 
sickens us a bit.  If we happen to break down and sit with 
smokers at a table and they throw their pack of cigarettes down, 
for everyone else at the table the package is enough to make them 
a little ill.  We should go ahead a do everything we can do to 
make it that much more distasteful.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, my question 
is for the member for Churchill. I found her speech most 
interesting. I am also a former smoker who had to fight hard and 
for a long time to kick the habit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the laws are tougher and if health warnings are required 
on cigarette packaging to warn about the dangers of smoking and 
so on, I notice that today the companies seem to easily sell 
their products in certain places, via television shows in 
particular. If I am not mistaken, there seems to be more actors 
smoking on television, particularly amongst the young actors and 
the stars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how the producers of those shows could be made to join 
the fight and stop playing the companies' game. 
I would like the member to tell me what she thinks of the idea 
of trying to get young actors to stop holding a cigarette or 
smoking on television. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am torn on that one 
having raised three sons, having been around a number of young 
people, having been a school trustee, and having been young and 
having started smoking.  Sometimes the criticism of smoking is 
incentive enough for young people to think they should smoke 
because they want to take that stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need legislation to disallow producers from taking any kind 
of cash payment or any kind of payment from tobacco companies to 
promote smoking.  That is the issue.  There are tobacco companies 
and cigarette producers which are feeding into movie producers 
and sponsoring them if they have smoking in their presentations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, in 1919 at Barnes Hospital 
in St. Louis, Missouri, a doctor summoned some medical students 
to an autopsy saying that the patient's disease was so rare that 
most of the students would never see it again.  It was lung 
cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This story is from a December 1992 article by Dr. John Meyers 
entitled “Cigarette Century” from <I>Time</I> magazine.  It 
illuminates like a lightning flash this fact: much, probably 
most, of our hideously costly health care crisis is caused by 
unwise behaviour associated with drugs, eating, driving 
recklessly, sex, alcohol, violence, insufficient exercise and 
especially smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Focusing on wellness, on preventing rather than causing illness, 
will reduce the waste inherent in disease oriented hospital 
centred high tech medicine.  The history of the connection 
between cigarettes and lung cancer illustrates the fallacy of 
associating health with the delivery of medicine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those 1919 medical students later wrote that he did not 
see another case of lung cancer until 1936.  Then, in six months, 
he saw nine cases.  By the 1930s advances in immunology and 
public health measures such as sanitation, the handling of food 
and so on, were reducing the incidence of infectious diseases. 
However we were about to experience an epidemic in behaviourally 
driven disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lung cancer epidemic can be said to have sprung from the 
1881 invention of a cigarette making machine.  Prior to that 
commercial manufacturing of cigarettes was largely a cottage 
industry.  However by 1888 North Carolina's James Buchanan Duke, 
whose wealth brought Duke University to life, was selling nearly 
a billion cigarettes annually throughout North America.  Between 
1910 and 1919, cigarette production increased by 633%.  The U.S. 
national cigarette service committee distributed cigarettes free 
to soldiers in France during World War I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1930 the lung cancer death rate among men was less than five 
per 100,000 per year.  By the 1950s, after another war in which 
cigarettes were sold for a nickel a pack, were distributed free 
in forward areas and were included with K-rations to soldiers, 
the lung cancer death rate among men had quadrupled to more than 
20 per 100,000. 
Today it is more than 70 per 100,000.  Women's lung cancer rates 
are soaring and lung cancer is far and away the leading cause of 
cancer deaths.

</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the World Health Organization, about half of all 
long term smokers die from tobacco related illnesses and half of 
those die in middle age, losing 20 to 25 years of productive 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have come a long way from the early days of television when 
sponsor-anchorman John Cameron Swayze's <I>The Camel News 
Caravan</I> required him to have a lit cigarette constantly 
visible to the audience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social disaster of smoking addiction illustrates why 
behaviour modification, especially education, is the key to 
containing health costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that end, legislation such as the bill we are debating today, 
the tobacco excise tax act, can serve the public good.  However 
the government must address concerns about the increased 
smuggling that may result from a spike in tobacco costs and the 
difficulty of policing our vast borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget that when combating smoking, drugs, foul 
language and other mischievous activities, especially among the 
young, social stigma has its place, as the member for Elk Island 
put it.  Information campaigns about the public health dangers of 
smoking have a role to play as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The addictive qualities of tobacco and the craving for the 
product at the lowest possible price could spur a dramatic 
increase in cigarette smuggling.  On January 27, 1994, the member 
for Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, the current government House 
leader, recognized these concerns when he told the House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country is faced with a serious smuggling problem.  As a 
non-smoker, I am generally in favour of high taxes on tobacco to 
help discourage young people from smoking.  However, the reality 
in Canada today is completely different.  Because of the 
smuggling problem in our country, almost any young Canadian can 
buy cigarettes cheaply, even illegally...We have no choice, Mr. 
Speaker.  We must put an end to this illegal activity by 
reducing, however temporarily, taxes on tobacco.  We have to work 
together to enforce the laws of our country. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was followed by an ambitious crackdown on cigarette 
smugglers.  The government told MPs it would dedicate 700 RCMP 
officers to anti-smuggling operations and that anyone 
participating in the tobacco smuggling trade in any capacity 
would be subject to the full range of sanctions and penalties 
under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presumably enthused by the new found enforcement of our laws, on 
October 20, 1994, the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca 
called on the government to restore the tax on tobacco to the 
level that existed on January 1 of that year and to put the 
increased revenue into health care financing.  His call was 
opposed by the current government House leader who told members 
the smuggling situation persisted and that the Minister of Health 
had tabled a report two months earlier which had showed the 
reduction in taxes had not resulted in an increase in smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader was wrong.  From 1979 to 1991 the 
real price of cigarettes in Canada increased by 159% and teenage 
smoking fell from 42% to 16%.  In 1994 Canada's reduced tobacco 
taxes, which were in response to concerns about smuggling, caused 
the real price of cigarettes to fall by one-third.  As a result, 
teenage smoking increased from 16% to 20% and total tobacco 
consumption began increasing, especially among young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a health point of view this was a clear and significant 
failure.  Revenue losses were equally acute.  The February 1994 
tax cuts resulted in a combined federal and provincial revenue 
loss of over $1.2 billion for the fiscal year 1994-95.  The 
federal loss was $656 million, more than twice what the 
government had predicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the government increased cigarette prices to try to 
reduce consumption.  On April 20 of that year the member for 
Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier rose in the House to inform his 
colleagues that the morning's papers showed that the increase had 
brought back cigarette smuggling with a vengeance to southern 
Quebec and Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has dropped the ball on this file in the past, 
both on the taxation side and the smuggling side.  The 
government's batting average has been far from good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 9, 2000, during a debate of Bill C-24, the so-called 
sales tax and excise tax amendment act, the member for North 
Vancouver reminded the House that up to that point, despite the 
government's dedication of over 700 RCMP officers to the cause, 
not one person had been charged with cigarette smuggling.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that same day's debate the member for Elk Island told the 
House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was about three, four or five years ago that cigarette 
smuggling was a huge issue, so the government decided to reduce 
the taxes on cigarettes to make the price differential between 
smuggled cigarettes and those purchased at the store less so 
there would be less demand for the black market, thereby reducing 
smuggling.  The government tells us that this has had some 
effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24 will once again increase cigarette taxes...However, I 
have to ask the question:  If high taxes were part of the reason 
for developing the smuggling industry in the first place, would 
it not be possible that by increasing these taxes, as Bill C-24 
will do, the problem will return? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not a member of the House when those comments were made 
and yet today we are considering the same question with Bill 
C-26. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having worked in Ottawa in 1997 and 1998 and travelled to and 
from British Columbia extensively at the time, I can tell my 
colleagues that straight prices for cigarettes in Ottawa were 
roughly the same as duty free prices for cigarettes at Vancouver 
International Airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time federal cigarette taxes were high in Vancouver but 
dramatically reduced in the Ottawa area in an attempt to reduce 
smuggling in this part of the country.  If taxes are to have the 
universal benefit of reducing smoking they must be applied at the 
same level in every part of the country.  There cannot be a gap 
in the cost of cigarettes across Canada.  This has been a failure 
in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a person who is interested in discouraging smoking from coast 
to coast, I remind the government that unless it deals 
effectively with smugglers and enforces the laws of our country, 
the problems that have plagued past efforts to reduce smoking 
will return to haunt the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon passage of the bill it is important that the government 
carefully and aggressively establish a plan to fight an impending 
surge of smuggling.  If it does not, the good intentions behind 
the bill will fail to produce what most Canadians want: a 
healthier country inhabited by fewer smokers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am very interested in the smuggling 
issue with respect to raising taxes on cigarettes.  I may have 
missed the early part of the member opposite's speech.  Did he 
make any reference to the price of cigarettes and tobacco in the 
United States? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last go around on this issue, the reason 
smuggling became such a large industry, particularly in eastern 
Canada and the Montreal area, was because of the price disparity 
of cigarettes across the border.  I wonder whether the member 
opposite has done any analysis or looked at all at what the 
current prices of tobacco are right now vis-à-vis the time before 
when we went through a major price increase because it seems to 
me that the price of cigarettes in the United States has risen in 
the interval and that may ameliorate the smuggling problem when 
we raise the taxes ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore:</B>  The point is taken, Madam Speaker. 
However the member knows that in the United States, just as in 
Canada, the lion's share of cigarette costs is taxation.  In the 
United States, therefore, as we see with as Michigan, New York, 
North Dakota and Washington, cigarette prices vary from state to 
state.  This puts an increased obligation on Canada to keep 
smuggling out of the country, and we must fulfil that 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member knows, in places like Akwesasne we have a 
tremendously complex border with differing police jurisdictions 
and the government must make sure it sufficiently guards that 
border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also note that one cause of cigarette smuggling is the 
increase in price that results from aggressive taxation policies 
designed to discourage smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Great Britain, for example, the government has decided to 
implement, on an interim basis and with a sunset clause, a 5% 
increase in cigarettes taxes each year.  The U.K. government 
argues that it is best if such increases are done cyclically, as 
seen with Canada's increase of 1993, its drop of 1994, its 
increases of 1996 and 1998, and its expected increase of 2001. 
If such tax increases are too great or too sudden they will cause 
a surge in the black market.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government in Westminster has implemented a gradual increase 
in taxation.  There is no instant spurring of the cost of 
cigarettes and therefore no spurring of black market or smuggling 
activity.  That is the sort of legislation the Canadian 
government should keep in mind if it is to continue down the path 
of increasing cigarette taxes to reduce consumption. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield (Yellowhead, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a great privilege to speak to Bill C-26 concerning 
the raising of taxes on cigarettes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My position is not an easy one to take.  When I consider raising 
taxes I swallow rather hard.  Canadians are hurting desperately 
because of the taxes they pay, and imposing even more taxes 
cannot be healthy for the country.  However the bill is less 
about raising taxes than about stopping the use of cigarettes. It 
is a health matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of cigarettes in our country has become a serious health 
issue and it must stop.  I have been involved in the health care 
system for many years.  When I talk with my counterparts I 
understand that one in six patients has a tobacco related 
problem.  Canada has a critical problem with its health care 
system and cigarette smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However to suggest that increasing cigarette taxes will solve 
the country's health care woes is misguided and dangerous.  It is 
only one piece of the puzzle.  We need to look at the whole 
puzzle and determine what must be done to change the paradigm and 
the way people think about tobacco use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be better to ask where cigarette taxes are being spent. 
If they are not being spent to determine the health dangers of 
cigarettes then we have a serious problem.  We need a game plan 
that does more than raise taxes because that is not the whole 
issue.  The issue is about stopping cigarettes and the damage 
they do to the health of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should ask whether that can be accomplished.  My father 
smoked all his life.  I look at kids today and think of when I 
went to school and how difficult it was to discern whether or not 
to smoke.  I was saved because of a basketball team and a coach 
who decided that if we smoked we would not be able to play. Those 
were the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Teenagers are very vulnerable.  The battle is about who will win 
the minds of our children with regard to cigarettes:  the tobacco 
companies which are putting more and more nicotine into their 
cigarettes so they are more addictive, or the government which 
should address the issue in an educational sense so that 
teenagers know they are becoming victims rather than exercising 
free choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe a society should have free choice and that we should 
stop victimizing the weak.  Someone who starts smoking at age 13 
will have spent $15,000 on tobacco by age 30.  That is a down 
payment on a good home or half the price of a good car.  That 
does not even take into account the health effects of smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tobacco companies in Canada reap $260 million in profits every 
year from the sale of cigarettes to teenagers.  Ninety per cent 
of those who start smoking do so between the ages of 13 and 20. 
That is where the battle must be fought.  Approximately 28% of 
teenage girls in Canada smoke cigarettes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real question is whether we can win the war.  Can we win the 
battle at that level?  Let us look at the example of alcohol. 
Massive education campaigns have seen drinking and driving in 
Canada decline dramatically from what it was a couple of decades 
ago.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be careful when we look at other countries and 
examine what they are doing.  What California has done is worthy 
of note.  It has put the pieces of the puzzle together a little 
more than we have here in Canada.  As a result it has moved its 
percentage of teenage smokers from 30% down to 9% today.  That is 
a success story that we need to perhaps model ourselves on and 
improve on, because it is an area that we have to look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole area of health care is something I would like to 
address because it is a bigger picture issue.  We need to 
understand that if we are to address efficiencies in health care 
and sustain a health care system, we have to look at the bigger 
picture of preventative health.  Since the seventies we have been 
talking about preventative health and yet I see very little 
effort directed to doing something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill moves very slightly in that direction, but we have to 
recognize that as the baby boomer bubble hits our health care 
system we have to do more than just add funds to the system and 
stop the crisis management of health as Canadians end up in our 
emergency wards or clinics.  To start with, we have to look at 
preventing them from becoming ill.  That is something we have to 
look at in a bigger scheme.  To do that we must recognize how 
smoking impacts our health care system.  We have to realize that 
$3 billion is spent in direct costs for hospitalization and 
physician time in regard to smoking, and another $8 billion is 
spent in lost productivity in the workplace.  Those are amazing 
figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labour Canada estimates that it costs between $2,300 and $2,600 
more to employ an individual who is a smoker.  The rate of 
absenteeism in the workplace has increased because of it.  Life 
insurance premiums have also gone up.  Not only is there a 
productivity cost due to smoking, but there are other direct 
costs.  These are the things we do not really recognize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to get to the teenaged mind.  Teenagers need to 
understand that not only is it costly to smoke and not only does 
it stink, and in more ways than one, but there is very little 
upside to smoking and to becoming addicted to something that will 
harness them to an addiction they cannot escape.  I have talked 
to a lot of people who smoke.  Very few of them want to smoke. 
Most of them want to quit, for many reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I had five individuals in my office.  One of them was 
the president of the Canadian Dental Association.  I have never 
thought about cigarettes and their effect on dentistry.  These 
people came to my office to talk about cigarettes and what they 
see as they look into the mouths of Canadians.  What they see is 
that baby boomers keep more of their teeth as a result of 
accomplishments in the dentistry field.  However, they are 
suffering from far more cancers because of their cigarette 
smoking.  Dentists are very concerned with the amount of gum 
disease and cancers of the mouth that they see brought on because 
of cigarettes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to impress upon the House how important it is that we 
look at funding a plan to address teenage smoking.  Just raising 
the cost of cigarettes is not the issue.  If we took the money 
raised and put it into such a plan, Canadians would support it 
much more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what amazes me and why I ask the House to implement such 
a plan.  The bill was introduced once before.  Now it takes 40 
pages to introduce the legislation and 50 pages to explain why. I 
am a little suspicious.  It was introduced in 1998 by the Senate 
and supported at that time by the health minister. Unfortunately 
the Speaker of the House did not support it because he felt it 
was a taxation issue, not a health issue.  Obviously this is a 
health issue and not a taxation issue.

this is happening and about what kind of energy is behind it.  If 
we do not address it as just one piece of a very large puzzle, 
then we will have missed our opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House needs to examine it as not just a taxation issue but a 
health issue, one that has to be addressed in our country.  We

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-305, an act to amend the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 
(inventory of brownfields), be read the second time and referred 
to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, in the short time that I have to defend 
my bill, Bill C-305, I will try to address four key areas:  a 
definition, an explanation, the need for and approaches to 
remediation, and the reasons why this legislation should be 
deemed votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is a brownfield?  According to the 1998 report by the 
National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, entitled 
“State of the Debate on the Environment and the Economy: 
Greening Canada's Brownfield Sites”, brownfields are defined as: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—abandoned or underused properties where past actions have 
caused real or suspected environmental contamination.  Although 
they are classified as a subset of contaminated sites, these 
sites exhibit good potential for other uses and usually provide 
economically viable business opportunities.  They are mainly 
located in established urban areas, where existing municipal 
services are readily available, or along transportation 
corridors.  They may include, but are not limited to: 
decommissioned refineries, railway yards, dilapidated warehouses, 
abandoned gas stations, former dry cleaners and other commercial 
properties where toxic substances have been stored or used. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am only guessing but I dare say each and every one of us in 
the House of Commons has a brownfield site or two in our ridings. 
Redevelopment of brownfields is often paralyzed due to a variety 
of reasons, including uncertainty regarding liability and 
ownership, and provincial and federal liens.  Since brownfields 
are normally located within urban areas, municipalities are the 
main drivers of brownfield development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of brownfields is in contrast to that of 
greenfields, that is, low cost virgin land on the urban fringe 
which is often more attractive for industrial or commercial 
relocation or expansion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we need to remediate and what are the approaches to 
remediation?  The advantages to the remediation of brownfields 
are obvious:  job growth, the revitalization of our downtown 
cores and the reversal of urban sprawl, as well as the cleanup of 
potentially environmentally hazardous sites right in our own 
backyards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing in many cities today is the growth of the 
urban doughnut, where the city expands ever outward while the 
once vital core becomes nothing but a hole.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need a police study to convince anyone in this place of 
the high crime rates in brownfield areas.  They can be dangerous 
places, not only for environmental reasons but also because of 
the threat to personal safety.  Vacant lots and abandoned sites 
become lairs for drug users and violent criminals.  Perfectly 
good commercial and residential land which just happens to be 
nearby such an area drops in value because of its proximity to 
the abandoned sites.  In short, these sites are dangerous, ugly 
and wasteful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we begin this new millennium, we need to adopt the new 
virtues of reduce, reuse and recycle in ways that are more than 
just putting newspapers and pop cans in the blue box.  The three 
Rs hold a lesson for city development as well.  All of our cities 
and towns are stuck in the wasteful habit of growing outward and 
ignoring their cores.  This trend cannot continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By encouraging brownfield remediation and reclamation, cities 
and towns can capitalize on infrastructure already in place, such 
as roads, sewers, et cetera.  The strain on public transit 
systems will be eased by putting people to work in town rather 
than in newly developed areas.  Increased construction, commerce 
and real estate transactions will return to where they were, to 
where they are most needed, to downtown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Toronto in April 1998, an international symposium was held, 
entitled “Redeveloping Brownfields:  A Different Conversation”. 
I would like to pass on to my colleagues the findings of the 
executive summary of that comprehensive symposium.  Ten 
recommendations were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is no single generic approach.  Best practices for 
brownfield redevelopment are not so much a list of directions or 
a prescription as much as a new way of thinking.  The best 
redevelopment approach is closely related to a site's competitive 
advantage, its marketability, the intended use and location.  The 
key is to integrate site restoration and the land redevelopment 
process in a way that fosters reinvestment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, a project is nothing without a vision.  It is important 
to be able to imagine and articulate the possibilities, to 
describe what others cannot yet see, because brownfield 
redevelopment is about protecting and revitalizing the very heart 
of our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, integration makes it happen.  Planning, design and 
environmental issues should be addressed together in an 
integrated, transparent process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, a decisive set of players is needed.  Project teams must 
have diverse skills and experience.  In addition, brownfield 
redevelopments benefit from collaboration among players, 
regulators, citizens, investors, bankers, technical experts and 
other members of the design team.  Getting the right players 
involved at the right time saves money and effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, every brownfield project requires partnerships to make it 
work.  Those partnerships can result in consensus about the next 
use and site design as well as innovative financing strategies, 
formal agreements regarding cleanup and monitoring, and ongoing 
communication and community development initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, local government and its citizens know best what is 
needed to spark reinvestment in brownfields.  The local spark may 
come from the public sector, such as a city department, agency or 
politician, or the non-profit sector such as, for example, the 
local economic or community development corporation.  Improving 
the investment climate by clarifying and streamlining the 
decision process and articulating the community vision are two 
areas where local government can play a key role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventh, risk based decision making is about managing change, 
ensuring that environmental and human health are protected in 
cost effective ways and making sound economic investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighth, broadening the scope of the decision leads to better 
understanding and better decisions.  Effective communication 
should be seen as a priority task for all members of the project 
team. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ninth point is best viewed as a shared responsibility of 
private and public sectors.  When we speak of education around 
the issue of brownfields the decision has traditionally been 
focused on public education.  The question of education and 
learning must be more comprehensive and should include all 
stakeholders, such as risk assessors, lenders, landowners, 
purchasers and developers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the last point is that many successes have resulted 
from upfront public sector investment in environmental 
restoration, infrastructure improvements and job creation. 
Setting a new standard for design and land use can go a long way 
to improve the investment climate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that members present consider these recommendations 
as they listen to the details of my proposed legislation and 
evaluate it accordingly.  I have endeavoured to take these 
recommendations to heart in my consideration of the problem of 
brownfield remediation and I believe that this bill, Bill C-305, 
is an effective first step toward this goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the bill would amend the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act to expand an existing registry that is already 
there.  Any member of the public can report suspected 
contaminated sites with the express purpose of building an easily 
accessible national registry of brownfields.  The registry would 
accept voluntary reports of contaminated lands according to 
regulations which would determine how much evidence of 
contamination is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also allow the federal government, together with 
provincial, municipal and private partners, to assist with the 
often prohibitive costs of environmental assessments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To solve a problem, we first need to identify the problem. 
Ultimately I see this as a three stage process: identification, 
assessment and remediation.  The bill addresses the first two 
stages directly.  First, we identify the extent of brownfields 
right across the country and once we know where these sites are 
we can begin to assess the costs of the cleanup.  Having this 
information open and available to all levels of government and 
private enterprise would foster co-operative and innovative 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a small but crucial step toward reclaiming these 
commercially useful sites, revitalizing our city centres and 
combating urban sprawl.  The existing public registry system, 
under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, was set up to 
facilitate public awareness to ensure convenient public access to 
records on projects requiring environmental assessments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the impediments to brownfield remediation is the 
reluctance to report a site due to the expense involved with the 
assessment.  By expanding the registry to include not only 
projects requiring an environmental assessment, in other words 
sites already in the process of remediation, but also suspected 
sites, the public will have access to information about sites 
that are lying dormant.  This is the key difference between the 
existing legislation and the changes I am proposing in Bill 
C-305. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment there is little or no concerted effort by the 
federal or provincial governments to address the issue of 
contaminated property that is cheaper and legally safer for the 
owner to ignore and let lie fallow rather than clean it up or 
sell it to someone who will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of the legislation would permit the federal 
government to fund projects before the environmental assessment 
is completed, in other words to pay for the assessment.  Bill 
C-305 would exempt projects from one component of the 
environmental assessment process.  No assessment would be 
required before the federal government provides any funding but 
only as long as the funds are used to pay for the actual 
assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned before, one of the impediments to remediation is 
the prohibitive cost of environmental assessments.  What I 
propose is that the federal government be allowed, be allowed I 
say especially to the Bloc who I know has a concern about 
jurisdiction, not obligated, to fund the assessment possibly in 
co-operation with the provincial and municipal governments and 
private partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should the legislation be deemed votable?  I believe that my 
bill meets the five criteria which the standing committee 
responsible for private members' business has set out:  First, 
the bill is clear, complete and effective; second, the bill is 
constitutional and concerns only an area of federal jurisdiction; 
third, the bill concerns a matter of significant public interest; 
fourth, the bill concerns an issue that is not part of the 
current legislative agenda and has not been addressed by the 
House; and fifth, the bill is not of a purely local interest and 
certainly is non-partisan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By virtue of its voluntary nature, the registry would not 
encroach upon provincial jurisdiction. 
What the registry would do is collect and share voluntarily 
submitted information, thereby fostering intergovernmental and 
private co-operation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no punitive measures associated with being on the 
list.  In fact, it would be in the interest of a brownfield site 
owner to be on the list, as it would open up opportunities for 
remediation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of brownfields remediation is a matter of highly 
significant public interest.  This is a problem of enormous 
magnitude which is long overdue for some kind of a solution. 
According to the redeveloping brownfields symposium, it is 
estimated that there are 2,900 such sites in Canada with an 
estimated cost of $3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Permit me to read from a part of the report from the symposium. 
It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By far, the overriding success stories in the United States 
Brownfields program have turned on the ability of the parties to 
engage all appropriate decision makers and for all decision 
makers to have a common goal of redevelopment using flexible 
decision making authority.  The cooperative approach, very 
consistent with the Canadian style of regulation, will be the key 
to the success of redevelopment in any jurisdiction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My proposed legislation, without overstepping federal 
jurisdiction, can do just that, by initiating a co-operative 
movement between all levels of government and the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by re-emphasizing my earlier statements.  To solve a 
problem we must first identify the problem.  Ultimately, I see 
this as a three stage process:  identification, assessment, 
remediation.  The bill addresses the first two stages directly. 
First, we identify the extent of brownfields right across the 
country. Once we know where these sites are, we can begin to 
assess the costs of the clean-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having the information open and available to all levels of 
government and private enterprise will foster co-operative and 
innovative solutions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise with pleasure to take 
part in the debate on Bill C-305, which proposes to establish a 
national registry of contaminated sites through amendments to the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I commend the hon. member for Hamilton West on his 
ultimate goal to rejuvenate contaminated sites.  I share his 
goal.  I have a number of contaminated or brownfield sites in my 
riding of Etobicoke North.  In 1999 I worked with a graduate 
student from the University of Toronto who developed a report 
entitled “Rexdale Brownfield Sites:  A Framework for 
Understanding”.  It dealt with a number of policy issues and 
alternatives.  I submitted the report to city councillors, the 
provincial government, the Minister of the Environment and other 
stakeholder groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ensuring that Canadians have a clean and healthy environment is 
an important goal for our government.  For example, the recent 
Speech from the Throne notes that for Canadians, protecting the 
environment is not an option.  It is something we must do. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his reply to the Speech from the Throne, the Prime Minister 
stated that a safe, healthy environment is essential to the 
health of Canadians and to the future of our children.  We will 
accelerate our efforts at home and internationally to foster a 
clean environment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These contaminated sites or brownfields are a legacy of poor 
environmental practices in the past.  Because of this terrible 
legacy we have shifted our thinking and our efforts toward 
preventing environmental damage before it occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government strengthened the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act so that it focused on pollution prevention.  The 
Minister of the Environment recently introduced Bill C-19 to 
strengthen the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act so that 
future development projects do not cause environmental harm.  In 
this context, it is necessary to look at Bill C-305 to determine 
if it would help us better achieve our environmental goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes to do two things.  First, it suggests that the 
current registry system in the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act be altered so that any individual could report and therefore 
register contaminated sites in municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Bill C-305 would enable the federal government to 
provide financial assistance for the environmental assessment of 
projects to remediate contaminated lands.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to bring the House up to date on recent 
developments relevant to the hon. member's proposal. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of the Environment just completed an exhaustive and 
comprehensive review of the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act.  This review included the release of a discussion paper in 
December 1999 with options for improving the current law. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public consultation phase of this review comprised 38 
sessions in 19 cities across Canada.  One day workshops were held 
in six major centres.  The Internet was put to good use as a 
means to distribute information and solicit the views of 
Canadians.  Over 200 written submissions were received.  All 
told, the Minister of the Environment heard from a broad cross 
section of Canadians:  environmental assessment practitioners, 
provincial governments, industry, environmental groups, 
communities, aboriginal people and individual Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the findings of the review was that the goal of 
facilitating public participation in environmental assessment has 
not been fully achieved.  In particular, the current system of 
establishing a separate paper based registry for projects that 
undergo an environmental assessment has not worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that Bill C-305 is based on the same registry system 
concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 20 the Minister of the Environment tabled his report to 
parliament on the outcome of his review, entitled Strengthening 
Environmental Assessment for Canadians, and Bill C-19 proposes 
specific Amendments for Improving the current act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 proposes to create a new Internet based government-wide 
registry of information about the environmental assessment of 
specific projects.  As a result, Canadians will have easy access 
to information about projects in their communities and across 
the country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because it is based on the current act, the proposal in Bill 
C-305 does not really mesh with the amendments in Bill C-19, the 
amendments that require the establishment of a new modern 
registry that takes advantage of the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the proposal in Bill C-305 would mix the objective of 
ensuring that Canadians have access to information about the wide 
range of projects that undergo a federal environmental 
assessment, such as proposed mines, dams, roads and pipelines, 
with the important task of identifying and registering 
contaminated sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons, Bill C-305 would not help us better achieve 
our environmental goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second related point I would like to make is that the 
discretionary authority to provide financial assistance for the 
environmental assessment of projects to remediate contaminated 
sites, as proposed in Bill C-305, is not necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act already goes 
much further by requiring environmental assessments of 
remediation projects where there is federal involvement as a 
proponent, as a provider of financial assistance or land, or as a 
regulator.  For example, remediation projects with federal 
financial assistance have triggered requirements for an 
assessment under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also be mindful of provincial jurisdiction.  Many of the 
contaminated sites that are the target of Bill C-305 would fall 
within provincial areas of responsibility. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean that the federal government does not work 
with its provincial partners on this issue.  Quite the opposite. 
Through the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment, 
Environment Canada has provided the scientific expertise 
necessary for the development of a national classification system 
for contaminated sites, as well as a comprehensive set of 
guidance manuals promoting the consistent assessment and 
remediation of contaminated sites across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is also taking measures to get its own 
House in order.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With over 25,000 owned and leased properties, it is essential 
that we identify and clean up contaminated sites in our control. 
Work is under way in this regard.  Under the federal contaminated 
sites and solid waste landfills inventory policy a database of 
federal sites is being compiled.  The database will soon be 
accessible to Canadians through the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their sustainable development strategies tabled in February 
departments with large land holdings such as National Defence, 
Transport Canada and Indian and Northern Affairs Canada committed 
to continue with the identification, assessment and remediation 
of their contaminated sites. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environment Canada also continues to be a global leader in the 
development of technologies to clean up contaminated sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, field experiments near Trail, British Columbia, and 
Île-aux-Corbeaux in the St. Lawrence River have demonstrated how 
certain plants can successfully remove toxic substances from 
soil, sediment and ground and surface water. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sunflowers, ragweed, cabbage, geranium and Jack pine show 
considerable promise.  Further field trials are being conducted 
on this innovative method for removing contamination from our 
lands and water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, Bill C-305 is a very forwarding looking and 
thoughtful project, but in the view of the government it is not 
appropriate because of more wide ranging proposals in Bill C-19 
which will significantly strengthen the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 will help safeguard our environment through an 
environmental assessment process that is more predictable, 
certain and timely.  Bill C-19 will improve the quality of 
assessments through measures to improve compliance and ensure 
more follow up.  Bill C-19 will increase opportunities for 
Canadians to have a meaningful say about projects in their 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the hon. member for Hamilton West.  I encourage him to 
keep his initiative alive and to keep a light on this issue.  In 
light of the efforts of the government on many fronts to deal 
with contaminated sites, Bill C-305 is not necessary at this 
time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I congratulate the member for 
Hamilton West.  The reason the bill came about is that his own 
government has not acted upon cleaning up these sites.  That is 
why the man has done it.  Had it already been done, the bill 
would not have seen the light of day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment the gentleman from Hamilton West on his foresight 
in trying to move this issue forward.  Unfortunately Bill C-19 
was dropped from the legislative calendar.  Maybe it will come 
forward in September; maybe it will not.  The government will do 
what it usually does, which is to sit on its hands, in particular 
on environmental issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in an extraordinarily beautiful country.  What the 
public may be interested to know is that despite the beauty 
around us, it is only a shell.  Underneath we have a government 
that is known worldwide as a serious polluter, one that ignores 
its own rules and regulations domestically and internationally, 
one that willfully pollutes, one that does this through the 
actions of government and does not regulate properly the actions 
of the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Hamilton West has put forth an articulate, simple 
plan suggesting that what the government should do is say yes, 
this is a good idea.  It is a good idea to identify these 
brownfield sites.  It is a good idea to put forth a plan of 
action.  It is an even better idea to implement solutions to 
change the sites that have been contaminated.  The public wants 
that and most members in the House want that.  Why does the 
government not act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been quite unfathomable to us on this side why the 
government has failed to act on so many issues of environmental 
importance.  Let us talk about some solutions that stem from Bill 
C-305, things that we can certainly support as a House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First is the assessment phase.  The public would be fascinated 
to know that today most environmental assessments are done after 
projects are completed.  Does that make sense?  It violates the 
government's own policies.  It violates the government's 1995 red 
book which said it wanted all environmental assessments to happen 
at the early stages of plans and programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 1998 survey by the environmental agency revealed very clearly 
that only 20% of screenings occur at a conceptual stage and that 
40% of environmental assessments occur late in the project or 
after the project is complete.  What is the benefit of that?  It 
makes no difference doing it at the end.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, some huge energy projects have been proposed under 
NAFTA which could benefit people.  Unfortunately most of the oil 
will go to the United States and no assessment has been done on 
the far ranging energy projects that will extract oil from tar. 
It is a good idea, but it should be done under the guise of sound 
environmental policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also essential that consideration be given to the need for 
alternatives in every project.  Why do we go through a project 
and not consider other alternatives, ones that would be better? 
This can happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sustainable development is the goal.  We should have a list of 
credible indicators of sustainable development such as no net 
loss to habitat, ensuring renewable resources are used at 
sustainable levels, and no net increase in air or water 
pollution.  There needs to be a duly elected duty on the part of 
the government to do just that.  There also needs to be a follow 
up process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are the transboundary responsibilities that fall clearly 
upon the shoulders of the federal government.  It is up to the 
government to ensure that projects which take place across 
boundaries, affecting not only our country but others, adhere to 
sound domestic and international environmental standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been hypocrisy in our actions outside Canada.  The 
public would be fascinated to know that Canada's own Export 
Development Corporation is using public money to fund development 
projects abroad which pollute rivers from Borneo to Central 
America, which dump mine tailings into rivers and into the ground 
and which clear-cut.  These projects are funded by Canadian 
taxpayer dollars and are being carried out by Canadian companies 
from Borneo to New Guinea to Central and South America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are violating not only the basic norms of international 
environmental standards, but they are also violating our own laws 
and the environmental standards set up by the Export Development 
Corporation.  Why is Canada known through the EDC as a pillager 
of the environment?  Why does the government, after being here 
since 1993, not have a handle on this?  It happens far away, 
thousands of miles away, unseen and unheard by the Canadian 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the public also be interested to know that the cultures of 
indigenous peoples are being laid to waste by these actions, that 
they have been turfed out and that they have been marginalized, 
all to allow Canadian companies to go in and pillage in an 
irresponsible fashion areas that have been pristine for a long 
period of time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environmental commissioner has said time and time again that 
the Canadian government has failed miserably, not only in the 
actions it takes as a government but its actions as a polluter. 
Standards were set and targets were set, but no assessment or 
action has been taken to deal with pollution by the Canadian 
government through its actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environmental commissioner puts out an eloquent report every 
year or so which contains effective, concise and doable solutions 
to deal with environmental challenges in Canada.  What happens to 
that report?  That report gets tossed on a shelf like the myriad 
of reports out of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the youth in the gallery are crying and lamenting over the 
terrible situation in our country.  Just mere words are causing 
them to shake and cry with despair.  Let us imagine what the 
public is doing out there.  It is very true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the government to listen to the environment 
commissioner and to implement and adhere to the rules set out by 
that commissioner.  The government should also adhere to the 
principles that we wave like a flag in our own country but fail 
to adhere to.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unthinkable for us not to do that.  Part of the reason, I 
think, is that there has been a death of innovation within this 
House.  It seems that innovation within the House of Commons is 
wilfully crushed on the altar of this game that we play where we 
bash each other over the head about issues the public does not 
care about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is in part why the hon. member for Hamilton West is having 
his bill defeated by his own government.  The man is trying to 
put forth something intelligent and meaningful, something that 
Canadians from coast to coast are interested in and that will 
help our environment and help their livelihoods.  Yet it is being 
defeated, all in order to deal with this at a later time.  If I 
had a dime for every time I have heard that we will do this 
later, I would be a very affluent man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need transparency and public participation in all we do. 
That is not taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, this bill is an original and worthwhile addition to 
the CEAA.  It is built on a win-win situation, environmental 
cleanup, revitalization of downtown cores and job creation, all 
in a meaningful way.  It could also—and should, if the 
government were wise—talk about the polluter pay principle, the 
principle that if a company goes into an area in our country or 
outside it and wilfully extracts resources or does some 
development, it is the company's responsibility to clean up the 
area.  That is the principle that exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that there is no enforcement.  The government 
turns a blind eye and says that it is not going to actually look 
at what that company has done.  Rather, it says that it is just 
going to leave it there and the people who live in the area can 
pay the price for it, and indeed they do pay a price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at the people who live around the Sydney tar ponds, 
who pay a terrible price in terms of birth defects and in terms 
of levels of cancer we do not find in other parts of the country. 
We can look at the price paid by the flora and fauna of our 
country.  We can look at the beluga whales that live in the St. 
Lawrence.  The flesh of a beluga whale would be considered a 
toxic substance because of the high levels of cancer causing 
agents it contains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I compliment the member and ask today for unanimous 
consent for the bill to go to committee for study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a pity 
that we have to deal with this issue today at this hour, at the 
end of the week. It takes a truly superb speaker to make the 
House crackle with excitement, even though the issue we are 
dealing with is extremely interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environmental issues have always been one of my concerns, but 
this is especially the case since I became a politician. I 
learned the ropes of political life in Quebec's National 
Assembly. At the time, in 1976, when Mr. Lévesque came to power 
in Quebec, there was no Department of the Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first environment minister was Marcel Léger. 
Not long after that, I became his assistant in environmental 
matters. Therefore, there are a few issues that are of concern 
to me and that I know better than others. Among them, of course, 
are issues related to environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation introduced by the hon. member at least has the 
merit of bringing us to talk about the environment. In my 
opinion, we do not deal with it often enough. This is an area 
that should be a major concern for the population, because if we 
do not ensure that the environment is protected and if we do not 
make more efforts in this regard in the future, future 
generations  will surely lay the blame at our feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to think of greenhouse gases, for example, which 
are warming up our planet. The hon. member who spoke before me 
talked about pollution in the St. Lawrence River.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize it is high time governments did the right thing and 
tried to restore the environment, and not only try to restore 
it, but also ensure we no longer pollute it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one aspect of the bill I disagree with; once again, we 
have here a bill which encroaches on provincial areas of 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of the environment, Quebec has come a long way since 
1975-76. I can tell the House that contaminated sites are now 
being reviewed. We have what it takes to do it. We have the 
necessary legislation and the BAPE does an excellent job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is flawed in the sense that once again there is 
overlapping. This slows down progress not only with regard to 
restoring the environment but also to protecting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an area such as this one, it is important that each level of 
government stick to its own jurisdiction and act without delay 
to restore—studying is not enough—sites that unfortunately 
were allowed to be polluted. The areas of jurisdiction are very 
clear. We do not need new legislation for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to talk about Lake Saint-Pierre, among 
others. Lake Saint-Pierre was polluted by the Canadian Forces. 
They fired shells into it. The consequences have been obvious 
since the 1950s. There were serious accidents as a result of 
shells being carried away by the ice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is clearly a federal jurisdiction. We do not need studies 
and special legislation and special committees to see how Lake 
Saint-Pierre must be restored. This lake is a source of vitality, 
of life for the river. It is the lung that restores polluted 
water coming from cities such as Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lake Saint-Pierre was polluted with bombs. The Canadian Forces 
polluted it and we are asking the minister responsible to see 
to its cleanup as quickly as possible. We have been asking this 
for years. This is clearly a federal jurisdiction and this is 
not open to dispute. And yet, this is not being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I talked about the pollution in Bagotville. This 
is a serious case of pollution that is spreading and seeping 
into groundwaters in the town of La Baie. I asked a question 
this morning on this. 
What answer did I get? I was told the government is examining 
the issue, that it is looking at the situation and that it will 
solve the problem when it arises. However the problem exists and 
this is clearly a federal jurisdiction. We do not need a private 
member's bill. We need only the government's goodwill to solve 
the pollution problem in Bagotville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only have the shores of the St. Lawrence River been ruined 
but between Trois-Rivières and Quebec City we have lost and are 
still losing a great portion of land to erosion. Some houses 
have had to be moved back, because traffic on St. Lawrence River 
moved a little too rapidly. Again, this is clearly a federal 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past we have managed to get some money to restore and 
protect the shores of the St. Lawrence River but it is far from 
over. 
Municipalities like Sainte-Marthe, Champlain, Batiscan and scores 
of others all the way to Quebec City are asking us to try to get 
money to do something because the shores of the St. Lawrence 
River are being eroded. This comes under federal jurisdiction 
but the federal government is not doing anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a disaster waiting to happen on the St. Lawrence River. 
I already talked about this when we discussed 
the marine transportation bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the world there is an increasing number of accidents 
involving ships carrying oil or other dangerous substances. 
Almost every month we hear about ships sinking somewhere and 
polluting the shores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine for a moment that a tanker moving oil to or from 
Montreal had an accident on the St. Lawrence River. Seven million 
Quebecers would be affected. What are we doing to prevent this 
from happening? Some will say that it never happened. Well, it 
did. 
Fortunately it was not a disaster, but last year a ship broke 
in two near Sept-Îles. Fortunately, it did not cause any damage. 
I live by the St. Lawrence River and each year we see spills, 
not major ones but enough to see oil on the shores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through a bill, I suggested that the Canadian government, that 
is the Minister of Transport who is responsible for that—it is 
his jurisdiction—should require that every ship entering the 
St. Lawrence River carrying dangerous products be inspected. It 
would be a preventive measure. We do not need legislation for 
that, just the political will to do it. We could certainly 
prevent disasters. I hope it never happens. Still, every year we 
are concerned about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oil shippers seem to use older tankers. When a ship breaks in 
two, it is often said that the ship was not inspected properly, 
that is was too old. These same ships go up the St. Lawrence 
River to Quebec City, to Montreal and on to the Great Lakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I often see these ships sail by since I live by the river. I 
pray to God that we not have a disaster like they had last year 
in France. We hear about this sort of thing happening all the 
time all over the place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that could be done immediately to cleanup and 
protect our water. I am talking about Lake Saint-Pierre and about 
inspecting ships carrying dangerous products on the St. Lawrence 
River. 
When we talk about the army or the air force contaminating the 
water table, as they did in Bagotville and Shannon, the minister 
says “There is no problem. The people are satisfied; we give 
them bottled water”. Yes, the water table is useless now but 
the consolation prize is that “From now on, you will be drinking 
bottled water”. Or better yet, we are told that the water table 
will clean itself up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the member who introduced the bill for raising 
the issue today. Although I just have to support the purpose of 
the bill, I still think that the member should introduce a bill 
asking the federal government to respect the jurisdictions in 
this area, to get involved in the restoration of the shores of 
the St. Lawrence River and all contaminated sites and to respect 
and support the work of the BAPE in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my time is running out, I hope I will be able to come back 
to this very important issue in the near future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, as 
is the tradition, I have been given five minutes to clean up 
after the presentation of the bill after an hour in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully to all the interventions made in the 
House today.  To my friend in the Bloc, I am still trying to 
figure out what a ship going up and down the St. Lawrence has to 
do with brownfields but I take his points.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend with the Canadian Alliance Party indicated or assumed 
that the government was not doing its job on the environment. 
Through my experience from 1988 to 1993 in opposition, the 
Conservative government of the day did precious little on 
environmental concerns compared to what this federal Liberal 
government has done since 1993 to the present date.  It is quite 
extraordinary and outstanding what has been done on issues of the 
environment under a series of different environmental ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the parliamentary secretary, will probably not 
leave his seat and allow me another opportunity to ask for 
unanimous consent to move this bill along for more than just an 
hour.  I jest because he is a friend.   Quite seriously, to my 
hon. friend who is standing in as a parliamentary secretary, I 
know he has to represent the government's point of view and I 
know he has a job to do.  I have done that job myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I would ask him to take back the message to the 
officials that Bill C-19 does not address the need of cost 
assessment as outlined in my bill.  If we have a project we want 
to proceed with then we go out and do an assessment.  Then we can 
get funding for the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-305 would amend the act and take it back a step so the 
opportunity of financing would begin at the assessment stage. 
Doing that would involve not just federal, provincial or 
municipal money but also tax money.  Also the private sector 
would be invited to play a role and to network with levels of 
government to spend the money, make it possible, make it happen 
and pay for it at first blush. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an interesting use of language in the government's 
rebuttal.  The word altered was used as opposed to my words of 
expanding the existing registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As addressed by the government, Bill C-305 says that we fear 
this paper registry versus the Internet or computer registry, and 
that a paper registry does not work.  What bill is perfect?  If 
we had perfect bills we would not have to spend time in the House 
debating them, making amendments at committee, taking them to 
report stage in the House and then making amendments at report 
stage.  No bill is perfect.  We would make those adjustments from 
paper to computer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, and the hon. member might pass this along to the 
government, even the new Internet based registry under Bill C-19 
would still only list environmental assessment projects, not 
suspected or presently unreported sites that my particular bill 
would do.  Maybe we will have to make an amendment to Bill C-19 
in order to make that possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the reforms that are being discussed and may 
take place shortly in the work of the House.  However what harm 
is there in permitting a private member's bill, which takes place 
in an hour outside of regular government business, to be 
discussed more and to have a second and third hour of debate in 
the House?  It could be in a stretch that might take six months. 
Then it could end at a parliamentary committee where the bill 
would be addressed, amended, clarified or even thrown out if the 
government, with its majority on committees, saw fit.  What harm 
is there in moving the bill along? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember that a private member's bill takes hours upon hours of 
work to formulate.  Then it goes to the legislative process.  I 
thank Debra Bulmer at legislative services because she spent 
hours looking through the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 
to make the appropriate amendments to respond to what it was I 
wanted to see in the act vis-à-vis brownfields.  I thank her for 
her hard work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask hon. members, with all the hours that were spent in 
developing, researching and drawing up the appropriate measures 
in the bill, to give this private member's bill a shot.  There is 
no harm in it.  It can be killed at committee if it has to be 
killed, and if not at committee at third reading in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I ask one more time, and I may know the answer to 
this already, that the House give unanimous consent to make the 
bill votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> The hour provided for the

Since the motion was not selected as a votable item, the item is 
dropped from the order paper.
