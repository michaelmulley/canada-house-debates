	The House resumed from March 18 consideration of the motion 
that this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
dividing my time with the hon. member for Lanark-Carleton. It is 
a privilege for me to speak to the 1996-1997 budget. If I can make 
some small contribution to the debate-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It will be small.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> My hon. friend from the Reform Party is alluding to 
the fact that my contribution will be small, and I agree, but it will 
be a contribution of some use.
<P>
	I will dwell a little in the history of where we were, how we got 
to be the way we are and where we may be going. It is necessary to 
put this budget and previous budgets into of context to address the 
financial situation of the country.
<P>
	In my previous incarnation as a member of the provincial 
legislative assembly in Ontario, I remember deficit budgeting in its 
infancy. Every province was guilty of deficit budgeting, as was the 
national government and virtually all governments in the western 
world.
<P>
	One of our senators has described that era as one of mutual 
seduction, when it was a very popular thing to believe that money 
came from government; that somehow or another there was an 
infinite well which could do almost anything.
<P>
	The political stripe of the government of the day really did not 
matter. As was described, it was simply a case of mutual seduction.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	By the time the government changed in 1984 the national debt 
had risen to $166 billion, over a period of  14 or 15 years. Then in 
the following eight years the national debt climbed from 
approximately $166 billion to $400 billion.
<P>
	There was a realization during those years that this could not go 
on indefinitely, that a halt had to be called, and yet there seemed to 
be an absence of political courage to do something until we were on 
the edge of precipitous financial situation not only in the country 
itself but in each province. Every province has gone through the 
same experience, as my colleagues will remember.
<P>
	In 1993, when the Liberals came to power, there was a feeling of 
frustration, a feeling of anger among the voting population and a 
feeling that government was somehow incapable of getting hold of 
the finances of the country. Expectations were low. It was a case of 
whether this ship could be steered through rough waters to safe 
harbour.
<P>
	We were very fortunate to have the gentleman who is the finance 
minister at the present time appointed to that position. I think it was 
a cup that he might rather have passed by because the position of 
finance minister in this country is very often the kiss of death 
politically.
<P>
	He set out on a course and he stated his course clearly at the 
beginning. He would take the economy in two year short term 
projections with a goal ultimately of getting rid of the deficit, 
paying down the debt, and certainly beginning with that portion 
which is held offshore.
<P>
	It was a recipe that some people felt could not be achieved 
because previous finance ministers had continuously failed to 
achieve the targets they had set out. My honourable friends will 
recall previous finance ministers as much as $10 billion off their 
targets.
<P>
	When our finance minister began this quest there was a lot of 
scepticism that he would achieve it, but achieve it he did and 
exceed it he did. Then he brought in the next budget, and achieve it 
he did and exceed it he did.
<P>
	Today we thankfully head down that path of reduced deficits. I 
am not prone to quote other people's writings when addressing the 
House but I think an article in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> from April 13 is 
worth noting: ``The federal government appears to be sitting pretty 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1434"> 1434 </A></B>
<P>
on its deficit target for the fiscal year just ended. The finance 
department said Friday the deficit for the first 11 months of the 
year was $23.2 billion, down $4.6 billion from the same period in 
the previous year. The finance  minister set a deficit target of $32.7 
billion for the year ending March 31, 1996''.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	I know some of my friends in the Reform Party feel this target or 
this goal is spread out too far. I can tell my hon. friends that had we 
not done that, had we took the slash and burn direction the Reform 
Party wanted we could have precipitated a recession of disastrous 
proportions. It was a matter of walking the tightrope and balancing 
the situation, moving toward the targets but at the same time not 
throwing out the baby with the bath water.
<P>
	What has that accomplished? There is a renewed confidence 
from the international community in Canada today. Canada is now 
poised for the greatest growth of all the G-7 countries. Sometimes 
we tend to look inward too much and we do not look out to see 
ourselves as other countries see us. It is useful to do that from time 
to time. Then we can get a picture of where we stand in relation to 
the people we trade with, to the people we compete with, to the 
people who pay their taxes in their country, and so on.
<P>
	In terms of taxation I know we all feel we are taxed excessively 
in Canada. If we compare ourselves to other members of the G-7 it 
is not exactly so. There are countries whose levels of taxation, 
especially income tax, are even higher than those in Canada.
<P>
	I would be the last person to suggest we should keep a high tax 
regime and I will be one of the first people to recommend to the 
hon. Minister of Finance that once the targets of zero deficit are 
achieved and we begin to pay down the national debt that it reflect 
in a sharing of that good fortune with the shrinking of taxation. The 
freeing up of money will be one of the essentials for our future.
<P>
	Now that we are at the point of a deficit of 3 per cent of the gross 
domestic product, beginning with 5.7, it now means we are 
approaching that point at which our growth rate is greater than our 
deficit. That means the deficit can be paid down more quickly now 
than it could initially. That ratio is very important. However, it is 
important to remember that what we have tried to do is have a fair 
and balanced approach to what we are doing, and I am sure we have 
succeeded in the minds of most Canadians, although not in the 
minds of everyone.
<P>
	We have deliberately tried not to leave segments of society out in 
the cold but we have tried at the same time to impose a balanced 
responsibility on every citizen so that we are all sharing the load. 
After all, we all created the load in the first place. For those of my 
colleagues who are probably young enough to benefit from certain 
kinds of government largess, we are now in a position where we 
have to make it right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the spirit in which my hon. colleague has couched his remarks. He 
is a fine gentleman but I surely take issue with some of his 
comments.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	The member talked about the seduction of governments which 
led us to this debt. To me that is absolute nonsense. Every family, 
every organizational group whether it be a church or community 
organization and every business in this country knows that we have 
to live within our means. They have done that for the last 25 years 
while this and previous governments have sunk this country into an 
enormous debt hole.
<P>
	We talk about seduction. I think it is clear in the minds of 
millions of Canadians that it was a simple buying of the Canadian 
vote in election after election. That was the difficulty they had in 
pulling away from that kind of overspending and government 
waste.
<P>
	We look at whether or not this government could have reached a 
balanced budget far earlier but in fact it has not even set a date for 
that. All we have to do is look at the provinces the hon. member 
referred to. All have placed themselves on track for a balanced 
budget. Provinces such as Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba 
have reached the point where they are now in a position to debate 
what they are to do with the surplus. They are deciding whether to 
reduce taxes or to plug some leaks in some of their programs 
through further expenditure of money and so on.
<P>
	We are now approaching a debt of $600 billion. At the present 
interest rate, it appears that our interest payment on that debt is 
going to be somewhere near $50 billion a year.
<P>
	I would like my hon. friend to address that issue. Can we deal 
with a $50 billion interest payment per year and still protect our 
social programs including our transfer payments to other 
provinces?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would first like to respond to the 
question of seduction since we are both here seducing each other. I 
want to reinforce the fact that it was an era of mutual seduction. It 
worked both ways. I will leave a little story with my hon. friend to 
show an example of that.
<P>
	In 1977 I ran in an election in Ontario. One of the issues my 
party brought to the fore in no uncertain terms was the deficit in 
Ontario at that time by the Tory government. We made speeches in 
the House prior to the election being called on the subject of 
government waste, excessive government spending, the largesse 
that was going on hither and yon which was piling up and 
accumulating the debt.
<P>
	When we got into the election my leader hammered this message 
out for the first couple of weeks until the premier was asked about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1435"> 1435 </A></B>
<P>
the comments that were being  made. He answered the reporters 
with two words: ``Dr. No''. That was the end of it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt my friend. Time 
has expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Unfortunately, there is no time left for the hon. member for 
Bourassa to ask his question. Resuming debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to make some comments on the March 6 budget of the 
government.
<P>
	As I enter the House each day I like to look at some of the 
Canadians who come to this place. I wonder what they are thinking 
about when they come here. I wonder if they are as much in awe of 
this place as I was when I came to the House, to think of the things 
that happen in this place. I see young people, grade school children 
who have come for a visit. I see some older children, parents and 
grandparents. They are Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Like every member of Parliament I would like to be sure when I 
speak in this place, that no matter what the age might be of 
Canadians who are listening to the speech in the gallery, they will 
think that something good, productive or constructive was said. 
From time to time statements are made in this place which are 
more or less one sided. It makes me think of the cliché that if one is 
not part of the solution, one must be part of the problem.
<P>
	During the debate we have had on the budget there has been a lot 
of talk about Canada's national debt which is about $600 billion. It 
is not an amount which people are insensitive to. No one in this 
place is insensitive to it. This amount was accumulated over the 
last 25 years. It reflects the amount of money Canadians took out of 
the system more than they put in. It is the amount of money we 
contributed to improve the health care plan and social programs in 
this country. In that accumulated sum, $350 billion of that is 
benefits to Canadians.
<P>
	Governments do not have money. Governments manage the 
money of Canadians. That $350 billion has grown as a result of 
interest and compound interest. The balance of that $550 billion to 
$600 billion of national debt represents interest.
<P>
	It is in our best interest-excuse the pun-to look at ways we 
can get our fiscal house in order to not only bring the deficit down 
but to eliminate it, the shortfall of revenue over expense every year. 
We have to get to the position where we are creating a surplus so 
that the surplus can be used to discharge that long term debt.
<P>
	If Canada had a balance sheet in which all its assets and 
liabilities were disclosed, we know the liability would  be a long 
term debt of some $600 billion. However, the Fraser Institute and 
the United Nations have said that Canada is the second wealthiest 
country in the world on a per capita basis. The reason they can say 
that is that Canada has a wealth of assets.
<P>
	According to the Fraser Institute, with our resources excluding 
land value, Canada is worth about $3 trillion. There really is a 
dowry or an equity in this country. The money we owe to foreigners 
and other Canadians for the national debt is not just money that was 
given away. It was invested in this country. It was invested in our 
people, our youth, our health.
<P>
	I see the health minister. I know Canada's health program is the 
strongest element within Canadian society which holds the country 
together. It creates the unity within this country and will keep the 
country united. We have a strong health care system which we are 
committed to. In good times as well as bad we will not compromise 
the five principles of the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	Confidence and stability are the principles which must be 
reflected in budgets. I hope the people who come here and who 
listen will feel that in recent years Canada has demonstrated a 
stability within its affairs, that government has generated a level of 
confidence, that the right things are happening.
<P>
	When this government came to office the amount of deficit 
represented something like 6 per cent of our GDP. The finance 
minister in his first budget brought it down to 5 per cent of GDP. In 
the next budget he brought it down to 4 per cent. In the current 
fiscal year which ends on March 31, 1997, it will be down to 3 per 
cent. The last time the finance minister addressed the issue of the 
long term outlook for the deficit he said that in the subsequent year 
it would be down to 2 per cent.
<P>
	We are so very very close to delivering a balanced budget. It is 
something we want to do and I do not think there is disagreement 
on that. The only disagreement is over the velocity at which it 
happens.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	Some would suggest we have to balance the budget at all costs 
regardless of the impact on seniors, regardless of the impact on 
health care, regardless of the impact on jobs and youth. I do not 
agree. Our budget has to be a compassionate budget. It has to be 
responsive to the important needs of Canadians, and it has to be 
done in a fair and equitable way. Are there spending 
mismanagement or problems in a corporation? Of course there are. 
In a government? Of course there are. There are always things we 
can improve upon. We have to look for the things we have 
improved upon.
<P>
	I want to talk a little about the national debt because it is not in 
isolation. There are assets and good things in this country which we 
have not invested in. They will be with us and are for our children 
in the long term.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1436"> 1436 </A></B>
<P>
	I say to all the young people: Canada is the best country in the 
world, one of the richest countries in the world and it is going 
to stay that way. Canadians have demonstrated that we have the 
know how, that we can operate in a global economy, that we can 
act responsibly and that we can work together in a proud, 
generous, tolerant and prosperous nation. This is what makes the 
United Nations look at Canada and say that is why we are the best 
country in the world.
<P>
	Seniors are a tremendous asset to Canada. They led us in bad 
times through the depression. They led us through the war times. 
They led us at times when we needed the help. The Prime Minister 
has said on many occasions that we will never, never abandon 
Canada's seniors.
<P>
	In his speech on March 6 the finance minister said: ``We believe 
that the right to a secure retirement should be available to all and 
not become the preserve only of those who are well off''. That is an 
important commitment.
<P>
	The seniors are affected in this budget by the creation of what is 
called a seniors benefit. It is a replacement for the current benefits 
for seniors, including old age security, the guaranteed income 
supplement and the age and pension income credits. It is a single 
tax free benefit to begin in the year 2001.
<P>
	Some of my constituents have asked why 2001. The important 
aspect of that is it is going to take time to phase in and allow people 
to arrange and manage their affairs so that when they do retire they 
have had an adequate opportunity to make provisions for all their 
needs.
<P>
	The Prime Minister committed not to reduce the pensions of 
today's seniors. The plan we have honours that commitment and 
goes well beyond it. Canadians who were 60 years of age and over 
on December 31, 1995 and their spouses whatever their age are 
guaranteed to receive pensions amounting to no less than previous 
entitlements. That means they are going to have an opportunity to 
either stay under the existing plan or go under the new seniors 
benefits. That is being sensitive to seniors. Many will receive more 
under the new plan. GIS recipients will receive $120 more a year 
and seniors will be able to choose the benefit that maximizes their 
pension.
<P>
	Most future seniors will also be better off because the new 
system targets higher benefits for those with lower incomes. 
Seventy-five per cent of single seniors and couples will receive the 
same or higher benefits and nine out of ten single senior women 
will be better off.
<P>
	The seniors benefits will be fully indexed to inflation and will 
treat senior couples equally through separate equal cheques for 
each spouse.
<P>
	There are so many good things about the budget I would like to 
talk about but my time is coming to a close. To finish, I would like 
to say a little word to the family. I  spoke on Bill C-10 not too long 
ago. During that speech I said that if the family is strong, the deficit 
will be gone. I urge my colleagues to work with me to consider 
ways in which we can improve the tax status of families that stay 
together and stop worrying about the tax benefits for those who 
decide not to stay together.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, both my 
hon. colleague and the speaker before him have stated that 
eliminating the deficit is one of this government's priorities. I 
agree. But I cannot, unfortunately, agree with the procedure, the 
mechanisms and the means used to accomplish this.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	To me, the social costs of eliminating the deficit are 
unacceptable: 45,000 public servants laid off, cuts made to social 
programs, including health and pensions. Having said earlier that 
you believed that seniors represented an important segment of our 
society, why are you making more cuts?
<P>
	The most unacceptable are the cuts to unemployment insurance. 
There is a $5 billion surplus, and this is not tax money, but 
contributions by workers and employers. How can there be any 
justification for using this money, which belongs to businesses and 
their workers, to eliminate the deficit? Does this not pose a 
problem of ethics and legitimacy? Does this not represent a 
misappropriation of funds which have been put in place by 
legislation not to solve a deficit problem but to provide benefits to 
the unemployed? That is my question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
understand the member's comments and his preamble. He really 
got down to employment insurance reforms.
<P>
	The word insurance has not been operative in the past. It is an 
insurance plan. That means premiums should be paid into the 
program by all who participate in the plan and be sufficient to cover 
the benefits paid out. It has not happened in the past. It is not 
sustainable for the future. Change is necessary.
<P>
	The member is part of the problem, not part of the solution. I 
would like to hear from him how the system might be improved so 
that it will be an insurance system which is not a burden on 
Canadians who do not draw on the plan. We all participate and 
support the plan. My wish is that the one million unemployed 
Canadians will get jobs and never, ever have to use employment 
insurance benefits.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, appreciate 
the awe that the member and all Canadians feel for this place. 
However, what governments have done and the irresponsibility 
they have shown in handling taxpayers' money causes me to feel 
disdain for this place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1437"> 1437 </A></B>
<P>
	Governments have been totally irresponsible. Finance ministers 
since the early 1970s have said that they realized that the deficit 
must be dealt with. John Turner in 1975 said: ``I come now to 
specific measures. None is more important than the control of 
public expenditures''.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister was finance minister in 1978 he said: 
``Significant reductions in deficits can be expected''. They did not 
happen. Many previous finance ministers promised to deal with the 
problem of overspending. It did not happened. Canadians cannot 
feel awe for this place with these kinds of actions on the part of 
governments when dealing with taxpayers' money.
<P>
	The member also spoke about the trillions of dollars in assets 
that Canada has. That kind of thinking is terribly upsetting to me. 
In Mexico assets meant very little when it did not deal with its 
overspending problem. The United States took over its oil reserves 
for the next number of years because Mexico needed the money. 
The United States along with other countries through the 
International Monetary Fund provided the money.
<P>
	This finance minister, with the ever growing interest payments 
on the debt increasing to $50 billion, has not dealt with the 
problem.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think the member has received a 
question. Briefly please, he has about one minute.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I repeat, there are people who are part 
of the solution and people who are part of the problem.
<P>
	We can spend all day long talking about history. We are here to 
talk about the future of these young people, the future of the 
working people today and the future of our seniors. We have to take 
positive steps. Now is the time to start. I ask the member to join the 
rest of the members in this place to start looking toward the future 
rather than lamenting the past.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be speaking today on the budget, if my Liberal colleagues will give 
me the chance. There is a place where people may discuss 
respectfully.
<P>
	Therefore, with the opportunity afforded me, I would like to 
show that the 1996 budget does not represent, as they like to say, 
any additional savings, that it really does not add anything new and 
that it represents the end of the plan to put the country's finances in 
order. In this budget, the minister is not cutting expenditures and 
this year's deficit at all. On the contrary, there is in fact an increase 
in expenditures of $104 million.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance is demonstrating the government's 
indifference. It is as if there was no waste, no duplication and no 
tax inequity. It is all forgotten; out of sight out of mind.
<P>
	The government is dumping $7 billion of its 1996-97 and 
1997-98 deficit on the provinces. Furthermore, it artificially 
reduced the deficit by taking the $5 billion surplus from the 
unemployment insurance account, which is funded entirely by 
contributions from companies and individuals. It is unacceptable to 
see the burden of the social programs left to the provinces and to 
those who forced to depend on them. In matters of employment, the 
government is deceiving the people, and particularly young people. 
It claims to be creating jobs and improving the economy, but 
clearly its measures are either inadequate or totally ineffective.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance cut funding to student job programs by 
$26 million over the past two years. And then, all of a sudden, 
perhaps because of an election year or an election on the horizon, 
he changes direction. He doubles to $120 million the amount of aid 
to student programs-an increase of $60 million. Nevertheless, the 
government is hitting young people by cutting funding to 
post-secondary education.
<P>
	The government will reduce funding by $150 million in 1996-97 
and by between $400 million and $500 million in 1997-98. This 
will inevitably lead to an increase in education costs, hence the 
demonstrations by young people and university students in recent 
months and years against these draconian cuts. In the end, the 
students will be the ones paying.
<P>
	For more than two years now, the Bloc has been calling for an 
investment fund to promote defence conversion. The Liberals 
promised $200 million per year over five years starting with 1994, 
for a total of $1 billion. They made this commitment in the red 
book and during the election campaign. As is too often the case, 
this promise was then forgotten. The Minister of Finance is 
proposing $150 million in 1996-97 and maybe $200 million in 
1997-98. We would not be surprised if the $200 million figure was 
revised downward, as is too often the case.
<P>
	Furthermore, for two years, the Bloc Quebecois has been calling 
for a major reform of the business tax system. The government has 
come forward with the proposal to set up a committee made of tax 
experts, several of whom would come from businesses already 
benefiting from tax shelters. We, in the Bloc Quebecois, joked that 
this was like choosing members of the Hell's Angels because they 
know how organized crime operates.
<P>
	It seems obvious that the only purpose of such a committee is to 
ward off criticism and to pretend to examine the issue. We can 
already anticipate the conclusions of this committee. They will not 
contribute anything new. In any case, the members of this inner 
circle are both judges and judged. We, in the Bloc Quebecois, want 
fair and equitable reform. To this end, we have been asking since 
we came to Ottawa for a parliamentary committee to analyze 
federal policies concerning business taxation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1438"> 1438 </A></B>
<P>
	Regarding these same subsidies to businesses, last year the 
government substantially reduced assistance to the dairy industry, 
which is mainly concentrated in Quebec. This year, it is simply 
abolishing it altogether.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Is the Minister of Finance really aware of the negative impact 
this measure would have on Quebec agricultural and dairy 
producers? We already know the answer is no. Does he know that 
these cuts are excessively dangerous, that Quebec is still the federal 
government's poor relation? Recently, civil servants who had 
nothing better to do got this great idea, they would go after raw 
milk cheese. They had a brainstorm over the Easter break. It would 
give them something to do. They said to themselves: Let us throw 
another monkey wrench in there. More often than not, the 
agricultural sector is the one that has to pay.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois demands that the government get its fiscal 
house in order by seing to it that those who do not pay their fair 
share do so.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I must ask you if this is a questions and comments 
period. If not, I would ask my colleague to please be patient a few 
minutes before making his clever comments.
<P>
	When will the government act in a real fair and responsible 
manner? We have now been waiting for two and a half years.
<P>
	Last year, unpaid taxes amounted to $6 billion and the 
government was not even able to do better than the year before. 
There are lots of funds that the government could recover. But 
because of its ineptitude, its incompetence, the government too 
often does nothing at all.
<P>
	The last estimate of the finance department shows that, as far as 
business taxes are concerned, the government forgoes nearly $10 
billion. When will members of Parliament undertake a thorough 
review of business taxation? Before anything else, the government 
must put an end to that type of evasion, that tax dodging.
<P>
	Part of the deficit reduction is due to the country's economic 
situation, which is relatively good, not because of the Liberals, but 
because all G-7 countries are currently enjoying a good situation.
<P>
	Undeniably, the government is making political hay with this. It 
is true that exportations are high, interest rates are low and 
unemployment insurance premiums are higher than payments. 
However, if the economic context was to change, either because of 
higher interest rates or a stronger pressure on the unemployment 
insurance system, the impact would be immediate and catastrophic 
for public finances. I am convinced we would then see a major 
change in the Liberal government's attitude.
<P>
	I am a member of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade. As such, I would like to stress that we will 
have to examine what seems to be the  main problem of new 
exporters, that is financing, whether it is easy to obtain financing. 
Above all, we will have to establish parameters in order to facilitate 
access to foreign markets for small and medium size businesses.
<P>
	According to what he said on page 78 of his Budget Plan, the 
finance minister seems to be aware of that problem. I would like to 
know how much of the $50 million injected into the Business 
Development Bank and the $50 million added to the working 
capital of the EDC, will go directly and through concrete measures 
to small and medium size enterprises trying to export?
<P>
	Government must recognize that Canada is made up of regional 
markets: atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, the prairies and British 
Columbia, which are separately integrated into larger trade and 
economic continental entities. For British Columbia, the northwest 
United States and the Asia-Pacific area are natural markets.
<P>
	For Quebec it is another matter altogether. Its favoured markets 
are North America, 80 per cent of its exports, and Europe, 12 per 
cent. We should note that for Quebec European markets are three 
times as important as Asian markets. It is up to individual 
companies, and not the federal government, to determine, on the 
basis of their strengths and the nature of their productions, what 
their export targets should be.
<P>
	The federal government should limit itself to providing support. 
Again the priority in the area of assistance to exporting companies 
should be a better access to financing.
<P>
	I would like to stress that we believe Quebec and Canada have 
lost something when they renegotiated the agreement on lumber 
with the United States. The fact that we agreed to reopen an 
agreement already in force will probably serve as a precedent for 
the United States, which will demand the same in other disputes 
with Canada.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to quote an article by Jean-Robert 
Sansfaçon, published in <I>Le Devoir</I> on Thursday, March 7: ``While 
Ottawa continues to pretend that it reduced the deficit by cutting 
expenditures from $120 billion in 1993-94 to $106 billion in 
1997-98, a more thorough analysis shows that at least 5 of these 
$14 billion come from a normal reduction in the number of 
unemployment recipients due to economic growth, and another $6 
billion come from cuts in transfers to the provinces for health, 
social assistance and post-secondary education. We know that a 
new recession would make the unemployment insurance fund 
surplus melt like new snow and, therefore, increase the budget 
deficit of the government. Like last year, the victims of this budget 
are the provinces, especially provinces like Quebec''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1439"> 1439 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	This is the reality: The federal government is not assuming its 
responsibilities, it is transferring to the provinces the burden of 
making most of the cuts called for in this budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the speech of my colleague. I wanted to make 
two or three brief comments and ask a question.
<P>
	After this budget was brought down, I looked carefully at the 
comments made by influential people within the country, that is, 
business people, men and women who work within the major 
unions and journalists. The great majority of them had positive 
comments to make. I am extremely surprised that my colleague 
was unable, unless I misunderstood him, to put greater emphasis on 
a number of things that are well accepted, well thought of and that 
are helping. I believe he mostly emphasized what he thought were 
the negative aspects.
<P>
	Perhaps my colleague would be willing to respond to this. Why 
did he not mention any positive aspects in his speech, when we 
consider all the positive comments that were made?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the 
comments made by my hon. colleague. Simply because it is 
difficult. Regarding the quality of the French used in the budget, 
the nice rhetoric used to hide the drastic cuts imposed on the people 
of Quebec and Canada, I could indeed admit that it is well written. 
It is written so that transfer payments to the provinces can be cut by 
$7 billion. At first glance, it almost appears to be well written and 
appealing.
<P>
	However, if we look at it more closely, as Jean-Robert Sansfaçon 
did in the March 7 edition of <I>Le Devoir</I> and as several other 
analysts and columnists did as well, if we look at the figures 
instead of the quality of the French used in the budget, how can I 
praise the government for cutting transfer payments to the 
provinces by $7 billion over two years? How can I praise the 
potential increase in tuition fees for students in Quebec and the rest 
of Canada? How can I praise the government for cutting transfer 
payments while maintaining national standards? How can I praise 
the government for cutting transfer payments for health care? How 
can I praise the government for practically robbing the UI fund of 
$5 billion?
<P>
	That is why I would rather comment on cuts, on the 
government's inaction, instead of praising the quality of the French 
used to try to hide cuts from the people of Canada and Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the speaker on his comments concerning the fact that 
this Liberal government is passing the spending cuts on to the 
provinces.
<P>
	All the cuts that the finance minister has passed on to the 
provinces still are not enough. Would the member comment on 
why he might think that the Liberals have not done the job in terms 
of cutting spending?
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to answer the 
question put by the hon. member from the Reform Party. In my 
opinion, the Liberals have not done their job as far as cuts are 
concerned, they dumped it all on the provinces because it always 
looks better to have cuts done by a neighbour rather than doing 
them yourself.
<P>
	The Liberals were also negligent because, if I am not mistaken, 
they were offered the possibility of a parliamentary committee to 
determine priorities regarding corporate tax cuts-you did so 
yourself.
<P>
	But they simply refused because it was easier to say: ``We will 
keep our money, but we will impose cuts on those who put money 
in our wallet, namely the provinces with their taxes''. Why did the 
Liberals neglect their job? Simply because they wanted to make the 
provinces responsible for the cuts and make them out to be the bad 
guys. It is as simple as that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Saint-Jean, Mr. 
Speaker, not Lac-Saint-Jean. The hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean 
will be joining us at 2 p.m. this afternoon, and we are very proud 
that he is doing so.
<P>
	First of all I would like to reassure our friends opposite by saying 
that, while the budget may contain very few good news, and there 
is no doubt that there are few, they must not forget either that it is 
the role of the opposition to assess the budgets brought down by 
government.
<P>
	Very seldom does a budget earn government praise for the 
outstanding job it has done in preparing the budget. In my opinion, 
it would not exactly be the place of the opposition to say so. We are 
here, in this democratic system, to point out those budget items that 
we totally disagree with and to suggest amendments, so that 
democracy can prevail.
<P>
	I think that, should this House become Liberal through and 
through, Canada would be next to impossible to live in. It seemed 
noteworthy to me. In fact, I have a few points to raise, which are 
not exactly positive either. I think that raising negative points in 
assessing a budget is good for democracy and something that must 
be done.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1440"> 1440 </A></B>
<P>
	The budget can be considered from two points of view. There 
is what I call the macroeconomic view and the microeconomic 
view. I often look at what impact the budget will have on the 
people of my riding. That is what I would like to share with you 
today. I will not be telling you anything you do not know already 
by saying that the riding of Saint-Jean has always been, in my 
words, a disaster area. We will recall that, with its very first 
budget, this government closed down the Collège militaire in 
Saint-Jean. This keeps going on. The hon. member for Terrebonne 
mentioned a few similar points.
<P>
	Let me tell you about the issue of milk subsidies, which is very 
important in my riding, where there are many milk producers. 
These people will be faced with a 15 per cent cut in their subsidy. 
This amounts to an annual dead loss of about $1 million for the 
riding of Saint-Jean. There will be $1 million less in Saint-Jean's 
economy, in addition to the $32 million loss suffered with the 
closure of the military college. And all this will keep going on, 
because the milk subsidy reduction is not just a one time cut: it will 
be implemented over a number of years until there is no subsidy 
left.
<P>
	Therefore, the riding of Saint-Jean will not just lose $1 million 
this year: it will lose $1 million this year, next year, the year after, 
and so on until there is no subsidy left. This will result in a $4 to $5 
million cut for the riding of Saint-Jean, without compensation. 
Once again, there is a double standard.
<P>
	The government says that it will put an end to the Crow benefit 
in western Canada. Of course, this measure will have an impact on 
producers, who are told that they will get $2 billion to make the 
necessary transition, diversify their economy, etc. However, no 
such assistance is provided in the riding of Saint-Jean and in 
Quebec, among others, who is the primary milk producer in Canada 
with 40 per cent of the country's milk production. Once again, 
Quebec is being targeted and more specifically the riding of 
Saint-Jean.
<P>
	The military college is not the only institution to be closed. This 
year, it was announced that Saint-Jean's employment centre would 
also be closed. Thirty second and third line employees from the 
employment centre are to be redeployed throughout the Montérégie 
region and will have to move. These people are wondering whether 
they will follow their jobs. They are wondering whether they will 
move to Saint-Hubert or Longueuil.
<P>
	In the meantime, industries and the jobless go to the Saint-Jean 
employment centre where there is only first line staff to take note 
of their plight and concerns. However, when the time comes to 
follow up on these cases, the employees are no longer there.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	The second and third lines of service have gone somewhere else 
in the Montérégie area. This is utterly deplorable. We could 
understand it if the unemployment insurance account were in 
deficit. We could understand even more if the government were 
contributing to the unemployment insurance account, but this is not 
the case, in either instance. The government is not contributing to 
the account, and the account is showing a $5 billion surplus every 
year. Not only was there a $5 billion surplus this year, there will be 
one next year also with the new proposed measures. They want to 
dip even deeper into that account, not to take care of the 
unemployed but to help wipe out the government deficit.
<P>
	In Saint-Jean, an area still facing closures, it is hard to 
accept-and this is an acid criticism levelled at the 
government-that it could say: ``Listen, we have to cut 
unemployment insurance; we know that you need it, but 
unemployed people will get better benefits''. Yet, just the opposite 
is happening.
<P>
	The customs office in Saint-Jean is closing down. There were 
two customs officers. The Saint-Jean office was the oldest inland 
customs office in Canada, but it just closed down. The industries in 
Saint-Jean that are experiencing difficulties in matters of customs 
clearance have been told: ``Listen, we will do it by computer. Also, 
you will send your files to the officers in the Lacolle customs 
office, who will come if there are are problems''.
<P>
	In that regard, I can tell you that all the industries in the riding of 
Saint-Jean are opposing this measure. The area is like a sieve, in 
any case. The Richelieu River flows by the city of Saint-Jean. In 
Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel, we have a customs office on a 
wharf that extends 300 or 400 feet into the river, which is about one 
mile wide. I am convinced smugglers go by on the other side of the 
river. All the customs officer can do is call in the RCMP. But the 
RCMP has not been spared by the cuts, and it takes a few hours 
before it starts going after the smugglers. So, anybody can go 
through. The government loses large amounts of money customs 
could collect. That is just another disaster for Saint-Jean. 
Saint-Jean is once again under fire, and the customs office there 
was closed down.
<P>
	The Fonds de solidarité and the CSN Fondaction, which is just 
starting out, are also under attack. The minister told us these funds 
have proved their value, and they no longer need the same level of 
incentive. Let me remind the minister that the CSN Fondaction is 
just starting out and that the Fonds de solidarité is the pride not 
only of Saint-Jean, but of Quebec as a whole.
<P>
	The Fonds de solidarité, the CSN Fondaction, and the Caisse de 
dépôt are all part of the distinctiveness of the Quebec society. That 
is what the distinct society is all about. We should not keep trying 
to water down its meaning, and try to replace it with the concept of 
principal homeland of the French language, which is the new 
buzzword.
<P>
	I am sorry, but the distinct society has always been a reality, and 
it means what it says. Concerning these  funds, I feel it is important 
to point out that they are a feature of the distinct society. They are a 
way to handle the economy in Quebec which is clearly distinct and 
different from what is going on in the rest of Canada. It thought it 
was important to mention it in passing because it was sheer 
nonsense for the Quebec Liberal Party to say, during the week-end: 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1441"> 1441 </A></B>
<P>
``We will no longer talk about a distinct society''. For now, we will 
talk about a cultural homeland and, next year, if English Canada 
still has a problem with that, we will just use the expression 
homeland. And then, we will water it down until there is nothing 
left. Let me say that the Bloc Quebecois will closely watch how 
things evolve on this issue and will oppose any such proposal.
<P>
	On the last point, Mr. Speaker, I beg your indulgence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I will speak to you in English because I am taking 
some courses in English at the language school base militaire in 
Saint-Jean. They say my English has improved. I have a very nice 
teacher, Brenda Hunter. She told me that if I want to follow these 
courses next year I had better say a few words in English in the 
House, not reading but expressing myself without any notes.
<P>
	I decided that for the last part I would denounce the measures in 
the budget concerning the language school in Saint-Jean. Earlier 
there were almost 150 teachers in Saint-Jean and nowadays there 
are around 75. The numbers are falling. The Department of 
National Defence is trying to extinguish the language school in 
Saint-Jean and we do not know why.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	Why are more people not coming to Saint-Jean to take these 
courses? We have a most modern laboratory and some very 
competent and knowledgeable teachers who do a great job. That is 
why I have to say once again that it is a scandal to try and close 
down a very important and very effective institution like the one in 
Saint-Jean.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I think you will agree that my first words of English 
in the House were not too bad.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, we consider this budget to be totally unacceptable. I feel 
that I have been fully mandated by the constituents from Saint-Jean 
to vote against this budget, but my colleagues across the way need 
not be afraid since we have come up with some positive 
amendments. That is what I call democracy.
<P>
	I will, of course, be very pleased to vote in favour of the 
amendment put forward by the Bloc Quebecois in order to make 
the changes needed in the budget. I hope my colleagues opposite 
will support this very important amendment. If not, they will have 
to understand that the constituents in my riding have mandated me 
to vote against this year's Liberal budget.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my hon. colleague from 
Winnipeg North.
<P>
	I am pleased to take part in the debate on the government's third 
budget, one which gives credence to the three main goals of the 
agenda since it was elected: job creation, economic growth and 
deficit reduction.
<P>
	First, I would like to commend the Minister of Finance for 
respecting the will of the voters which was clearly expressed 
regarding taxation. Canadians did not want a tax hike because they 
believe they are already paying their fair share of taxes.
<P>
	Given the delicate state of the Canadian economy at the present 
time, the federal government could have opted for harsher 
measures. In fact, some provincial governments such as the present 
Ontario government have chosen this path which I believe does 
nothing but increase the economic problems we face.
<P>
	The Liberal government rejects any solutions based on narrow 
minded ideologies. Instead, the guiding principle to making the 
changes that have to be made are based on pragmatism and fairness 
to all levels of society. As an example, the Canadian health and 
social transfer will be characterized by secure and stable funding 
over the next five years.
<P>
	It is important to remember that the government will legislate a 
floor to provide a sound guarantee that cash transfers will never fall 
below the $11 billion mark at any time during the five-year period. 
This guarantee demonstrates the Liberal government's strong 
commitment to secure Canada's health system, social safety net 
and to build a renewed social and economic union.
<P>
	The government recognizes that Canada is a rich country, rich in 
natural resources and its people. It also recognizes that it is the 
government's responsibility to create opportunities for present and 
future Canadians and that is what it has done. The challenges that 
face our youth are clear. The youth unemployment rate is roughly 
double the national average. Approximately 45 per cent of the new 
jobs created between the years 1990 and the year 2000 will require 
more than 16 years of training and education.
<P>
	This budget provides an additional $165 million over three years 
to help students and their families deal with the increased costs of 
education. This will be done through increased education tax 
credits and an increased limit on parents' contributions through 
their children's registered education savings plan. Eligibility for 
the child care expense allowance has been broadened to help more 
parents undertake education or retraining.
<P>
	Funding for summer student jobs has been doubled. An 
additional $315 million over three years will be  provided in 
addition to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1442"> 1442 </A></B>
<P>
existing fund to create new youth employment opportunities. We 
are committed to a new domestic Team Canada style partnership 
between businesses and governments to create entry level jobs for 
Canada's youth.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	Canadians know direct job creation must come from the private 
sector, but it is incumbent on the government to make sure the 
economic context is the best possible and favours the continuous 
economic growth necessary for job creation.
<P>
	Deficit control requires, among other things, that inflation is 
kept low. This contributes to reducing pressures on interest rates 
and helps control the other costs of doing business. It makes 
Canada more competitive in foreign markets.
<P>
	We can also see dividends from the ability to control the deficit 
and inflation. Short term interest rates have diminished by three 
percentage points since last year's budget. This means a saving of 
$2,400 a year on $100,000 mortgage. Increased competitiveness 
means a strong increase in exports with a record export surplus of 
$28 billion.
<P>
	Canada's trade performance in recent years has been remarkable. 
Exports have soared. The Team Canada approach has proven to be 
a major success with $20 billion in new business deals resulting 
from three major trade missions led by the Prime Minister to Asia 
and Latin America. We all know exports are vital to job creation in 
Canada. Every billion dollars in exports sustains 11,000 to 12,000 
new jobs. Continued progress begins with further fiscal 
improvement and the 1996 budget delivers.
<P>
	The steps proposed in the March 6 budget consolidate and 
extend the first two budgets and further contribute to the economic 
and financial objectives. The government is maintaining its focus 
on reducing program spending because the debt is a problem 
created by government and the solution has to focus primarily in 
our own backyard. That is why of the fiscal actions taken from 
1994-95 to 1998-99, a full 87 per cent have been through 
expenditure savings. Together the three budgets will contribute 
$26.1 billion in savings for 1997-98.
<P>
	However, the 1996 budget goes beyond the bottom line 
calculations. As Liberals we know that financial reform must never 
be an end in itself. The steps taken to get our fiscal House in order 
are a means to an end. What is the end? It is lower interest rates, 
better job growth and the maintenance of cherished social 
programs. These steps are a means to ensure the Canada that all 
Canadians want can be preserved.
<P>
	Many seniors have asked us to address their concerns about 
security for their grandchildren and security for themselves. I am 
pleased to see a new tax free benefit for seniors that will replace the 
old OAS and the GIS  benefits and will ensure the long term 
stability and sustainability for seniors' pensions. These proposed 
improvements to seniors' benefits reflect what the great majority 
of my constituents in Lambton-Middlesex have been asking for, 
as indicated in a survey I conducted last November.
<P>
	The seniors benefits will help those who need it most while 
streamlining the program. It will make the system fair. It will 
guarantee that all current seniors, in fact those who are 60 years of 
age now, and their spouses will receive no less than the current 
pension benefits. Most seniors will receive the same or more 
money under the proposed new system.
<P>
	I am very pleased the Minister of Finance made a decision not to 
allow charter banks to sell insurance from branches. This issue was 
a major concern to my constituents. Keeping the status quo means 
that Canadians will continue to have many choices depending on 
where they live and what their particular needs are.
<P>
	As the member for Lambton-Middlesex, I look forward to 
working with my colleagues to help implement the government's 
commitment to bettering the lives of rural Canadians, a 
commitment that was renewed in the February 27 throne speech. 
This year's budget will build on this foundation through a number 
of initiatives to provide for economic growth and new 
opportunities for the agri-food sector.
<P>
	For example, the government will create a single food inspection 
agency to be responsible for all federally mandated quarantine and 
inspection services. This initiative will reduce overlap and 
duplication by consolidating resources now in the three federal 
departments of agriculture and agri-food, health and fisheries and 
oceans, and will lead to an annual savings of approximately $44 
million starting in 1998-99.
<P>
	While phasing out the remaining dairy subsidies starting August 
1, 1997, the government has made a commitment to supply 
management as part of a long term dairy policy intended to 
maintain a strong and viable Canadian dairy industry. This will 
include a strong defence of Canada's position in the NAFTA 
dispute settlement process. We are also committed to finalizing 
arrangements with the provinces for cost shared safety nets, 
including a whole farm income stabilization program, currently 
NISA, crop insurance and province specific companion programs.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Another major announcement of the March 1996 budget was the 
decision by the government to sell its fleet of 13,000 grain hopper 
cars. It is extremely important that the terms and conditions of the 
sale are established for the maximum benefit of Canada's farming 
community. As stated in the budget, the federal government will 
consider all proposals put forward for the acquisition of the cars.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	In a country as diverse as ours, it is a real privilege for all of 
us to be able to be part of a team that sets objectives and goals, 
and meets them. We do not just talk about them. We meet them. 
We have set the challenges for the years to come. Through the 
Minister of Finance and all who are involved in the process, we 
will continue to meet each and every one of these challenges.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a short question. The member for 
Lambton-Middlesex talked about the sale of 13,000 hopper cars, 
which is an extremely important issue in my riding and in my area.
<P>
	Most of the time, when one wants to buy a used product such as a 
car, one goes to the lot and asks the sales person what the price is. 
He or she will say that the price of the car is $5,000, $3,000 or 
$10,000.
<P>
	In the case of the producer coalition which wants to buy the 
13,000 hopper cars, the Minister of Finance or Treasury Board or 
the Minister of Transport or whoever is responsible will not tell the 
farmers what is the asking price for the cars.
<P>
	Does she really think it is fair to ask producers to come up with a 
proposal to buy the cars when they are not told what is the asking 
price for those cars? They have not been given the details of how 
those cars will be administered and allocated after they have been 
purchased.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. This is 
certainly a concern that was expressed to me in my riding while we 
were home for the Easter break.
<P>
	The government is proposing to meet with all concerned parties. 
We have to understand that these hopper cars were bought by 
taxpayers' money Canada-wide. It is very important how the 
consultation process goes with the producers as well as with the 
Minister of Finance, with the minister of agriculture. It is not just 
the west but it is the east as well that has to share in the burden of 
this.
<P>
	I have seen allocations that perhaps the cars are worth $300,000 
or $400,000. In due time when these people sit down and negotiate 
terms of where the hopper cars are going to be sold, it will solve 
itself.
<P>
	It is all well and good for farmers or commodity groups to bid on 
these. We have to work collectively on this. There is not much 
point in owning hopper cars if we are not compatible with the 
railway system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on the 
1996 budget which was tabled in Parliament March 6.
<P>
	It reflects the priorities of the government. It ensures that the 
need to be more frugal will never come before the need to be more 
compassionate and fair. It strikes a  delicate balance between fiscal 
reality and social responsibility.
<P>
	The government has met its deficit reduction targets and is on its 
way to surpassing them without raising taxes. At the same time, it 
is protecting and preserving our valued social programs like 
medicare and pension programs for seniors.
<P>
	These twin goals have been achieved through good governance. 
The response from the Canadian public has been positive. The day 
after the budget was delivered last month, newspapers across the 
country carried headlines expressing optimism and support.
<P>
	In my home town, the Winnipeg <I>Free Press</I> gave the finance 
minister high marks for meeting his deficit projections. ``Too many 
finance ministers before him have promised honey and delivered 
vinegar''.
<P>
	This achievement in fiscal responsibility and stability has 
contributed to Canada's strong economic performance and 
therefore job creation. Since 1993, when the Liberals took office, 
nearly 600,000 jobs have been created nationwide.
<P>
	In addition, the merchandise trade surplus has increased and 
short term interest rates have decreased, decreasing the amount of 
mortgage payments which citizens have to pay. Inflation has fallen 
sharply. All of these have boosted investor confidence in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	The deficit targets of 3 per cent of GDP for 1996-97 and 2 per 
cent for 1997-98 will be achieved. In 1997-98 the financial 
requirements of government will fall to $6 billion or about 0.7 per 
cent of GDP, making it the lowest since 1969 and the lowest of any 
central government in the G-7 countries.
<P>
	All of these achievements will translate into job creation, which 
remains the number one priority of the government. I am pleased 
that we have created over half a million jobs since 1993. However, 
we know this is not enough and that is why our efforts of job 
creation remain our overwhelming commitment.
<P>
	Budgeting is more than putting our fiscal house in order and 
more than deficit reduction. It is more than balancing our revenues 
and expenditures. Financial stewardship is only a tool to the 
primary purpose of government which is to serve citizens.
<P>
	Canadians value our nation's social programs. We worry when 
we hear of hospital closures, cuts to education funding and 
reductions to social assistance for the less fortunate in society. 
Canadians wonder how universal medicare, access to 
post-secondary education and social assistance can be sustained 
given all the pressures on our system.
<P>
	Therefore in order to ease the mind of citizens and to reaffirm 
the government's commitment to health, education and social 
assistance, the 1996 budget provides  the stability and subsequent 
growth to its transfers to the provinces by legislating a new 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1444"> 1444 </A></B>
<P>
five-year funding arrangement for the Canada health and social 
transfer program beginning in 1998-99.
<P>
	Entitlements over this period will grow from $25.1 billion to 
approximately $27.4 billion. More important, there will be a new 
cash floor for transfers of at least $11.1 billion in all years 
thereafter. This will give the federal government the leverage to 
maintain our valued social programs.
<P>
	For the province of Manitoba, where I come from, the major 
transfers in terms of the Canada health and social transfer and the 
equalization payments which later on will replace the established 
programs financing will exceed $2 billion in 1996-97 and are 
expected to total roughly $1,875 per person in 1995-96, about 48 
per cent of the national average. We see there is a significant 
transfer of money from the federal government to the province of 
Manitoba.
<P>
	Just for comparison, per capita Manitoba will be getting less 
than Newfoundland, P.E.I., Nova Scotia and New Brunswick but it 
will be getting more than Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta 
and B.C.
<P>
	That defines for us the character of our nation: those who have 
more share with those who have less. It also defines our Canadian 
identity.
<P>
	Secure and growing funding for our transfer program will ensure 
the federal government's capacity to uphold the five principles of 
medicare: universality, portability, accessibility, non-private, 
public administration, and comprehensiveness; as well, the 
principle that no residency requirement can be imposed on social 
assistance recipients who move from one province to another.
<P>
	These measures will enable the government to keep its deficit 
reduction targets while protecting the future of our social 
programs. This type of balanced approach tells us how the 
government is very fiscally realistic and at the same time very 
socially responsible.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Canada currently spends approximately 10 per cent of GDP on 
health care. Other nations spend more but do not provide universal 
access to their citizens. Indeed we are fortunate in Canada. We 
enjoy universal access. It is one of the most envied health care 
systems in the world. However, we realize we must do all we can to 
protect our system. We must ensure that each and every health care 
dollars is spent wisely.
<P>
	To this end we would like to know in which new technologies 
and techniques to invest, which old ones to retain or abandon and 
how to organize health services to get the maximum benefit from 
available resources. This is our commitment. Because of this the 
budget has  allocated health services research funds to the tune of 
$65 million.
<P>
	As well, the budget has increased assistance to those in need 
with the new child support taxation measures to benefit our 
children, the future of our nation. We have not forgotten our 
seniors. We are committed to introducing a new seniors benefit 
program that will ensure sustainability by targeting those who need 
assistance most without affecting the benefits received by current 
seniors.
<P>
	The government cannot do it alone. That is why the government 
has challenged the private sector. We know that a measure of 
success in any country is when citizens try their own initiatives and 
at the same time commit and challenge themselves in the service of 
the country.
<P>
	Imagine a country that is number one in which to live, according 
to the United Nations. Imagine a country where interest rates have 
decreased over 300 bases points since early 1995, a country where 
deficit targets have consistently decreased from 6 per cent, to 5 per 
cent, to 3 per cent and to 2 per cent until the budget is balanced. 
Imagine a country where financial requirements will fall to $6 
billion or .7 per cent of the GDP from $30 billion or 4.2 per cent in 
1993-94, the lowest since 1969 and the lowest in any central 
government of the G-7 countries. Imagine when the drop in 
program spending has been dramatic, from 16.8 per cent to 12 per 
cent. That country is Canada and budget '96 reflects the soul of this 
country.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. 
colleague mentioned that job creation is a priority for this 
government. I think that this government has failed miserably as 
far as job creation is concerned.
<P>
	These last few weeks, I have worked on the issue of the closing, 
in Sainte-Thérèse, Quebec, of the plant operated by Kenworth, an 
American firm. More than 800 workers stand to lose their jobs and 
more than 800 Sainte-Thérèse families will be affected. This is 
utterly tragic for these families which are faced with a very limited 
future.
<P>
	I say to my hon. colleague that, true, jobs have been created, but 
tens and hundreds of thousands of others have been lost. The jobs 
that are created are precarious, temporary and poorly paid. These 
days, business executives specialize in laying off their employees. 
The more they lay off, the more efficient they are.
<P>
	In the federal Department of Citizenship and Immigration, 
immigrants complain that they can no longer meet a public servant 
or talk with one on the telelphone, that their calls are always 
answered by machines. They do not get answers to their problems.

<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague what concrete job creation 
initiatives are found in this budget, apart from the creation of a few 
summer jobs for students?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is indeed sad that downsizing 
has to happen but it is an essential component of good governance.
<P>
	It is indeed sad that some jobs have been lost, but at the same 
time we have the new economy. Therefore we have to adjust our 
country and our citizenry to that new economy. We must realize 
that when we have created over half a million jobs, and I hope the 
member would agree with me, that some who have been laid off in 
their previous jobs would have found new jobs among the new jobs 
created. This is the reality of our times.
<P>
	In terms of specific projects, the summer student program is 
there for our youth and I would not like to belittle that, as the 
member may suggest, as only because the unemployment rate 
among our youth is among the highest compared to any other age 
groups. We have to focus on our youth.
<P>
	It does not mean we have not focused as well on job creation for 
those beyond the youth age. Jobs have been created for them. We 
have the Team Canada spirit where the government in partnership 
with the private sector would create jobs. When we work 
co-operatively and in collaboration with each other we will create 
more jobs.
<P>
	As I indicated during debate, of course the government is not 
happy that we have created only this much. We will continue to do 
more, but if we can work together we will achieve that goal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the member for Okanagan Centre.
<P>
	It seems that when people put together a budget, and certainly it 
should be no different for a government, a budget should be 
reflective of a plan. As we take a look at the affairs of the 
government day after day we see they are disorganized, in disarray. 
Most of all we have a strong sense of disappointment that the 
Liberals are effectively betraying the trust given to them by 
Canadians in the 1993 election.
<P>
	None is anymore true than in the case of the heritage minister. 
The heritage minister has been going around Canada making verbal 
droppings of different ideas that she has. She has no organization, 
no plan and no idea of what will be happening next. Let me give 
some examples.
<P>
	Before she came on board, this has been a problem within the 
department of heritage right from the word go. Probably the most 
classic example would be the so-called Juneau commission that 
was examining the affairs of the CBC, Telefilm Canada and the 
National Film Board.
<P>
	It started off in May of last year with the idea of having its report 
complete by September. It did not complete the report by 
September. It said it would be completing it by November. We were 
rather curious to see how many dollars it had already consumed to 
the end of its original report period. It had consumed over $900,000 
in that period of time.
<P>
	The committee went past its November deadline and said it 
would deliver its report in January. Again we went to access to 
information and we discovered that the $900,000 had ballooned to 
$1.6 million. Within that $1.6 million was an entry for $60,000 for 
the three commissioners. I think it was instructive that in the 
original set of numbers of $900,000 there was no money for the 
commissioners, no money at least reported at that point, and 
suddenly out of the $1.6 million there is $60,000.
<P>
	Then the committee came forward with its report in January, and 
what a report it was. It was absolutely brilliant, saying that 
Canadian who chose not to watch the CBC and who get cable 
would really enjoy paying an extra cable fee, an extra cable tax to 
cover the costs of the CBC which they did not want to watch in the 
first place. Or if they did not want to get cable, maybe it would be a 
good idea if we were to charge them some kind of a levy or tax on 
their video rentals. Apart from the fact that it really did not 
accomplish anything we know the report is going to end up on the 
shelf and nothing is ever going to happen to it, and what did we 
pay? We paid $2.75 million for that report.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	What was particularly instructive was how the heritage 
minister's friends made out, the cultural elite who were doing the 
report. In the first instance in September there was no mention of 
any fee for the commissioners. In November there was mention of 
$60,000. In January when this wonderful tome finally came 
forward, it cost the Canadian taxpayers $300,000 for the part time 
work of these commissioners.
<P>
	We dug a little further and of course we were making noises 
about the fact that it did not seem right that these people should be 
getting $100,000 for about seven or eight months of part time 
work. One of the commissioners suddenly piped up and said: ``Oh, 
I did not take anything'', which makes it even worse. Now there are 
two commissioners digging into the pockets of Canadian taxpayers 
for $150,000 each for seven months work. Not bad work if one can 
get it I guess. That is typical of this government. It takes care of its 
friends and keeps on going through these reports but it does not 
have any plan.
<P>
	When the heritage minister took over the portfolio what 
happened with respect to Radio Canada International? Radio 
Canada International performs a valuable function for Canada. It 
has approximately 125 employees and its budget is approximately 
$16 million. It  is of interest to note that in order to get the short 
wave 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1446"> 1446 </A></B>
<P>
out, almost $1 million of the $16 million is consumed in hydro 
power alone. It is really quite an enterprise. However, it has 125 
loyal employees who were told in November last year that their 
services would no longer be required as of April 1.
<P>
	The heritage minister loves to do these little droppings all over 
the place. She said that we were going to save Radio Canada 
International, which was good news. Except she got her portfolio in 
the latter part of January and then she had to figure out where the 
money was going to come from.
<P>
	She went to the CBC. We are going to be talking about the CBC 
in just a second. She ended up taking $8 million from the CBC. 
Then she scavenged around with a tin cup and came up with 
another $8 million for a total of the $16 million.
<P>
	There is no plan. Radio Canada International is still in the state it 
was previously. Radio Canada International has a reprieve of one 
more year with absolutely no idea of how it is going to be kept on 
the air or how it is going to keep this valuable service going.
<P>
	It has been my position as Reform Party heritage critic that we 
have to look at privatizing and look at other ways of funding 
valuable functions like Radio Canada International other than from 
the pockets of taxpayers, other than going into debt. However there 
is no plan.
<P>
	I should note that members of the staff and management of 
Radio Canada International are to be highly commended for 
staying on the job doing their work and keeping the faith while the 
minister kept them waiting for a full five and a half months from 
the time they were told they were no longer needed. Only two 
weeks before they did not know where their next mortgage 
payment would come from, she said she had scrounged around and 
had come up with some dollars.
<P>
	What about the CBC? The minister is particularly noted for what 
I call her Canadiana. She loves to say that she is going to give us a 
much more wonderful Canada. I must admit that along with a lot of 
Canadians I am becoming increasingly sceptical of whether the 
government will be able to do what it says it will be able to do. 
What the government says and what it does very frequently do not 
match up.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	An example is the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation which the 
Reform Party has said should be privatized. The Liberals have said 
out of one side of their mouth they are going to keep the CBC as a 
public broadcaster funded with public funds, but they have already 
cut $227 million. They now have to find $150 million more by 
1998. It is no wonder that without any kind of direction or a 
mandate the unions today are in a position of being able to take a 
strike vote the week of April 22, next week.
<P>
	A report from Canadian Press today states that if no deal is 
reached between the CBC's three unions and management a strike 
or lockout involving 7,000 employees could happen as early as 
May. They are presently fighting over the issue, as it were, of 
contracting out, in other words, how much information or 
programming will be done in house by these unions for the CBC.
<P>
	This question cannot be resolved because of the lack of direction 
of the heritage minister and the lack of direction of the government. 
This is the reason I and many Canadians are so sceptical that the 
government will be able to do what it says it is going to do.
<P>
	Last Friday the minister announced a $10 million program. I 
should explain that this comes out of a $120 million slush fund set 
up by the finance minister. This $10 million program is called 
Young Canada Works. It theoretically is going to put 1,900 people 
in the age bracket of 16 to 30 to work. It is going to involve high 
school and college students. Of those 1,900 it would be fair to 
speculate that this summer about one million people are going to be 
looking for work. That means one person in five hundred is going 
to be able to take advantage of the program, but how much of a 
program is it?
<P>
	Let us make it clear. The Canadian Museums Association in a 
news release it also put out over the weekend expressed some 
happiness that this was in place. However, the association should 
know that the Deputy Prime Minister, Canada's heritage minister, 
has no idea where the funds are coming from for any of its projects 
either. What she has basically done is she has slipped her hand into 
this $120 million slush fund and has come out with $10 million.
<P>
	This is going to be shared with other institutions. It is going to be 
shared with Young Canada Works in both official languages, Young 
Canada Works in national parks and historic sites, Young Canada 
Works for urban and aboriginal youth, and Young Canada Works in 
heritage institutions.
<P>
	The point of my submission is that this government has no plan. 
The minister is out of control. She has no idea of what she is doing. 
This budget and the way the minister is administering her heritage 
department is disgraceful.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member for Kootenay East began his debate by stating that the 
government has absolutely no plan and that the budget should be 
reflective of the government's plan.
<P>
	I refer him to the throne speech we began this session with. The 
throne speech did refer to our commitment to jobs and growth, 
youth, science, technology and trade. The throne speech referred to 
security for Canadians. A secure social safety net is very important 
for the people  of Canada. The throne speech referred to a modern 
and united country. Federalism is constantly evolving. There were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1447"> 1447 </A></B>
<P>
promises made in the throne speech about a first ministers meeting 
which will be coming up probably in June of this year.
<P>
	I now refer the member to the budget. The purpose of the budget 
is to spell out the government's plan in detail and the 
implementation of the government's plan. Beginning with our 
platform in 1993 we fulfilled certain commitments halfway 
through our mandate. Now we are showing Canadians how we are 
going to meet the rest of our commitments in the latter half of our 
mandate.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to read the throne speech and the 
budget speech again. I think he will be assured and he can assure 
his constituents that this government has a very clear plan for the 
future growth of this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member unwittingly makes my 
point. My point is that there is no connection between what is 
contained in the throne speech and the budget and the activities of 
the minister. For example on the issue of the fly flag program of the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, the Reform Party would say ``buy 
flag, fly flag''. In other words, let us have some responsibility. Let 
us spend $2 on a little flag and let us fly the flag. Let us spend $30 
on a larger flag let us fly the flag. Let us take some responsibility 
for that.
<P>
	The minister wants to go back to 1967 and as a consequence she 
has come forward with a plan. Her fly flag program was running 
before the civil servants in her ministry had any idea where the 
flags were going to come from. Calls were coming in and they had 
absolutely no idea what they were doing or how they were going to 
do it. Is it going to cost $2 million, $4 million, $6 million? I do not 
know and neither do her officials. She came up with $150,000 out 
of thin air for a lacrosse project. It goes on and on and is absolutely 
astounding.
<P>
	The Liberal member has underscored my point. Yes we have a 
throne speech and yes we have a budget, both which have nothing 
whatsoever to do with what the minister is doing on a day to day 
basis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
surprised my colleague has attacked the Deputy Prime Minister and 
minister of heritage, with her knowledge and vision of Canada, her 
commitment to this nation, her boundless energy, her tremendous 
creativity. I applaud her flag program. I cannot see the value in 
attacking it.
<P>
	I am also disappointed the member would say the minister does 
not have a plan. The minister does have a plan. Either the hon. 
member does not understand the plan or he is simply quibbling 
about the fact it is not his plan and therefore he is unhappy.
<P>
	I would ask my colleague to tell us what his plans are. He 
suggests he knows what he would do. Let us hear it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is rather silly to say let us hear the 
Reform Party plan. In 30 seconds we are supposed to have a plan.
<P>
	Every time we end up talking about the heritage minister and the 
fact that she does run willy-nilly on these things, suddenly I am 
attacking her commitment to Canada. I would suggest that kind of 
rhetoric is really unfortunate. To question the commitment to 
Canada of anyone in this House, save 53 members, is beyond the 
pale.
<P>
	We should be able to point out that the minister does run around 
indiscriminately making all sorts of announcements which her 
officials then have to run around picking up after her, without my 
being questioned as to whether I question her credibility to 
Canadians. Of course she is proud to be Canadian and is committed 
to Canada, as are the majority of people in this House and I.
<P>
	The minister is lacking in credibility on the promises she made 
on the issue of the GST. She is also lacking in credibility by 
continuing to come forward saying let us do this with the collection 
fee for the CBC, or let us do that with respect to the CRTC. There is 
no plan which is exactly the point.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage has the ability to be a 
tremendous fixer of Canada, a cement builder for Canada. It can 
glue things and permanently pull things together in Canada. As 
long as this minister continues to fly off in all directions at once we 
will never see the full value of the Department of Canadian 
Heritage, and this is a shame.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
draw the attention of the House on this debate to perhaps a little 
different approach. I focus it in the words of a professor at a 
university who was referring to Aristotle, the great teacher and 
great philosopher about democracy and how it should operate. He 
said people in government exercise a teaching function. Among 
other things we, the people, see what they, the government 
officials, do and think that this is how we should act.
<P>
	Whether we like it or not the position of legislators in this and 
many other countries and how they act is somehow interpreted by 
the people that they should act that way as well.
<P>
	If we examine this budget from that context and look at the 
message it sends to the people, in particular to young people, I 
suggest that there is very little to be proud of. Let us take a few 
moments to reflect on some of the messages the budget sends.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1448"> 1448 </A></B>
<P>
	The first message is if you cannot afford it, borrow it. The 
second is if you do not want to pay for it, borrow it  and tax future 
generations and/or spread the burden on to others in society. How 
have Canadians responded to these messages not only in this 
budget but in previous budgets? This is not a new trend in Canada.
<P>
	For example, if you cannot afford it, borrow. Personal debt in 
Canada, including credit card debt, is at an all time high. There is 
some indication that less than 10 per cent of the disposable income 
of Canadians is discretionary. In other words, they do not have 
much flexibility to spend that little bit of income they have left 
over after they are taxed. Is it any wonder our retailers are crying 
that people are not buying? Our economy is dying because they 
cannot buy. How can they? They have borrowed to the maximum. 
Almost all of their discretionary income is going to paying those 
debts so they do not have money to spend.
<P>
	Then the retailers and the other business people ask how can they 
get them to buy more. They have various schemes like do not pay 
until next year, do not pay until two years from now, and most 
recently, do not pay anything until three years from now. That is 
dangerous.
<P>
	The second message was if you do not want to pay for it, borrow 
it and tax future generations and/or spread the burden on others in 
society. There is a very strong situation today, and some legislation 
has been introduced in the House, that students do not repay their 
loans. Is that good? No, it is not. Can we blame them when they 
look at their government and say the government is not living up to 
its promises? It borrows to pay the interest on the debt that is 
outstanding. The students see this and say there is a double 
standard. The government says to the student ``you pay'' but when 
it comes to its own debt it just keeps on borrowing more.
<P>
	Abuses to the UI system are examples of how we distribute it 
around to other members of society. Quit a job that one has to work 
at for 365 days and get a job where one can be employed for 12 
weeks and then collect pogey for the other 40 weeks of the year. 
Who pays for that? Not the individual who incurred it; it is 
someone else.
<P>
	The example Canadians see that is set by the federal government 
in this and previous budgets is one which no one should follow if 
they want to be in control of their own financial future. The budget 
is the major policy document of a government and as such ought to 
be the best example of how Canadians should operate. It does 
exactly the opposite.
<P>
	There is another part to this. The budget as it was proposed to us 
says it is not necessary to tell the whole truth; just tell the people 
what they want to hear. The deficit is going down which means we 
are getting closer to balancing the budget. That is good, is it not? 
So far, so good.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	However, do not tell them the debt is actually increasing. Do not 
tell them the interest is actually increasing. Do not tell them it will 
continue into the future because there is no plan to eliminate the 
deficit. Nor is there a target date as to when the budget will be 
balanced. Do not tell them there will be less disposable income as a 
result of this budget because taxes will have to increase to pay for it 
all.
<P>
	Do not admit that in the election campaign the government 
promised to kill, slash, eliminate the GST. Instead, quote page 22 
of the red book which does not promise to eliminate the GST but to 
harmonize it.
<P>
	Do not admit the verbal promises of the Prime Minister and the 
Deputy Prime Minister went well beyond the provisions of the red 
book. Instead, when called to account, they declare: ``I am not 
responsible for what I said. I am only responsible for what is said in 
the red book''. That is quite an example, is it not? It is the wrong 
example for our young people.
<P>
	Do not tell them there will be a direct and negative impact on 
social programs, particularly medicare, education and seniors' 
pensions. In other words, there will be less money available for 
these programs.
<P>
	At the same time, we have the government telling us it is really 
serious about looking after seniors, making sure their pension 
benefits will continue, that they will be at least as well off as they 
are today. How can it be serious about a statement like that when 
the message the budget sends is different?
<P>
	At the heart of this comes another issue, freedom or liberty. 
Probably the most serious implication of this and previous budgets 
is that this important policy document, especially in our senior 
government, is the absence of wisdom and responsibility in that 
budget.
<P>
	It is not wise to spend more money on government programs 
than the government collects in revenue. It is not responsible to 
incur debt in one generation which a future generation will have to 
service and ultimately repay.
<P>
	How different the attitude that was just published about 
Albertans. They were asked in a recent poll what the government 
should do with the surplus. They said to the government pay down 
the debt, do not reduce taxes. That is wisdom. They understand that 
as the debt is paid down, the interest to service that debt comes 
down. That means even if the taxes are kept at the same level, they 
will buy more. That is wisdom. That is also responsible.
<P>
	From that perspective, the Alberta position is the correct 
position. The position of the federal government says keep on 
borrowing. It is dishonourable and it is an example that we as 
Canadians should not follow in our own lives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1449"> 1449 </A></B>
<P>
	The burgeoning debt is the problem. It is the issue. It stands 
at $581 billion today. We have an interest bill of $47 billion. In 
the four years, as indicated in the 1996 budget, this contemporary 
federal government has added over $100 billion to the federal 
debt.
<P>
	Why is that important? As has been already indicated, it 
increases the service costs, particularly the interest payments. Any 
dollar that is added to the debt will change the amount of interest 
paid.
<P>
	Each point of interest has an impact as well. Supposing the 
interest rates should rise, and it looks like they will, each point rise 
in the interest rate itself adds $1 billion immediately to the total 
interest bill.
<P>
	How much is $1 billion? There is a very interesting bit of 
arithmetic that somebody did not too long ago. I wish I had the time 
to figure these things out. Somebody sat down and figured it out. If 
one counted a number at the rate of one per second consistently, 
each second there would be a complete number. It would take just 
short of 32 years to get to $1 billion. That is how much would be 
added to the interest if the interest rate rises 1 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Each time that happens it increases the amount of money that 
future generations will be expected to repay. At present levels of 
roughly 30 million people in Canada and a federal debt of about 
$600 billion, that is $20,000 per person. Any child born today 
comes into the world with a $20,000 debt they will be responsible 
for in order for us to liquidate that date.
<P>
	That is what we are doing but is that what Canadians wanted? I 
do not think so. The number one requirement, which the 
government hit right on the head when it went into the election, is 
to create jobs, jobs, jobs. That is exactly what we wanted.
<P>
	We had over this last week a very interesting development on 
Friday afternoon and it raises some very interesting questions. For 
example, airlines in Canada must be 75 per cent owned by 
Canadians in order to fly but bus lines transporting people on the 
highways do not have that restriction. What kind of sense does this 
make? Is this a matter of Canadian culture and Canadian identity or 
is it about competition and preferential treatment of some over 
others?
<P>
	What is it we want to preserve? A viable economy? A Canadian 
culture? Preservation of our social programs? I say it is all three. 
We want all of these. Our job should be to establish and maintain a 
culture which rewards entrepreneurship, innovation and research 
and ensures a level, competitive and honest workplace and 
marketplace.
<P>
	Governments lead by example. I implore the Prime Minister that 
the government change the example so we can follow it because it 
reflects wisdom and responsibility, not this last budget which 
reflects the exact  opposite of wisdom and responsibilities; it is 
neither wise nor responsible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
following on the point of not being wise or responsible, that is a 
fairly substantial indictment.
<P>
	Earlier I spoke about being part of the solution rather than part of 
the problem. When the government took over after the last 
election, the financial year ended in March 1994 and the 
government had a deficit of 6 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	The finance minister in his first budget brought in the concept of 
two year rolling targets. We have achieved 5 per cent in the first 
full year of deficit to GDP; 4 per cent in the second; 3 per cent will 
be the percentage at the end of March 1997; and a commitment by 
the government, by the finance minister, to further reduce that to 2 
per cent deficit to GDP.
<P>
	We are getting very close to delivering to the people of Canada a 
balanced budget. We have hit the targets. We have set them. They 
have been realistic and balanced in a way which will not impact 
negatively on seniors, on our health care system which keeps the 
country together, on young people, on jobs and on economic 
growth that we have been experiencing.
<P>
	The indictment this member makes tells me he is spending more 
time lamenting the past rather than looking forward to the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it rather interesting that the 
member opposite would suggest that the meeting of the target of 2 
per cent of GDP is a desirable goal for the deficit.
<P>
	I wonder if the member recognizes that doing that means a 
perpetuation of a deficit on a continuing basis. If the gross 
domestic product should rise, which I hope it will and it looks like 
it will, it will automatically allow the government flexibility to 
increase that deficit which means the end result is not a decrease in 
the government debt but an increase in the government debt.
<P>
	The very point the hon. member is making is the exact opposite 
of what he is trying to prove. It it true that there is less of a deficit 
today than there was last year, and that is commendable, but the 
point is that even $1 of deficit is too much because it increases the 
debt. When will the government recognize that to be wise and to be 
responsible means to tell the truth, the whole truth, not part of it? 
Tell the people the implications of this debt. Tell them the 
implications of the interest rates and how it will increase the debt. 
That is the whole story.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Am I supposed to suggest that everything about this budget is 
bad? I did not say that. I said tell the truth, tell it the way it really is 
rather than telling part of the story. That is the issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1450"> 1450 </A></B>
<P>
	The member makes a big point about being on track and having 
reached the targets, et cetera. There was a target. It was to 
eliminate the GST. I ask him, where is the elimination of the GST? 
That was the promise. That was the promise they campaigned on. 
Where is it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
cannot let the hon. member's incorrect statements go unchallenged.
<P>
	I refer him to the budget speech. He complains about what was 
and was not said to the public. The Minister of Finance said: ``The 
new funds that government must borrow from financial markets 
each year will be cut to $6 billion, 0.7 per cent of GDP in 1997, the 
lowest among all G-7 central governments''. The minister went on 
to say: ``The debt to GDP ratio, the size of the debt in relation to 
Canada's economy, will finally begin to decline in 1997-98. The 
economy will grow faster than the debt''. There are the statements 
in black and white made publicly in the House of Commons.
<P>
	How can the Reform members, speaker after speaker, say that we 
are not open and honest with the public?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, my point has been proven again. I 
quite agree the government is going in the right direction. But it 
does not matter how long we proceed or how much slower we 
proceed to the edge of the waterfall, the waterfall is coming. If we 
slow down the canoe by paddling backwards slower or faster so 
that progress toward the edge of the precipice decreases, we are 
still going to come to the edge of the precipice sooner or later.
<P>
	With all due respect to those statements, the fact still remains 
that the debt is increasing and our interest costs are increasing. 
Unless we change that direction we will not get our debt under 
control.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak in support of the 1996 
budget brought down in the House on March 6, 1996 by my hon. 
colleague, the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Let me say at the outset that I believe this is a good budget for all 
Canadians. It has particular relevance to many aspects of my 
portfolio as Minister of Natural Resources.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The difficult decisions we took and the measures that we 
announced create an environment conducive to economic growth 
and job creation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The variety of measures announced by the hon. Minister of 
Finance affecting the natural resources sector result from a series 
of intensive consultations with the provinces, with industry and 
with stakeholders in Canada's natural resources sector. We listened 
to the views of Canadians and we delivered.
<P>
	The announcements by the Minister of Finance solidify my 
department's progress to focus on sustainable development and 
jobs and growth in the energy, mining, forestry and earth sciences 
sectors. This progress is critical because these sectors make a 
substantial contribution to Canada's overall economic growth, to 
job creation and to the trade surplus.
<P>
	In addition, the work of my department reflects the federal 
government's core responsibilities in those areas where national 
effort and co-ordination are necessary.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First, I would like to talk about the budget announcements 
regarding renewable energy and energy efficiency. Canadians who 
work in the renewable energy sector have a vision of the future. 
They work hard to ensure that Canada is at the leading edge of 
developments in this important sector.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the spirit that environmental health and economic 
development should complement each other, the federal 
government's green power procurement policy and the tax changes 
in the 1996 budget emphasized the commitment we made in the red 
book to renewable energy and energy efficiency industries.
<P>
	The income tax changes will provide a level playing field for 
certain renewable and non-renewable energy investments. The 
creation of the Canadian renewable and conservation expenses, or 
CRCE, will provide renewable energy investments with similar 
treatment to that afforded to non-renewables.
<P>
	This will attract new investment to the Canadian renewable 
energy industry. Officials in my department will join their 
colleagues at Finance Canada to begin consultations with 
stakeholders to determine the types of expenses that will be 
included under this expenditure category. I expect this work to be 
completed this fall.
<P>
	I should point out that I have been gratified to receive many 
letters from individuals and associations in the renewable energy 
sector who expressed their thanks to the Government of Canada for 
these progressive announcements in the 1996 budget. These 
announcements respond to the needs of the Canadian renewable 
energy industry. We listened and we delivered.
<P>
	For this reason, I am working with my colleague, the hon. 
Minister of Finance, on a process for consultations on proposals for 
tax measures to promote energy efficiency investments. I expect to 
join my hon. colleague in making an announcement on the 
timetable for consultations very shortly. The objective for this 
process will be to recommend measures for implementation in the 
1997 budget.
<P>
	In the meantime, I am committed to ensuring we play a role in 
further progress by Canada's renewable energy sectors. For
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1451"> 1451 </A></B>
<P>
example, in the very near future I expect to release a renewable 
energy strategy. This strategy will continue to emphasize the 
importance of R and D and stronger market development activities.
<P>
	Success by Canada's renewable energy sector, both at home and 
abroad, will contribute to economic growth and jobs. In addition, 
the renewable energy sector offers significant potential to help 
Canada move toward its international climate change commitment 
to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 
2000.
<P>
	Let me now move to more traditional energy forms. In this 
regard I would like to speak about Alberta's oil sands. Let me 
remind members of the House that the oil sands deposits in Alberta 
are estimated to contain more recoverable oil than all the reserves 
of Saudi Arabia, more than 300 million barrels. The national oil 
sands task force has estimated that in the next 25 years new 
investments totalling approximately $25 billion will help create 
approximately 44,000 permanent new jobs in the oil sands industry.
<P>
	The federal government recognizes the potential of the oil sands 
industry to spur economic growth and create jobs. However, to 
realize the potential of this enormous resource, the oil sands 
industry requires increased investment.
<P>
	To send positive signals to the investment community, the 1996 
federal budget provides a generic tax treatment for all oil sands 
projects. In short, the tax treatment previously accorded to oil 
sands projects using mining methods has been extended to cover all 
oil sands projects. Tax incentives that were available for new 
projects and major expansions will now include investments in 
environmental efficiency improvements.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has made these changes for three 
reasons. They will promote economic growth Canada-wide. They 
will increase domestic oil supply and they will stimulate job 
creation.
<P>
	The fiscal changes made in the 1996 budget, along with recent 
changes to Alberta's royalty framework, will establish a clear, 
consistent and attractive regime for oil sands investors. These 
changes will encourage them to invest in Canada rather than 
competing projects in other countries.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The importance of this attractive framework for the economy of 
Alberta can hardly be overstated. There is no other industrial or 
resource opportunity that compares in size to the oil sands. Oil 
sands development offers the promise of major growth in 
investment and income well into the next century.
<P>
	I should point out these benefits will not be restricted to Alberta. 
Studies conducted under contract to Industry Canada demonstrate 
the procurement benefits from oil sands development will flow to 
more than 50 different  industrial groups. Simply put, jobs will be 
created across the country.
<P>
	Moreover, the changes in the 1996 federal budget affecting the 
oil sands industry reflect many of the recommendations by the 
national task force on oil sands strategies. Again, we listened and 
we delivered.
<P>
	Let us move to other changes announced by the Minister of 
Finance that provide benefits for Canadian mining and oil and gas 
industries. In mining, investment in Canadian mineral exploration 
has been rising. In fact, 1996 will be a banner year for mineral 
exploration. The Government of Canada shares the excitement in 
this increased exploration activity. We are working hard to ensure a 
bright future for mining by living up to the commitments made in 
the Liberal mining policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The mining industry, including the Prospectors and Developers 
Association of Canada and the Association des prospecteurs du 
Québec, were asking for changes to the flow-through share system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	They requested that eligibility rules for these shares be tightened 
to ensure that the benefits are delivered only where they are most 
needed to support new grassroots exploration activity. The 1996 
budget delivered.
<P>
	In addition, the Minister of Finance announced an extension of 
the 60-day rule for flow-through shares to one year. As a 
consequence, mineral and metal and oil and gas exploration 
activities will be more efficient. The risk to investors will be 
reduced and greater efficiencies will likely lead to more 
discoveries. These new mineral discoveries will provide new 
opportunities for economic growth and jobs in Canada and increase 
the benefits of jobs and growth in existing mining communities in 
both rural and urban Canada.
<P>
	I would like to move to other budget announcements, in 
particular those concerning Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, or 
AECL. AECL's budget will be reduced from $174 million in 
1996-97 to $100 million in 1998-99. AECL will focus on 
maintaining a viable and competitive Candu business at a reduced 
cost to the federal government. AECL will capitalize on its 
business potential and will continue to make a significant 
contribution to Canada's economic growth and the creation of high 
skilled jobs in an area of advanced technology.
<P>
	Nearly 20 per cent of Canada's electricity is produced by Candu 
reactors and the foreign sales of Candu technology bring important 
economic benefits home to Canada. For example, the projects to 
build three Candu reactors in South Korea are bringing more than 
$1 billion in contracts to Canadian companies.
<P>
	The magnitude of the budget cuts required difficult trade-offs. 
One of these trade-offs was funding for basic  science activities that 
are not directly linked to the Candu program. However, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1452"> 1452 </A></B>
<P>
Government of Canada is committed to seeking alternative sources 
of funding and other institutional arrangements for some of the key 
basic science activities that AECL has conducted until now.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let me tell you that the decision of the federal government to 
withdraw from the financing of R and D programs concerning 
fusion in Ontario and Quebec was a very difficult one to make but 
that fusion is not presently a priority of the federal government. 
Actually, we believe it will take some 30 years before fusion 
technology can be marketed. The Government of Canada must 
clearly focus its resources on short term priorities.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Moreover we believe that Ontario Hydro and Hydro-Quebec can 
financially support R and D fusion projects on sites where this 
sector is a priority.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government is determined to deliver good 
government at a lower cost to the taxpayers of Canada. My 
department continues to play a leading role in this effort among all 
federal departments and agencies. Let me make a few comments 
about the budget's announcements with respect to the operations of 
my department. All members of this House will recall that the 
results of the first phase of the federal program review dramatically 
reduced the size and the budget of Natural Resources Canada and 
many other departments.
<P>
	The results of the second phase of program review have 
identified further reductions in my department's budget of $14.6 
million or 3.3 per cent in fiscal year 1998-99. Both programs and 
staff levels will be affected. While detailed decisions will be taken 
during the next 18 months, present estimates suggest a reduction of 
between 75 to 100 positions in 1998-99. These further reductions 
together with cuts announced last year will result in a reduction of 
roughly 60 per cent of the resources in my department.
<P>
	These reductions will be reflected in a more focused role for 
NRCan in the natural resources sector, a role that emphasizes 
science and technology, the regulatory and policy regime, 
international trade and market access and knowledge of Canada's 
land mass.
<P>
	Program review is a continuing commitment to get government 
right. We will continue to examine what we do and how we do it. 
The objective is to keep looking for a more efficient and effective 
contribution to a stronger federation. This is critical to meeting the 
future challenges that face Canada, challenges that include 
maintaining the federal contribution to jobs, growth and 
sustainable development in the energy, forestry, mining and earth 
sciences industries. NRCan is achieving what  we promised in the 
speech from the throne. We are withdrawing from areas where 
others can function more appropriately.
<P>
	As a result the work of my department reflects the federal 
government's core responsibilities in the areas of international 
trade and investment, science and technology, aboriginal matters, 
federal crown lands, national statistics and environmental issues. 
These are areas where national effort and co-ordination are 
necessary.
<P>
	In addition, my department is already engaged in many 
partnerships with stakeholders in the natural resources sector, 
including the provinces and the private sector, to explore further 
changes in the way it fulfils its federal responsibilities. In fact, I 
believe my department is setting an example for other federal 
departments and agencies. NRCan's approach to partnerships is an 
excellent model for efficient and effective federal activities that 
reflect the objectives set out in the speech from the throne.
<P>
	In conclusion, this is a good budget for all Canadians and it is 
particularly a good budget for the natural resource sectors. The 
announcements by the hon. Minister of Finance concerning our 
resource sectors result from serious, meaningful and productive 
consultations with all stakeholders.
<P>
	The income tax changes will have positive benefits for these 
sectors throughout Canada. These changes will increase prospects 
for investment, stimulate economic growth and create jobs for 
Canadians. In addition they will stimulate investment in key areas 
that are critical to Canada's progress toward sustainable 
development. The reason for this is simple. The Government of 
Canada listened and the Government of Canada delivered. We will 
continue to listen to all Canadians and we will continue to deliver.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the minister's comments about Canada and about 
Alberta in particular.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	In Alberta there is a great deal of pride developing. We have our 
deficit at zero. We now have a surplus budget. We now have a plan 
to take care of our debt. That is very positive particularly in the 
resource industry. We have a very positive feeling that things are 
moving forward. When is the minister's government going to 
develop that same plan at least to get the deficit under control and 
then show that vision that something further is going to happen?
<P>
	On a second issue, the many businesses in my province of 
Alberta and her province of Alberta are very concerned that those 
provinces which have socialized their utilities are still going to 
receive the advantages of the federal government's tax deduction. 
Those provinces that have privatized and have a free enterprise 
efficient utility industry are now not going to get that refund. The  
effect of that on all business, in turning one province against the 
other and not creating a level playing field is of great concern to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1453"> 1453 </A></B>
<P>
many of my constituents and I am sure to many of hers and many 
others in provinces like Alberta. I would like her to commenton that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
many questions. Let me see if I can remember them all as I work 
through them.
<P>
	First of all the hon. member talks about a plan in relation to 
deficit and debt reduction. It is very plain that if the hon. member 
reads the three budgets that my colleague, the hon. Minister of 
Finance has brought down over these past three years he will see a 
plan. I would suggest probably for the first time in many years one 
sees a plan, a clear blueprint, in relation to how we will deal with 
the deficit and the debt in this country.
<P>
	I think the success of that plan, the acknowledgement of that 
plan, is clear in the reaction not only of financial markets here at 
home but financial markets around the world. If my hon. colleague 
needs reassurance he can find it in the three budgets that my 
colleague, the Minister of Finance, has delivered.
<P>
	In relation to the specific question the hon. member raises 
regarding PUITTA, the public utilities tax, this was a rebate 
provided initially by both the province of Alberta and the 
Government of Canada. The Government of Alberta chose to 
repeal the rebate to Albertans in 1990. I can direct the hon. member 
to the exact page in the Alberta legislature's Hansard if he would 
like. Alberta did so specifically because of its deficit and debt 
situation. As I understand it the Government of Alberta in fact has 
saved itself $90 million a year by repealing its rebate.
<P>
	The federal government chose to do the same thing in the 1995 
budget delivered by the Minister of Finance. However because the 
federal government is acutely aware of the importance of level 
playing field issues, the Minister of Finance has created a task 
force involving ADMs of taxation across this country. This task 
force is looking at the whole question of tax treatment of private 
and public corporations.
<P>
	As the hon. member is undoubtedly aware, this difference in tax 
treatment arises because of section 125 of the Constitution Act, 
1867. This provides the Minister of Finance with some significant 
limitations in terms of how we deal with issues of level playing 
field.
<P>
	However, the Minister of Finance has chosen to create this task 
force on which might I add there are not only federal and provincial 
finance officials but also representatives from industry, which I 
believe include TransAlta Utilities Corporation, Ontario Hydro and 
Nova Scotia Power. We are looking at this difficult question of the 
level playing field and how one creates it in the context of public 
and private corporate entities.  We look forward to the report of that 
task force in the months ahead.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate. The hon. 
member for Témiscamingue. Would the member inform the Chair 
if he will be sharing his time?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
share my time with the hon. member for Drummond, who will 
speak during the second half of the period. Afterwards, there will 
be a 5 minute questions and comments period.
<P>
	It is my turn to have my say on the last federal budget that was 
brought down on March 6. During the next 10 minutes, I would like 
to address certain elements of the budget pertaining essentially to 
the new Canada social transfer.
<P>
	We knew since last year that the federal government planned to 
merge its old cash transfers to provinces into a single new program, 
the Canada social transfer. This program is a combination of 
established program financing and the Canada assistance program.
<P>
	What the government has done is reorganize various transfer 
programs, establishing a single program and reducing the global 
envelope. The amount of funds that will be devoted to the Canada 
social transfer will be $11 billion. By creating this new package, 
the government is trying to delude us into believing that, in the 
field of transfer payments, it did not make real cuts. And to come to 
this twisted conclusion, it ads up the tax points which were given in 
the past, and it ads up the equalization payments if that can be 
helpful in certain cases. In short, the government is twisting the 
facts.
<P>
	Let us simply look at the figures, the real ones. When it came to 
power, this government devoted $17 billion to the old programs, 
the cost shared program for post-secondary education, the Canada 
assistance plan and the cost shared health program. The 
government provided $17 billion; this year, it will provide only $11 
billion. At one point it was even almost $18 billion. So, it reduced 
that amount by 6 or 7 billion. It is simple: 17 minus 11 gives 6. It 
cannot have us believe that it is giving us more money than before. 
No matter what numbers you add, no matter how you present it, 
reality speaks for itself.
<P>
	At the same time, the government is maintaining the same 
standards. A few minutes ago, an hon. member on the other side 
said: ``We guarantee social security because we are still maintain a 
presence in the health field to ensure a universal system for all 
Canadians''. What the Liberals do not say is that they ask the 
provinces to find new ways to give the same services with less 
money but by applying the same standards. The government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1454"> 1454 </A></B>
<P>
announced its cuts one or two years ago but,  in practice, the 
provinces are the ones that have to live with them.
<P>
	We see Quebec and Ontario trying to cope with those cuts that 
were imposed on them. In fact, I am not sure that Canadians are 
convinced that the federal government is there to ensure an 
absolute social safety net, as the members opposite claim. The 
federal government wants to take credit for the good things and 
pass the bad things on to the provinces. Often in politics, someone 
will reap the benefits from a situation and have others pay for it. 
That is the strategy behind the Canada social transfer.
<P>
	I think that we must be honest with the public and say that the $6 
billion in cuts made by the federal government in transfers to the 
provinces is in money that went to social assistance, health care 
and education. These are three areas from which the federal 
government has withdrawn, asking the provinces to make the more 
surgical cuts.
<P>
	I now want to deal with the area of post-secondary education. In 
the case of Quebec, there have been cuts totalling nearly $300 
million. The federal government is telling students that it is the 
institutions and the provincial government which are raising tuition 
fees, that it has nothing to do with it. Of course, what choice do 
they have when they end up with $250 to $300 million less? They 
either have to make substantial cuts in the system or increase 
tuition fees. For the moment, the Government of Quebec has 
chosen to try to absorb the cuts without raising tuition fees. But 
other provinces have had to do it, and Quebec will have to consider 
doing it also, if the federal government continues to follow this 
path.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Students are told that there are no cuts, but there is a $250 to 
$300 million shortfall that, sooner or later, will inevitably result in 
increased tuition fees or reduced services. At the same time, the 
government proposes a student summer employment program. 
Many of us know about that kind of program. When we were 
students, we all have looked for summer jobs to help pay for our 
education and to try to gain practical experience in a field related to 
our field of study.
<P>
	In its first year in office, the government maintained the funds 
allocated in this area. Last year, it reduced these funds by about 40 
per cent. This year, it is practically doubling these funds to make 
the annual cuts of $300 million in the case of Quebec less difficult 
to swallow. The government will pour $60 million more into the 
summer student employment program for one year only, so it can 
say: ``Look what we are doing for you''. It is getting as many 
political points as it can from these $60 million.
<P>
	We will see what kind of program the federal government will 
announce to get more visibility, while cuts are being made in a 
more indirect way so that somebody else has to deal with them and 
pay the political price for them.
<P>
	Figure it out yourself. Take $300 million a year and multiply that 
by five, ten or even fifteen years if you want, and compare that to 
$60 million for one year. Will there be more? We will see, but I 
would be surprised. The government has not said that this was a 
permanent increase in that program's budget.
<P>
	So this is a way to make students swallow the bitter pill, to avoid 
creating too much dissatisfaction among a client group which 
seriously questions the existence of the federal government and 
which counts a high percentage of sovereignists in Quebec. The 
government avoids creating discontent as much as possible among 
students or tries to make sure they will not be able to clearly 
understand what is really going on.
<P>
	I have discussed with some representatives and no one is being 
fooled. Student associations have a clear picture of what is going 
on. They too have problems understanding how they come out as 
winners in such a situation. This does not mean that we should 
make no financial effort in this sector. We still must have the 
honesty to recognize what is being done. A budget must not be 
nothing but words that conceal reality.
<P>
	In the last two or three minutes I have left, I would like to talk 
about subsidies to dairy producers. The two regional county 
municipalities located at the southern and northern ends of my 
riding, Témiscamingue and Abitibi-Ouest, have numerous dairy 
producers. The last budget announced a phasing out of subsidies to 
dairy producers.
<P>
	This will create a new reality: there will either be a rise in the 
price of milk or a major income crisis for dairy producers. The 
federal government would like us to believe that it took this 
decision in consultation with producers. The government refers to 
industry and says it talked to industrial entrepreneurs but it never 
says it talked to producers. This is difficult to accept.
<P>
	What people accept even less is that at the same time, the federal 
government has long had an agriculture policy that supported in a 
very substantial way the grain industry in the West. We had the 
Western Grain Transportation Act and the Crow rate, known by 
everyone in the agricultural sector. When the federal government 
decided to abolish that, generous compensation programs were set 
up.
<P>
	For them, there was a transition period, but for Quebec 
producers, there has just been talk of looking into it, discussing it, 
but nothing has been done, nothing concrete announced, and no 
major developments are expected.
<P>
	How can it be that, when abolition of the Western Grain 
Transportation Act was announced, compensation mechanisms 
were already in place? How is it that, when  Quebec and eastern 
Canada are involved-for it is not just Quebec but also part of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1455"> 1455 </A></B>
<P>
Ontario-the thing is impossible, while, when the west was 
involved, it was an absolute priority?
<P>
	In the federal government's eyes, right from the start, agriculture 
has essentially equalled western beef and grain. This is hard for 
taxpayers in Témiscamingue to swallow, when they are dairy 
producers or the neighbours of these producers.
<P>
	This last budget contained something unacceptable to the people 
in the rural areas of Quebec, and Ontario, and the dairy producers 
of these areas. The industry is, as we well know, mainly 
concentrated in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	I could have spoken about unemployment insurance as well, as 
many of my colleagues have done, about making use of a $5 billion 
surplus, year after year, instead of making less of a cut to the 
benefits paid to the unemployed or to the amounts workers and 
employers have to pay into the fund, thus injecting more money 
into the economy and trying to make use of it to revive 
employment,
<P>
	Employment was a recurring theme during the campaign, but 
there is no sign of government action on it between campaigns. 
This creates a problem, and it is something I hear about constantly 
from the people in my riding. It worries them a great deal to see 
that employment is being taxed, because the surplus is being 
tapped year after year. That $5 billion represents a lot of money 
that could have been put to another use, instead of reducing the 
deficit with it.
<P>
	These are the elements in the budget on which I wished to speak, 
the ones I see as the most negative. There are also a number of 
measures that are not bad, but I am sure that the hon. members 
across the way will enjoy listing them, so I decided to concentrate 
essentially on those three.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise in this debate on the latest federal budget, which 
smells suspiciously like an election budget, because the measures it 
contains are not particularly heavy or harsh. We could even say the 
budget was a sort of pacifier for Canadians, except perhaps for the 
cuts to the dairy subsidies-a flagrant injustice to Quebecers and 
milk producers.
<P>
	Apart from this injustice, the latest budget could be called an 
electoral budget to mollify Canadians, in preparation for elections 
this fall or next spring perhaps. The most difficult measures have 
already been put into effect, in the previous two budgets. When the 
Liberal government was elected three years ago, the government 
was widely known to have a big problem, that of the debt and the 
deficit. They have reached $550 billion and have even been 
predicted by department and government statistics to go over $600 
billion by the year 2000.
<P>
	It is a huge problem. It is Canada's major problem, which the 
Liberal government undertook to resolve. It is so serious that 
Canada has the highest debt in the world in terms of its gross 
domestic product apart from Italy. Canada has already been warned 
of the precariousness of its position by the International Monetary 
Fund. There are leaks everywhere. Technically, we could even say 
that Canada is bankrupt, so to speak.
<P>
	This is all to say that the problem of the deficit and the debt is 
extremely complex, severe and serious. What have the Liberal 
members done since their election three years ago? Not much. 
They could have done a lot. They could, for example, have reduced 
the number of senior officials, because there are a lot of them and 
their salaries are very high and their expense accounts substantial. 
There is a lot of waste here.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	The government has decided to reduce the number of public 
servants by 45,000, mostly at the lower and middle levels. 
Normally, some 15,000 public servants retire every year. This 
certainly does not qualify as a major effort to reduce the size of the 
public service. The federal government could have cut its spending 
or at least contained its losses.
<P>
	As a former member of the public works committee, I know that 
there are many loopholes for federal funds to slip through, 
contracts being one of them. Some $10 billion a year is spent on 
contracts. There is a great deal of abuse and waste in this area. So 
far, the government has not done much to close these loopholes.
<P>
	Even the auditor general's numerous recommendations were not 
taken into consideration in the government's previous budget 
measures. Senate spending was not cut. Senators' pay could have 
been reduced to $1 a year rather than the thousands of dollars they 
receive for doing nothing. The Senate costs Canadians $50 million. 
This is a rather shameless waste of Canadian taxpayers' money.
<P>
	The government could have made significant cuts to its defence 
spending. DND's budget exceeds $12 billion a year. The Somalia 
affair and other recent events clearly show that DND is not the 
most effective of federal government departments. Had the Liberal 
government been seriously committed to reducing the federal debt 
and deficit, it could certainly have cut the defence budget by 
several billions of dollars.
<P>
	It could have tightened up tax measures for corporations. As we 
know, tax evasion in Canada represents between $3 billion and $4 
billion. Corporations shelter their profits in countries like the 
Caribbean islands to avoid paying taxes. Canada's losses due to tax 
evasion are estimated at $3 billion to $4 billion. The federal 
government did not act in this area either.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1456"> 1456 </A></B>
<P>
	Another option would have been for the government to crack 
down harder on the banks. Last year alone, banks made $5.2 
billion in profits, record profits, but this government, the Liberal 
government, collected from the six chartered banks something like 
$100 million over two years, which represents less than one per 
cent of their net profits.
<P>
	The government could also have imposed restrictions or made 
other changes to family trusts. Again, this is an especially 
interesting case, in that family trusts benefit the wealthy, Canadian 
families which are fabulously rich. The Minister of Finance 
himself is one of the fabulously rich Canadians who can invest 
their net profits in family trusts to avoid paying taxes for 
generations and generations. Because of such trusts Canada's 
wealthiest families avoid paying taxes altogether.
<P>
	It is estimated that taxation is avoided on nearly $100 billion 
through family trusts. The federal government could have collected 
taxes on family trusts to help resolve its very serious debt and 
deficit problem.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	I have just listed nine measures this government could have 
taken to reduce its debt, but it did not see fit to act in those areas. 
Instead, the government decided to act in two well-known areas. It 
is worth repeating because it reflects the basic thinking of this 
Liberal government. It very clearly shows that, in Canada, the rich, 
the wealthy are spared while the most vulnerable are hard hit.
<P>
	The only two measures taken by this government to reduce its 
deficit and its debt were to cut transfer payments to the provinces 
by a few billion dollars, some $7 billion, by the year 2000. As we 
know, these transfer cuts will affect education by reducing funds 
available for education purposes. This means that Canadian youth 
are directly affected. Health transfers are cut, which means that the 
sick will be affected.
<P>
	The other measure soon to be announced concerns changes, cuts 
to old age pensions, which, as we already know, will affect mostly 
senior women. Cutting transfers to the provinces is a measure 
designed to leave the provinces holding the baby by giving the 
impression that they are the ones making cuts.
<P>
	The measure to be taken in another area, namely unemployment 
insurance, is perhaps the most outrageous measure this government 
has ever taken. It is actually asking the unemployed to contribute to 
the debt reduction effort. Nothing less. Since 1990, the federal 
government has not contributed a single dollar to the UI fund. The 
money comes from the contributions of workers and employers. 
The federal government does not contribute one penny to the fund.
<P>
	Last year, the federal government took out about $5 billion from 
the UI fund. It will do the same this year and next year. Over that 
three-year period, $15 billion will  have been taken out of the UI 
fund and used to reduce the federal government's debt.
<P>
	This is a disgrace because it is basically a misappropriation of 
funds. The money in the UI fund should be used to provide training 
programs for the jobless, but the government has other ideas. This 
Liberal government is dishonest to the point of reducing the 
amount that the unemployed can receive, setting tougher eligibility 
criteria so that fewer people will qualify for UI benefits and, in 
addition to that, misappropriating money from the UI fund and 
using it to reduce the debt.
<P>
	This is a dishonest and unfair measure which is tantamount to a 
fraud. The government is defrauding those who contributed to the 
fund, namely workers and employers. It is purely and simply a 
fraud. That money was to be used for the benefit of the unemployed 
and to provide training for workers. Instead, this government is 
using it to reduce its debt.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Of all the initiatives that it could have taken to reduce its debt 
and its deficit, the government opted for two measures which 
mainly seek to get money from the most vulnerable members of 
our society, namely the unemployed, the sick, young people and 
women, while protecting rich people, family trusts, banks and 
corporations.
<P>
	In conclusion, this series of measures spread over a three-year 
period clearly show the spirit of that Liberal government, which 
seeks to spare the rich and to hit the most vulnerable ones in our 
society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, I have a few comments to make. I wonder how my colleague 
would define the words ``dishonest'' and ``fraud''. What does he 
think they mean? Is he prepared to make these kinds of accusations 
outside the House of Commons?
<P>
	I only have one question for him. What does he think his cousins 
now in power in Quebec, his former leader, will cut when the time 
comes for a budget in his province? Does he think that the 
organizations that he mentioned earlier this morning and that were 
supposedly treated so badly by the Canadian government will be 
cut, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no question that the way 
the federal government used the unemployment insurance fund is 
tantamount to a fraud. It is a fraud to use this fund for purposes 
other than what it is usually used for. It is a misappropriation of 
public funds. The money employees and employers put in the 
unemployment insurance fund is supposed to be used for 
unemployment insurance purposes. It is not all that complicated. 
The unemployed are either compensated by directly receiving 
unemployment insurance benefits or by taking part in training 
programs. This is why the  unemployment insurance fund was set 
up in the first place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1457"> 1457 </A></B>
<P>
	When the money is used for purposes other than to help the 
unemployed, it is called fraud. It is dishonest. We are lying to the 
Canadian citizens, to employees and employers. They are asked to 
contribute to a fund which is not used to meet their needs, so it is a 
misappropriation of funds. I do not think we can be any clearer 
over the fact that the government is guilty of fraud, since it is 
misappropriating public funds. We, in Quebec, are at least honest 
enough to avoid all the hypocrisy shown here by the current Liberal 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the Bloc's arrival on 
the Hill, for the past two and half years or so in particular, they 
have been singing just one song: tax loopholes, trusts, big business. 
I must point out that, when the entire issue of family trusts was 
examined, the Bloc's minority report had no suggestion whatsoever 
for another way of dealing with them.
<P>
	As well, when we ask the Bloc to offer concrete suggestions on 
how to bring the $45 billion deficit down to zero, they always tell 
us to go after the $6 billion in bad debts.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Everyone knows that there is no long term reduction to be found 
in bad debts, only a short term one for the year involved. 
Procedures have been established for debt recovery.
<P>
	A surtax has also been levied on financial institutions. The hon. 
member talks of our dipping into the unemployment insurance 
fund. This I find totally unacceptable, particularly in a context 
where, with the possible exception of this year, Quebec has 
received more from the unemployment insurance fund than it has 
contributed.
<P>
	What I want to ask the hon. member is this: Is it not prudent, in a 
recession, to always create a reserve so as to avoid additional 
burden on the government? During a recession, we all know social 
programs increase, thus increasing the burden, and revenues 
decrease.
<P>
	I therefore find it unbelievable that the Bloc members keep on 
telling us we must not touch the $5 billion in the reserve we have 
created. The precise reason for creating a reserve fund is to avoid a 
potential recession. Is that not prudent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps I should have spoken 
English, because I do not seem to make myself understood in 
French. Of course it is obvious. You would have to be nearly blind 
not to recognize that the government is using the money from the 
unemployment insurance fund fraudulently. In other words, this 
money is not being used for unemployment insurance but for  
federal deficit reduction. It is a fraud. It is dishonest-there is no 
other way to put it.
<P>
	When they say, as my colleague has just pointed out, that the 
Bloc has not proposed practical measures to reduce the deficit, I 
would point out that, on the matter of family trusts, the Bloc 
suggested they simply be abolished. Some $100 billion is in family 
trusts in Canada. This money is not taxed. It is set aside for the 
wealthiest families, the super rich, which includes the Minister of 
Finance. That was one of the suggestions we made. In fact, I made 
eight this morning the government has not acted on.
<P>
	So, the hon. member's repeating the Liberal government's 
harebrained, hypocritical and dishonest ideology does not stop me 
from seeing clearly that unemployment insurance funds are being 
used fraudulently and that the Liberal government has neither the 
backbone nor the guts to resolve its finances as it could have done 
had it really wanted to.

	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, April is Parkinson's Awareness Month as proclaimed by 
the Parkinson Foundation of Canada.
<P>
	Since its formation in 1965 the foundation has been devoted to 
the support of research into the cause, treatment and cure of 
Parkinson's disease, a chronic brain disorder suffered by 
approximately 100,000 Canadians.
<P>
	Through the various chapters of the Parkinson Foundation of 
Canada, a number of fundraising events are being planned across 
Canada to raise money for research, to promote public education 
and to develop patient and family support services.
<P>
	Each April the beautiful red and white Dr. James Parkinson tulip, 
the official symbol of Parkinson's, is sold to the general public and 
businesses. One of the selling days coincides with Secretary's Day 
on April 24. Other fundraising events include a national cut-a-thon 
on the last Sunday in April in which hair salons across Canada offer 
their time and talent for a small donation.
<P>
	I encourage all Canadians to do their part in contributing to the 
search for a cure for Parkinson's disease.

of Foreign Affairs praised my position in the Haiti debate, but a 
few days later when I questioned his ministerial actions with 
respect to Haitian peacekeeping and aid to China he reverted to 
form and accused me of isolationism. I do not know which I find 
most offensive: praise from that particular minister or his personal 
attack.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1459"> 1459 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister should understand that Canadian support for the 
UN in Haiti does not mean being a doormat and that Canadian 
trade with China does not require an annual foreign aid bribe of 
$162 million. Nor do relations with China require our Export 
Development Corporation to provide financial assistance for the 
Three Gorges project, a grandiose boondoggle which will displace 
1.25 million people.

Party of Canada in Quebec passed a very important resolution on 
national unity and cohesion.
<P>
	This resolution reaffirms with great conviction and sensibility 
our government's main commitments on national unity. Among 
other things, federal Liberals in Quebec stated in clause 1.4 of the 
resolution that the Liberal Party of Canada supports enshrining in 
the Constitution the principles recognized in the December 1995 
parliamentary resolution defining distinct society.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
announcement that the Textiles Monterey mill will reopen is 
another indication of the vitality and entrepreneurship of the people 
of Drummond. Last September, 270 jobs were lost after the 
company declared bankruptcy. In just six months, a group of 
former employees, both managers and workers, came up with a 
business proposal to acquire the company's assets and to specialize 
the new company's production.
<P>
	The reopening of Textiles Monterey is the fruit of the 
collaborative efforts and great determination of all stakeholders: 
the employees, the union, the financial institutions, the FTQ 
solidarity fund, and the three levels of government. The success of 
this operation stems from the establishment of a financial network 
and, above all, a dialogue between local resources.
<P>
	On behalf of all my fellow citizens of Drummond, I wish every 
success to the shareholders of the new Textiles Monterey company.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberal government has said it wishes to support small businesses, 
but wishes are not policies.
<P>
	The performance of Canada Post in the north continues to make 
it more and more difficult especially for publishing businesses 
which are a small but a vital part of the economy both in the Yukon 
and Northwest Territories.
<P>
	In December publishers were notified one week before a price 
change occurred. Certainly promotional material could not be sent 
out and the publisher was left to absorb extra costs. Also in 
December Canada Post put ads in a number of newspapers but not 
in the north regarding mandate review. Finally, publishers have 
recently been informed by Canada Post that there will be a 
substantial price increase in the coming years.
<P>
	Clearly publishing is extremely important to the north as a vital 
business. I call on the minister responsible for heritage to meet 
with the minister for Canada Post to save this emerging northern 
cultural business.

taken in the brutal and senseless massacre on April 5.
<P>
	As a young and energetic couple filled with hopes and dreams, 
Mr. and Mrs. Gakhal came to Canada in 1970 with their two eldest 
daughters. They had lived in Vernon for over 20 years. The Gakhals 
<P>

were contributing  members of society and active participants in 
community life.
<P>
	This Canadian family was well liked and respected. On Saturday 
more than 2,000 people attended their funeral service to pay their 
last respects.
<P>
	Like many other Canadian families, the Gakhals worked hard to 
create a good and comfortable life for their family. Karnail and 
Darshan Gakhal were loving and devoted parents. They dedicated 
themselves to raising their six beautiful children. They taught their 
children appreciation of values, principles and the importance of 
contributing to their community. The Gakhals were close and 
loving.

announced its decision to shut down operations at its truck

are jeopardized by this announcement.
<P>
	As we speak, almost all concerned are actively trying to prevent 
the closure of this important plant and to save 850 jobs. But the 
federal government has yet to take positive steps in this important 
issue.
<P>
	Time is of the essence, and I might remind the government that it 
takes more than wishful thinking to prevent the 850 jobs at 
Kenworth's from moving to Mexico or to the U.S.
<P>
	In its speech from the throne and its budget, the government 
boasted about putting job creation first. It should therefore get 
directly involved in the Kenworth matter and co-operate with the 
Quebec government in finding a solution, thus preventing the 
plant's closure.

supported in part by taxpayer dollars.
<P>
	We have also learned that the federal government is providing 
free legal representation for two former ministers involved in this 
tragedy, while a mere pittance is thrown to the legal requirements 
of the victims.
<P>
	These revelations further darken a shadow cast by a growing 
legacy of mismanagement. This shadow continues to obscure the 
truth. Sadly, similar scenarios are all too much a part of the 
continuing Ottawa inquiry process.
<P>
	And where is the health minister? Instead of safeguarding the 
mandate of the inquiry, along with others he challenges its 
legitimacy. Instead of protecting the health of Canadians through 
an improved blood system, he protects the interests of those who 
are part of the system that failed.
<P>
	Two fundamentals are at stake here: the principle of government 
accountability and the goal of assured health for all Canadians. The 
minister must change his course of action to safeguard both this 
principle and this goal.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to see the Prime Minister in this House, 
because things are going badly for the government. Parallelling the 
unprecedented scandal in the Canadian army, which we will return 
to later, is the scandal involving the Prime Minister who reneges on 
his promises.
<P>
	This weekend, at the meeting of the Liberal Party, the Prime 
Minister made an about-face. He changed the commitments he 
made in Verdun only a few days before  the referendum. His 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1462"> 1462 </A></B>
<P>
promise to recognize Quebec as a distinct society was trampled 
underfoot, tossed out with a wave of the hand after a night of work 
and the undebated passing of a resolution on the floor of the 
meeting.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister justify not keeping his word to the 
people of Quebec and once again reneging on the commitments he 
made in Verdun?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we made a commitment to have the distinct society 
recognized in this House and we met it in December. All the 
members on this side of the House voted in favour, and the 
members of the Bloc voted against. This is the fourth time they 
have voted against a distinct society.
<P>
	We support the distinct society. We support having all Canadians 
recognize that the French fact, French culture and French civil law 
have special significance for Quebec. And we will continue to fight 
for this. It would be very helpful to have the support of the Bloc in 
having this fact recognized. However, today, as always, those who 
voted against the Meech Lake accord are weeping crocodile tears. 
And yet, when you yourself were a member in Quebec City, you 
voted against the distinct society in the Charlottetown accord and 
you voted against the distinct society as late as last December.
<P>
	If the Leader of the Opposition is serious, I issue him the 
following challenge: let him propose a vote in this House on the 
distinct society, and we will support him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a simple resolution at a meeting of the Liberal Party is 
enough to overturn the resolution passed in this House, of which 
the Prime Minister was allegedly so proud, and since a simple 
resolution of the meeting of the Liberal Party is enough to void the 
commitments made in the throne speech, are we to understand that 
the government and the Liberal Party consider the commitments 
not worth the paper they are written on?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois want to 
help us enshrine the distinct society in the Canadian Constitution, I 
am sure we can do it. But, how can we insist on or hold a 
federal-provincial conference on the distinct society when the 
leader of the Parti Quebecois, the premier of Quebec, asks us not to 
put it on the order paper before the Canadian premiers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister is not going to alter the debate. It was 
he, at his meeting, who reneged on the commitments he made as 
Prime Minister. He cannot shift people's attention today.
<P>
	I will say simply that, once again, our fine Prime Minister has 
managed to turn all of Quebec against him.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	How can he reconcile his new constitutional position with the 
remarks made this very morning by his referendum ally, Daniel 
Johnson, who said on behalf of Quebec federalists that he is totally 
opposed to the position the Prime Minister is now taking?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would simply like to read clause 1.4 of the resolution 
passed this weekend by party officials in Quebec and the members 
of the Liberal Party in Quebec who want the fact incorporated in 
the Constitution. Here is the text that was passed and that the 
Leader of the Opposition has obviously not read: ``The Liberal 
Party of Canada supports the enshrinement in the Constitution of 
the principles recognized in the Parliamentary resolution passed in 
December 1995 defining the distinct society''.
<P>
	There is the answer for the hon. member, who, if he were a little 
more honest with himself and with the people of Quebec-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Indeed, he would tell the people 
of Quebec that he has always voted against recognition of Quebec 
as a distinct society, whereas we Liberals have always worked to 
achieve this end.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs.
<P>
	At the general membership meeting of the Quebec wing of the 
Liberal Party, the minister stated in connection with the place 
Quebec holds within Canadian federation that the words 
themselves were of no importance, what counts is the reality.
<P>
	Well then, can the minister tell us whether, in his reality, 
Quebecers constitute a people?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is the first question asked of me as a member of 
Parliament, and I must thank the hon. member for it.
<P>
	Anyone wishing to properly describe public opinion in Quebec is 
obliged to admit it is not a society in unanimity, but a society where 
various opinions are voiced. The best way to illustrate this is with a 
poll that came out a week before the referendum. Quebecers were 
asked how they defined themselves. Twenty-five per cent said they 
defined themselves as Quebecers only, and all the rest defined 
themselves as Canadians, many of them as Quebecers first, because 
they felt more at home in Quebec, but Canadians also.
<P>
	These people are Canadians. The hon. member would like them 
to stop being Canadians, and that is where the  problem lies. The 
answer is this: in Quebec we have differing opinions, but the large 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1463"> 1463 </A></B>
<P>
majority of Quebecers want to remain in Canada. We are going to 
work to ensure that everyone in Canada may be reconciled.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> It 
would have been far wiser, Mr. Speaker, for the Liberals to find out 
what the minister's answer was before applauding.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs not demonstrating 
through his reply that, just like the Prime Minister, he has 
absolutely no grasp of the Quebec reality?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am not much versed in how things are done here, but 
if I understand the hon. member correctly, he wishes me to repeat 
what I said, because he did not understand it fully.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dion:</B> I thought I had been very clear. We have a pluralistic 
society in Quebec, one in which a number of different points of 
view are expressed, one in which people need to be left to define 
themselves as they wish. Some wish to define themselves as 
primarily Quebecers, others as primarily Canadians, and what is so 
wonderful in Canadian federation is that no one forces anything on 
anyone else.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
morning's revelations in the growing Somalia cover-up are deeply 
disturbing.
<P>
	Documents from Two Commando Unit have miraculously 
reappeared in a Petawawa filing cabinet. Vital operational logs 
from One Commando were apparently the victim of a Mogadishu 
mud puddle or Somalia sea water, and the RCMP is now examining 
DND's tampered with hard drive for electronic fingerprints.
<P>
	Given all of this, how could the Prime Minister still have full 
confidence in the chief of the defence staff and his own Minister of 
National Defence?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is because I have known the Minister of National 
Defence for a long time. He is a very good man and a very 
competent minister.
<P>
	When he became minister he was confronted with a file that was 
created before the coming of this administration. He has worked 
with this problem and he has decided to do something 
unprecedented: to have an  inquiry into the operation of national 
defence. Not only that, but he recommended that we disband the 
regiment that was involved in that.
<P>
	He took some extremely courageous actions and he has decided 
this inquiry will go to the bottom of the file, a file that was started 
perhaps by an incompetent administration before we arrived.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
trouble may have started before but what we need is for this 
minister to truly get to the bottom of it and clear it up once and for 
all.
<P>
	The lawyers for the Somalia inquiry were quite clear in who they 
think is responsible for this whole mess: the Somalia inquiry 
liaison team, the public affairs division of DND and this Liberal 
government.
<P>
	The lawyers did not say that General Jean Boyle is the common 
link between all three of these problem areas. He had a hand in 
SILT and he headed up public affairs at DND before he was hand 
picked for this current position by this minister.
<P>
	Will the defence minister ask his friend, General Jean Boyle, to 
step aside until the Somalia inquiry gets to the bottom of his role in 
this attempted cover-up?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly will 
not ask the chief of the defence staff to step aside.
<P>
	It seems the members of the Reform Party are intent on making 
accusations, not allowing individuals to state their cases before the 
commission and drawing their own conclusions. This is foreign to 
Canadian justice which has served us well for over a century as a 
nation.
<P>
	I think the inquiry process is working. The chairman of the 
commission has noted a problem with documentation and has set 
aside a couple of weeks to look at this specific issue and hopefully 
will draw some conclusions.
<P>
	If it is apparent, as the chairman said, that outside help, whether 
the military police or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, should 
be involved, that is the job of the commission to identify.
<P>
	I cannot reply every day to accusations that come forward at the 
commission. That is why we set up the commission, to take it out 
of the political arena and put it where it belongs, in front of three

<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
are a lot of people who do want to state their cases. Instead they 
have been stifled, which is the unfortunate part of this whole thing.
<P>
	I guess it is easier to blame subordinates than it is to fire a hand 
picked appointee. If this minister had done his job the military 
brass would not be leading him  around by the nose. If this minister 
had done his job, General Boyle would not even have been named 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1464"> 1464 </A></B>
<P>
chief of defence staff. If this minister had truly done his job the 
Somalia inquiry would not be scrambling around looking for 
operational logs and missing documents.
<P>
	Since the minister is obviously incapable of doing his job and 
has lost the confidence of absolutely everybody but the military 
brass, will he resign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the 
Prime Minister has dealt with that on a number of occasions.
<P>
	This has been a particularly troublesome file for all of us in 
government. The Department of National Defence is under 
instructions to make all documents available to the commission. 
There have been some problems. I welcome the commission's 
deciding to set aside these two weeks to look at the documentation 
problem.
<P>
	Obviously by what has transpired this morning the commission 
still requires further answers. Departmental officials will give 
those answers. However, it is very important that individuals, 
whether the chief of defence staff or others who have been named 
publicly by the Reform Party or others in the media, have an 
opportunity to go to the commission, state their own case and be 
judged in the eyes of all Canadians fairly and justly because that is 
what Canadian justice is all about.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Contrary to what the minister just said, the commission 
adjourned this morning because it was dissatisfied with the level of 
co-operation from the Department of National Defence and the 
minister himself. This is unacceptable.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister feel his defence minister is still 
trustworthy despite his lack of co-operation in the Somalia inquiry 
and the fact that the minister himself had General Boyle appointed 
to the position of Chief of the Defence Staff, supposedly to restore 
public trust?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister asked the department to co-operate with the 
commission. Furthermore, he himself created the commission and 
recommended that an independent commission be established to 
review this whole matter.
<P>
	This is obviously a complex matter that was-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ah, ah.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Yes, it is complex. It happened 
before we formed the government, and the  party in power had 
trouble dealing with this matter. After disbanding the regiment 
involved in these operations, the minister decided to request that a 
fully independent commission be established to review this whole 
matter.
<P>
	All requested documents will be made available to the 
commission, and all those concerned are doing their utmost to 
honour the commission's requests, especially the minister, in 
whom I have full confidence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
contrary to what the Prime Minister just said, the existence of the 
files was known when the Conservative Party was in power. 
General John Anderson said so.
<P>
	They keep saying that they still trust the minister and General 
Boyle, when everyone has lost confidence in the Canadian Forces. 
It could be said that, as recently as last weekend, the whole world 
was making fun of Canada because of the search for documents 
ordered by the minister.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the search for 
documents was a very important exercise for the Canadian Forces. 
I think it shows that the members of the Canadian Forces are 
willing to co-operate with the commission.
<P>
	The hon. member across the way has accused the Chief of the 
Defence Staff of committing offenses, even though the CDS has 
not had the opportunity to share his views with the commission. 
This is not how the Canadian justice system works.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	In October 1995 the military police reported that its inquiry on 
the divergence of information provided to the Somali inquiry could 
not conclude due to a missing hard drive computer disk. The 
minister deemed it unnecessary to go further to find the missing 
hard drive disk.
<P>
	How is it that the Minister of National Defence did not recognize 
the significance of what the military police explained to him 
regarding the missing disk?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member will remember that about a year or so ago in the House I 
said that when the commission was set up all relevant documents 
would be made available to the commission. The department has 
tried to meet the expectations that were made of it to provide those 
documents.
<P>
	It is quite apparent that there have been some problems with the 
documents that appear to be missing. The department has given 
certain explanations. In fact, the chief of defence staff initiated a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1465"> 1465 </A></B>
<P>
search last week  which turned up further documents that are now 
being analysed by the commission.
<P>
	When the hon. member implies that we did not take the search 
for documents seriously, that is not true. Even as late as last week, 
to assist the commission this week in its exercise to look at the 
documents, it was the department that asked the RCMP computer 
experts to come in and assist it with respect to those deficiencies 
relating to the computers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister's actions speak much louder than his 
words.
<P>
	The minister did not provide the Somali inquiry with the military 
police report, such an important document, until four months after 
the minister had accepted it.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	It would seem that General Boyle had to be appointed to the 
position of chief of defence staff because anyone else would have 
deemed it necessary to go further and get to the bottom of why the 
hard disk and certain records were missing.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister 
not see that this one event alone is so serious that clearly the 
Minister of National Defence and the chief of defence staff, 
General Boyle, must resign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member has shown once again how selective he is with the facts.
<P>
	I would rather listen to the commission counsel who this 
morning raised some further concerns and asked the department to 
provide answers by this Thursday. I would prefer to wait until next 
Monday when a certain hearing can be started on the public affairs 
aspect of the problem so that the chief of defence staff and others 
can state their case.
<P>
	It does not serve us well every day in the House to rehash the 
accusations, the comments that come from the commission. That is 
why the commission was established, to remove it from Parliament 
to let an independent group take the appropriate action and review 
this in the clear light of day.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the situation continues to deteriorate. Even before really 
getting down to business, the Somalia inquiry commission is 
exposing a most serious situation. Not only is what took place in 
Somalia unacceptable, the whole situation within the Canadian 
forces high command and the Department of National Defence is 
intolerable.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister agree that the government must order a 
much more wide-ranging inquiry to consider all the blunders made 
by the Canadian Armed Forces and the whole cover-up?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the mandate of the commission allows its members to 
examine all issues relating to these incidents and they definitely 
intend to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the commission should also look at what happened in 
Petawawa, at the hazing rituals, at what happened in Gagetown, at 
what happened with the pseudo-terrorist attack at the Quebec City 
Citadel, following which the commander of the Citadel was 
appointed chief of the armed forces in Haiti. This is quite 
something. Talk about being irresponsible.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that his government is 
tarnishing the reputation of the Canadian Armed Forces and that 
this will continue as long as the current defence minister is in 
charge?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am quite 
affronted that the hon. member would accuse the government of 
tarnishing the image of the armed forces. If anything is tarnishing 
the image of the armed forces, other than the problems we have to 
deal with on an ongoing basis, it is the attitude of the members 
opposite who are making political points on the backs of the men 
and women who serve with distinction in the Canadian Armed 
Forces.

in welcoming the intergovernmental affairs minister to his seat, I 
note that some time ago he indicated that a distinct society clause 
in the Constitution would not confer special status on Quebec and I 
quote: ``It is an insult to suggest Quebecers would use the clause to 
trample minority rights''.
<P>
	Canadians familiar with Quebec's oppressive language laws fear 
a distinct society clause would be used to further the exclusionary

<P>
	For the benefit of Canadians, will the minister clarify his 
intentions about including a distinct society clause in the

<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (Saint-Laurent-Cartierville, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we must state the facts.
<P>
	Since the beginning, since 1988, the intent to put in the

change the distribution of powers in the Constitution of Canada.

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1466"> 1466 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	Never. Some politicians who do not want to reconcile Quebecers 
and Canadians may say that but it is not the truth. I will give you 
what was written in 1987, the first draft the first ministers accepted 
in order to keep Quebec as a distinct society, or any other term you 
want to use within Canada.
<P>
	``Nothing in this section derogates from the powers, rights or 
privileges of Parliament or the Government of Canada or the 
legislatures of the governments of the provinces, including any 
powers, rights or privileges relating to language''. This is why it 
would be a lie to say that it may change the distribution of powers. 
It is an interpretative clause. It is necessary but it does not change 
the basic Constitution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not know how much Canadians will be cheered by that 1987 
response.
<P>
	The intergovernmental affairs minister has also said that 
Quebec's racist bill 101, the language law in Quebec, and I quote 
him: ``A great Canadian law and is liberal in many ways.''
<P>
	In many ways inclusion of distinct society has the legal potential 
to allow for policies which will take away from the rights of 
Canadians. I ask the minister if the inclusion of a distinct society 
clause is necessary, what measures will the government take to 
ensure that the clause will not undermine the equality of all 
Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (Saint-Laurent-Cartierville, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, bilingual or trilingual democracies have measures to 
ensure that their language communities will live together in 
harmony. It is what we have in Canada. We are very proud of it.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health. The Canadian government 
has just banned cheese made from raw milk. In Quebec, producers, 
importers, retailers, restaurant owners, consumers, veterinarians 
and the provincial government disagree with this decision. The 
Quebec Liberal Party and even the Liberal Party of Canada also 
disagree.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member has asked a very important question relating to 
raw milk cheese. Evidence has come  from my department which 
suggests that there may be an increased risk of illness or disease.
<P>
	As a result a regulation has been gazetted and for 75 days there

Speaker, my question is for the minister of human resources.
<P>
	This year's budget punishes seniors by reducing the RRSP age 
limit for contributions from 71 to 69. Why impose this hardship on 
seniors when they are now living longer and healthier lives and will 
need their savings over a longer life span?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the hallmarks of the 
budget brought in by my colleague, the Minister of Finance, was to 
deal with problems such as the demographic change taking place in 
this country and elsewhere in the most fair and equitable way.
<P>
	I would have thought the hon. member would have made 
reference to the fact that the proposals made by the Minister of 
Finance allow for those people who wish to take advantage of 
RRSPs to go back as far as they can to pick up those years where, 
because of child rearing or for other reasons, they were unable to 
make maximum contributions.
<P>
	The proof is in the pudding. As one looks at the reactions across 
the country to the proposals made by the Minister of Finance with 
regard to RRSPs and other elements of the budget, they have all 
been very well accepted by people who understand them.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister is still refusing to deal with the age 
difference. By lowering it, he is really harming seniors. By 
reducing the age of mandatory rollover from seniors' RRSPs, the 
government will raise close to $100 million by the year 2000.
<P>
	This is just another Liberal tax grab. Why does the minister not 
have the courage to be frank with our seniors about what he is 
doing and admit this is another tax grab at the expense of seniors?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the challenge is always with 
comprehension. There is no doubt about that.
<P>
	What we are dealing with here is undoubtedly an effort to be 
equitable. There is no question the hon. member has stated the 
record in terms of the reduction to age 69.
<P>
	Whatever the alleged tax grab may have been as a result of that 
change, if the hon. member would look at the cost to taxpayers, the 
benefits made available to people who want to avail themselves of 
the RRSP, going back over the years where they missed making 
maximum contributions, the hon. member would understand this.
<P>
	If she takes the time and the care to look carefully, what has been 
retained by the government in terms of  the change at the upper end 
will be more than compensated for by being more generous to 
people who were not able to make maximum contributions to the 
program through their working life.

	My question to the Deputy Prime Minister, who has made all 
kinds of pronouncements on this issue, is why are they breaking 
their promise? Why are they not getting rid of the GST as they said 
they would?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the answer is not very complicated. The hon. member has 
only to read page 22 of the red book. We were talking about the 
harmonization of taxes, the sales tax in Canada. It will be done.
<P>
	We are not worried about them because they will not be there for 
a long time.

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the minister of fisheries on his B.C. 
fleet reduction policy, a policy that has been strongly condemned 
by fishers, coastal communities and the B.C. New Democrat 
government.
<P>
	Why did the minister ignore the recommendations of the 
Cruickshank commission? Will the minister now agree to 
reconsider this policy, in particular the stackable area licensing, the 
totally inadequate amount of buyback and the absence of habitat 
protection and enhancement? Will the minister recognize that his 
policy will have a particularly devastating impact on small owner 
operators and on coastal communities in British Columbia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have to tell the hon. member and reassure the House 
that the Pacific salmon revitalization plan stems from the Fraser 
report which led to the a consideration by 70 stakeholders in this 
industry and a  report that made 27 recommendations. We took 
these recommendations and came up with a plan.
<P>
	This industry has gone from $400 million to $200 million to $80 
million to a possible loss of $10 million this year. The capacity has 
quadrupled. We are looking at areas where 40 per cent of fishermen 
lost money a couple of years ago. This year it is 60 per cent plus. 
This is a sick industry and this is a plan that is meant to revive it. It 
is tough medicine but like all tough medicine it is made to improve 
the health of the industry.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the minister responsible for government services.
<P>
	The Department of Public Works and Government Services has 
been working hard to make direct deposit its standard method of 
making various payments to Canadians.
<P>
	Can the minister tell the House if this initiative has actually 
saved money and if so, how much?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last year alone we 
saved approximately $28 million as a result of direct deposit. These 
are savings on postage, paper and on banking charges. In the last 
six months alone 1.7 million Canadians have agreed to join the 
direct deposit system.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	While at this time 40 per cent of all payments by the federal 
government are made by direct deposit, it is our intention to 
increase that in the short term to at least 60 per cent for an annual 
savings of $44 million.
<P>
	I encourage Canadians as much as possible to join others to help 
us save money and at the same time have a very reliable way of 
receiving payments.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-260, an act to amend the Income Tax Act and the 
Canada pension plan (transfer of income to spouse).
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, managing the family home and caring 
for preschool children is an honourable profession which has not 
been recognized for its value to our society.
<P>
	The Tax Act and other legislation discriminates against families, 
particularly those that choose to provide direct parental care to 
preschool children. One aspect of this has to do with the extension 
of Canada pension benefits or service credits for those who choose 
to provide care in the home to their preschool children.
<P>
	This bill therefore seeks to promote changes which would have 
the intent of extending Canada pension plan benefits or service 
credits to those who choose to provide care in the home to their 
preschool children.

restoration of the death penalty and to amend the Referendum Act.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today 
to introduce a private member's bill calling for a binding national 
referendum on reinstatement of capital punishment.
<P>
	For too long, in fact forever, Canadians have been shut out of the 
debate process where this issue is concerned. Through the use of a 
referendum this bill would allow Canadians a say on whether the 
Criminal Code should be amended to include the death penalty as a 
sentencing option for persons who are convicted of first degree 
murder.
<P>
	Critics will note on reading the bill that it does not ask them to 
vote for or against reinstatement of capital punishment. Instead it 
asks simply that MPs allow Canadians to make the final 
determination in this respect.
<P>
	I also want to thank my constituents of Nanaimo-Cowichan. It 
was they who voted overwhelmingly by a margin of 919 to 104 for 
this initiative to be brought before the House which it is today. I 
believe this sentiment to be an accurate reflection of the support in 
rest of Canada for the bill. As such, and in closing, I ask colleagues 
on both sides of the House to support the bill when it comes before 
them. More important, I urge members of the subcommittee-

	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International 
Cooperation and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> 
In so far as the Canadian International Development Agency is 
concerned, on January 31, 1996 an agency forum was convened by 
the president of CIDA with CIDA headquarters staff to introduce 
the Minister for International Cooperation with responsibility for 
CIDA, the Honourable Pierre S. Pettigrew. As is the common 
practice when a new minister is appointed to any federal public 
service department, staff members were given the opportunity to 
hear the minister's views on pertinent issues and to meet with him 
afterwards.
<P>
	The cost of this agency forum was $1,670, broken down as 
follows: room rental, $750; coffee, tea, juice and muffins, $920. 
There was no translation provided, as these staff meetings are 
conducted in both official languages.
<P>
	The costs were charged to CIDA's communications branch, as 
the event supported internal communications.
<P>
	The agency forum was videotaped so that CIDA staff members 
posted to Canadian missions overseas could view the forum on 
videotape. This is the usual practice for departments with 
employees posted abroad. The taping was carried out by 
Productions André R. Lavoie Inc., and 60 copies were made for 
CIDA staff abroad. All work was done in-house, with the exception 
of the taping which cost $400. Tape stock was purchased for 
$410.73 and the ADCOM Presentation Group provided technical 
equipment for $56.71. The total videotape cost was $867.44.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that this House 
approves in general the budgetary policy of the government, and of 
the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the 1996-97 budget.
<P>
	Since the beginning of our mandate in 1993 the government has 
been faced with many significant challenges. These challenges 
have been met directly, openly and honestly with the people of 
Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1472"> 1472 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We all know that too many Canadians are unemployed, that 
Canadian businesses are still having a hard time, that we must get 
down to work right away to maintain social programs that are the 
envy of the world. We all know this, and our government intends to 
deal with these issues that concern all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Much progress has been made to date in achieving the goals of 
job creation and economic growth, and the sustainability of social 
programs. The unemployment rate has declined two full percentage 
points since the Liberals formed the government. Over 600,000 
jobs have been created and inflation is at its lowest level in 30 
years. Interest rates have remained low largely because of the 
successful action on deficit reduction. Interest rates are critical to 
the maintenance of job creation and economic progress.
<P>
	We have also tackled the maintenance of the health care system 
and social programs through progressive reviews in consultation 
with Canadians.
<P>
	The 1996 budget accomplishes much to complement the work 
that has been done to date. To progress with the job creation and 
economic growth agenda, the government has in the budget 
focused on three priorities: youth, trade and technology.
<P>
	Despite reduced spending in virtually every area of government 
activity, spending on youth has been substantially increased. This 
budget will provide an extra $315 million over the next three years 
toward creation of jobs for young Canadians. An additional $165 
million is being provided for students. The federal government will 
work closely with provinces and businesses to help young 
Canadians find that crucial first job.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since we came to office, Canada's exports have soared. This 
increase in trade has been the driving force behind job creation and 
economic growth. Team Canada's trade missions have been highly 
successful, generating $20 billion in sales for Canadian businesses.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The 1996 budget will further aid the development of exports by 
giving the Export Development Corporation $50 million in new 
equity capital for export financing and the Small Business 
Development Bank $50 million to assist small and medium sized 
businesses, in particular, to participate in international trade.
<P>
	I said the third priority was science and technology. Leadership 
in the knowledge industries means more jobs, lasting jobs and 
better jobs for Canadians. High knowledge industries have 
contributed more to recent job growth than all other industries 
combined.
<P>
	Over the long term, businesses using new technology will create 
new jobs faster than old jobs disappear. This is why technology is a 
key element of the job strategy.
<P>
	Through the 1996 budget special support is being provided to 
key sectors such as aeronautics, biotechnology, environmental 
technology and the development of the information highway. Just 
one example is the student connection program which will hire 
2,000 students to show 50,000 small companies how to use the 
Internet to help their businesses.
<P>
	This is an area of investment of scarce dollars that is particularly 
important for my community and for the national capital region. 
The region has been significantly affected economically by 
downsizing in the public service which will amount to a total of 
15,000 jobs disappearing over three years starting with the last 
budget. As we seek to diversify the local economy, local 
governments, the business community and the federal government 
working in co-operation, the importance of high technology 
development to our region is absolutely crucial.
<P>
	At the same time the government is making efforts to improve 
the situation of the public service. The wage freeze legislation will 
expire this year. It will not be renewed. It will not be extended. 
Beginning in June annual increments to public service employees 
will again be the order of the day. A return to collective bargaining 
as the wage freeze legislation expires is something to which we all 
look forward.
<P>
	I want to speak very briefly about a couple of things that are of 
particular concern to my constituents because deficit reduction 
without tax increases does not come easily and does not come 
without pain, nor does ensuring the sustainability of social 
programs like our pension system.
<P>
	The government is acting to ensure that the public pension 
system, which has done so much to alleviate the poverty of seniors, 
continues. It will be done by increasing benefits to the lowest 
income seniors and by ensuring that those now receiving benefits 
or within five years of receiving old age security or other 
retirement benefits will continue to have the right to those benefits.
<P>
	As the minister looks toward the development of this legislation 
I want to raise with him some concerns that have come to my 
attention. First is the very short time frame for implementing the 
rollover of RRSPs into RRIFs or retirement income. This is causing 
great concern to people who have made investment plans under the 
rules that existed. They are saying we need a better phase-in period.
<P>
	I also want to draw to the minister's attention my concern that 
the legislation implementing the changes to pensions as well as to 
RRSPs should pay attention to the need to improve the economic 
status of retired women. Ninety per cent of the poorest elderly in 
this country are women. I do not think any of us need an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1473"> 1473 </A></B>
<P>
explanation as  to why that happens; work history and a variety of 
other situations.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	We have an opportunity as we implement changes to the pension 
plan to also equalize the retirement income of women. I urge the 
minister to do that. I would be happy to share with him some ideas 
on how that might be done.
<P>
	In conclusion, this has not been an easy budget. It has involved 
some difficult choices as has every one of our budgets since 1993. 
It is a reasonable balance between the kind of compassionate, 
caring society we want and the fiscal restraint that currently is 
necessary to get us to a much better future for the entire country. I 
am pleased to speak today in support of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
member indicated that her government is concerned about 
maintaining social programs into the future. She is concerned 
particularly about maintaining pensions.
<P>
	If that is the case, why does her government continue to increase 
the amount of money spent on interest payments on the debt from 
$38 billion to about $50 billion since it has come into power? Why 
did her government leave in place a pension plan that is totally out 
of line with what is acceptable to Canadians? If the government 
was serious about maintaining social programs and pensions, it 
would not have left in place the pension plan that it has.
<P>
	How can Canadians believe that her government is really, truly 
concerned about the future of social programs when its actions say 
otherwise?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Madam Speaker, I think it behoves the hon. 
member for Vegreville to acknowledge those areas in which the 
government has made substantial progress.
<P>
	Specifically the member talked about the debt and the deficit. I 
sat in this Chamber through five budgets of the previous 
government and saw threats, promises, cutbacks and sacrifices so 
that we could get the deficit under control. The deficit just kept 
going up.
<P>
	Our government in just two budgets has been able to 
substantially reduce the amount of the deficit. The hon. member 
knows very well that in the next two budgets we will have dropped 
not from 6 per cent of GDP in deficit to 3 per cent as we committed 
at the last election, but to 2 per cent, in other words not by 50 per 
cent but in fact by 66 per cent. That will bring the deficit from over 
$45 billion when we took office to $17 billion by the time our term 
is over.
<P>
	Regarding pensions, this is the first government since the MPs 
pension plan was introduced in the 1950s that has actually reduced 
it to the tune of $3.3 million worth of savings to Canadians. It has 
reduced the benefits by over 20 per cent. We have met every single 
one of our  commitments on that matter and have gone beyond 
them.
<P>
	Yes, it is still a very generous pension plan. It is one for which, as 
the member knows, MPs pay very generously as well, far more 
than most other pension plans. It needs further reform but one 
cannot disrupt the lives of people who have served in this House for 
decades by suddenly saying they do not have the pension plan they 
thought they had.
<P>
	In terms of the sustainability of pensions generally, 75 per cent 
of seniors in this country live on incomes of under $26,000. Ninety 
per cent of the poorest seniors are women who are either single, 
widowed, divorced or separated.
<P>
	I regret as much as anybody in this House an end of a universal 
pension plan which is an entitlement of citizenship. I also realize 
the necessity of looking after those lowest income seniors when 
resources are limited. I am pleased that we are going to be 
increasing benefits to those lowest income Canadians in 
retirement.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Madam Speaker, in the last election campaign when 
Reform proposed targeting old age security to those most in need, 
the Liberals promised that they would never end universality of old 
age security. Now the finance minister has done that.
<P>
	We could not believe them on the GST. We cannot trust them on 
old age security. The numbers the hon. member used in terms of 
deficit reduction are yet to happen sometime in the future.
<P>
	The Liberal government has made a little progress on the deficit. 
Canada's debt is the second highest in the industrialized world and 
it is still being added to every year.
<P>
	It is so difficult to understand how members of that party can say 
with a straight face that they are doing what has to be done to 
assure that the money will be there for social programs into the 
future because they have not.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Madam Speaker, as I encouraged the member to 
do on his first question and comment, I suggest that he might want 
to accurately reflect what our government has done. He knows 
perfectly well that deficit reduction is not something for the future. 
He knows very well this is the first government in over a decade 
that has successfully reduced the deficit from $45 billion to $30 
billion. That is a one-third reduction in only two budgets and that is 
a substantial reduction.
<P>
	On pensions, let me just say we are not like the Reform Party. It 
wants everybody to have to rely on themselves for their pensions.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise in the House today to 
address the 1996-97 budget as presented by the Minister of Finance 
on March 6.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1474"> 1474 </A></B>
<P>
	When our government was elected in October 1993, Canadians 
from coast to coast to coast told us that reducing the deficit and 
the debt must be our number one priority. This budget along with 
our two previous budgets showed Canadians that we have been 
and continue to be listening.
<P>
	When this government was elected the annual deficit was more 
than $42 billion. By the end of the 1995-96 fiscal year we reached 
the deficit reduction target of approximately $32 billion. We are on 
target to reach our original goal set for the 1996-97 fiscal year of a 
deficit of 3 per cent of GDP which will be approximately $24 
billion.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has already set two rolling targets to 
take us into the second half of our mandate. These targets will 
reduce the deficit to 2 per cent of GDP by fiscal year 1997-98. By 
the turn of the century, by the year 2000, I personally hope to see 
that the deficit is realized to zero and the introduction of a balanced 
budget to this House.
<P>
	The 1996 budget continues on the track of reinventing 
government. Last year through a major program review we 
managed to protect vital programs while reducing spending to its 
lowest level of GDP in almost 50 years. This year we have further 
reduced program spending in order to move closer to a balanced 
budget. Federal program spending this year will represent 12 per 
cent of GDP, its lowest level since 1949 and down from 20 per cent 
only a decade ago.
<P>
	Liberal governments over the years have played a leading role in 
building Canada's social programs. Today faced with dramatic 
changes to our society and our economy, the Liberal government 
must ensure that these programs remain effective and financially 
sustainable.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	One way the government is doing this is through the new Canada 
health and social transfer which consolidates transfers for health 
care, post-secondary education and social services. The transfer is 
a block fund which offers more flexibility to the provinces. This 
flexibility will allow for the development of innovative programs 
for Canadians receiving social assistance. Greater flexibility will 
also reduce administrative costs and will allow provinces to adjust 
to the new funding levels while still protecting programs that 
Canadians desire.
<P>
	This budget introduces a five year funding arrangement for the 
CHST for the years 1998-99 through to 2002-03. The CHST will be 
stabilized at the 1998-99 levels for another two years and then will 
begin to grow. There will not be any cuts to the CHST beyond those 
announced in last year's budget. When the CHST begins to grow 
beyond the year 2000, federal transfers will increase for the first 
time since the mid-1980s.
<P>
	The CHST will allow provinces to plan programs to meet their 
needs with clearly set levels of federal funding.  By providing 
predictable funding, the government is demonstrating its 
commitment to safeguarding health care and other social programs 
that are valued by all Canadians.
<P>
	As we all know, part of the CHST is made up of a cash transfer 
which was scheduled to gradually decline. However, in response to 
concerns about diminishing cash transfers, this government has 
announced that the cash component will be kept above a floor of 
$11 billion per year for the five years between 1998 and 2003.
<P>
	While the CHST will give more power to the provinces, the cash 
transfer will guarantee a strong federal presence for programs of 
national priority such as post-secondary education and social 
assistance.
<P>
	In addition, the government will continue to vigorously defend 
the five principles of the Canadian health care system: 
comprehensiveness, universality, accessibility, portability, and 
public administration. The federal government will also work with 
the provinces to develop other shared principles and objectives for 
this new transfer.
<P>
	This budget is good for Canadians. For the third year in a row 
there will be no increase in personal income tax rates nor will there 
be any increase in excise taxes.
<P>
	Additionally, the budget marks a significant turning point. In our 
first two budgets we were forced to make a lot of tough but 
necessary decisions in order to clean up the economic mess left by 
the previous government. Unlike those budgets, this budget has a 
more direct focus on the future, a more sustainable plan, a long 
term plan for Canadians. This focus is reflected in our attention to 
our youth, our attention to working families and in particular to 
seniors.
<P>
	February's throne speech put the problems facing Canadian 
youth into the spotlight. Youth unemployment and 
underemployment are a serious concern in my riding of 
Cumberland-Colchester. Young people throughout the area feel 
that they have to leave home, in fact many of them must leave the 
country to find employment.
<P>
	This budget announces concrete measures which demonstrate 
that the Liberal government is serious about improving 
opportunities for young Canadians. To make education more 
affordable, tax credits for university and college students and their 
parents will increase. This budget will also stabilize the funding 
that we transfer to the provinces for post-secondary education. In 
addition, it lays out a plan to increase that funding over time.
<P>
	This budget will double federal funding for summer jobs. In 
1996-97 we doubled the number. There are 200 more jobs in my 
riding. The deadline was April 12 and we encouraged employers in 
all sectors of our society to get out there and employ our youth this 
summer allowing an extra 30,000 young Canadians to gain vital 
experience and help finance their education. It also challenges the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1475"> 1475 </A></B>
<P>
private sector and other levels of government to do their  share to 
create opportunities and to assist our youth in finding their first job.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	My riding of Cumberland-Colchester consists of hard working 
families who work long hours with fewer benefits to try and stretch 
that paycheque as far as they can. These families will benefit from 
this year's budget.
<P>
	Parents who wish to return to school in order to find better jobs 
will now be able to make full use of the child tax credit. This 
includes parents who show the courage to return to high school. We 
are raising the age limit for the child care deduction from 14 to 16 
years so that more parents who work nights can claim it. As well, 
we are doubling the working income supplement of the child tax 
benefit. This will mean an extra $500 a year for low income 
working parents.
<P>
	This budget is also committed to security for the elderly through 
the availability of old age security and the guaranteed income 
supplement. The budget includes a new seniors benefit to be 
implemented in the year 2001. This tax free benefit will replace the 
existing OAS and GIS programs. More than 70 per cent of our 
seniors will actually receive higher benefits under this new system, 
many of whom are single women.
<P>
	Pensions for today's seniors, near seniors and their spouses will 
be protected. Seniors will be guaranteed to receive an amount that 
is no less than the current pension plan. The new system will better 
respond to the needs of low income seniors and will ensure a 
responsive, affordable system for our children and grandchildren. 
Let there be no doubt that we will look after our elderly and that 
this budget is the first step in doing so.
<P>
	There are a record number of single parent households in this 
country. When a marriage breaks down, the children are always the 
first to suffer. I have received many letters from men and women 
alike who are concerned about the current child support system. 
This budget speaks to those concerns and introduces measures to 
improve the system, measures that include a revised tax treatment 
of child support payments.
<P>
	Currently child support payments are taxable for the recipient 
and tax deductible for the parent paying support. This is wrong. 
Payments are supposed to provide support for children. They are 
not income for parents. The budget proposes that all child support 
awards agreed to on or before May 1, 1997 will not be included as 
income of the custodial parent for tax purposes, nor will they be tax 
deductible for the parent paying the support. The government will 
also introduce new guidelines and enhance enforcement for the 
collection of child support payments.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I regret but the 
member's time has expired. Questions or comments. Resuming 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this is the third federal budget I have spoken on since I 
came to Ottawa. In each budget I have expressed major 
disappointment: in the first, because it did not deal with the fiscal 
realities that faced Canada in 1994, the deficit and the debt; in the 
1995 budget, because it missed a tremendous opportunity to put 
Canada on a positive fiscal course which would see the deficit 
eliminated and the debt paid down within the next five years.
<P>
	Like Liberals of old, the Liberals who started deficit financing 
rather than making tough decisions, these present day Liberals 
again put off tough decisions. This refusal to come to grips with 
Canada's debt problem plus interest on the deficit means that the 
debt has continued to soar. By the end of March it was over $578 
billion. The Liberals by failing to address this issue have added 
over $200 billion to the national debt.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	As the debt grows, so does the interest that must be paid. The 
government now pays $47 billion in interest on the debt. This is 
more than it pays on elderly benefits, unemployment insurance, 
payments to aboriginal peoples, foreign aid, the CBC, and science 
and technology combined.
<P>
	Let us face it. This is not just a waste of the taxpayers' money. It 
affects how business and industry reacts to our country. This kind 
of mismanagement of the country's economy does not create a 
climate for investment, it does not create confidence.
<P>
	If the government had proceeded immediately in the 1994 
budget to address Canada's problems with the economy, the 
confidence for investment and job creation would now be with us. 
The job creation proposals in the budget which we all know will not 
create a single long term job would not have been necessary and 
would not be with us now eating up taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	If the right economic road had been followed in the beginning by 
these Liberals, they would now be in a position to reduce taxes. A 
reduction in income taxes, a reduction in payroll taxes, 
unemployment insurance premiums and the elimination of the 
heavy regulatory burden which follows Canadian companies would 
go a long way to stimulate investment in Canada. These are the 
measures that should have been announced in this budget.
<P>
	A failure to deal with the deficit and Canada's accumulated debt 
is not the only shortcoming of this budget. This budget also has 
severe human consequences. The finance minister and the Minister 
of Justice through their combined wisdom have seen fit to get 
involved through the budget in the payments made by the 
non-custodial parent to the custodial parent after divorce. Starting 
in May 1997 these payments will no longer be  tax deductible by 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1476"> 1476 </A></B>
<P>
paying ex-spouse and will not have to be included in the income of 
the receiving spouse.
<P>
	Why the government will not leave the issue of taxation of child 
support payments to be dealt with by the parties themselves with 
the help of a mediator is beyond me. However what worries me 
even more is the fact that this new rule can be made retroactive. It 
can be made to apply to payments that are now being made. This 
means that thousands of Canadians, who prior to budget day 
thought the matter of child support was well settled, are now 
reviewing their child support agreements to see how this budget 
will affect them.
<P>
	Now that the paying ex-spouse may no longer claim a tax 
deduction for the support payments, he or she will have less money 
to look after their new family as well as to help the ex-spouse and 
the children of the first marriage. Who is going to benefit from this 
massive tax grab? Not the parents involved in the divorce, not the 
custodial or the non-custodial parent and certainly not the children.
<P>
	Who will benefit? The government. No new taxes in this budget. 
That is a very dishonest statement. The government already knows 
it will make over $250 million on this new program in a major tax 
grab.
<P>
	What if some of these ex-spouses are already having a difficult 
time making support payments and keeping up with the demands of 
a new family? Without the help of a tax deduction might they be 
less inclined to make full support payments? Is the government 
building a new monster, another social problem on the backs of 
divorced parents?
<P>
	As well, thousands of family law lawyers across the country are 
down on their knees thanking the justice minister for increasing 
their billable income for at least the coming two years. This piece 
of legislation has opened the floodgates to more litigation. How 
dare the Minister of Justice and indeed the Liberal members of the 
House of Commons justice committee decide to vote down my 
private members' bill on grandparents rights because it might 
increase litigation and then support this budget measure which 
virtually by definition will increase litigation. Perhaps my bill in 
reality did not increase litigation enough for them to support it.
<P>
	What about seniors issues? Seniors issues are put off to be dealt 
with in the next century. If the old age security and the guaranteed 
income supplement need to be changed or need to be replaced, why 
put it off for four years? Again, if a tough decision which might 
affect the government's popularity could be made, the Liberal 
solution is to put it off at least until after the next election.
<P>
	More than that, I believe the Liberals in this budget have broken 
faith with our seniors. During the Quebec referendum period and in 
the run-up to the budget, the Prime Minister repeatedly assured 
Canadian seniors their  retirement incomes were safe. In a 
supplementary document entitled: ``The Seniors Benefit: Securing 
the Future'' the government stated: ``Current seniors have the right 
to continue in their retirement secure the change will not affect 
them. That is guaranteed''. This is what the government said but 
this is not what it has done.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Let us look carefully at the actions of this government. The 
government reduced the mandatory withdrawal age for RRSP 
contributors from 71 to 69. Seniors will pay more in taxes over 
their retirement. Because of this budget, seniors will have to 
remove their retirement savings from the their RRSP accounts 
attracting tax a full two years earlier than would otherwise be the 
case.
<P>
	Could it be that when reality hits our seniors and they realize 
they will not be better off, that in fact they will be forced to roll 
over their RRSPs at 69 years of age instead of 71, they will realize 
that this Liberal government has increased their tax burden and 
taken away direct savings from their many long years of hard work 
as dependable Canadian taxpayers?
<P>
	Is it that by placing the proposed new seniors benefit to come 
into force in the year 2001 the government hopes to coast in on the 
next election and by the time that our seniors realize they have been 
hit with a new and higher tax on their retirement income it will be 
too late?
<P>
	This government seems to be maintaining its do nothing attitude 
and closing its eyes to an increasing debt of close to $600 billion. 
No change that negatively affects seniors, I do not think so.
<P>
	What else did this budget do? The government froze the RRSP 
contribution limit at $13,500 until 2003, lifting it marginally 
thereafter. Again this affects the ability of Canadians to provide for 
their own retirement. Again the government's promise to seniors 
has been broken.
<P>
	As I said earlier, seniors are living longer healthier lives, retiring 
later by some. They want the right to service their own retirement. 
They want the government to live up to its promises.
<P>
	Then there are the Liberal make work programs. The Liberals 
will spend over $65 million in the next five years to establish a 
commission to study health care needs. Canada's health care needs 
no more studies. This is simply a way to put Liberal friends on the 
commission. Then there are the other make work projects for 
youth. None of them create meaningful long term jobs. I know it, 
my party knows it and worst of all, the Liberals know it but again, it 
looks good and it sounds good to the electorate.
<P>
	The only long term permanent jobs are created by industry in a 
healthy marketplace. Industry will only create these jobs when it is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1477"> 1477 </A></B>
<P>
confident the government is  moving in the right direction. Tax 
relief might have been a good answer in part of this budget.
<P>
	With this budget the Liberal government has missed a great 
opportunity to do something for the future of Canada. It did not. 
Perhaps it is time it stepped aside and let the people of Canada 
decide on the future of this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is as 
clear today as it ever has been that Canadians do not want rhetoric 
from their government. What they want is action. What they seek is 
real progress.
<P>
	These are the standards that Canadians have set. These are the 
standards by which this government wants to be judged. Seldom in 
our history have so many experienced such anxiety. Canadians feel 
our very way of life is at risk. They look at medicare and feel it is 
threatened. They look at the pension system and wonder if it will be 
there in the years to come. They consider the economy and worry 
that the gale force winds of competition and change will carry away 
their jobs. And Canadians think about their children, our youth, and 
ask what kind of opportunities will be left for them.
<P>
	These are damning statements from a member of the opposition 
but that is a direct quote, the opening paragraphs of the speech by 
the Minister of Finance to this House, the budget speech on March 
6, 1996. That is the admission of the Minister of Finance to the 
House and the country: the government does not have the answers 
that are required, does not have a plan and, halfway through its 
mandate, has done virtually nothing to address the major concerns 
of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Let us look at these questions. Canadians feel their very way of 
life is at risk. That is a statement by the Minister of Finance. Of 
course it is at risk. Why? Taxation is going up and up, contrary to 
what the Minister of Finance says. While he says that he has not 
raised taxes, everyone knows that he has raised taxation revenue 
from Canadians by taking a dollar from the seniors, by reducing the 
amount that they can put into RRSPs. They are going to be cut off 
at age 69 instead of age 71.
<P>
	The minister knows full well that the basic exemptions for 
income tax are not indexed for inflation at all as long as inflation is 
under 3 per cent. He has taken unemployment insurance premiums 
out of Canadian taxpayers faster than would otherwise would be 
required.
<P>
	What a litany of exercises by the Minister of Finance. By 
squeezing more dollars out of this program and collecting a little 
more from that program, ensuring that Canadians have to pay more 
somewhere else, all the while he is claiming that he has not raised 
taxes. I will give him his due. While he has not raised the general 
rate of taxation, he has done everything in his power to raise taxes 
by every other means at his disposal.
<P>
	That is why Canadians feel that their very way of life is at risk. 
The Minister of Finance says that Canadians look at medicare and 
feel it is threatened. They have every right to feel it is threatened. 
The government remains absolutely committed to keeping its head 
in the sand. It stands by its five principles that unfortunately are 
outdated.
<P>
	Medicare has stood us well until now, but unfortunately we have 
a plan that we can no longer afford. Changes are required. What 
does the government do? It does absolutely nothing. It has not 
changed one thing, other than transfer less money to the provinces. 
It is allowing them to figure out how to deliver health care within a 
framework that was devised 30 years ago. Unfortunately the 
provinces are finding that they cannot live within the new 
restrictions. That is why medicare is threatened.
<P>
	It is up to the government to do something to demonstrate 
leadership. If I recall, the Prime Minister campaigned in the last 
election that he would convene a conference of the health ministers 
to resolve the crisis in health care. That was going to take place by 
June 1994. It will soon be June 1996 and we are still waiting for 
that to happen. That is why health care is threatened.
<P>
	Seniors look at the pension system and wonder if it will be there 
in the years to come. The actuaries have said that there is a $600 
billion shortfall in the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	Today the government has started a travelling road show to ask 
Canadians what they want. Where is the leadership from this 
government? Where is the commitment by the government to the 
seniors who have worked hard all their lives? Now that they are 
retired and dependant on their savings and the money that they paid 
to the Canada pension plan in the belief that old age security was 
going to be there for them, these are the things that are threatened.
<P>
	Seniors are concerned. They are asking if the pension system 
will be there for years to come. We have said and seniors are saying 
it more and more that it is not going to be there. The newspapers 
today are suggesting that the premiums are going to double in order 
to maintain the program that is currently available.
<P>
	I am not sure the Canadian economy can afford a doubling of 
premiums. That is why Canadians are concerned. Is the Canada 
pension plan going to be there for the seniors of today, far less the 
seniors of tomorrow? It is an answer to that question which we 
want from the government.
<P>
	In the budget speech the minister said that old age security and 
the guaranteed income supplement are going, that they will be 
finished in the year 2001. No more old age security. No more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1478"> 1478 </A></B>
<P>
guaranteed income supplement. The programs that seniors have 
depended  on for the last generation or more are going to be wiped 
away.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Where does that leave them? We know the minister is going to 
introduce something called a tax free benefit to seniors. However, 
is that going to be better or worse for seniors? They do not know, 
which is why they have every right to be concerned.
<P>
	Not only is the government saying it has a serious problem with 
the Canada pension plan but it does not know how to fix it. In the 
same speech the Minister of Finance states he is taking away the 
old age security and the guaranteed income supplement and is 
replacing it with something called a tax free seniors benefit which, 
as far as we can tell, could in many cases pay seniors less than what 
they are receiving today.
<P>
	Do seniors not have the right to be concerned? I think they have a 
right to be concerned. I would think the government would say that 
they have a right to be concerned. Yet halfway through its mandate, 
the Minister of Finance is making statements at the beginning of 
his speech which are almost an admission of failure to manage the 
programs that it was elected to manage.
<P>
	The government considers the economy and worries that the gale 
force winds of competition and change will carry away the jobs. 
Does anyone remember what was the promise of the election 
campaign of this government? It was jobs, jobs, jobs. Now it is 
saying that people are concerned that the changes in the 
competition will carry away their jobs. What is the government 
doing about it? Not very much. Nothing at all.
<P>
	The government spent $6 billion on an infrastructure program 
and the President of the Treasury Board said it created 8,000 
permanent jobs. This is 8,000 jobs for a $6 billion investment. Was 
that value for money? I do not think it was. As I have said many 
times, the government would have been better to have put the 
money in the bank and given the people the interest.
<P>
	There are many more things I would like to speak about, such as 
the privatization of NavCan and CN Rail. We are now hearing that 
the food inspection branch is going to be set up in some kind of 
unaccountable, removed from government, removed from 
criticism by the members of Parliament. We hope it is going to do a 
good job.
<P>
	The government says it is committed to cutting down on waste. 
There are many issues that I would love to talk about and continue 
on. I have only got to the first half of the first page of the minister's 
speech. I could go for days. Unfortunately I cannot.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I have to make the same comment I made to the person questioning 
me after speaking on the budget. I think one of the best things we 
can all do as  parliamentarians for our constituents and for 
Canadians generally is to give them the facts.
<P>
	Therefore, when the member who has just spoken talks about 
taking away the old age security and the GST and talks about those 
programs as being gone, finished, wiped away, he knows that is not 
the truth. He knows perfectly well that any senior now receiving a 
benefit will continue to receive exactly that benefit. He knows that 
any person within five years of being entitled to those benefits will 
be entitled to continue receiving them for the entire period of their 
retirement. He knows that is a commitment of the government and 
of the Prime Minister personally. It is precisely what is laid out in 
the budget, unless those seniors now aged 60 and looking forward 
to retirement at 65 determine that the new combined benefit is in 
fact to their advantage.
<P>
	The member also knows that combining those benefits and 
directing them is going to make sure that 90 per cent of the elderly 
poor who are at the lowest level of income, 90 per cent being sole 
support women, will in fact get more not less. He knows that the 
benefits for today's seniors are not in danger.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	That is quite a bit different from the Reform Party plan which 
requires everybody to put something aside for their own retirement 
under some kind of private RRSP system.
<P>
	I remember the days when my father made $90 a month. This 
plan would require many families to choose between putting food 
on the table for their children or providing for their retirement 40 
years hence. As a mother, frankly I know what choice I would 
make. That is not security in retirement.
<P>
	As well, he knows that the Prime Minister has kept his promise 
concerning health care by establishing the national health forum 
which the Prime Minister personally chairs. Perhaps the hon. 
member would consider doing what I and many Liberal members 
have done in our ridings and hold a forum in which his constituents 
can give him their views, as mine have done, on what their 
priorities are for a sustainable health care system for the future.
<P>
	The member asked about the infrastructure program. Was that 
value for money? Ask the 100,000 plus people who had a job for 
that time if they thought it was value for money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, the member asked for the facts. 
Let me give the facts.
<P>
	``There is widespread anxiety, particularly among the young, 
that the public pension system will not be there for them when they 
retire''. That is a direct quote from the Minister of Finance. ``First 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1479"> 1479 </A></B>
<P>
the CPP must be put on a sound financial footing and done so in a 
way that is  sustainable, affordable and fair''. Another direct quote 
from the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Carrying on: ``Clearly, the government should have acted some 
time ago to address this problem''. A direct quote from the 
Minister of Finance. I can go on and on.
<P>
	The point I am trying to make is that seniors and everybody else 
listened to the Liberals when they said jobs, jobs, jobs, when they 
said that is going to be there for them. The Liberals told Canadians 
not to worry about their pensions because they would make sure 
they will be there. What did we find out? There were no answers 
coming from the government. The facts speak for themselves. 
These were direct quotes from the budget speech by the Minister of 
Finance to this House on March 6, 1996.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, in 
the few minutes available I would like to put forward some 
thoughts on future budgets.
<P>
	First, let me congratulate the minister on his announcement on 
March 6 of the change to the Income Tax Act regarding 
investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. 
This is an initial step in the right direction which will help in 
keeping our red book promise to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
<P>
	The main point I would like to make today is to express the hope 
that sooner or later, but preferably sooner, the government will find 
it possible to conclude the policy of deficit reduction and review 
and expand public sector expenditures in an effort to improve the 
social and economic conditions of most Canadians, particularly 
low and middle income earners.
<P>
	We have witnessed with apprehension the phenomenon of 
certain large corporations, banks and other financial institutions 
making record profits by continuing to ``downsize'' their 
workforce. The time has come, as one observer recently put it, to 
downsize downsizing for the sake of social peace and stability.
<P>
	The Easter recess has allowed me time to note the profound 
malaise caused by unemployment and poverty and to bring back to 
Ottawa from Toronto and Montreal recent images and impressions 
of the hardships Canadians are presently enduring.
<P>
	In increasing numbers people are sleeping on sidewalks and in 
telephone booths and are reduced to begging for change in our 
downtown urban areas. Families are struggling to make ends meet. 
There are even reports that the financial hardship resulting from 
cuts to welfare payments in Ontario has become a factor in parents 
offering their children for adoption. Cash strapped municipalities 
are finding it almost impossible to provide basic services, from 
road maintenance to public libraries to providing an adequate 
number of teachers, to mention a few.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Social housing applicants are waiting longer and longer, in some 
cases several years, before their turn comes.
<P>
	High youth unemployment set at 15.3 per cent in March has 
eroded the confidence and hope of our young people to find 
meaningful work commensurate with their training and career 
plans. It is no wonder that youth are without jobs when thousands 
of people have been and continue to be thrown out of work as a 
result of corporate and government layoffs, including the 10,500 
provincial civil servants recently cut by the Harris government in 
Ontario.
<P>
	Consumers are hesitant to buy even small appliances because of 
the uncertainty posed by potential job loss. Companies such as 
General Motors are closing down auto parts plants in Oshawa and 
Windsor because of low cost competition in the U.S., all in an 
effort to please the insatiable corporate appetite for larger and 
larger profits. Also, Kenworth Trucks in St. Therese, Quebec is 
giving notice that it intends to shift and enlarge truck production to 
its plant in Mexico.
<P>
	New housing starts remain at a record low while the savings 
rates of Canadians stay at record low levels and the percentage of 
after tax personal income going toward servicing their debt is at a 
record high.
<P>
	The poverty gap, that is the amount of additional income that 
would be required to bring all Canadians above the poverty line, 
amounts to a staggering $15.2 billion with single parent mothers 
representing one of the largest groups living in poverty.
<P>
	It seems to me that these points call for a number of measures, 
the most pressing being the urgent necessity of redistributing 
incomes. Personal and corporate tax expenditures alone still cost 
the federal government billions of dollars in lost revenue. Some of 
these expenditures are necessary and warranted but others such as 
the non-taxation of gambling and lottery winnings, alone 
amounting to some $900 million in lost revenue in one year are not.
<P>
	To give another example, the tax concessions in the resource 
sector such as the Canadian exploration expense and the Canadian 
development expense are conservatively estimated at $150 million 
a year. These expenditures are no longer justifiable if development 
is to become sustainable.
<P>
	Over the past 30 years corporate taxes as a percentage of federal 
government revenue and as a percentage of GDP have declined. 
There was a corporate tax rate reduction from 46 per cent to 38 per 
cent under the Mulroney regime, thus reducing the corporate fiscal 
burden in Canada to one of the lowest among OECD countries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1480"> 1480 </A></B>
<P>
	While the social safety net has undergone intense scrutiny and 
reductions, for example unemployment insurance and the Canada 
assistance plan, outside of small increases in the large corporation 
tax and corporate surtax in 1995-96, increases in corporate 
taxation remain untouched in this budget. This policy has 
produced a serious imbalance between the treatment of social and 
economic policies.
<P>
	For these reasons, sooner rather than later the Minister of 
Finance needs to shift his focus of attention from deficit reduction 
toward a policy which will: one, restore fairness and 
progressiveness in the tax system so as to bring back the 
confidence of Canadians in their government's sense of social 
justice and equity; two, give poverty issues the attention they so 
urgently require; three, provide low income Canadians with 
adequate social measures to ensure they can live in dignity; and 
four, translate the government's commitment to sustainable 
development into coherent policies that will ensure future growth 
while taking into account the need to protect our freshwater 
resources, the necessity of clean air to breathe, the fragility of 
many ecosystems, the need to adequately conserve our agricultural 
soil and the need for sustainable fisheries and forests, to name a 
few.
<P>
	In addition, our sustainable development policies must respect 
our international commitments from the management of toxic 
waste to the ratification of the law of the sea, from the biodiversity 
convention to our commitments to lower carbon dioxide reductions 
under the climate change convention. All of these are important 
Liberal commitments we must work to realize.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I have a few words on the phasing out of the old 
age security pension over the next five years and the Canada 
pension plan. The replacement of the old age security pension with 
the proposals for new seniors benefits involves basing benefits on 
household income instead of on individual income as is the present 
case. Unfortunately the losers in the scenario are married women 
who have no income of their own who at the same time have no 
legal entitlement to the income of their spouse. I urge the 
government to redress this inequity over the next five years to 
ensure that married women retain the same degree of financial 
independence they have presently under the old age security 
pension.
<P>
	On the Canada pension plan, I congratulate the government for 
launching today public hearings in Toronto which will help decide 
on the future of the CPP. Our increasing senior population makes it 
necessary to do in Canada what has already been done in other 
OECD countries namely, to increase contribution rates so as to 
retain both the present retirement age and level of benefits. This is 
a small price to pay for a retirement plan which benefits most 
Canadians who cannot afford a private retirement plan and which 
permits mobility from province to province and from job to job.
<P>
	The Canada pension plan is one of the best plans of its kind in the 
world. It is funded entirely by contributions from employers and 
employees without a penny coming from taxes. It serves Canadians 
well and has done so for some 30 years. It ought to remain as a 
public fund owned and operated by the public sector for the benefit 
of many generations of Canadians to come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, we have 
seen governments over the years bring forward budgets that have 
expressed their concern about overspending and deficit spending, 
yet each year the debt has grown and grown and grown. Since 1993 
we have heard exactly the same kind of rhetoric, that everything is 
fine, we are on track, be happy and do not worry. Yet the debt has 
continued to grow year after year after year. The finance minister 
will not tell us when he believes we will stop sliding into debt. In 
other words, he has not set a date like many of the provinces have 
for a balanced budget.
<P>
	Seeing as how the interest payment on our debt is the greatest 
threat toward our social programs, including our senior citizens 
programs, that enormous amount of money we have to pay on an 
ever rising debt which is going to amount to approximately $50 
billion by 1997, which is just next year, is the government prepared 
to tell Canadians when it expects to balance the debt? Would the 
member be prepared to offer an estimation of what the debt will be 
when the government finally reaches a point when it is no longer 
overspending and borrowing, but instead living within its means? 
What does the hon. member think that debt and the associated 
financial interest payments will be?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member is engaging in a 
typical Reform misconceptual game of linking debt with social 
security payments and I think he is wrong. He is completely wrong 
because the social security system cannot be seen in isolation as a 
factor that runs counter to economic interest.
<P>
	Whatever penny or dollar is spent in terms of pensions is 
returned to the economy very quickly through expenditures by 
seniors who certainly know how to use their revenue. Usually that 
revenue goes to the cornerstore, to the supermarket, to transport 
and other commodities.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Therefore there is no conflict between the well-being of the 
economy and the well-being of social security. On the contrary, by 
ensuring that our seniors receive an adequate pension payment, 
adequate security and the ability to live in dignity as they do now, 
we also pump the money back into the economy and everybody 
benefits from it.
<P>
	I noticed on the part of the hon. member the same tendency as 
that of the hon. member for Prince Albert, a desire to spread some 
fear among Canadians about the  future of their Canada pension 
plan. The Canada pension plan as it stands today is not in any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1481"> 1481 </A></B>
<P>
danger at all. It is a pay as you go scheme. It is a scheme that takes 
care of the immediate present and will be put in a condition to take 
care of future generations as the number of seniors increase by 
adequate adjustment in the contributory benefits.
<P>
	In doing so we can look forward not just to a few years but 
decades and decades of Canadians having a pension plan that will 
at least meet the basic requirements of an individual. It is a system 
and a scheme that for the last 30 years, as a result of a fine Liberal 
measure, has served us well. I must make sure the hon. members of 
the Reform Party understand that the Canada pension plan does not 
receive one penny from the taxpayers. It is a self-sustaining plan.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister </B><B>of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased today to 
rise to discuss the Minister of Finance's March 6 budget.
<P>
	This budget proves that the government is keeping its promise to 
put Canada's fiscal house in order. The 1996 budget consolidates 
and extends the actions taken in the 1994 and 1995 budgets. It 
continues our work to create the proper climate for economic 
growth and job development. It meets and even betters our fiscal 
targets.
<P>
	It ensures the sustainability of Canadian social programs so that 
those who need assistance receive assistance. The budget relies on 
government expenditure cuts to meet our goals. There are $1.9 
billion in cuts in 1998-99.
<P>
	Program spending stood at 16.8 per cent of GDP when this 
government took office in 1993. It will be reduced to 12 per cent in 
1998, the lowest level since 1950. Taken together this 
government's first three budgets have introduced seven dollars in 
cuts for every dollar of tax increases. Our borrowing requirements 
will drop from $30 billion in 1993-94 to $6 billion in 1997-98. As 
well the ratio of debt to GDP will drop by more than one percentage 
point in 1997-98. In other words, the economy will finally be 
growing faster than the debt in 1997-98. The hon. member asked 
that question just moments ago and I have just provided the answer.
<P>
	The cuts we have made are strategic. We are remaking 
government to meet the needs of Canadians in a globalized high 
tech world. Government may be smaller but it is more efficient. 
Services are provided more quickly where and when Canadians 
need them.
<P>
	I would like to review the budget measures relating to Revenue 
Canada. We are strengthening our ability to combat the 
underground economy. The underground economy is not a 
victimless crime. It hurts honest taxpayers who are forced to pay 
more than their fair share of taxes. It places honest businesses at a 
competitive disadvantage. Revenue Canada is undertaking new  
enforcement measures to address this. Some $3.8 billion of 
additional taxes have been assessed. More resources are going to 
our audit program aimed at unincorporated businesses and 
self-employed individuals and we expect this to bring us further net 
revenues of about $100 million.
<P>
	Over two years ago the government consolidated revenue 
administration at the federal level. Sales, income and excise tax 
collection were integrated with customs and trade administration 
into a single department. The integration has performed as 
expected. By eliminating administrative overlap, considerable 
savings have been generated for the government. More important, 
the change has meant better service for Canadians. Administrative 
costs have been cut and the burden of compliance for taxpayers has 
been reduced.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	There has been excellent progress, but the job is not finished. 
The budget confirms that the government will create a new 
institution, the Canada revenue commission. The new commission 
will enhance internal efficiency by providing increased 
administrative and financial flexibility.
<P>
	The real gains for taxpayers, however, lie in the possibility of 
greater co-operation between the federal and provincial 
governments and the streamlining of revenue administration.
<P>
	We must also ensure that our social programs are affordable and 
sustainable into the future. The budget contains measures to 
provide secure, stable and growing funding for health, 
post-secondary education and social assistance.
<P>
	The Canada health and social transfer, CHST, introduced last 
year provides the provinces with enhanced flexibility to design and 
administer their own programs while safeguarding medicare and 
other social support.
<P>
	Since the cash component represents a sizeable part of total 
federal spending, we could not put our finances on a sustainable 
basis without reducing the transfers. That is why funding 
arrangements for 1996-97 and 1997-98 decline.
<P>
	Following consultations with the provinces, the 1996 budget 
now acts to extend the CHST but there are no further cuts. We have 
set out a five year schedule in which transfers grow and the cash 
component is stabilized and increases over time.
<P>
	The budget provides additional protection to the provinces. A 
new cash floor will guarantee cash transfers of at least $11 billion 
in all years. We also want to ensure that Canada's retirement 
income system will be there for Canadians when they need it.
<P>
	Over the next 30 years the number of seniors will more than 
double while the proportion of Canadians  working to support the 
pension system will decline. Recognizing the wide public concern 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1482"> 1482 </A></B>
<P>
over this situation, the Prime Minister has promised to protect the 
pensions of today's seniors.
<P>
	Beginning in 2001, a new seniors' benefit will replace the old 
age and guaranteed income benefits. The new benefit will be tax 
free and fully indexed to inflation. Those most in need will receive 
$120 more a year than under the current system. The vast majority 
of seniors will be as well or better off.
<P>
	Those 60 and older on December 31, 1995 can opt for the new 
system or the old one, whichever is more advantageous. The Prime 
Minister's commitment to our senior citizens will be met and 
surpassed.
<P>
	There will also be fairer, more affordable tax assistance for 
retirement savings. The government is committed to assisting 
individuals to save for their retirement. At the same time, our fiscal 
position calls for reasonable limits on the amount that can be saved 
with tax assistance.
<P>
	For this reason RRSP contribution limits will be frozen at 
$13,500 through to the year 2003 but then will increase to $15,500 
by the year 2005. These measures will affect only individuals 
earning over $75,000. Thus, individuals earning less will continue 
to be able to save up to the full 18 per cent of their earnings.
<P>
	This is consistent with the government's objective of directing 
tax assistance to the large population of modest and middle income 
Canadians. Because our younger population is facing different 
challenges we have eliminated the seven year limit on carrying 
forward unused RRSP contribution room.
<P>
	The budget also introduces improved tax treatment, new 
guidelines and better enforcement to ensure that adequate child 
support is paid regularly and on time to the custodial parent.
<P>
	We are now in a situation in which six out of ten children who 
live with lone parent mothers are living below Statistics Canada's 
low income cutoffs.
<P>
	The Thibaudeau case in the Supreme Court simply brought home 
what many had been saying for years. We have to make it simpler, 
faster and more efficient to get child support into the hands of the 
parents to the benefit of the children.
<P>
	The government consulted the Canadian public widely on this 
point. It became clear that few Canadians think it is right to tax 
child support as though it were the custodial parent's own income. 
Nor should the person paying the support receive a special tax 
break merely for performing the ordinary obligations of a parent.
<P>
	For this reason, child support will no longer be included in the 
taxable income of the custodial parent, nor will it be deductible to 
the payer. Custodial parents will no longer have to worry about 
setting aside a portion of the support they receive to pay taxes on 
the amounts  and payers of the support will not have to make high 
payments and then wait for the deduction at year's end.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	The working income supplement of the child tax benefit is 
intended to help low income parents meet the costs of things like 
transportation and child care when they go out to work. It can also 
help to compensate for the loss of certain material benefits which 
parents lose when they go off social assistance to enter the labour 
force.
<P>
	To encourage this type of initiative and to help low income 
families make the transition we are doubling the maximum annual 
benefit in two stages from its current level of $500 to $750 in 1997 
and $1,000 in 1998.
<P>
	When it is fully implemented, Canada's low income working 
families will have an extra $250 million annually to assist them 
with their child care expenses. About one-third of the families 
eligible for these benefits are single parents. We will thus be 
targeting what we have identified as a serious locus of child 
poverty.
<P>
	The government has taken a number of actions to reallocate 
funds to increase Canada's investment in youth, technology and 
trade, all very important areas to Canada's future. To encourage 
education for young Canadians an additional $165 million over 
three years is being funded by reallocating money from within the 
tax system. We are increasing the limits on education tax credits, 
the limit on the transfer of tuition in education credits and the limit 
on contributions to registered education savings plans.
<P>
	There will be more flexible child care expense deductions for 
low income parents who are in school or attending training 
programs.
<P>
	We are creating new employment opportunities for youth by 
reallocating budget savings. We will double the funds for student 
summer employment to $120 million this summer. We will 
increase support for programs like Internship Canada and Youth 
Services Canada to help young people who have left school to find 
employment opportunities.
<P>
	Canada is a nation at the cutting edge of high technology. To 
ensure our continued predominance in this field, the government is 
establishing the Technology Partnerships Canada. This new fund 
will encourage private sector investment in high technology 
products and processes and assist in technology diffusion. New 
equity capital will be made available to increase the lending efforts 
of the Business Development Bank in strategic growth sectors such 
as the new technology area.
<P>
	When this government took office it was charged with a double 
task: to address Canada's increasing fiscal burden without 
destroying the social fabric that has made this country one of the 
most 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1483"> 1483 </A></B>
<P>
admired in the world. We can achieve this only by ensuring the 
kind of economic  health that made our unique social system 
possible in the first place.
<P>
	The government has followed its jobs and growth agenda with 
one clear objective: to build an innovative economy that will mean 
prosperity for all Canadians. We are succeeding. Employment in 
the first quarter was up by 91,000, the largest quarterly growth in 
two years. The overall unemployment rate is down nearly two 
points from 11.1 per cent to 9.3 per cent. Interest rates are down 
and inflation is at its lowest level in 30 years.
<P>
	Let us give credit where credit is due: to the Canadian people for 
their resourcefulness in a difficult time, to the private sector for its 
willingness to partnership and to explore innovative ways of doing 
business and sharing and joining with government, and to the 
Minister of Finance for his sure and measured handling of our 
national finances.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
commend the member for her very clear message.
<P>
	There are two questions I would like to ask her. The first one 
centres on the child support payments and the changes there. I 
believe those changes will cause some concern across the country. 
The non-custodial parents who have contacted me are very 
concerned about something that is not mentioned in the proposed 
bill that will be coming forward, their visiting rights and access 
rights the courts grant them and which are not lived up to by the 
custodial parent.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member if she believes that the visiting and access 
rights should be linked with the child support payments.
<P>
	My other question is whether the member sees a danger in the 
rising debt inasmuch as the interest payments that we have to make 
on the debt are drawing away from the revenue dollars we need to 
support our social programs.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	When there is change there is anxiety about the change. It is true 
that people will call into a constituency office and say they are 
worried about the specifics of change which they think could 
adversely affect them immediately.
<P>
	The first thing we must say is that there will be clear material 
given to people so they may understand the changes coming. With 
this budget we put out a special tax booklet identifying all the 
questions and answers relating to the changes in support payments.
<P>
	We did another interesting thing relating to Revenue Canada. We 
allowed Revenue Canada, after the request from the Justice 
Department, to get information necessary to enforce payments of 
delinquent supporters. I believe this measure will go a long way.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that Revenue Canada will not be releasing 
addresses to individuals requesting that information. However, we 
have done something to help with enforcement.
<P>
	The changes we are talking about do not relate to visitation 
rights. That is not what we are talking about here. We are talking 
about tax treatment, a tax policy that will be implemented through 
the self-assessment process at Revenue Canada, which is the most 
successful in the world. Canadian taxpayers are honest for the most 
part. We are hoping to enhance the livelihood and to help with the 
real economic needs of children in homes where money is due to 
them from a non-custodial parent. We are changing the tax 
treatment to make it more efficient, more simple and faster. There 
will be concerns.
<P>
	As a government we will spend money to assist in the 
administrative changes necessary. I can assure the House that the 
changes were necessary and were done after massive consultations. 
Members of the government crossed the country over a year ago 
asking for input from custodial parents. We got the input and we 
listened. Finally, after nearly a half a century of one system we are 
about to change and modernize our laws.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate on the recent budget tabled by the 
Minister of Finance. We would have preferred to comment on a 
budget showing the government's determination to be more 
effective and to reduce its size and its non-productive interference. 
However, this is not the case.
<P>
	We would have liked a budget showing that the government has 
a minimum of compassion and is sensitive to the plight of our 1.4 
million fellow citizens who are jobless and who realize every day 
that the election promises of ``jobs, jobs, jobs'' were nothing but 
empty words. Unfortunately, there is no compassion for the 
unemployed in this budget.
<P>
	We would have liked a budget showing that the government got 
the message that we, on this side of the House, have been 
conveying to it for two and a half years by reminding it of the 
urgent need to restore justice and tax fairness for overburdened 
average taxpayers, while companies avoid paying taxes on record 
profits. Again, this is unfortunately not the case.
<P>
	We would have liked a budget showing that the federal 
government had finally decided to put its house in order, instead of 
resorting to the easier solution of leaving to others the 
responsibility of taking real measures by dumping its deficit onto 
the provinces. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The budget that 
we have to comment on is not of the courageous type. What the 
Minister of Finance has tabled is in fact a non-budget. It is a kind of 
economic statement on the country's financial situation, in which 
everything is explained by magic, that is as a  percentage of the 
GDP, rather than by using actual figures. It is an economic 
statement which does not propose any real and effective measure to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1484"> 1484 </A></B>
<P>
face the problems that confront us and that can be summarized in 
very simple and concrete terms: 1.4 million unemployed and a debt 
of $600 billion.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Expressing reality in hard figures, rather than projecting it 
through the rose coloured filter of percentages of GDP, is harsher, 
as well as less savvy from the political point of view. Harsher, 
because behind these real figures are real human beings, people 
who each and every day face the hard reality, real problems, and 
people who are getting more and more worried.
<P>
	It is very sad to realize that a sizeable number of our fellow 
citizens are no longer concerned by government administration, 
have lost their illusions, can no longer relate to all of the 
contradictions coming from this government, contradictions 
raining down on their heads every day about administration, 
taxation, social services, as well as constitutional matters.
<P>
	Understandably so. This government had promised 
employment-remember the red book refrain of jobs, jobs, 
jobs-and held out great hopes, for young people in particular. But 
their imagination dried up after they came up with the red book 
slogan. There had been a government promise to do away with the 
GST. The Prime Minister said he was going to scrap it, and the 
Deputy Prime Minister said she would resign if that was not done. 
This government's imagination was hard pressed to find the most 
effective means of trying to say what had not been said, and of 
convincing people that they had not heard correctly.
<P>
	What people were meant to hear was not that the GST would 
disappear. What they were meant to understand was that, in light of 
the present economic situation, and in order to keep the deficit at 3 
per cent of the GDP, the GST would have to be harmonized by 
adding the provincial taxes to it. That is what the members of the 
government would now like people to have understood, although 
their main campaign slogan was something quite different.
<P>
	Strangely enough, today the Minister of Finance is using the 
same expressions, when speaking on the GST, as the Conservatives 
used during the election campaign. Within two and a half years, 
then, our Liberal friends have, in addition to reneging on their 
promise, espoused the same position as the Conservatives, a 
position they had so emphatically decried. The government does 
the opposite of what it says; no wonder our fellow citizens have so 
little confidence in their political leaders.
<P>
	Another one of this government's contradictions is its 
commitment to streamline the federal bureaucracy and make it 
more productive. They promised the people they would cut fat in 
order to preserve social programs. What  the government is saying 
in this year's budget is that there is no more fat to be cut in the 
bureaucracy, when most of our fellow citizens feel that the federal 
government is living high off the hog.
<P>
	In fact, as the finance minister's figures confirm, the real budget 
savings will amount to 0.0 per cent in 1996-97-which is nothing 
to write home about-and to around 0.2 per cent in 1997-98. We 
can only conclude that the government feels there is no more to be 
done in its own backyard and has given up on the greater challenge 
of reducing the size of the public service. It is, of course, easier to 
take over the UI fund, cut transfer payments to the provinces, and 
let others deal with the problems.
<P>
	The government has brought down a budget with few real 
measures to stimulate the economy. Yet this budget clearly shows 
the government's inability to resolve three nation wide problems: 
the employment crisis, the debt crisis and the constitutional crisis.
<P>
	This budget contains no concrete measures for the jobless. The 
government boasts about injecting another $60 million into the 
summer student employment program and investing $150 million 
in the technological innovation fund.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	It forgot to mention that what it gives with one hand, it had taken 
away several times with the other. It cut post-secondary education 
by $150 million plus another $300 million in 1997-98. In the 
1995-96 budget, it cut $32 million from research and development 
for the Canadian Space Agency, $65 million from the three 
granting councils, and $11 million from the National Research 
Council. Those are the facts.
<P>
	The government fails to provide tax incentives to promote job 
creation, helps itself to the UI fund instead of lowering premiums, 
and cuts benefits to workers' venture capital corporations whose 
sole purpose is to create and maintain jobs by investing in small 
and medium size businesses. This budget does not stimulate 
employment, it stifles job creation.
<P>
	This budget does not contain any new government debt or deficit 
reduction initiative. Instead of putting its own house in order, the 
government is shovelling its problems into the neighbours' 
backyards. The provinces end up having to bear the brunt of the 
federal deficit reduction effort. While the federal debt has grown 
by $133 billion since the Liberal took office, tax shelters remain 
and unnecessary spending continues, including outrageous military 
spending.
<P>
	Finally, this budget increases federal government's interference 
in areas of jurisdiction that are not its own, which is where the very 
essence of the constitutional crisis in Canada rests. Instead of 
showing goodwill and withdrawing from areas of provincial 
jurisdiction, the government is devising new initiatives to interfere 
even  further while continuing to spend and getting deeper and 
deeper into debt. Three new angles has been found to undermine 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1485"> 1485 </A></B>
<P>
provinces' autonomy, namely the health research fund, the Canada 
revenue commission and the Canadian securities commission.
<P>
	This is how, after tabling three budgets, this government has lost 
any credibility it may have had. It had promised to eliminate the 
GST, to create jobs, and to steer clear of constitutional matters. It 
has reneged on its promise in every instance. The people of Quebec 
and Canada can no longer trust this government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I heard 
the hon. member say in her speech that jobs had not been created.
<P>
	It always amazes me when opposition members talk that way. 
All they have to do is get a copy of a report by Statistics Canada 
and they can see that well over 500,000 new jobs have been created 
since the last election. In fact, for the last quarter, just about every 
month there has been new job creation in Canada.
<P>
	Second, long ago the province of Quebec harmonized with the 
GST. I will tell the House why this is a good thing for Quebec and 
Canada and how governments should co-operate and work 
together. Manufacturers in the province of Quebec have the ability 
not to include retail sales taxes in the sale of manufactured goods 
for export. Quebec was clever enough to notice the advantages of 
harmonizing the GST.
<P>
	Unfortunately my province of Ontario does not see that. Where I 
live General Motors is a major manufacturer. The manufacture of 
automobiles in Ontario includes a certain element of retail sales 
tax. That gives Quebec a tactical advantage over Ontario in the 
export of automobiles to the North American market.
<P>
	I would like to suggest to the member that rather than attacking 
some of the advantages of harmonization, she should be applauding 
the government for its foresight in trying to apply the 
harmonization method that has been used in Quebec across the rest 
of this country.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to suggest that if she contacts Statistics 
Canada it will tell her the net new job growth on a month to month 
basis. She will see that we have been very successful in creating 
new jobs in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Madam Speaker, I will repeat what I said when 
responding to the speech from the Throne.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	In this budget, taxpayers expected the government to take 
important measures to get its finances in order and create jobs. 
Given that 1.4 million people are out of work, the Minister of 
Finance could have shown a  minimum of compassion by 
introducing job creation initiatives. This is what matters at this 
point in time.
<P>
	I am not an expert in the fields of finance and economy, but I do 
know, like everyone else, that when people have jobs, they pay 
taxes and that helps the economy. Putting people to work might 
help reduce the deficit. However, as long as the government keeps 
trying to cut here and there, particularly at the expense of the poor 
and of the unemployed who truly need help to find work, it will not 
succeed in promoting economic recovery.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as official opposition critic for heritage and cultural 
industries, I cannot stop myself from referring to the throne speech 
in my response to the budget speech.
<P>
	What is written in the conclusion to the throne speech must be 
noted as something of great importance to the cultural industries, 
``Culture is at the core of our identity as Canadians. The 
Government is committed to strong Canadian cultural industries''. 
This speech also confirms the government's desire to ensure the 
viability of the CBC, the National Film Board and Telefilm 
Canada. The statements of principle in the Minister of Finance's 
speech are, however, unequivocal. The Liberals want to reduce 
expenditures, while at the same time encouraging improved job 
prospects. Such a contradiction! Regrowth and reducing 
expenditures in the same breath. They claim to have a strategy 
which works via reallocation.
<P>
	Let us be serious now. Contradictions do not belong in 
administration. The Liberals are full of great statements of intent, 
which we all know very well they have no intention of putting into 
practice. This government's sole objective is to make cuts, and its 
true cultural policy is to make cuts in culture. With a policy applied 
to strategic sectors that is threatening social cohesion through 
massive budget cuts, and threatening economic growth through a 
systematic layoff policy, we cannot look at the future with any 
hope.
<P>
	Yet, if there is one sector that is strategic for maintaining 
cohesion and social equilibrium in Canada and in Quebec, it is 
culture. And what is this government doing? In the Liberal Party of 
Canada's budget, national cultural institutions are facing cuts of 9.7 
per cent. Telefilm Canada, the NFB and the National Archives are 
the most affected, moreover. Let us take an example. The CBC 
alone is being hit the hardest, with cuts of $102 million between 
fiscal 1995-96 and fiscal 1996-97. According to Mr. Beatty, its 
president, there will be additional cuts of $48 million.
<P>
	Telefilm Canada will face cuts of $19 million in the upcoming 
fiscal year just when it is looking at the possibility of going 
multimedia. The National Film Board alone will be hit with cuts of 
$10 million on top of the $16 million cuts in the 1994-95 budget.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1486"> 1486 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	The National Archives will be cut by $11 million. Publishing 
support programs will be cut by $14 million, and the heritage and 
cultural development program will cut by $22 million in the 
coming fiscal year. Contributions to the cultural infrastructures 
project will be cut by 69 per cent in 1996-97, on top of the 44 per 
cent in 1995-96. This is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	I ask this House if this the expression of a desire to develop 
cultural industries in Quebec and Canada. How can the Liberals 
claim to be promoting job creation with such cuts? How do we 
assure the long term viability of the CBC, the NFB and Telefilm 
Canada? When the government systematically cuts the operating 
budgets of these organizations, there is no guarantee of a future.
<P>
	When everyone knows the importance of our cultural 
institutions, how do we convince the government that it is heading 
in the wrong direction? This lack of political will to develop the 
cultural industries is having a dramatic impact, let us face the facts, 
on lost jobs.
<P>
	The $227 million cut from the CBC since 1995 represents 2,400 
lost jobs, and the forecast cuts of $150 million between 1996 and 
1999 will mean another 2,500 positions, making a total of 4,900 
jobs lost in the years the government is giving expression to its 
alleged intention to develop Canada's cultural industries.
<P>
	Such job losses have a significant impact on the cultural fabric of 
society in Quebec and Canada. Culture is made up of real people: 
actors, screenwriters, authors, musicians, performers, composers, 
model makers, make-up artists, costume designers, scenic artists, 
and others. They are the raw material of cultural creation and 
production. The very essence of our identity could be ruined and 
driven to despair by this Liberal government's extensive cuts and 
lack of strategy, vision and policy in cultural matters.
<P>
	The prospect of an Anglo-American culture threatens our 
culture, as everyone knows. The Canadian Minister of Finance's 
budget is a major culprit, as it jeopardizes the very existence of our 
cultural industries.
<P>
	That is one of the reasons why the Government of Quebec claims 
full responsibility for the management of its share of the federal 
funds allocated to cultural industries. The federal government's 
estimates for heritage and cultural industries directly threaten all of 
us as a culture. In these circumstances, the Bloc Quebecois, as the 
official opposition, urges Ottawa to withdraw from the whole area 
of culture and communications. While the Government of Quebec 
was increasing its contribution to cultural funding by 4 per cent a 
year and its share of all public expenditures affecting Quebec 
culture from 32 to 37 per cent, the federal government's 
contribution fell from 45 per cent in 1989-90 to 34 per cent five 
years later.
<P>
	According to Louise Beaudoin, Quebec's Minister of Culture 
and Communications and Minister responsible for the 
Administration of the Charter of the French Language, although 
Quebec makes the greatest effort in Canada, it is not enough to 
compensate for the federal government's gradual withdrawal from 
culture. It is certainly logical.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	At a time when Quebec is taking action and increasing its 
budgets to ensure the viability and development of its culture, the 
federal government continues to withdraw and to cut funding. The 
Government of Quebec has no use for the more or less political 
goals pursued by the Department of Canadian Heritage through the 
distribution of millions of flags. At a time when everything is being 
cut, they suddenly found $17 million and hired 10 full time 
telephone operators to handle callers who want the flags promised 
to them by some deputy minister. As we speak, at a time when 
everybody is being hit by budget cuts, including those who create 
our culture, who guarantee our identity and development, they have 
just spent close to $7 million.
<P>
	Meanwhile, on the other side of the Ottawa River, the federal 
government plans to reduce the funds spent on culture, something 
that would greatly compromise our cultural future.
<P>
	In closing, this budget shows once again the government's 
inconsistency and lack of vision and respect for Quebec culture. 
We must, however, admit that the federal Liberal government is 
true to itself, making and breaking its own promises as it pleases.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
our friend opposite said about protecting culture is most 
interesting. A question comes to mind however: What culture is 
that? The Canadian culture, which includes the Quebec culture? Or 
are all cultures lumped into one?
<P>
	I think the best way to protect a culture, a language or a people, 
as our friends opposite would say, is through the Canadian 
government, the federal government, as opposed to the provincial 
level of government. The measures we have adopted in this budget 
are but one way of ensuring that a typically Canadian culture is 
preserved, so to speak.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> That is blackmail.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Blackmail yourself, Madam. Let me speak.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I understand that the debate 
could excite emotions and even convictions, but I nevertheless ask 
the co-operation of the House in please addressing the Chair when 
making remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Mr. Speaker, the opposition keeps attacking 
the budget put forth by our government by using intimidation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1487"> 1487 </A></B>
<P>
regarding the culture preservation  issue. As I said before, as did 
several other speakers, the budget has put in place measures to 
ensure that funds are available to preserve our culture as weknow it.
<P>
	The fact remains that culture-perhaps the opposition will 
disagree-is something that evolves. There is no such thing as an 
unchanging culture. It grows and gets better over time.
<P>
	Moving to other budget issues raised by the hon. member, the 
preservation of our social programs and the sacrifices that had to be 
made in the system we have enjoyed in Canada, we can be thankful 
for the measures that we have taken as a government to ensure that 
sufficient funding will be available to continue preserving the 
French language across Canada and preserving French language 
programming across Canada. The survival of the French-Canadian 
language and culture in Canada is guaranteed through the measures 
put forward in this House by the Minister of Finance to ensure that 
funds will be available.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder on 
which planet the hon. member for Saint-Denis lives, given what 
she said about subsidies being given to French speaking 
communities everywhere. She should reread this blue document 
called the budget. She will realize that there are cuts, year after 
year, and that the assimilation rate keeps growing. It is time the 
hon. member woke up.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member claims that her government provides many 
good things in its budget for culture. Let me just remind her of a 
few facts which she does not appear to have figured out: the CBC, 
cuts totalling $150 million and close to 5,000 jobs eliminated; 
Telefilm Canada, cuts of $19 million; the National Film Board, cuts 
of $10 million; the National Archives, cuts of $11 million; the 
writing and publications program-books are important, our 
authors tell our story-cuts of $14 million; heritage programs, 
cultural development, cuts of $22 million.
<P>
	Please, wake up. These are cuts, not support. These are cuts and 
when cuts are made, it results in a reduction, not an increase, in 
production and in the number of jobs.
<P>
	It is time to wake up and realize that the budget tabled in this 
House does not promote cultural development and does not in any 
way support one of the main recommendations made in the Juneau 
report, which provides that we should not only ensure the 
recognition of our cultural institutions such as the CBC, Telefilm 
and the National Film Board, but also their long term funding. Not 
only does this budget not follow up on these recommendations, 
which have gained unanimous support, but it also cuts everywhere, 
thus creating losses of jobs and services, while jeopardizing 
cultural development as a whole.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Vancouver South, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to the budget which was 
introduced by my hon. colleague, the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	There has been much discussion both in the House and in the 
homes of Canadians since the budget was brought down in early 
March. The overwhelming consensus is that truly this is an 
outstanding budget. Editorials from St. John's to Vancouver have 
hailed it as a major step forward in the fight against the deficit and 
to protect social programs. I know the Reform members would not 
know much about social programs.
<P>
	Let us look at the economic and fiscal framework in which the 
budget is presented. We should take a moment to recognize the 
achievements of this minister. First of all, his tenure in the finance 
portfolio has been marked by a measured, balanced and disciplined 
action.
<P>
	Let me just repeat for some of my colleagues that this is a 
balanced and measured approach. I know some members would say 
that we have to cut and chop everything out of government. 
However, Canadians see that the position the government and the 
minister have taken to have a balanced approach. An approach 
where we deal with the deficit on a year by year basis is the right 
approach, instead of ignoring the problem which some of our 
members would like to do. Other members would like to slash and 
burn. As Liberals we know that is not the right way.
<P>
	When the Liberals took office, the country's finances were in a 
disastrous state. There was no vision and no plan. Under the 
finance minister's stewardship, the government has worked with 
Canadians to craft a sound economic vision for the future.
<P>
	The Liberals realize that the deficit, employment, economic 
growth, inflation and taxation are all interrelated. That is why we 
need a sound economic vision for the future of our country. That is 
why the budgets have been structured with an integrated economic 
framework.
<P>
	Just two and a half years after the Liberals assumed office the 
outlook for Canada is much brighter. The results of the fiscal 
framework are the following.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	For example, short term interest rates have fallen by three 
percentage points in the last year alone. Imagine how much money 
Canadians are saving. People who have mortgages, people who 
finance their automobiles are saving a lot because short term 
interest rates have dropped. Something which I did not think would 
happen has happened. Overnight, interest rates are now lower than 
those in the U.S. This is a sign that the markets have confidence in 
this government and its economic policies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1488"> 1488 </A></B>
<P>
	In the last 13 months 263,000 jobs have been created. Since 
1993 some 600,000 jobs have been created in the Canadian 
economy. Inflation is the lowest it has been in 30 years, reflecting 
solid productivity growth and virtual absence of cost pressures.
<P>
	Let us compare Canada to other countries. On an international 
basis relative to other G-7 countries, our finances appear to be on a 
sound footing. Our financial requirements, deficit to GDP, our rate 
of inflation and unit labour costs are all looking good when we 
compare them to the G-7 countries. Of course, we cannot rest on 
our laurels for there is still work to be done but these numbers are 
sure signs that progress is evident.
<P>
	We have seen in the international community how much more 
confidence there is by looking at interest rates, by looking at the 
targets we have met. So far we have been able to meet and do better 
on every target. The international community has a tremendous 
amount of confidence in us for when we say we will deal with the 
deficit we do, not through words but by action.
<P>
	This budget represents another important part of our coherent 
and integrated plan to modernize government and to put in place 
the fiscal ingredients for a prosperous Canadian economy.
<P>
	The major thrust of the budget is the future. Specifically, it 
speaks to our future by restoring health to public finances, defining 
a more appropriate role for the federal government in today's 
economy and federation, and by taking direct action to secure 
social programs for the future. It is very important to emphasize 
that we are taking direct action to secure our social programs, 
laying out a plan to restore confidence in our public pension 
system.
<P>
	As the finance minister indicated in his budget speech on March 
6, this budget is about addressing problems before they arise. It is 
about managing ahead and continuing to put in place new building 
blocks for security and prosperity. This is important because as we 
know we are in an age where social and economic transformation is 
occurring at a frightening speed.
<P>
	Looking at the budget we can recognize the change that is 
coming in our society, the roles that information and technology 
are playing. That is why we are investing in those areas. That is 
why we are investing in our young people who are getting involved 
in helping small businesses take advantage of the information 
technology.
<P>
	In British Columbia young people are working with small 
businesses. We as a government along with the private sector have 
said that we need to make sure that small businesses take advantage 
of the existing technology. That is why we are trying to bring our 
youth and small business together on programs that will take 
advantage of the information technologies.
<P>
	That is why Canadians have given this budget glowing reviews. 
It minimizes the uncertainty of our future by simultaneously 
creating economic opportunity and safeguarding our cherished 
social programs.
<P>
	British Columbians are very satisfied with the budget. I want to 
take this opportunity to explain why this budget is a good one for 
British Columbia.
<P>
	Many of the Reformers are very supportive of this budget, 
particularly on our success in dealing with the deficit. Reformers 
have to understand that this government will not gut our social 
programs like they would do, nor would we destroy our cultural 
industries like Reformers would do. We will continue to ensure that 
we have social programs and that we support our cultural industries 
as this budget does.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	The reaction in my home province and in my riding has been 
overwhelmingly positive. That is why the Liberals are over 50 per 
cent in the polls in British Columbia and Reformers are down to 20 
per cent or less in British Columbia. They only have one issue and 
that is the deficit and it is no longer an issue because we have 
broken the back of the deficit. They are looking for other issues all 
the time and are unable to find them.
<P>
	There are three or four issues which are near and dear to the 
hearts of the citizens of my province and the people of my riding. 
We all know the figures by now so there is no need to reiterate 
them. Perhaps we should ask why our success in reducing the 
deficit is important. There is a link between deficits and our goal of 
jobs and growth. That is our ultimate goal, jobs and growth. We 
want to create an environment where the private sector can create 
those jobs and growth.
<P>
	Pursuing a lower deficit helps to keep our inflation and our 
interest rates low. Low inflation helps to smooth the bumps of the 
boom and bust economic cycle. It also helps to keep interest rates 
low. Low interest rates in turn help to stimulate demand in interest 
sensitive industries, foster high levels of investment and keep 
Canada competitive relative to our global competitors.
<P>
	We have started this process of fiscal recovery. By doing this we 
can eventually attack the debt, and we will attack the debt, which as 
we all know consumes more than one-third of federal revenues. For 
the first time in decades, British Columbians know that when the 
finance minister says he will balance the books there is real 
substance behind the promise.
<P>
	This budget speaks volumes about the differences that exist 
between this government and other parties in the House. The 
Liberals are a true national party which effectively represents all 
Canada's regions and people across the political spectrum.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party say theirs is a national party but 
we have not seen that. In every byelection the  Reform Party has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1489"> 1489 </A></B>
<P>
not been able to prove it is a national party. It has been a disaster. In 
not one of the byelections was the Reform Party able to make any 
substantial effort or win any seats. Reformers have a long way to go 
to prove it.
<P>
	The Liberals are a true national party which effectively represent 
all of Canada's regions and people across the political spectrum. 
We do this by providing government that is open, honest, forthright 
and rational. We recognize there is a fundamental need to change 
the way government works. We have not retreated from the task of 
bringing Canada into the 21st century. Instead we have 
enthusiastically embraced this challenge by recognizing that 
difficult decisions must be made.
<P>
	In making these decisions we have found the balance between 
retrenchment and social justice. We have shown Canadians and 
indeed people around the world that it is possible to protect the 
social safety net while restoring integrity to our nation's finances.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
ask the member a very short, directly answerable question. I would 
like to place a bet with you, Mr. Speaker, that he will not answer it. 
I cannot do that, I am sorry.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I have been known to take a 
flyer or two on a few tips but I do not think we should engage in 
that sort of game.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> My apologies, Mr. Speaker. We will have to see how 
this speculation ends.
<P>
	The hon. member knows a lot about business. If he were the 
chief executive officer of a corporation and when he took over the 
debt in that corporation was around $40 million and after four years 
it had grown to $50 million, would he be applauded by the 
shareholders? I would like the hon. member to give me a yes or no 
answer and I think he will not.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member is concerned 
about direct answers he should talk to his leader. The last time I 
asked him a direct question about his party's stand on the turban 
issue with the RCMP, the leader of the Reform Party refused to 
answer. I am glad that some of the members have now brought this 
forward as an issue and they may deal with it at the next 
convention. If the member wants a direct answer he should start by 
talking to his leader so that he does give a direct answer when he is 
asked a question in the House.
<P>
	In terms of corporations let me say that government is not a 
corporation. Some members of the Reform Party have to learn that 
you cannot try to compare a corporation with government. In 
government we are dealing with people. We are not dealing with 
the bottom line.
<P>
	It used to be said that what is good for GM is good for this 
country. We have learned that sometimes what is good for 
corporations is not good for the general population. It is not good 
for Canadians. We are ensuring that we have a vision for the long 
term for our future generations, for our children, our grandchildren 
and their grandchildren. We do not look at just the bottom line. We 
look at our future to make sure that we have a quality of life we can 
be proud of and we can tell our future generations that we worked 
toward that. We cannot compare a corporation and government.
<P>
	We are concerned with the debt. The first thing we said as a 
government was that we were going to deal with the deficit. We 
cannot deal with the debt unless we deal with the deficit. We have 
put forward a constructive program to deal with the deficit. The 
international community knows that when we say we are going to 
deal with it we are dealing with it.
<P>
	Once we have dealt with the deficit the next step obviously is to 
deal with the debt. We will be dealing with it but we have to do it in 
a balanced, rational and a measured approach so that we ensure we 
are sensitive to the human dimension of cutting deficits and cutting 
budgets. The way we are doing it will be seen in history as the right 
way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since this 
government has come into office and as a result of the budgets the 
finance minister has put forth so far the debt will increase by about 
$120 billion. The debt is ever increasing with no sign of that 
increase ending.
<P>
	The government has made some cuts in spending but those cuts 
have been more than lost due to increases in the interest payments 
it takes to service the debt. The only reason deficits are decreasing 
in the projections is due to increased revenue, more money brought 
in by this government from taxpayers. Is this situation satisfactory 
to the member?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Mr. Speaker, first let me correct the facts. For 
every seven dollars cut there is only one dollar on the revenue side 
in action taken by the government. We have cut seven dollars for 
every one dollar of revenue whether it is through fees or in some 
other way. It is not accurate to say that most of the changes came 
about as a result of a change to the revenue side.
<P>
	The approach this government has taken has not been to cut 
everything by 10 per cent or 20 per cent. We said let us look at 
government and see where we can improve, where we need to cut 
and where we need to add. Let us see where we need to add more 
money to government so that we have a core government, that we 
have an efficient government and we have a government that is 
working for the people of this country and not just a straight 
percentage cut everywhere. That is why we looked at the priorities 
of what is important for Canadians before we made the changes 
that we did in the budget.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1490"> 1490 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Mississauga East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in less than a single full term in office this government has 
managed to cut the national deficit by $20 billion and at the same 
time cut the unemployment rate by a full two percentage points.
<P>
	Canadians can have more confidence in how they are governed 
now that they have a Minister of Finance who sets and reaches 
ambitious fiscal goals without the destructive consequences of 
public service walkouts or wholesale elimination of service. 
Successes come from abandoning the failed policies of 
governments past.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	A sixty per cent cut in subsidies to business was born from the 
realization that little can be gained by collecting taxes from 
business with the sole purpose of redirecting the same dollars to the 
same businesses through subsidies and grants. We have learned that 
the value of targeting funds is small and more than offset by the 
consequences of increased taxation, administrative overhead and 
the cost to business of hiring consultants and lobbyists to apply for 
grants.
<P>
	It was a typical case in the previous regime that $100 would be 
taxed away from an industry with $1 or $2 spent in the collection 
process, as much as $20 more spent on grant administration and the 
remaining $78 dollars would be handed out to business as a great 
gift. However, $15 had already been spent by business trying to get 
its tax money back by hiring consultants and applying for grants.
<P>
	At the end of the rinse cycle industry would be about 35 per cent 
better off had the government just stayed away. We have done away 
with tax and grant government. We no longer believe that the role 
of government is to seize and reinvest the earnings of private 
corporations.
<P>
	Rarely has economic success ever been built on temporary 
grants and subsidies. It is true the odd business may be lured to set 
up a factory by the promise of grants, tax credits or some other 
concession paid for by the local businesses. It is also true that often 
these factories vanish as soon as the locks get changed at the house 
of the free money.
<P>
	Government grants impose a psychology on business that slows 
sustainable job creation as entrepreneurs wait for handouts rather 
than accept private sector funding under market conditions. It is not 
rare to hear of a small business owner planning an expansion which 
might create 100 jobs. Typically the entrepreneur could find the 
money needed from private resources or a bank or venture 
capitalist, but then the prospect of the government grant would get 
in the way.
<P>
	The entrepreneur would start spending his time visiting 
bureaucrats, filling out forms, preparing his case. Pretty soon he 
would get frustrated and hire a consultant who specialized in 
positioning companies for grants. The  process would drag on for 
months. A hundred people were still out of work but our 
entrepreneur would sense the competition. If he did not get a grant 
his competitor might then be able to undercut his price. He would 
have to press on. More months would pass with still no word, still 
more consulting fees, still no jobs created.
<P>
	Finally there would be a sigh of relief with rejection letters from 
all granting agencies. Now our entrepreneur could actually carry on 
his business, creating jobs by using private sector resources for 
private sector results.
<P>
	Many forms of subsidy will remain in selected fields and to 
support exports. Generally business is being freed of having to 
apply to government for funds to stay competitive. 
Overwhelmingly the government is being reduced to a level that 
can actually be understood by citizens who are too busy working 
and paying taxes to study every branch or tentacle funded by their 
tax dollars.
<P>
	The confidence the public has shown in the government and the 
Minister of Finance arises from our efforts to limit government to 
its original and irreproachable aims. In 1997-98 total program 
spending will fall to about $106 billion. Fifty-four per cent of this 
spending will go to seniors, the unemployed and to the provinces to 
support education, health and other social programs. Business 
subsidies by contrast will account for barely one and one-half per 
cent of program spending.
<P>
	By the conclusion of our first term in office, the taxpayer will be 
comforted to know that fewer and fewer hard earned tax dollars are 
leaking away from the core of government's role. Government will 
soon be able to say it is doing only what it does best which no one 
else will do.
<P>
	Our role is largely to redistribute cash to help seniors, the 
unemployed, low income earners, provinces with smaller per 
capita tax bases as well as support our national medicare system 
and affordable post-secondary education.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	Some have criticized these programs, saying their home 
province is spending more than it receives, say from the 
employment insurance plan. This plan is about people, not about 
provinces. It is intended to treat individuals fairly according to the 
unemployment levels they face where they live.
<P>
	Politicians in wealthier provinces who protest relief going to 
people in need in other provinces represent a view of the country 
shared by Lucien Bouchard, always calculating their share, 
discounting what they receive, focusing on any area where they pay 
more than they get back and never viewing Canadians as equal 
members of a single nature who have a long history of helping each 
other through hard times.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1491"> 1491 </A></B>
<P>
	This 1996 budget does not give in to regional parochialism or 
selfishness. It preserves the Canadian sense of community by 
sustaining our social fabric while finding necessary savings in 
subsidies, administration and by closing tax loopholes.
<P>
	In short, we have reduced Canada's deficit without reducing 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have been in the House for a while now listening to 
some of the Liberal members who spoke. I have to admit that most 
of what they say sounds like it has been written by a speech writer 
in an office tower who is totally unattached to Canadian reality.
<P>
	There is an occasional paragraph in some of the speeches where 
a few words have been added, but most of it sounds like pure 
political drivel by someone in the finance department trying to 
justify a rather uninspiring budget with accolades that are not 
shared by Canadians and which do not reflect the response Liberal 
members are getting from their constituents.
<P>
	When looking at the budget we begin to see there are perhaps 
some changes coming for old age pensions and for CPP. There are 
some signs that perhaps the Liberals will not keep their promises. 
Liberals are great for not keeping their promises. They changed 
their minds on the free trade agreement. They said it was terrible 
and now they support the free trade agreement.
<P>
	They said some things about the GST and they have been back 
pedalling awfully hard on that one. Why should Canadians believe 
one thing these Liberals are saying?
<P>
	I believe that because of the fiscal mismanagement of the 
country, one day the Liberals will have to get up in the House and 
say: ``Sorry, old age pensioners, you will lose your old age pension 
even if you are low income''. They will say: ``Sorry, we 
mismanaged your CPP funds and you will lose them. We meant to 
tell you sooner, but we just did not get around to it''. They will tell 
our young people: ``Sorry, we have to raise your taxes. We did not 
do things quite right in the past. It just kind of crept up on us. We 
did not mean it to happen. That is the reality of the times''.
<P>
	Our debt is increasing at an enormous rate. In spite of all the 
drivel we hear from the Liberal members, the truth is our debt has 
increased by almost $100 billion since the Liberals took over and 
the interest payments on the debt are approaching $50 billion every 
year. This from a government that only gets a little over $100 
billion in revenue each year and is spending about $160 billion 
each year. It is atrocious. It is terrible.
<P>
	I wish the Liberals would come to their senses and recognize the 
seriousness of the situation and be prepared to do something 
constructive about it before they lose all of the so-called social 
safety nets they claim to be the champions of. It will be the Liberals 
who will  destroy all of our social safety nets by pretending there is 
nothing wrong with their budgets or with the ongoing deficits they 
have been ringing up not only in this decade but in previous 
decades to the tune of almost $600 billion to date.
<P>
	I had to get that off my chest because I am extremely upset that 
they would mislead the Canadian people by letting them think 
everything is okay.
<P>
	I want to direct most of my speech today to the agricultural 
perspective of the budget. As agriculture critic I am very concerned 
about what the budget states with regard to agricultural issues. 
There are a few issues that need to be discussed today.
<P>
	There was a formal announcement in the budget of the 
government selling off 13,000 grain hopper cars. This was not 
much of a surprise because it had been discussed and the 
government's intention had been made known before the budget 
was release. It became very clear the government was prepared to 
go ahead when the budget was released in March.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	The so-called SEO group, the senior executive officers, made up 
of executives of the railways, elevators and other key players in the 
grain industry was set up last year by the federal government to 
develop a set of recommendations regarding future grain 
transportation systems in western Canada. In its set of 
recommendations to the Department of Transport and Department 
of Agriculture and Agri-Food last fall, the disposal of the hopper 
car fleet was considered. The railways would purchase these 
13,000 cars on the condition that they be used to transport western 
grain. The cars would be sold for $100 million and the purchase 
cost would be recovered over five years through an approximate 
one dollar a tonne rate increase in transporting grains.
<P>
	This all seems to be going down the drain. The recommendations 
for the car disposition seems to be derailed and any idea that the 
railways will be receiving the cars is very slim at the current time, 
which is not necessarily bad. Subsequently, a coalition of farm 
groups has banded together to develop proposals to buy the hopper 
cars. The primary objective of the coalition is that all 13,000 cars 
be sold together, that they be operated as a common fleet and that 
the first priority of use will be moving western Canadian 
agriculture products.
<P>
	Members of the producer coalition have been critical of the 
federal government, suggesting it is difficult to develop a business 
plan or arrange financing until they know what the selling price of 
the cars will be.
<P>
	I might use the illustration of a used car salesman. If any 
member of the House was to buy a used car and went to a used car 
lot, they would see a car and would ask the salesman the price of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1492"> 1492 </A></B>
<P>
the car. Our used car salesman, the minister of agriculture, said he 
wants to sell his used hopper cars to Canadian farmers but that 
there is one  little catch, he will not tell them the price of these 
hopper cars. He wants the farmers to put together the financing by 
going to the Farm Credit Corporation or some leasing company and 
make all the arrangements and then he will finally get around to 
talking price a ways down the road.
<P>
	We have heard of some pretty shady used car salesmen in the 
past but I certainly do not think farmers appreciate the used hopper 
car sales approach that is being used by the minister of agriculture.
<P>
	In the budget the Liberals laid out a proposal that was far from 
specific and raised more questions than it answered: ``The 
government will examine proposals for the acquisition of the cars, 
taking into account the interests of producers, shippers and 
railways and the need to make the most efficient use of the cars. 
The Minister of Transport will be authorized to adjust regulated 
freight rates effective August 1, 1998 by 75 cents per tonne on 
average to cover the cost of the acquisition''.
<P>
	Shortly after this announcement it was reported that the 
government was looking for somewhere in the neighbourhood of 
$250 million for the cars. However, this was only a rumour. There 
was no substantiation and no firm proposals put forward. There 
was no explanation as to how long the 75 cent per tonne surcharge 
would remain. There was no explanation as to the replacement 
process for replacing these hopper cars. There was no suggestion as 
to how they might be maintained. There was no suggestion as to 
how they might be allocated.
<P>
	What the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and the 
Minister of Transport are asking are for farmers to buy these cars. 
They will have no locomotives to pull these cars. They have no idea 
as to what kind of an allocation process will be put in place for 
these cars. Yet they are supposed to put the financing together and 
go storming ahead with this process.
<P>
	It sounds an awful lot like the way the minister of agriculture 
handled the whole Crow situation. When the Crow buyout was 
announced it was supposed to be offset by efficiencies in rail 
transportation. The problem is the minister of agriculture forgot to 
address the issue of the efficiencies before he ended the Crow. It 
was kind of like putting the cart in front of the horse.
<P>
	Certainly in this whole Crow fiasco there were a lot of mistakes 
made. Certain crops like forage were not included in the payment 
even though they were part of the regular rotation of eligible crops. 
There were instances where a renter and a land owner were going to 
arbitration and it was costing them an exorbitant amount, anywhere 
between $500 and $1,500 a day for arbitration for a cheque that 
may not be much more than that.
<P>
	Cheques were to be mailed out in January. However, there are 
still constituents in my riding of Kindersley-Lloydminster who 
have not received that initial Crow buyout cheque.
<P>
	I was talking to some people from the Farm Credit Corporation. I 
told them this whole Crow buyout plan allowed that the payment 
would be going to FCC for land they held and was being leased by a 
customer. If the customer chose to use that money as a down 
payment they could purchase their land and get it back. I asked how 
this plan worked. The corporation said it was really not working at 
all because they had to meet a December 31 deadline and many of 
them still did not have their initial Crow payment.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	They were not able to put together interim financing. They were 
not sure what the amount would be. Therefore, he said: ``It is very 
rare that you would see a client of the Farm Credit Corporation 
using the Crow buyout as a down payment to repurchase his land''. 
There was some very bad planning in the whole process.
<P>
	Let us go back to the grain hopper cars. It makes sense for the 
government to develop a clear plan of action rather than taking the 
ad hoc approach that we are becoming quickly accustomed to in 
this House.
<P>
	The minister of agriculture has stated publicly a bias in favour of 
some form of producer ownership. If the government would like to 
see the hopper cars go to the producers, it should develop a 
transparent and open framework that will accomplish that. The 
minister of agriculture should not be giving the producer coalition 
preference when he cannot guarantee the cars will be sold to the 
producers.
<P>
	Second, if the government has already made up its mind who 
should own the cars, there is very little point in having a lengthy 
consultation process to arrive at a conclusion that perhaps is 
predetermined. There has been no openness in discussing the 
negotiations or the intentions of the government other than the 
minister's expressed wish that the producers somehow buy the 
hopper cars without knowing the details.
<P>
	According to the budget, the bottom line is that the hopper cars 
will be sold. They should be sold. While the government should 
attempt to get a reasonable amount of money from the sale, 
producers that utilize the rail system should not be pained 
unnecessarily for paying off the cars. The ending of the WGTA 
subsidy has already increased farmers' transportation costs on 
average by 75 per cent. What is needed in the car disposition 
process is a clear and concise strategy that will prevent the process 
from going off the tracks.
<P>
	The agriculture minister failed in the whole disbanding of the 
Crow. He is failing on the hopper cars. He failed on the durum trade 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1493"> 1493 </A></B>
<P>
dispute Canada had a year or so ago  with the United States and he 
failed on the transportation bill, Bill C-14.
<P>
	The minister of agriculture spoke to a meeting of the 
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool in my province and indicated that he 
would be a point person, the person who negotiated the best 
possible transportation act for prairie producers.
<P>
	Every prairie representative who I know that came before the 
transportation committee said that there were fundamental flaws 
with Bill C-14 which needed to be changed. If it would be enacted, 
it should be fair both to shippers and the railways. The minister of 
agriculture failed to represent that interest, which showed how 
hopelessly inadequate he was or how inconsistent he was in 
keeping his word.
<P>
	I want to briefly touch on the reduction of the dairy subsidy and 
the creation of a single federal food inspection agency, which are 
also parts of the budget.
<P>
	With regard to the reduction in the dairy subsidy, the Reform 
Party has stated that the supply managed sectors must not rely on 
federal subsidies to sustain their existence in the marketplace. 
Instead, producers must rely on their competitive advantage and 
create an environment that is viable, self-reliant and market driven.
<P>
	The Liberal government has failed to come clean with producers 
when it told them that the status quo approach with a few cosmetic 
changes would allow the supply managed sectors to go unhindered 
into the 21st century. Once again, the government has relied on an 
ad hoc approach to the detriment of Canadian farmers.
<P>
	As far as supply management is concerned, before the election 
Liberal candidates and Liberal members of Parliament were 
suggesting that article XI was safe, that they would defend article 
XI under the GATT. Once they got into power, they quickly broke 
that promise as they broke many others. They said, sorry, we did 
not have enough support in the international community. We had to 
break our word.
<P>
	I fear that the Liberals are doing the same with supply managed 
industries. They are making promises that they are not going to be 
able to keep and that is unfair.
<P>
	One of the promises they broke was the discontinuation of the 
dairy subsidy. I heard nothing prior to the last election that a 
Liberal government would discontinue the dairy subsidy. In power, 
that is what it has turned around and done.
<P>
	Reform was very open. We had a dialogue with the supply 
managed industries. We said that in the overall scope of things we 
would reduce and eliminate the dairy subsidy, but we would do it in 
co-operation with the industry. The industry would know what was 
going on and there would be other avenues that it could follow to 
compensate for the losses the farmers would have.
<P>
	The Liberals were not open and straightforward with the 
industry. They mislead the industry and now they are pulling the 
rug out from under an industry that was not prepared to deal with 
the end of the dairy subsidy. That is not good government and that 
is not a good way to deal with the agriculture sector.
<P>
	As far as the single food inspection agency is concerned, that is a 
positive development if it brings about the forecast of expenditure 
reductions and if it continues to provide the service that is required.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	It is about time the government realized that amalgamating the 
same services of three departments under one department will 
promote efficiencies financially while reducing the duplication 
among various levels of government and government departments.
<P>
	It is clear that some of the other federal departments should 
follow this and reduce inefficiencies. We have to be vigilant to 
make sure that the government actually reduces the departments 
where there is overlap rather than reshuffle people around, create 
this new single inspection agency, but yet keep unnecessary bodies 
around in the other three departments because it is not prepared to 
make the cuts and do the decisive things that need to be done in the 
department of agriculture.
<P>
	The Liberal delay in addressing the deficit will cost Canadian 
taxpayers in excess of $10 billion. If Canadians would have elected 
a Reform government in 1993, by the year 2000, taxpayers would 
have been $10 billion better off than they are under this Liberal 
government because of its mismanagement of the economy and of 
the budget.
<P>
	A Reform government would have halted this waste by 
balancing the books more quickly. Furthermore with a balanced 
budget taxpayers would see a sustainability of funding for social 
programs and tax relief.
<P>
	That is the compassionate way to deal with seniors. That is the 
compassionate and right way to deal with our youth. That is the 
right way to deal with the agriculture sector as well.
<P>
	The sustainability of Canada's social safety net, job creation and 
a prosperous farming sector can only be achieved by creating a 
healthy economy through a balanced budget, reduced federal 
spending and a shrinking federal debt which will result in modest 
surpluses and a growing economy. That comes from proper 
management and proper budgeting and a finance minister that has 
more courage than our current finance minister.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Mississauga East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
simply could not let the member's words about drivel go unnoticed.
<P>
	I wonder if he would agree with Bill Good, B.C. based radio 
call-in host, who said on CTV's ``Sunday  Edition'': ``What Paul 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1494"> 1494 </A></B>
<P>
Martin has done is gathered a considerable amount of credibility by 
hitting the targets that he has said he was going to hit, that is 
keeping interest rates relatively low because international investors 
now believe Paul Martin is serious about deficit reduction''.
<P>
	Would he also agree with Jeffrey Simpson, <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
columnist who said: ``If only federal governments 10 years ago had 
introduced budgets like the last two, including yesterday's-The 
fight against deficit-debt has been waged thus far successfully 
without major tax increases to which Canadians have become 
politically resistant. It has instead been fought where it belongs, in 
the government's own spending and in transfer to the provinces''.
<P>
	Would he agree with the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> editorial: ``For the 
most part Mr. Martin deserves praise for keeping his government's 
promise to keep federal finances under control without damaging 
the core of the country's social services and without hurting too 
many people too badly''.
<P>
	Perhaps he would agree with Jason Moscovitz that the reason for 
the drivel of the member's opposite is that, as Mr. Moscovitz said: 
``With the Liberals showing the deficit declining, the Reform Party 
appears to have been caught flat footed. Paul Martin had a day he 
may not soon forget. In straight parliamentary terms he beat up the 
opposition-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I hesitate to interrupt at any 
time but I think it is important to remember that although 
sometimes we might quote from any publication, the rule of the 
House is that we cannot do indirectly what we cannot do directly. In 
other words, directly we would not name the Minister of Finance. 
We would refer to him as the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	I know we have been away for a few weeks and we are a little 
rusty. I just bring that to the attention of the House once again. I 
think the question has now been put.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, it was interesting. What the 
member was doing was quoting from the Liberal finance 
department's briefing notes. This is what the hon. member should 
say in response to Reformers. Use this quote, this quote and this 
quote, and see what happens.
<P>
	I am not sure of the economic credentials of some of the people 
who wrote some of those articles. I am sure they are all excellent 
journalists in one form or the other. A lot of what the member said 
is true. The finance minister has hit his target.
<P>
	Actually, Mr. Speaker, if you put a string a foot above the foyer I 
could jump over it without any problem. If you put the target up 
where it should be, where I would be competitive, in my case it still 
would not be too high because of the shape I am in. Let us say three 
or four feet and then it would be a challenge.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	The finance minister has set his sights very low. He is certainly 
hitting his targets but he is doing it at great cost to future 
generations. Low income seniors will not have their old age 
pensions and CPP because of the finance minister's low targets. 
Young people today, our kids and our grand kids will be paying 
taxes that they cannot afford to pay and they will be looking for 
jobs that are not available because the finance minister set his 
targets far too low.
<P>
	Mr. Simpson said that this should have been done sooner. It 
certainly should have been done a whole lot sooner. The debt was 
$17 billion in our centennial year. Now the deficit is $30 or $40 
billion a year.
<P>
	One of the worst finance ministers during that period is the 
current Prime Minister. He started us down the wrong road. The 
Mulroney government came along and it could not fix it either. 
Canadians finally started getting mad and now they are electing 
Reformers because they realize they were headed on a course to 
disaster if we do not get the federal ledger balanced and get it done 
soon.
<P>
	As far as Mr. Moscovitz is concerned he is a great reporter. I 
enjoy watching his show. He is always entertaining but he reminds 
me in that statement of a lot of reporters who said in 1988 that the 
Reform will never elect an MP. These are the people who said that. 
``They will never elect an MP. You will never see one of them 
sitting in the House of Commons''. In 1989 we elected our first MP.
<P>
	They said that Reform would never get anywhere outside of 
western Canada and it will never be anything more than just a rump 
in the west. We hold the majority of seats in western Canada and 
we elected a member in Ontario. We were the second strongest 
party in Ontario.
<P>
	The other day we almost won a seat in Newfoundland where the 
experts had written us off and said we would never even get a 
toehold.
<P>
	Mr. Moscovitz may be wrong. We see the Liberals breaking their 
promises, taking away OAS, not being able to fund CPP, not being 
able to support post-secondary education. Then Canadians will say 
the Liberals betrayed us, the Reformers were right and that is where 
we had better put our stocks in the future.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I resume debate, 
earlier an hon. member raised the issue of a wager. The last 
member who spoke made mention of how high he might be able to 
jump. That might make for an interesting wager.
<P>
	Let me see if I can get some clarification here. Is the hon. 
member for Elk Island seeking the floor for debate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let me clear the matter up as 
best I can. The last spokesperson from the Reform Party, the hon. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1495"> 1495 </A></B>
<P>
member for  Kindersley-Lloydminster, went well beyond 10 
minutes if there was split of the debate time. I am having great 
difficulty in recognizing someone from the same party at this time.
<P>
	I hope that the hon. member will understand. I might have been 
of more assistance if I had asked the member if he was sharing his 
time. I failed to do so. I regret the confusion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. I was of the opinion that 
we were splitting our time, however I will gladly defer if you can 
assure me that some time down the road I may get another 
opportunity.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am sure the hon. member 
will get another opportunity. The matter of debate today is the 
amendment of the official opposition. It will be voted on no later 
than after the bells at 6.15 p.m. I believe there is still some debate 
time left on the budget motion. Could the table officers indicate to 
me that there is still some time? There is still some debate time on 
the budget, and so the hon. member for Elk Island will have an 
opportunity.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I am sorry if I 
went over my 10 minutes. I was of the understanding that we had 
indicated we were dividing our time. Could you indicate whether 
there is still part of the half-hour slot remaining? Would the 
member for Elk Island at least be able to use some of that time if 
there is some time remaining?
<P>
	I apologize if I went longer. I was expecting a sign from you 
when nearing the 10 minute mark.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Normally in all likelihood I 
would have given any member some indication when getting close 
to his or her time. However, not having the previous information 
that the member was to be splitting his time, once we got beyond 
the 10 minutes I accepted the fact that possibly the hon. member 
for Kindersley-Lloydminster was to take the full 20 minute slot.
<P>
	Again, I apologize if I contributed to this confusion but I must 
look to the opposite parties now for debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize for using more time. 
It is probably my fault and I accept responsibility.
<P>
	Would the House consider granting unanimous consent in the 
short time we have before the bells ring to give the hon. member 
for Elk Island about 10 minutes to give his speech. If the House 
denies I understand, since it is my fault, but if the House would be 
generous I ask for unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Could the hon. member for 
Elk Island possibly summarize in five minutes?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will gladly do that given the 
opportunity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> So, here we are. We all 
realize that there was some confusion. The hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster thought he would speak for ten minutes 
and split his time with the hon. member for Elk Island. However, he 
went on for nearly 15 minutes.
<P>
	With the consent of the House, I will give five minutes to the 
member for Elk Island and I will then give the floor to the hon. 
member for Chicoutimi for his allotted ten minutes. Then the bells

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will focus my 
comments on the urgency of balancing the budget. This is the thing 
most Liberals are missing. The talk is always that they are on 
target. While they are meeting their soft targets, for which they 
should be commended, at the same time we are losing the battle.
<P>
	As a high school student I ran a marathon race. Each of us in that 
high school competition had to set our own goals. Each person 
practised and did his training in order to achieve his goal. I set the 
goal to finish the race. That was my only goal. I have never been 
athletic. I have always been heavy for my size. It is not all muscle.
<P>
	I set my goal to finish the race, and I did finish it. When I 
finished the run there was only one person left there, the high 
school official who checked me off as having met my goal. All the 
others had already gone home, but I finished.
<P>
	Notice I do not have any credentials or accolades as an Olympic 
racer. I met my own goal, which is great, but I did not compete at 
all outside of that. This is what the Minister of Finance is doing. He 
is setting goals he can reach, which makes him feel good. There 
may be one person at the finish line, not many more, who will give 
him a check mark and say ``you done good''. However, he will not 
be an Olympic winner at the rate he is going.
<P>
	The essence of the speed or the importance of the speed is what 
is happening in the growth of our debt. I did a few little 
calculations. In 1993 to pay off our debt we would have needed a 
surplus of some $47 billion a year for 25 years. Regrettably we now 
need an annual surplus of approximately $56 billion per year. We 
need a surplus that large if we are to pay off our debt.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	Every year we postpone balancing the budget and bringing the 
deficit to zero, that number increases. That, hon. members, is the 
reason for the urgency. I really feel we are letting down our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1496"> 1496 </A></B>
<P>
children and our grandchildren  by allowing the debt to grow 
indefinitely without solving the problem.
<P>
	I recognize that my short time has ended. I appreciate the 
opportunity to speak to the issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to discuss the budget recently tabled by the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	I feel quite comfortable doing so, because I since had the 
opportunity to consult my constituents and to hear their comments, 
which I will convey to this House.
<P>
	First, taxpayers and residents in my riding of Chicoutimi feel 
that the Minister of Finance totally missed the boat. They simply 
ask the government to get its revenues-since the revenue minister 
is here-where the money really is, starting with family trusts.
<P>
	They also want the government to review the whole corporate 
tax system and to abolish tax shelters.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance is ignoring these calls from ordinary 
citizens. With the support of all government members, he continues 
to take what little is left in the pockets of the poor, the unemployed 
and students.
<P>
	By contrast, no measure is proposed to recover the $6.6 billion 
owed to Revenue Canada. Nor is there any plan to review the whole 
tax system. In this budget, we note that, in terms of income tax, 
more than $5 billion will be collected from individual taxpayers 
this year, as compared to a mere $700 million from corporations.
<P>
	Several of my colleagues have mentioned the fact that, as part of 
its deficit reduction effort, the government was helping itself to 
money that workers and employers have contributed to the UI fund, 
thereby creating an artificial deficit reduction. This astronomical 
amount could have been put to other uses, such as creating 
employment.
<P>
	By his actions, the Minister of Finance is disguising his deficit. 
He even went so far as to say that he would continue to dip into the 
UI fund in coming years. It is a disgrace.
<P>
	Incidentally, business people, workers and unemployed people 
will be holding a protest march in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, on 
May 4, with the support of the Conférence des chambres de 
commerce du Saguenay, to show the Minister of Finance that they 
disagree with his action and also to let the Minister of Human 
Resources Development know that they disagree with his reform. I 
can assure you that no activist will be taking part in this 
demonstration.
<P>
	The fact is that the Minister of Finance is completely blind to the 
reality, and he is pulling his government along in his wake.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	This budget also contains some measures which endanger 
another sector of activity that is very important in my area, in 
Quebec. The announced cuts to the dairy industry place it in 
jeopardy. Quebec's agrifood industry will be facing cuts of some 
32.3 per cent.
<P>
	For some years now, we in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean have seen 
the number of dairy farms decrease. Federal government funding, 
estimated at some $8,000 per farm, allowed milk producers to keep 
production costs low. You can see right away what will happen. 
You can guess what the results of this cut will be: increased cost to 
the consumer. Production will likely be lower because of that.
<P>
	According to a number of people in the region, quotas could 
leave the region because dairy farmers will not be able to support 
their operations on their own. Once again, more unemployment in a 
region that has long been number one in the country for 
unemployment, a dubious honour we could readily do without.
<P>
	Yet, when the Liberal government announced abolition of the 
Crow benefit, it automatically included a $3 billion compensation 
for western farmers. Here, the subsidy to the dairy industry is being 
abolished, but where are such measures this time? Nothing has 
been planned. A fine country, is it not, with equality for all? The 
true face of those people across the floor is a two-faced, double 
standard.
<P>
	Comparisons are unavoidable. Thus the Liberals have always 
had two speeches: one for Quebec and one for the rest of Canada. 
Things are different from one place to the other. Things are watered 
down. There is, for example, no more mention of distinct society 
status for Quebec. Now they are talking simply of a cultural 
homeland in North America, a homeland where the Americans may 
perhaps have something to say. Why not state right now, clearly, 
that Quebecers are a people, yes, a people?
<P>
	Now, I would like to go back to taxation. The minister did 
promise a review of taxation. But no. What better thing did he 
come up with? He came up with the clever idea of setting up a 
committee with people coming from very important companies 
that have the pleasure of using tax havens. It is ludicrous. However, 
until this committee makes its report, money is flowing out of the 
country causing unemployment to rise.
<P>
	This budget, which we in the Bloc described rightly as a 
mediocre make-up session, hides the truth about Canadian 
finances. It makes promises whose fate is the same as those the 
famous red book made. When will jobs be created? When will the 
GST be abolished? When will real steps be taken to improve the 
economy? Nothing. Not even a glimmer of hope.
<P>
	However, people were hoping for something better. Everything 
is falling on their heads at the moment. They  were especially 
hoping for jobs. So the famous promise of jobs is a smoke screen. 
The Minister of Finance has announced he would double summer 
jobs for students. He is simply putting back what was there before. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1497"> 1497 </A></B>
<P>
Last year, in my riding, half of this funding was cut. This year, it is 
being doubled, so we are back where we started from. This has 
happened all over Quebec. Once again, it is window dressing.
<P>
	We have come to the point where the government has lost all 
credibility. It is unable to revive the economy, to keep its promises, 
or to create jobs. Furthermore, the government is about to pass a 
law that would deprive thousands of unemployed workers of UI 
benefits. This reform is an admission of failure by the government.
<P>
	The budget tabled by the Minister of Finance is not a responsible 
budget. It simply implements what the minister announced earlier 
and tells us what to expect in the future. For example, if you are 60 
years old today, will you remember in five years that you may no 
longer qualify for the old age pension? Again, this is nothing but a 
smoke screen. The Minister of Finance must go back to the 
drawing board so that he can finally meet the people's 
expectations.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In closing, I would like to 
thank all hon. members of this House for their co-operation.
<P>
	It being 6.15 p.m., it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and 
put forthwith all questions necessary to dispose of the amendment 
now before the House.
<P>
	The question is on the amendment. Is it the pleasure of the House 
to adopt the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those in favour of the

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In my opinion the nays have 
it.
<P>
