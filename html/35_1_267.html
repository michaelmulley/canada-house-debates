	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to relate the 
outstanding international volunteer efforts of my constituent,Mr. Bruce Decker of Grand Bend, Ontario.
<P>
	Mr. Decker and his wife Jean recently returned to Canada from 
Romania where Mr. Decker had applied his expertise to a 
locomotive manufacturer in restructuring its marketing 
department.Mr. Decker offered his services under the auspices of the Canadian 
Executive Services Organization, a non-profit volunteer 
organization which among other valuable services has been 
providing advice to emerging market economies in central and 
eastern Europe since 1967.
<P>
	CESO is supported by the Government of Canada principally 
through CIDA. In addition to government support, CESO is also 
supported by hundreds of Canadian corporations and 4,000 
volunteers. It is this kind of commitment and dedication by 
thousands of other Canadians that has contributed to the high 
esteem Canada has earned throughout the world.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
you are fleeing from the law in any country in the world, go to 
Canada. The taxpayers will look after you.
<P>
	Take for instance Melissa Harris from Florida. She is a suspect in 
a double slaying who has fled across the border to Winnipeg. At the 
taxpayers' cost she is applying for refugee status, from Florida no 
less.
<P>
	This Liberal government is a disgrace led by a minister of 
immigration who will no doubt call this yet another isolated 
incident. Or if I back him in the corner again he will simply say that 
as the minister he has no jurisdiction over refugee boards.
<P>
	Perhaps Canadians should take another look at the policies of 
this government which allow Americans to claim refugee status if 
they are criminals, like Charles Ng. What is more important to 
Canadians, their safety or Liberals looking for more votes?
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">*  *  * </H4>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THECONSTITUTION">THE CONSTITUTION</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister has put forth hastily concocted post referendum 
proposals that seem, rather than working to bring about a consensus 
on national unity, to be creating even greater disunity.
<P>
	The amending formula which proposes four regions does not 
take into account the strong views of many westerners that the 
prairie provinces are quite different from British Columbia, the 
third largest province in Canada. Past constitutional reports 
acknowledge the importance of this by considering British 
Columbia as a region for the purpose of constitutional 
amendments.
<P>
	A second major question which this proposal raises concerns the 
implications for the creation of new provinces. At present the 
Yukon territory, Western Arctic and the newly created Nunavut are 
not demanding provincehood. However, it is imperative that 
constitutional measures not be put in place which would prevent 
the creation of new provinces at some time in the future.
<P>
	I call on the Prime Minister to clarify what the implications are 
of this amending formula for the creation of new provinces in his 
proposed act.

	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Lambton College, which is located in my riding of 
Sarnia-Lambton, recently signed a formal partnership  agreement 
with the Polytechnical University of Nicaragua. The agreement 
provides for faculty and student exchange programs, professional 
development and management linkages, sharing of educational 
development,

my voice today to those countless numbers of Canadians who are 
calling on the federal government to take more stringent action 
against tobacco products. Such actions could take several forms, 
including declaring tobacco to be what it is: a hazardous substance.
<P>
	It is my belief and that of many of my constituents that the use of 
tobacco represents the most serious avoidable threat to the health 
of Canadians today. In fact, this is much more than a belief; it is a 
proven fact which should cause governments at all levels to take 
whatever positive steps they can to address this enormous health 
threat.

tobacco products as hazardous and strictly regulate its 
manufacture, marketing and distribution.

from insurance brokers in Simcoe North. These small business 
people have valid concerns about the possibility of chartered banks 
being permitted to aggressively enter the insurance business.
<P>
	On the surface this may appear to be just two industries in 
competition over a business segment, but it is much more than that. 
It is about the survival of many hundreds of small insurance 
brokerage firms located in towns and cities throughout Canada. It 
is also about the consumers of insurance services who will receive 
less personalized, untailored insurance coverage from inexpert 
bank representatives pushing inflexible, preset insurance plans.
<P>
	This government is very concerned with creating conditions in 
which small and medium enterprises can  grow and prosper. I hope 
this positive attitude will prevail when it comes to the hundreds of 
insurance brokers across Canada.

	The first time he has an opportunity to show that he respects 
Quebec's distinct character, the Prime Minister chooses instead to

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, </B><B>BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the <I>Globe and Mail</I> reported a split in the phoney 
committee chaired by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. I 
am referring to the committee that is supposed to consider changes 
in the federal system, to follow through on the referendum 
promises made by the Prime Minister.
<P>
	It seems that on one side we have five ministers, including three 
from Quebec, demanding thorough changes and on the other side, 
four ministers from Ontario who persist in their belief that 
Quebecers will be satisfied with symbolic gestures.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. Are we to assume it was the profound split between 
members of his committee that led the Prime Minister to announce 
his proposals on such short notice, even before the committee 
tabled its report?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition is impugning motive. We are 
working on various ways in which the Canadian federation could 
be improved.
<P>
	Yes, we did discuss the issues of distinct society and veto rights, 
and the first results were there in the Prime Minister's 
announcement. We are now discussing other matters, including a 
more sensible division of powers between the provinces and 
Canada. We will submit our recommendations to the Prime 
Minister as soon as they are ready.
<P>
	That ministers should differ in their opinions on various subjects 
is entirely normal in a party like ours that practices the democracy 
it preaches.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in view of the very deep split within the committee 
chaired by the minister, I want to ask him whether he would agree 
that the hollow initiatives announced by the Prime Minister show 
that he sided with  the four ministers from Ontario who believe 
they can satisfy Quebecers' desire for change with this measly 
proposal.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, in our committee, we consider the interests of Canada, 
including those of Quebec. The ministers express their views on the 
basis of their knowledge, experience and judgment, which is 
entirely normal.
<P>
	My conclusion with respect to distinct society and the veto is 
that we are clearly on the right track towards making substantial 
changes in the way the Canadian federation operates.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I heard ``on the right track''; a look at the newspapers is 
enough to see it is the wrong track.
<P>
	I want to ask the minister whether he would agree that the 
government's initiative is off to a very bad start and that the 
government is heading up another blind alley, since as we saw in 
the case of Charlottetown, any proposal to Quebec will be seen as 
too generous by English Canada and not enough by Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, our committee has approached the problems of unity from 
the perspective that we stayed together for 128 years and always 
managed to solve our problems, and also from the perspective that 
the French language was best able to thrive-and I saw this 
personally in the course of my career-while we were part of 
Canada.
<P>
	The position on distinct society, which is gaining acceptance and 
which will be included in the resolution of the House of Commons, 
is also a recognition of aspects of distinct society which developed 
in the Parliament of Canada and in the Canadian provinces. I 
repeat, it developed within Canada. The changes that are necessary 
can and should be made within Canada. In fact, that is the message 
sent to all Canadians, including the official opposition, by the vote 
on October 30.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, one would 
certainly think in listening to the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs that he has become a Pollyanna, since he is the only one 
pleased at this time with the situation in which he has placed 
himself and his government.
<P>
	In the rush of reactions to the Prime Minister's announcement of 
his initiatives, the premiers of British Columbia, Alberta, even 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16962"> 16962 </A></B>
<P>
Manitoba have had some very harsh words to say about both the 
initiatives and the  Prime Minister's attitude. All of the reactions 
triggered by the Prime Minister's proposals paint a picture of an 
increasingly divided Canada.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs aware that the 
reactions to the Prime Minister's proposals clearly demonstrate 
that the proposals are in serious jeopardy, even now as we speak, 
and that his government is headed for a constitutional impasse?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>On the 
contrary, Mr. Speaker. In connection with the distinct society, you 
have seen a large number of Canadian premiers, including those 
from the west, Mr. Filmon in particular, expressing their 
agreement. The Prime Minister has indicated that we would start 
with a House of Commons resolution on these questions, since we 
can do no more from the constitutional point of view at present, but 
that it was our wish to enshrine it in the Constitution.
<P>
	What is happening with the distinct society question will also 
happen with the veto. The Prime Minister had promised during the 
closing week of the campaign that he would take steps to reinstate 
the Quebec veto lost by René Lévesque. We are going to reinstate 
it; this is the way to resolve the problems that exist in Canada. We 
have a committee looking at the other problems of the federation at 
this time, and it will be coming out with some conclusions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs not agree that his proposals, 
his government's proposals, not only are dividing his own 
committee, the phoney committee, but also the cabinet and the 
caucus, as well as deeply dividing all of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I would recommend that the official opposition come to 
grips with the fact that there was also divided opinion on the yes in 
Quebec, and that the yes side lost. When there is talk of divided 
opinions, the main place there is any division at this time is in 
Quebec, but it is also clear that the no side did win and that 
Quebecers-and this is a decision that you must accept because it 
is a democratic one-have clearly indicated that they want major 
changes, but within Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one of the most obvious lessons from the past is that unity 
proposals are divisive if their only goal is to appease one province 
or one group in Canadian society.
<P>
	After the referendum vote, Canadians demanded fresh thinking 
on national unity and there was a widespread demand from all 
Canadians to reshape our federation.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has responded to this demand, not by 
bringing a broad forward looking Canada package to the House but 
rather by bringing a narrow backward looking Quebec package.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
When will the government bring a national unity package to 
Parliament that addresses the legitimate concerns and aspirations 
of Canadians outside Quebec as well as inside Quebec?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think Canadians from all regions of the country have 
said they want to keep Canada united.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	When Canadians from all parts of the country went to Montreal 
to express their views, they were representing views from all over 
Canada, from British Columbia to Alberta to Ontario to the 
maritimes. Canadians are united on that goal to keep Canada 
together. They want the federal government to find the ways to 
solve existing problems.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	It is normal that many views would be offered, some of which 
are contradictory, on the means by which Canada can be kept 
together. However in the present instance there is no doubt that we 
have the support of Canadians for the measures the Prime Minister 
has introduced.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, during the referendum campaign the Prime Minister and 
the federal government showed that they were dangerously out of 
touch with the aspirations of Quebecers. Now with this half baked 
Quebec package, with nothing more than constitutional vetoes and 
distinct society, the government is showing that it is dangerously 
out of touch with the rest of the country.
<P>
	There is nothing in these unity packages that addresses the 
concerns of the west, the north, Ontario or Atlantic Canada. In fact 
that absence of content merely alienates the millions of Canadians 
who are tired of this 30-year old federal two step to appease 
Quebec separatists.
<P>
	When will the government change direction, abandon the status 
quo and develop a truly Canadian package for nation building, one 
that addresses the concerns and aspirations of Canadians outside 
Quebec as well as inside Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I ask the  hon. member to 
recognize and acknowledge that the steps announced this week by 
the Prime Minister represent only the first steps in a strategy in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16963"> 16963 </A></B>
<P>
months to come that will make it clear that the government has a 
national vision for the future of the country.
<P>
	Second, I invite the attention of the hon. member to the terms of 
the veto proposal the Prime Minister has put on the table reflecting 
the very approach taken by the Reform Party in its purported vision 
for the future. It requires regional consensus before any 
constitutional change could take place in the country. I would think 
the Reform Party as a regional party would support that approach 
and I expect it will.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is nothing in the government's remarks, no matter 
which minister addresses it, that indicates there is even an interest 
in the constitutional and systemic demands for change in other 
parts of the country.
<P>
	For example, I have been in the House for two years and I have 
never yet-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Nobody noticed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Recall.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> What are you, a cowboy?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Calgary Southwest is about 
to put his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, in that period we have never yet 
seen the government give any priority whatsoever to the concerns 
and aspirations of British Columbia, the third most populous 
province in the country. B.C. is not even represented on the unity 
committee. It is not recognized by the government as a region in its 
own right.
<P>
	The government is prepared to recognize Quebec as a distinct 
society. When is the federal government prepared to recognize 
British Columbia as an important province of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the leader of the third party 
emphasizes impressions. He wants to leave the impression that the 
British Columbia perspective is not reflected in these proposals, 
but the reality is quite different.

	The hon. member should know, if he does not, that the

1982, requires unanimous consent of the provinces to any change 
falling within section 41 of the Constitution, an important list of 
changes.
<P>
	British Columbia has a veto over any such change. British

<P>
	British Columbia can opt out, like any other province, of any

	In that context how can the leader of the third party possibly 
suggest the western and the British Columbia perspective is not 
reflected in the Constitution?

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs.
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs was totally serious 
yesterday when he announced that the phoney committee he chairs, 
which is divided, as the minister has indicated, will continue its 
deliberations despite the initiatives announced by the Prime 
Minister. It will even submit recommendations to the Prime 
Minister by Christmas.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the phoney committee is continuing its 
work because it plans to offer Quebec more than the Prime Minister 
did barely two days ago?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the official opposition is obviously obsessed with the 
word ``phoney'', which it must surely get from its own use of the 
word or from the example it provided with the regional 
commissions in Quebec, which were really phoney commissions.
<P>
	The Bloc's questions are also becoming increasingly phoney, 
because the answer has been provided three times. The committee 
plans to submit its recommendations to the Prime Minister by 
Christmas. A few weeks are not going to bother us. However, in our 
report, we will clearly have to consider other options for solving 
the federation's current problems in connection with programs, 
activities, roles and jurisdictions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps the word ``phoney'' bothers the minister because 
it reflects the truth.
<P>
	Does the minister not believe, rather, that the initiatives 
announced by the Prime Minister sound the death knell for the 
work of his committee, thus confirming beyond a doubt that the 
committee is phoney and was set up simply to create the illusion 
that Ottawa was preparing to offer changes to Quebec? This is the 
fact of the matter.

Quebecois need a refresher on good examples of bad studies, they 
have the very thing right in their own bailiwick.
<P>
	As for our committee, we will continue to examine ways to 
resolve the federation's problems, because our goal is not to 
destroy Canada, but to build it. This is what the majority of

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister is proposing a package of change that reminds 
some of us of the Charlottetown accord, an accord which we 
emphatically rejected three years ago. He should not be surprised 
when British Columbia and Alberta, the two most populous and the 
two wealthiest provinces in the west, have rejected his offer.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister justify cobbling together a package 
which supposedly addresses the concerns of Quebec but which is 
seen as a slap in the face to Alberta and British Columbia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the proposal which is reflected in 
the veto bill, to be tabled later today, comes very close to what was 
known as the Victoria formula of 1971, an approach favoured by 
the province of British Columbia.
<P>
	Under the Constitution at present, in the absence of the 
legislation we will table today, it will be possible for constitutional 
change to take place under Section 38 of the Constitution Act, 
notwithstanding that it was opposed by British Columbia and two 
other western provinces, even if they comprised more than 50 per 
cent of the population of the west.
<P>
	This bill will make it impossible for that to occur.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
justice minister talks about the 1971 reality. I would ask him to leap 
forward if he could to the 1995 reality.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	He ignores the fact that Canada is changing and that in a 
generation British Columbia will have as many people in it as 
Quebec. He ignores the fact that the concerns of the west can no 
longer be ignored. If he does not know that, he should go out west 
and he would know that.
<P>
	Why is the Prime Minister proposing veto provisions for central 
Canada when he must know that British Columbians will never 
approve of this package?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think we should assume 
for a moment that the hon. member speaks for the people of British 
Columbia.
<P>
	I thought it was the Reform Party which proposed that we should 
change the situation so that there is regional consensus required 
before constitutional change takes place, which is exactly what this 
bill does.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member, since he derives from a riding in British 
Columbia, whether he has the agreement of his colleagues from 
Alberta for the proposition that B.C. should itself and alone have a 
veto on constitutional change.

question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. Given the 
last minute commitment made by the Prime Minister a few days 
before the referendum with a view to swaying Quebecers, followed 
by the striking of a phoney committee with a foggy mandate, and 
by the hasty announcement on Monday of his proposals, it appears 
increasingly obvious that the Prime Minister is improvising on his 
own.
<P>
	Given the general outcry in response to the Prime Minister's 
proposals across Canada, will the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs admit that the Prime Minister, faced with a profoundly 
divided Liberal Party, is acting alone on this issue to save his skin?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, on the contrary. Quebec has been demanding a distinct 
society clause for a long time, for years, for decades. It has been 
doing so to achieve a very important objective: to provide 
Quebecers with the security afforded by the recognition, by the 
federal government and the Constitution, of the distinctiveness of 
the language spoken by the majority of them, which is different 
from the language used in the rest of Canada, the uniqueness of 
their culture, and the particular traditions of their civil code.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's motion finally gives Quebec what it has 
been demanding for years, that is recognition by Canada as a 
whole, since Parliament is the only place which represents all 
Canadians from every region. The Canadian Parliament has been 
asked by the Prime Minister to pass this resolution giving Quebec 
the recognition it has been demanding for years.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	While the Minister of National Revenue from B.C. contends that 
recognizing Quebec as a distinct society will not amount to very 
much, conversely the Minister of Natural Resources from Alberta 
said that distinct society  status in Quebec would amount to 
something very substantial. One wonders whether it is substantial 
or not.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister to explain how he intends to promote 
national unity across Canada when he is having such a problem 
getting unity even within his own cabinet.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the last few days the 
Prime Minister has shown a leadership that unfortunately will not 
be understood by the Reform Party because it does not understand 
either the word Canada or the word leadership.
<P>
	I met a woman in a wheelchair during the Montreal march who 
had come from Peace River, Alberta. I met her in an elevator and 
she said to me: ``Madam Copps, I do not speak French but I know 
you do and will you please tell Quebecers that I am here because I 
care for my country, and Quebec is a part of my country''. That is 
why the vast majority of Canadians will support the Prime Minister 
and his leadership, unlike the cheap politics of the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, speaking of cheap politics, there is clear evidence that old 
style Tory-Liberal federalism and politics are alive and well as far 
as central Canada is concerned.
<P>
	For instance, the unity minister says the west should sacrifice its 
own concerns for the good of the country.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister if he would explain why western 
provinces should yet again sacrifice their concerns and support a 
unity plan that is aimed solely at appeasing the separatists of 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member talks about the 
western provinces and the regions. Certainly the Prime Minister 
has left the door open to a different Canadian configuration with 
the regions. In examining the proposition that calls for a 
recognition of four regions, he is actually following a study on 
Confederation written for the Canada West Foundation by one 
Preston Manning, who called for the western provinces as one 
particular entity.
<P>
	When the member opposite talks about the five regions of 
Canada and asks is Alberta or British Columbia a separate region, I 
would like to quote the House leader of the Reform Party, who says 
the five regions of Canada means British Columbia, not Alberta. 
The answer by the House leader of the Reform Party: ``Not 
necessarily Alberta and British Columbia. All the provincial 
governments now have a say in the ratification formula''.
<P>
	When they want to talk about regions, I wish the Reform Party 
would ascertain whether they want regional status for Alberta or 
British Columbia.

question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The Prime Minister announced two days ago that instead of 
recognizing the responsibility of Quebec in the area of vocational 
training, as we have all requested for many years, Ottawa intends to 
keep full control over the money it now spends on employment 
training by giving that money directly to the unemployed.
<P>
	Can the minister confirm that, in the area of manpower training, 
the proposal that would have the federal government deal directly 
with individuals, bypassing the provinces, will prevent the 
provinces from implementing a true manpower training policy 
adapted to the needs of the labour market?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the Prime Minister 
made it very clear on Monday that in fact the federal government 
was very much clarifying the respective responsibilities and we 
were transferring to the provinces a large number of 
responsibilities that had previously been under various regimes of 
shared programming.
<P>
	For the member to claim that somehow in fact there is now more 
interference is simply turning logic and reality on its head. We are 
making a very major departure for the province because we think 
that is a much better way of clarifying the role.
<P>
	At the same time, I think everyone recognizes that under the 
Unemployment Insurance Act, as it was constitutionally agreed to 
in 1941 by all the provinces, including Quebec, the federal 
government has taken the trusteeship for those under the regime of 
that system and therefore we have a responsibility to the people in 
that system.
<P>
	It would seem to me that it is about time this hon. member 
learned a little bit about the real Constitution of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister has such difficulty explaining his positions that he always 
has to resort to insults. It is exactly because we, in Quebec, 
understand the very basis of the Constitution of Canada that we say 
that manpower training is a Quebec jurisdiction both on legal and 
constitutional grounds.
<P>
	Can the minister confirm that what he is about to do, by giving 
money directly to the unemployed, is to keep control over national 
standards, choices and needs, in spite of Quebec's rights?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, frankly, it is the height of 
absurdity to claim, as the hon. member has just done, that under the 
unemployment insurance program, where people have paid 
premiums, we have no responsibility of helping to pay benefits. 
The reason people pay premiums is so we can pay benefits. That is 
the whole purpose of the program.
<P>
	Furthermore, the system has worked effectively in the past 
because we have the ability to share that responsibility across the 
country so that people who pay premiums in one part of the country 
can help pay benefits in another part of the country where there are 
higher levels of unemployment. That is the genius of the system. In 
this country we have learned to share from region to region and not 
isolate ourselves behind a wall.

<P>
	This morning, we learned from a Canadian Press dispatch that

the income of the unemployed but rather the family income, he will 
deny thousands of women access to the unemployment insurance 
program, while continuing to require that these women pay their UI 
contributions?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

directly to aid families with children, is based upon a family 
income test. As a result, most of the beneficiaries, I would say 
almost 80 per cent, are women and particularly children.

	Too many governments in this country and too many politicians

suit the purpose of a politician who wants to pander to a certain 
narrow element of the electorate, and there are such politicians. But 
this government is in favour of what works, and what works is a 
responsible approach to youth justice.

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Revenue, the 
senior minister for British Columbia.
<P>
	British Columbians are outraged that first we were shut out of 
the cabinet committee on unity and now we are denied the same 
veto rights as Ontario and Quebec.
<P>
	I ask the minister: Why was B.C. shut out of the cabinet 
committee on unity? When will the minister finally stand up for the 
people of British Columbia instead of showing total contempt for 
British Columbians by telling us that we have to wait for 
demographics until we have basic equality with Ontario and 
Quebec? When will he stand up for British Columbians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

representatives of the NDP at a  time when we need to nation build

<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that the minister for British 
Columbia is working very hard to ensure that British Columbia's 
voice is heard strongly and loudly in cabinet. I can also assure him 
that the regional veto proposal put forth by the Prime Minister, 
which is far better than the current amending formula, places in the 
hands of British Columbians the power to shape the Constitution 
more directly in the future than they ever had in the past. The Prime 
Minister never closed the door to future recognition of B.C. in a 
specific way.
<P>
	I can say that at least on this side of the House we do not have 
one member of Parliament calling for a region of British Columbia 
and another calling for a region of Alberta, something that we see 
in the Reform Party.

Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is 
an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its

discriminates against families who make the choice to provide care 
in the home to preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill, 
or the aged.

initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families who 
decide to provide care in the home for preschool children, the

intended to publish under the new policy of outlook documents that

therefore, I put a motion on the Order Paper.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="RECOGNITIONOFQUEBECASADISTINCTSOCIETY">RECOGNITION OF QUEBEC AS A DISTINCT SOCIETY</A></H3>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the People of Quebec have expressed the desire for recognition of 
Quebec's distinct society;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) the House recognize that Quebec is a distinct society within Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) the House recognize that Quebec's distinct society includes its 
French-speaking majority, unique culture and civil law tradition;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) the House undertake to be guided by this reality;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(4) the House encourage all components of the legislative and executive 
branches of government to take note of this recognition and be guided in their 
conduct accordingly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am happy to rise in the House of 
Commons to launch the debate on the motion presented by the 
government to recognize Quebec as a distinct society within 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	I made three commitments during the Quebec referendum 
campaign: first, to recognize that Quebec forms a distinct society 
within Canada; second, not to make any constitutional change that 
affects Quebec without Quebecers' consent; and third, to undertake 
changes to bring services and the decision making process closer to 
citizens.
<P>
	Less than a month after the referendum, the government is 
keeping its word and fulfilling its commitments. I would like to 
remind everyone that a majority of Quebecers said on October 30 
that they want Quebec to continue to be a part of Canada and that 
they want changes to be made within Canada. The Government of 
Canada has understood that message, and the resolution we are 
debating today, as well as the bills on a veto and unemployment 
insurance reform, are testimony to the Government of Canada's 
respect for the choice of Quebecers.
<P>
	By rejecting the option of separation promoted by the Parti 
Quebecois and members of the official opposition, Quebecers have 
called on their provincial government to act like a full-fledged 
partner and to work with us for the  evolution of the Canadian 
federation. It is unfortunate for Quebecers that their government 
and the official opposition have not remembered that message. 
They refuse to respect the will of the majority and to represent all 
Quebecers, not just those who say the same things they do.
<P>
	In fact, a few minutes ago, in the Quebec National Assembly, the 
Parti Quebecois refused to recognize the results of the referendum 
in a motion put forward by the opposition asking the National 
Assembly to recognize them. It is unfortunate that the Leader of the 
Opposition, who is likely to be the next premier of Quebec, is still 
talking as if the referendum campaign were still under way. The 
referendum is over. Quebecers have voted for Canada, for change 
within Canada. It is about time certain members of this House 
realized that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our government understands the lessons that had to be learned. 
The result of the referendum on October 30 has shown us we 
cannot take Canada for granted. The Canada we have built deserves 
to be defended against its detractors. Canada deserves to have its 
evolution safeguarded. That is what we intend to do.
<P>
	The measures we initiated on Monday move in that direction. All 
our actions have just one goal: to ensure the unity and evolution of 
Canada in order to respond to the aspirations of all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The purpose of the motion we are debating today is to have the 
elected representatives of Canada recognize that Quebec is a 
distinct society within Canada. As a Quebecer and a francophone, I 
understand and share the desire of my fellow Quebecers to have our 
difference recognized.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	The motion put forward by our government goes to the very 
heart of what makes Quebec different. The motion specifies that 
this distinct society includes, and I quote: ``-its French-speaking 
majority, unique culture and civil law tradition''.
<P>
	That definition of what makes Quebec different is just, true to 
reality and unrestrictive. I am certain that most Quebecers will 
recognize themselves in that definition of distinct society. It 
includes our traditions, our culture, our legal system and our 
French soul.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The debate we are having today on this motion is an opportunity 
for the members of the official opposition to show solidarity with 
and good faith in their fellow citizens. It is an opportunity for them 
to act positively to support the recognition of the distinct society of 
Quebec by the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16972"> 16972 </A></B>
<P>
	I would not want to miss this opportunity to speak directly to 
Quebecers who, since October 30, since the distressing statements 
by Mr. Parizeau, since the unacceptable actions by Mr. Landry, 
have been feeling nervous and unwelcome.
<P>
	Quebec is made up of a francophone majority. That is what 
makes it different. However, Quebec is also made up of Quebecers 
who have come from every part of the world. They are full fledged 
Quebecers and Canadians. On behalf of the Government of Canada 
I want to tell them today that we have not forgotten them. I assure 
them of our full support. They can count on us.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada is a country where diversity is respected, where we can 
recognize and affirm our differences. We reject the idea that a 
country must require its citizens to have a single, uniform identity.
<P>
	The reality of Canada accommodates recognition of Quebec as a 
distinct society within Canada. The reality of Canada includes the 
reality of Quebec.
<P>
	We are calling today on the members of this House to recognize 
that Quebec is a distinct society within Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	During the referendum campaign the legislatures of Ontario, 
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland passed 
resolutions recognizing the uniqueness of Quebec within Canada 
by virtue of its language, culture and legal systems.
<P>
	Canadians throughout the country also showed their attachment 
to Quebec during the referendum campaign. All across the country 
spontaneous demonstrations were organized in support of Quebec.
<P>
	Today I call on Canadians who demonstrated their attachment to 
Quebec during the referendum campaign to support our 
government's initiative to recognize Quebec explicitly as a distinct 
society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	With the support of Canadians, with the support of governments 
in the other provinces, and with the support of members of this 
House, I am certain that, if the Government of Quebec so wishes, 
we will be able to entrench that recognition of Quebec's distinct 
society within the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	But now is not the time for constitutional discussions, because 
the Government of Quebec and the Leader of the Opposition 
himself have indicated that they refuse to participate in such 
discussions. That is why the government has decided to show 
Quebecers that it is possible to recognize their society for what it is, 
by calling on the House to vote in favour of this motion.
<P>
	Once it is passed, this resolution will have an impact on how 
legislation is passed in the House of Commons. I remind Canadians 
that the legislative branch will be bound by this resolution, as will 
the executive branch. This is a real, dynamic recognition, recorded 
in the very heart of our country's government.
<P>
	I believe that this is the type of assurance and guarantee that the 
majority of Quebecers are looking for. And the Leader of the 
Opposition need do only one thing to indicate to them that he 
respects their vote in favour of change within Canada. 
Unfortunately, he has already indicated that he does not intend to 
do that.
<P>
	Moreover, the Leader of the Opposition often likes to remind us 
of those who did not support Meech. And each time, memory fails 
him. Well, I would like to remind him that his colleague sitting 
right beside him, the member for Roberval, was a member of the 
National Assembly in 1987 and he voted against Meech.
<P>
	The party which he intends to lead voted against Meech and 
against Charlottetown, and is about to reject for a third time in a 
row the recognition of the fact that Quebec is a distinct society 
within Canada.
<P>
	The party he still leads today is about to do the same. History 
will remember that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As it concerns the aboriginal people of Canada, my government 
is clearly on record as respecting their aspirations. We recognize 
the unique legal position of aboriginal people, including the 
protection of aboriginal and treaty rights in the Canadian 
Constitution and the inherent right of self-government.
<P>
	This resolution, through which the House is being called upon to 
confirm the reality that Quebec is a distinct society, is not intended 
in any way to infringe upon or derogate from those aboriginal or 
treaty rights. This position includes the inherent right of 
self-government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Quebec has long claimed a veto over amendments to the 
Canadian Constitution to ensure that it is a full participant in the 
evolution of the Constitution and to have protection against 
amendments that could diminish the powers, rights and privileges 
of the National Assembly and the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	The Government of Canada recognizes the legitimacy of those 
demands. Indeed, we are where we are today because, in 1981, the 
PQ government of the time abandoned its traditional demand of a 
veto in favour of the current amending formula. As far as we are 
concerned, our party has always, always supported a veto for 
Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16973"> 16973 </A></B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the Government of Canada also recognizes that 
a constitutional amendment is a serious measure. It should be 
based on a broad consensus. No region of Canada should be 
excluded.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is why the bill requires that the Government of Canada first 
obtain the consent of Quebec, Ontario and two provinces from both 
the western and Atlantic regions representing 50 per cent of the 
population of each of those two regions before proposing a 
constitutional amendment to Parliament.
<P>
	Some people will say that this proposal does not respect the 
principle of equality of the provinces. I will answer that equality of 
the provinces means that all provinces have the same rights to 
make laws, to make decisions and to set policies to serve the 
interests of their citizens.
<P>
	Our proposal does not change that reality. As the Minister of 
Justice indicated during question period, to change the Constitution 
today with the amending formula that exists it requires four small 
provinces to block an amendment but only two big provinces to 
achieve the same goal. It is a sign that the weight of the population 
is already incorporated in the Constitution that serves the country 
today.
<P>
	Others will say, and we have already heard them, that the bill 
does not do justice to British Columbia. At this point I directly 
address the people of British Columbia. With the constitutional 
veto ascribed to western Canada in the bill, British Columbia will 
have a larger say on the Constitution than it has ever had in 
Canadian history. With almost half the population of the west, 
British Columbia will wield unprecedented weight. Some people 
are trying to characterize this tremendous progress as a setback. We 
should not believe them. It is the opposite. It is the start of a new 
era of British Columbia's strength in Canada.
<P>
	In extending its veto to Quebec, Ontario, the Atlantic and 
western regions, our government is directly inspired by the major 
principles of our democracy. It is a solid, tangible measure that 
reconfirms the government's willingness to use practical, essential 
means to protect all regions of Canada with regard to future 
constitutional changes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At a time when all modern societies must deal with an 
ever-changing world and environment, a world in which borders 
are disappearing, Canada must adapt. Accordingly, the third 
initiative put forward by our government at the beginning of the 
week is a response to the desire expressed by all Canadians for their 
governments to become closer to citizens.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The reform that the Minister of Human Resources Development 
will table in the House on Friday is an example of the pragmatic 
approach we want to take to clarify the roles and responsibilities of 
the Government of Canada.
<P>
	Let us be clear. We will not abandon our constitutional 
responsibilities to help unemployed Canadians re-enter the labour 
market, a constitutional obligation we have had since 1941. We 
will continue to act to get Canadians back to work in partnership 
with all those who share that objective.
<P>
	It is important to recognize and respect the responsibility of the 
provinces in the areas of education and labour market training.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We appreciate that workers need training to keep their job or find 
a better one, and we are prepared to help them. But we will do so 
only with the consent of the provinces, respecting the priorities of 
each. We are putting forward a proposal for partnership, and our 
main partners in this area are the provinces. In Canada, we 
overcome our difficulties through a spirit of compromise and 
mutual respect.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	The spirit of cooperation and partnership that inspires us should 
motivate us to continue building this country in an atmosphere of 
generosity and respect. The measures we are taking today mean 
change without revolution, progress without break-up.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the final days of the Quebec referendum people across Canada 
demonstrated an outpouring of love for their country the likes of 
which I have never seen in my 32 years in public life. They spoke 
out in one loud voice of their deep, deep attachment to Quebec and 
of their yearning to keep Canada together.
<P>
	I said to them then that I would not let them down. Mr. Speaker, 
today I stand before you, before the eyes of the whole nation, and 
say proudly that I have not let them down and I know that they will 
not let Canada down.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to say to my fellow Quebecers: You have demonstrated 
your commitment to Canada. I am telling you that we, in the House 
of Commons and across Canada, will show that we warranted your 
faith. You were right in believing that Canada can and will change 
to meet your aspirations and those of all Canadians, that Quebec 
can stand proud and tall inside Canada.
<P>
	In the coming days we will hear from those who defend only 
their own interests. We know the agenda of the separatists. They 
want to destroy Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16974"> 16974 </A></B>
<P>
	And there are others in other parts of Canada who think that 
the way to win popularity and power is to divide, to attack, to pit 
Canadians against one another.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is not the Canadian way. It has never been. The Canadian 
people are stronger, more open and more understanding than that. 
When the chips are down they stand up for Canada. That is what I 
ask them to do in the days and weeks ahead.
<P>
	It is easier to attack than to work together. It is easier to shout 
than to listen. It is easier to destroy than to build. It is easier, yes, 
but it is wrong for ourselves, for our children and for our country. 
The shouters, the attackers, the destroyers have had their say. Now 
Canadians want to get on with building Canada. The initiatives we 
have tabled today and will table in the next few days will help us to 
get on with that job. I know Canadians across the country from 
B.C. to Quebec to Newfoundland and the north will support us.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is why I call on all members of the House to support the 
motion of the government, which wants the House of Commons to 
recognize Quebec as a distinct society within Canada.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, before recognizing the Leader of 
the Opposition, I will hear the hon. member for Sherbrooke on a 
point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order concerning 
the order in which the speakers will be recognized this afternoon. 
You will understand that the resolution before this House today is 
exceptional in nature and that, under similar circumstances, the 
House usually shows some flexibility.
<P>
	Therefore, with your permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
ask for consent, this afternoon-and I think that my hon. colleague 
from the New Democratic Party plans to do the same-to be 
allowed to speak immediately after the leader of the Reform Party 
and, should the time normally provided be expired, to disregard the 
clock, so that each of us has an opportunity to speak on the 
resolution just tabled by the Prime Minister.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will go directly to the whip of the government 
and will take the other two points of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I consulted with my colleagues 
about this issue earlier this day. I am pleased to report that we 
would consent to such a proposal and that we are willing to make 
the same offer to the hon. member for Yukon if she were to seek it.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will recognize the hon. House leader of the 
Reform Party on the same point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have considered 
the matter and feel that we should use the regular order of speaking 
with regard to the resolution. If the government wishes to give up 
two of its slots as time goes on that is its business. We believe we 
should follow the regular order of speaking and not change the 
order of business.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, as far as the hon. member's request 
is concerned, I would just remind him that, not so long ago, my 
colleagues asked for consent in debates of great importance to 
Quebec, and he consistently denied consent. Let him now abide by 
a narrow interpretation of the Standing Orders and have a taste of 
his own medicine.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Sherbrooke and the hon. 
member for Yukon have both asked for unanimous consent. The 
House, as I understand it, has refused this consent. We will now 
proceed to the hon. leader of the opposition.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
understand that you have ruled on this, but I would like to register 
within the House a point of order on the fact that at a time when we 
are trying to look at the future of this country it is regrettable that 
the Bloc and the Reform Party do not accept the proposal of the 
member for Sherbrooke.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we just heard the Prime Minister's speech. I think we 
should point out that this speech is a distinct departure from the 
approach the Prime Minister has taken in the past two years. 
During the 1993 election campaign and the subsequent two years in 
this House, the Prime Minister's approach was extremely hard, 
rigid and, I must admit, consistent, in other words, he did not 
mention the Constitution, did not feel it was appropriate to suggest 
any changes and was quite satisfied with Canada as it is.
<P>
	He took a similar approach during the initial weeks of the 
referendum campaign, so much so that he put his feet up and 
relaxed until the last week of the campaign, when he woke up to the 
fact that the yes side was surging ahead and had become a very real 
threat to the no side. His reaction was very nervous, very 
improvised and came on very short notice.
<P>
	He quickly arranged for a very large meeting in Verdun on 
October 24, where he said the following-this was the new Prime 
Minister-and I quote: ``We will keep open all the other roads to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16975"> 16975 </A></B>
<P>
change, including  administrative and constitutional means. Any 
changes in constitutional jurisdiction will only be made with the 
consent of Quebecers''.
<P>
	Back in the House, after a very narrow win by the no side, 
improvisation has been the name of the game in the federal 
government. First, it set up two committees-we still do not know 
what they are doing-which were short-circuited by the debate we 
are having today. One of the committees, chaired by the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, is supposed to come up with and 
propose ways to resolve the current constitutional mess and 
deadlock. Second, we have the announcement the Prime Minister 
rushed to make on Monday about a resolution that would include a 
symbolic recognition of Quebec as a distinct society, a so-called 
veto and a vague delegation of activities in the area of manpower 
training.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	The question is: What is behind this complete about-face by the 
Prime Minister, who has consistently fought the concept of a 
distinct identity for Quebec?
<P>
	First of all, there were the circumstances. The Prime Minister 
was very surprised and even distressed by the almost irresistible 
advance of the yes side during the latter part of the referendum 
campaign. And it was fear, and fear is a very healthy reaction and 
also, according to the gospel, the father of wisdom, that inspired 
the sudden statements he made on October 24 and during the last 
days of the referendum campaign.
<P>
	This surprising about-face is neither surprising nor an 
about-face, since the proposal is meaningless and a worthy 
successor to all the political positions taken so far by the Prime 
Minister since the beginning of his career with the federal 
government and on the federal scene. Words can be made to say 
what we want them to say, and the phrase ``distinct society of 
Quebec'' is no exception. Distortion is always possible.
<P>
	The expression ``distinct identity of Quebec'' is a case in point. 
It may be useful to recall that its initial appearance in our 
constitutional vocabulary and on the political scene in Canada and 
Quebec actually dates back to February 1965 and the preliminary 
report of the Laurendeau-Dunton Commission, where the 
expression was used in a rather descriptive way, devoid of any 
political or legal content. It surfaced again, this time with a more 
formal meaning, in September 1970, when Mr. Bourassa, the newly 
elected Premier of Quebec who was attending a constitutional 
conference, actually used the expression in the meaning it has had 
more or less since that time.
<P>
	However, starting in 1985, the term was to develop some very 
specific overtones, as in the Quebec Liberal Party platform in June 
1985, before the election that would be held several months later, 
and this recognition of the distinct identity of Quebec was to 
become a  precondition for any decision by Quebec to become part 
of the Constitution of 1982.
<P>
	We must therefore examine the context. In 1982, Quebec 
sustained a blow, a blow with which everyone is familiar, and 
which was felt very strongly by everyone including the Quebec 
Liberal Party, which had always refused to endorse the 
Constitution, even condemning it in a vote in the National 
Assembly in November 1981. And in 1985 the Quebec Liberal 
Party, in an attempt to unravel the knot, to bring things out into the 
open, proposed that Quebec set a precondition to signing the 1982 
Constitution-the Prime Minister's Constitution, the one that still 
has a blank at the bottom of its last page next to the name of 
Quebec-as a precondition to any negotiation the unconditional 
recognition by the federal government and all of the provinces of 
Canada of the distinct character of Quebec.
<P>
	Then, of course, on June 3,1987, came the signing of the Meech 
Lake accord. The real one, the real Meech Lake; not the one to 
which the Prime Minister refers all the time, which is his accord, 
the one he had watered down later on, and the one I shall speak 
about later, but the true Meech Lake accord. On June 3, 1987, all of 
the first ministers of Canada, provincial and federal, reached 
agreement for the first time in history on the signing of a 
constitutional accord which would have allowed Quebec to 
preserve its honour, to return to the constitutional family, and then 
to come on board with enthusiasm. The words ``honour'' and 
``enthusiasm'' correspond to two separate phases. First of all, the 
return to the family with head held high, because our distinct 
character has been recognized, and second, enthusiasm in 
redefining the division of powers between Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	I am recalling a context which I see as extremely important since 
it offers a very good explanation of the degree to which today's 
proposal, which is totally unacceptable and does not hold up, will 
not fly. It will not even make it into the history books, except 
perhaps as a footnote somewhere. It is a truly minimalist effort, 
nothing in comparison to previous efforts to attempt to settle the 
Canada and Quebec problem.
<P>
	What was there in the Meech Lake accord of June 1987? Let us 
review this. First of all, there was entrenchment of the accord in the 
Constitution. Entrenching a formal agreement as part of the 
Constitution is by no means a trifle. This means there are 
consequences. This means the courts are obliged to take it into 
consideration, to apply it. They are bound by the clauses introduced 
into the Constitution.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	You will note as well that the wording is extremely strong. So 
strong, in fact, that it greatly displeased the Prime Minister who has 
fought it ever since with all of his might. The formulation is that, 
henceforth-I shall describe it now. I will quote it verbatim in a 
few minutes-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16976"> 16976 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps: </B>Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard: </B>I would appreciate the Deputy Prime Minister 
allowing me to speak. This is perhaps one of the last speeches she 
will have the pleasure of hearing me give in this House. Would she 
let me speak?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the Meech Lake accord of June 1987-and it is 
important to keep this in mind-required the courts, from the 
Supreme Court on down, to interpret all of the Constitution, 
including the Charter, ``in a manner consistent with the recognition 
that Quebec constitutes within Canada a distinct society''. There 
was nothing to qualify this, no definition of content which would 
thereafter represent a limitation, simply the strong and clear 
statement of the principle to be recognized.
<P>
	This, therefore, constrained the courts in future to recognize and 
implement a principle which imbued the Constitution with a new 
spirit. Each and every provision of the Constitution, with the 
amendments and everything that dates back to 1867, was tinged 
with something new: the recognition of Quebec's distinct nature. It 
also introduced, formally, in terms of a legal instrument, a new 
criterion for interpreting all the provisions.
<P>
	When I say all the provisions, I also mean the provisions of the 
Prime Minister's Constitution, the 1982 one. It, let us remember, 
did a lot of things. One of the things the 1982 Constitution 
effectively introduced into Canada and Quebec's legal and political 
landscape was the notion of a single country, a Canadian 
nation-this was a first.
<P>
	This was the first time constitutional and legal texts talked about 
Canada as a single nation, the nation of Canada. The corollary, 
needless to say, was that Quebecers found their existence as a 
people being denied, implicitly, if not explicitly. Up to this point, 
there had been lots of discussion, but, under the Constitution of our 
forebears, the one we Quebecers agreed to, not the other one, the 
Prime Minister's, the prevailing spirit was that there were two 
founding peoples.
<P>
	It was not expressed this way in so many words, but this is what 
our forebears had in mind when they agreed to sign the 1867 
confederation agreement. Otherwise, Lower Canada would never 
never have agreed to sign the Constitution. This is what convinced 
Quebec parliamentarians of the time to enter into confederation, 
because they thought that French Canadians, as they were then 
called, could move about freely within Canada, could feel at home 
wherever they were and could be the equal of the other founding 
people everywhere.
<P>
	What happened in 1982? A principle was introduced, which 
basically knocked the stuffing out of the concept many Quebecers 
had of Canada, including Quebecers who were still federalists.
<P>
	The Meech Lake accord came back to this very point. It 
provided, in addition to the initial interpretation  
criterion-recognition of Quebec's distinct nature-for a second 
criterion, which was recognition-I will read the text, it is very 
short-that: ``the existence of French-speaking Canadians, centred 
in Quebec, but also present elsewhere in Canada, and 
English-speaking Canadians, concentrated outside Quebec, but 
also present in Quebec-''constituted a fundamental characteristic 
of Canada.
<P>
	This extremely important principle is enshrined in the text of the 
Meech Lake accord. This means there is a duality. I am sure that 
many lawyers, with a little bit of imagination, could have argued 
before the courts that this implied the recognition of two peoples 
and not a single Canadian people with the existence and the identity 
of Quebec mixed in with the lot and therefore annihilated. That was 
in the Meech Lake accord.
<P>
	So when they say the accord did have teeth, it is true that it was 
an important document. Furthermore, it recognized something very 
important. It was the fact that Quebec's distinct nature was not 
subject to the charter of rights and freedoms. This is a very 
significant principle and it convinced many Quebecers to accept 
the Meech Lake accord, despite the fact that many sovereignists 
opposed it. My colleague here, the member for Roberval, opposed 
it. I approved it. A lot of sovereignists like myself decided at the 
time to give federalists a chance-this has been referred to as the 
``beau risque''-and support Mr. Mulroney in this, which was 
leading to the recognition of something that had never yet been 
accepted.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	This should be recognized as very important for it marked the 
beginning of the crisis that deeply divided the country and the Tory 
cabinet and led to my resignation and the resignation of several 
Tory MPs to form the Bloc Quebecois. It is important to note that 
the original Meech not only recognized Quebec's distinctiveness 
without limiting it, but also ensured that this recognition was not 
subordinate to the pre-eminent charter of rights and freedoms, 
which, as we know, is the Prime Minister's baby.
<P>
	If someone should know that the first Meech Lake accord 
protected the principle of recognizing Quebec's distinctiveness 
against the application of the charter of rights, it is the Prime 
Minister. That is the reason why he was so vehemently opposed to 
it. As many people must remember, a milestone in the Prime 
Minister's philosophy and political journey was the very important 
speech he delivered on January 16, 1990, here at a university, in 
Ottawa, in which he sounded the death knell of Meech.
<P>
	You may wonder why, since he was not even a member of 
Parliament at the time. He may not have been an MP, but he was a 
candidate-still undeclared, I think-for his party's leadership. He 
had not yet declared his candidacy, but everyone knows that the 
intention  comes before the formal declaration. Everyone knew that 
this former MP and minister, who spoke before Ottawa university 
students on January 16, 1990, had every chance of becoming the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16977"> 16977 </A></B>
<P>
next Prime Minister of Canada and that his words therefore had 
weight.
<P>
	What he said at the time is very important, because it marked the 
fatal attack against the Meech Lake accord. The Prime Minister 
had a lot of credibility, and he still does, I think, with all Canadians, 
and perhaps to an even greater degree in English Canada. I am not 
criticizing him but at the time-at least in English Canada, where 
there was a great deal of muted, latent opposition to the Meech 
Lake accord-his voice was heard as being extremely effective in 
destroying any political chance of success for the Meech Lake 
accord.
<P>
	What he did was to invoke basic rights and the need to preserve 
the effectiveness of the charter of rights. He said this, and I quote: 
``By proposing that the distinctiveness of Quebec society be 
affirmed in a constitutional interpretation clause'', an effective 
interpretation criterion, as I said, ``they are in fact splitting the 
country in two, with Quebec on one side and the other nine 
provinces on the other''. In his speech, the Prime Minister was 
desperately trying to demonstrate that recognition of Quebec's 
distinctiveness should not be an interpretation principle, because it 
is too broad, because it would undermine the effectiveness of court 
rulings under the charter of rights, and that the substance of the 
Meech Lake agreement should therefore be drastically altered.
<P>
	What the Prime Minister said in January 1990 throws an almost 
blinding light on his subsequent behaviour and successive 
positions, which are all in line with his efforts to water down 
recognition of Quebec's distinctiveness.
<P>
	Why did the Prime Minister, who is an honest man, a responsible 
public figure who wants what is best for Canada-and no doubt for 
Quebec as well-throw such a monkey wrench in works that were 
bringing hope, at the time, for a moment of grace, harmony and 
agreement? Why did he do that? I respectfully submit-I could be 
mistaken, but this is a possible explanation-that he did it first 
because, in his opinion, and I respect his opinion, Canada is a 
nation. In his view, there is only one people in Canada, the 
Canadian people, comprised of a number of components, including 
one called Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The bottom line for him, and this is another principle of his, 
Quebec is like any other province. Quebec is one of the good little 
chicks around the federal hen.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ha, ha.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> But he is a logical man, Mr. Speaker. I would 
never challenge his logic, since his logic leads him to conclude, and 
this is a characteristic of his position, if he does not recognize the 
distinctiveness of Quebec in its true sense, it is because he came to 
the logical conclusion  that there is only one, real national 
government, namely Ottawa, to represent Canadian values, make 
major decisions, decide the basic trust of anything and everything 
happening in Canada and that the provinces are just that, provinces. 
They exist under the Constitution. There is not much that can be 
done about that. There they are.
<P>
	Since they are part of the Constitution, the provinces have to be 
tolerated, but nothing keeps this government from cutting funding 
and putting the squeeze on them. The federal government is in 
trouble? It is experiencing financial difficulties? They just cut 
funding to the provinces, while keeping the tax money and points 
and without cutting taxes.
<P>
	The provinces are actually viewed as some kind of arrangement, 
and they are respected as such, entities, administrative entities, 
perhaps huge municipalities in the eyes of the Prime Minister and 
other like-minded individuals, including his mentor, Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau, who tried relentlessly to impose as a reality a fiction of 
Canada.
<P>
	These people are living with a fantasy of what Canada should be. 
Their vision of Canada is quite simple. Imagine a circle, the federal 
system; all around this circle, you have little squares, dots or what 
not called provinces and, in the middle, you have the basic national 
state. Very often, their speeches and attitudes have reflected some 
sort of weariness about the presence of the provinces, whether 
Quebec or the other provinces, provinces that have identities and 
aspirations. I know for a fact that the Reform Party has legitimate 
concerns about this.
<P>
	So, you can understand now why this reasonable and responsible 
man did what he did in 1982. I do not think it is justifiable but, in 
1982, this man, who had this vision of Canada, went as far as to 
impose it on Quebec.
<P>
	Never in the history of this country-and I know a thing or two 
about history from my studies, and many-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Indeed, I studied history and I am being modest 
in saying that I know a thing or two on the subject. And I am not 
alone in Quebec to have studied history. Bear in mind that 
Quebec's motto is ``Je me souviens'', which means I remember. If 
Quebec's identity survived this long, it is because of its long 
memory.
<P>
	Like many other Quebecers, as a student, I was not a 
sovereignist, but this did not prevent me from being critical of the 
confederation. And my criticism is on record. I might have put in 
writing as the editor of the student newspaper and all, but it never 
occurred to me that, someday, a democratic Canada, English 
Canada, a nation that is open, tolerant and respectful of individual 
rights, could actually rely on its weight to crush Quebec's wish, 
tear up the Constitution agreed upon by our forefathers in 1867 and 
replace it with another  constitution that was not recognized by 
Quebec but 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16978"> 16978 </A></B>
<P>
imposed on Quebec, a constitution repudiated by every democratic 
entity and political party in Quebec, including federalist parties.
<P>
	I would never have thought that this kind of thing could happen 
in my country. I would like to tell the Prime Minister, who feels 
that I refer to 1982 too often, that I can understand why that makes 
him uncomfortable. I can understand that, but I want to remind him 
of that sunny day when, along with Her Majesty the Queen of 
England, as Queen in right of Canada, and Mr. Trudeau and 
Mr. Ouellet, he signed, on the lawn of Parliament, the patriation of 
the 1982 Constitution. That day, which was a great day for the rest 
of Canada, is the day that Quebecers' desire to achieve sovereignty 
was exacerbated.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	We can now see that, for someone coming back to lead the 
country, the original version of the Meech lake accord, that is the 
one signed by the then Prime Minister and by all the premiers of 
Canada, was a threat. He perceived that agreement as a terrible 
threat, as something which could undermine what he had 
accomplished, even by encroaching on the collective rights of 
Quebecers.
<P>
	So, what did he do? He did a controlled skid. He realized that he 
should not oppose the recognition of Quebec's very distinct nature, 
that he could not deny that-indeed, it would have been somewhat 
preposterous to say that Quebec is not distinct, given all that 
distinguishes us, and at such a deep level too. So, he kept the 
expression, but did everything possible to make it meaningless.
<P>
	It is at that level that his political work paid off. Make no 
mistake about it: he is a capable and formidable politician. I am 
among those who have the deepest respect for his political 
know-how, as demonstrated by his succeeding in diluting the 
concept of Quebec's distinct nature. What did he do after his 
January speech? He made sure that it would become obvious to Mr. 
Mulroney, who was then Prime Minister, that-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Your friend.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard: </B>Pardon me?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Your pal, your buddy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> They have no class.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, they say that Mr. Mulroney was 
my friend, as though that was a bad thing. Yes, we were friends for 
30 years.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> What did you deliver?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> What do you have to say against Mr. Mulroney? 
What does she have to say against Mr. Mulroney? Let us hear it. 
What does she have to say?
<P>
	<B>One hon. member:</B> Stand up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> This is not the place to discuss personal issues. 
The Deputy Prime Minister should not express any animosity she 
may have towards a person during this debate.
<P>
	Here are the facts: at the time, that man, Brian Mulroney, was 
Prime Minister. He had succeeded in having the Meech Lake 
accord signed on June 3. No one had ever managed to do something 
like that in Canada. Never. Obviously, the Prime Minister is not on 
his way to achieve that either.
<P>
	If I am not mistaken, the opposition organized by the current 
Prime Minister, then a possible candidate, and later an official one, 
for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada, convinced Mr. 
Mulroney and his entourage, of which I was no longer a member, 
that he had to negotiate with him. So, without many people 
knowing about it, I certainly was not awareof it, people decided to 
move closer to the views held by the future Prime Minister, so that 
he, since he controlled the leaders of the provincial Liberal parties 
who were blocking the Meech Lake accord, could remove the 
obstacles and ensure that the accord would be signed, albeit with a 
revised content.
<P>
	That agreement was reached by the so-called Charest 
commission. They agreed on diluting the content of Meech. The 
Quebec caucus of the Conservative party, which was under my 
responsibility, had pledged that the substantive provisions of 
Meech would never be changed. I believe it was in the last days of 
May that we learned there would be a Charest report which had the 
support of the Conservative and Liberal parties, and which diluted 
the recognition of Quebec's distinct nature to such an extent that 
the charter of rights would apply to it, thus having the effect of 
making it sterile.
<P>
	That is when I resigned. I resigned, as did others, as a matter of 
principle. I had not come to Ottawa to support the views of the 
current Prime Minister. I had come here to fight them.
<P>
	So that led in June 1990 to Meech II, son of Meech, watered 
down Meech, wishy-washy Meech, the Prime Minister's Meech 
which was even then rejected by English Canadians for still going 
too far. In Newfoundland, Manitoba and among English Canadians 
in general, two out of three surveys showed that it was still giving 
too much to Quebec, whereas it had become unacceptable for 
Quebec, even for those who had supported it until then.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Then came Charlottetown, where it was diluted still further. This 
is where they started to define recognition of the distinctive nature 
of Quebec; by defining it, of course, they restricted it. They started 
to put it on the same footing as equality between the provinces; 
distinct, equality for all. Everybody was distinct. Something for  
everyone, everyone on the same footing. It no longer had any 
meaning. The people rejected it. Not me, not the wicked separat-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16979"> 16979 </A></B>
<P>
ists, but all of the people of Quebec, all of the people in English 
Canada.
<P>
	So, bye bye Charlottetown.
<P>
	What is this week's incarnation? What are they proposing to us 
now? I have to admit that I have a compliment for the Prime 
Minister: this last attempt to water down distinct character is the 
best yet. This time we do not need a lawyer's opinion appended to 
the resolution to know that it means nothing.
<P>
	Remember, in the somewhat comic episodes involving Meech II, 
there was still some doubt, still some people who were wondering 
``maybe it does still mean something''. Some lawyers signed a 
legal opinion that it meant nothing, which was appended to the 
Meech Lake accord.
<P>
	This time, there is no need to pay any lawyers. There is nothing 
that needs to be appended; all one needs to do is read it to realize it 
means nothing. They took no chances this time.
<P>
	Why? First of all because it leaves untouched the concept of a 
single Canadian people according to the 1982 Constitution. In other 
words, the Prime Minister saved his Constitution, the one that is 
not Quebec's, the one we did not sign but he signed on the steps in 
front of Parliament. His Constitution is intact.
<P>
	There is only one Canadian nation; Quebec is part of all that and 
should live with it and blend in. The identity of the Quebec people? 
Sorry, some other time.
<P>
	Furthermore, what we have here is just a simple resolution. Just 
that. So what does this mean in legal terms, a resolution by 
Parliament, by the House of Commons? It is a wish formally 
expressed by a group of parliamentarians but without any legal 
effect. The courts are not bound by this resolution. A lawyer could 
not even put it before a court, which would refuse to acknowledge 
its existence because legally, a resolution does not exist. It is 
nothing.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Wishful thinking.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Just wishful thinking. And even the House is not 
bound by this resolution. If the House passed the resolution, with 
the Bloc voting against it, of course, if the House, on the strength of 
its majority, were to impose adoption of the resolution, the very 
next morning the resolution would not be binding. The House could 
do anything at all. Imagine if the government were to change. What 
would our Reform Party friends do with the resolution and the 
so-called veto? We will talk about that one tomorrow.
<P>
	It is just a mirage. This resolution is a mirage. Not smoke and 
mirrors, that would be too strong a term, because it implies there is 
more than meets the eye, and  in this case, when you read the 
resolution, it is all there. So this is not a case of smoke and mirrors 
but a mirage.
<P>
	It demonstrates a complete failure to appreciate what Quebecers 
want. I think that when people have been in Ottawa for a few years, 
and it might happen to me because I have been here for some 
time-they tend to become a little isolated from what is happening 
in Quebec. It is almost inevitable. Being on the Hill is like living 
under a glass dome, and because we always breath the same 
oxygen, see the same faces, listen to the same voices, read the same 
newspapers and talk to the same reporters who are listening to us, 
we finally lose touch to some extent-not altogether, of course 
not-with what is going on out there.
<P>
	Remember what it was like in the House the night the 
Charlottetown resolution was adopted. I remember. It was a very 
solemn occasion, of course. The whole House rose to adopt 
Charlottetown, all parties, all members. There were only six or 
seven members- The member for Beaver River was with us, 
members of the Bloc, in the corner, along the curtain, and we voted 
against the resolution. We almost felt embarrassed to do so. I told 
myself that evening: Could it be that the Bloc, having been in 
Ottawa for too long, has lost touch with reality, that it has failed to 
understand that Canadians and Quebecers want the Charlottetown 
accord? Could I be wrong? Could we, the dissident minority, the 
outcasts along the curtain, be wrong? Could we be wrong or could 
all these intelligent people who fly to their ridings every day, who 
meet everybody, who know the issues, who are advised by people 
who are extremely bright, people from the Privy Council, be 
wrong?
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	They were wrong indeed. The people proved them wrong. So I 
was saying that there is something in Ottawa that makes people 
lose touch with reality, at least with Quebec's reality. How can the 
Prime Minister think that Quebecers will be pleased to hear him 
say that he recognizes the fact that they are a distinct society? How 
can he think that this will make us, Quebecers, happy? We certainly 
know that we are a distinct society and we have known it for quite 
some time.
<P>
	What we want is the means to make our own decisions, to plan 
Quebec's future based on our differences. That is what we want, but 
we are not getting it. There is nothing to that effect in the 
resolution.
<P>
	What I am saying basically is that the Prime Minister and his 
colleagues are burying their heads in the sand. By constantly 
refusing to face reality, they eventually sink into some kind of 
surrealism. This is evident from the fact that, from Meech 1 to 
Meech 2 and from Meech 2 to Charlottetown, Quebec was always 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16980"> 16980 </A></B>
<P>
offered less and less. Maybe they offered a little less each time 
because they were tired by their previous effort.
<P>
	They tried Meech 1, it did not work. They offered Quebec a little 
less in Meech 2 and, of course, it did not work either. They offered 
even less in Charlottetown, which was rejected by the people in a 
referendum. So what are they doing now? They are trying again, 
offering less than in Charlottetown this time. And they think that 
Quebec will go for it. They even think that Quebecers are 
fascinated by this debate. Well, they are not. I am sure they will not 
be listening to us today or tomorrow. I am convinced that they have 
now moved on to other things that are of greater concern to them.
<P>
	It has now become the debate of the Prime Minister, who is just 
discovering the distinct society clause, who wakes up at night 
thinking about Quebec's distinct nature. Too late, Mr. Prime 
Minister, it is over. You can sleep at night and dream of other things 
that Quebec's distinct nature. It is a thing from the past, from the 
political past.
<P>
	When I said that the government's approach borders on 
surrealism, let the people be the judge. On the one hand, as I have 
just shown, the federal government's offers are less and less 
meaningful, ever shrinking.
<P>
	At the same time, and moving in the opposite direction, 
Quebec's demands are growing and are more attuned to the reality 
of the people of Quebec. Why? We have only to look at events in 
recent years. In May 1980: 40 per cent of Quebecers give their 
support to a soft question on something that ended up simply being 
a mandate to negotiate, to try to negotiate sovereignty-association. 
Charlottetown, 1992: the Accord reached by all parties and 
governments, including the Government of Quebec under Mr. 
Bourassa, is rejected. In 1995: sovereignty on a hard question, that 
is, the legal and political ability to proclaim sovereignty following 
a yes vote, 49.4 per cent vote in favour.
<P>
	While Quebec, on the move toward sovereignty, is ever 
increasingly achieving its status as a people and wanting to assume 
this status with means that are rightfully its own, the federal 
government offers less and is surprised when the offer is refused. Is 
this surprising? Not to the people in Quebec, at least.
<P>
	What I am saying in fact is that the whole debate on Quebec's 
distinct nature has largely lost its immediate relevance.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Why? First, because, in Quebec, everyone knows that it is 
impossible for English Canada to get its act together enough to 
propose something acceptable to Quebec on this point. This House 
is an example of English Canada, for once. I was talking about the 
other House, which is disconnected from the people of Quebec and 
Canada. At least this House shows us that, in English Canada, there 
are a lot of differences in opinion on the Prime Minister's vision.
<P>
	Therefore, Quebecers who see all this, know what happens in 
English Canada and have lived through 30 years of useless efforts 
know full well that nothing positive will come in response to their 
basic expectations about the recognition of Quebec's distinct 
nature. It is also out of date, because it must be understood that the 
phrase ``Quebec's distinctiveness'' was a compromise right from 
the start. It is a phrase that Mr. Bourassa used out of political 
courtesy, out of political correctness, I would say, to avoid using 
the actual phrase ``the people of Quebec''.
<P>
	He knew that to recognize the people of Quebec would scare the 
federal government and English Canada and that it would never go 
over. So Mr. Bourassa, who has a way with words, who must have 
read the old reports of the Laurendeau-Dunton Commission, found 
this phrase, included it in his speech, and ended up making it one of 
the conditions for Quebec's joining the 1982 Constitution.
<P>
	But English Canada saw right through it. People have great 
instincts. I think that people in both Quebec and English Canada 
have very sound political instincts. English Canada realized, 
perhaps more or less consciously, that behind the phrase ``Quebec's 
distinct society'' lurked the phrase ``the people of Quebec'', and 
that is why they rejected the agreement. That is why they will 
always refuse to recognize Quebec's distinctiveness, as they have 
done so far. If we ask them, and if Quebec does not act to secure 
this recognition, they will always refuse. They will never let a 
Prime Minister of Canada turn this recognition into a legal reality.
<P>
	I just said that I urge the Prime Minister to be realistic. I would 
also like to tell him that I want to preach by example and that we in 
Quebec now intend to face reality. First of all, everyone in Quebec 
is tired of talking about the Constitution. Everyone is sick and tired 
of hearing these phrases that keep changing year after year and 
month after month: special status, asymmetrical federalism-that 
one was quite a find; we never found out what it meant but it will 
probably be explained to us some day-, equitable federalism, 
cultural sovereignty, distinct society, and also ``equality or 
independence'' and then ``masters in our own home'', all this to go 
around in circles.
<P>
	The people of Quebec know that we have tried everything, that 
we have gone through the dictionary, and that all these efforts have 
led nowhere. It is time for a reality check; the people have had 
enough of these debates. Second, we in Quebec have more pressing 
priorities like government finances. In Quebec, the integrity of our 
public finances-which, incidentally, are in better shape that the 
federal government's, but that is none of my concern since I am not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16981"> 16981 </A></B>
<P>
responsible for managing federal affairs, while the Parti Quebecois 
may entrust me with the public finances of Quebec-is a basic  
requirement, not only as a matter of correctness or sound 
management practice.
<P>
	No, in Quebec-and it is the same in Ottawa, I am sure-putting 
our fiscal house in order is a matter of restoring our ability to 
choose. Unless the government's financial base is restored, no one 
will have any choice any more. There is no point in holding debates 
on the environment, the Constitution, the future of political 
systems, export policy, social assistance or any other issue, if steps 
are not taken to ensure that the government will be able to make 
choices.
<P>
	Any government that is in a financial squeeze has no room to 
breathe and can no longer carry out its basic function. That is why 
we in Quebec, if the Parti Quebecois puts its trust in me, will 
address this problem. I will not waste any time reading 
constitutional proposals made by the Prime Minister if they look 
anything like this. There are other priorities, but these will be dealt 
with in greater detail in Quebec City. We may participate in 
discussions. After all, we are still part of the federal system. I can 
see where the Prime Minister is coming from. I heard his plea the 
other day, when he said he was prepared to discuss in the interest of 
the people of Quebec and Canada. But in the meantime, anything 
that may be in the interest of Quebec will not fall on deaf ears if the 
Parti Quebecois puts its trust in me.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	What Quebec wants, when all is said and done, with respect to 
the Constitution-a discussion that may continue tomorrow again, 
for the Prime Minister has yet another proposal to make to us 
tomorrow; the Prime Minister is suddenly becoming very active, 
hyperactive even, in connection with the Constitution-let us be 
clear right from the start, what Quebec wants, what we need, with 
respect to the Constitution, we know we cannot expect from either 
the federal government or English Canada. We know that we are 
the only ones who can give it to ourselves, take it for ourselves, and 
to the extent that our future as a people, the remedy for our present 
problems, the flowering of our economic, social and cultural 
identity, is linked to our status as a people. We now know, from the 
message we are receiving from English Canada, particularly after 
today's inadequate resolution, that it is up to us to give ourselves 
the status of a people.
<P>
	We have nothing to ask for, nothing to beg for from the federal 
government and English Canada. We do not mean this arrogantly; 
we are merely speaking as adults. We have attained a sort of 
political maturity which comes from all of the conclusions we have 
drawn from all of those years of empty discussions, of going 
around in circles. English Canadians are also familiar with this; 
they are just as tired and disillusioned as we are. So Quebec knows 
that its rendezvous with the future is a rendezvous with itself, that it 
will involve a referendum, that it will  address Quebec's 
sovereignty so that Quebec may come into its own as a people.
<P>
	I would like to say to the Prime Minister that it might happen, 
perhaps not here in this House but one day-whether I take over the 
responsibilities I shall be seeking shortly or someone else 
does-that whoever becomes the Premier of Quebec might face 
him across the table. I hope that this will come to pass. My personal 
wish, in the interests of Quebec and of Canada, although I am 
aware that it is harder to convince Canada of this than Quebec, is 
that one day a premier of Quebec will find himself across the table 
from his federal counterpart, precisely for the purpose of 
discussing political systems.
<P>
	But I would not want this Premier to stand alone like his 
predecessors, those who failed, who paid a high personal price and 
sometimes made Quebec pay a high price as well and caused strong 
tensions in relations between Quebec and the rest of Canada. Not 
that we did not send good negotiators. Not that the people who 
came here to negotiate on behalf of Quebec, as Premiers, were not 
competent. I would say we sent our best people. No one could be 
better than René Lévesque to negotiate for Quebec.
<P>
	But from now on, the situation will be different, because the 
Premiers who will come to talk about the Constitution and political 
arrangements will come with a mandate from the people of 
Quebec. They will not be out to retaliate, to be aggressive, to be 
negative. No. They will come with respect but confident, with the 
confidence of a prime minister, a head of state, who has received a 
mandate for sovereignty from the people. In other words, we will 
negotiate as equals, and then we will be able to agree, and only 
then. As long as Quebec comes here as a province like the others, 
we will never be able to agree, because those who came here and 
failed when they represented Quebec were not always separatists, 
as the Prime Minister said. Very often, and I would say in most 
cases, they were federalists. But success escaped them as well.
<P>
	Why? Because Quebec federalists are Quebec nationalists, first 
and foremost. They realize that Quebecers cannot develop their 
potential unless they do so as a group, and as such they must have 
the resources and the capability to define their own policies.
<P>
	I am not saying we will no longer speak to each other. We will 
have to, all the time. We are neighbours and partners through our 
history and all kinds of connections. We are practically doomed to 
talk to each other. That being the case, and I offer this advice in all 
modesty to the Prime Minister, he will have to be careful not to 
waste the capital of good will that is left. If we keep tossing 
resolutions back and forth and discussing the kind of futilities we 
have before us today, it will create more false hopes and perhaps 
fuel feelings of resentment. Let us be careful.

<P>
	Let us call some kind of truce where we can address our primary 
concerns. I just mentioned what we have to do in Quebec. I do not 
know when we will be able to come back to this discussion. It may 
be sooner than the Prime Minister thinks. Who knows? This time 
we will not let him know one year in advance. Let us create the 
climate that will have to prevail when we have this real meeting, 
this real discussion, where we will have to and, for the first time, be 
able to look realistically and lucidly, but with a chance at 
succeeding, at defining a new partnership between Canada and 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.
<P>
	Every day, the Prime Minister has to face our questions, 
including questions on this motion. Could we have a question 
period for each member who addresses the House? I ask for the 
unanimous consent of the House and for the consent of the Bloc 
Quebecois to ask questions following this important speech by the 
leader of that party, maybe the longest speech of the century. I hope 
that the Bloc Quebecois will have the courage to accept our 
questions.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is not a matter of courage. We have rules in this 
House. The member has asked for unanimous consent. Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There is no unanimous consent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We will continue with the debate. I say this only so that we all 
understand. The hon. leader of the Reform Party because of the 
rules will have 20 minutes and then there will be questions and 
answers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today I address the motion of the Prime Minister calling 
on the House to recognize Quebec as a distinct society within 
Canada.
<P>
	Let me begin by reminding the House why we are even 
considering such a motion at this time. As hon. members know, last 
month the Prime Minister came very close to losing the Quebec 
referendum on secession. It is now generally agreed that there are 
two principal reasons for this.
<P>
	First, there was no sustained effort made by the federalist forces 
to make clear in advance of the referendum the terms and 
conditions Canada would demand in the event of a secession 
attempt. Thus the separatists were allowed to perpetuate the fiction 
that a separate Quebec would simply enter into a new and better 
economic union with Canada. Over 30 per cent of the people who 
voted yes on October 30 thought they  could do so and still retain 
all the benefits of being Canadian.
<P>
	The second was the demand for change in Quebec. The demand 
for real systemic change was grossly underestimated by the Prime 
Minister and the no side. Rather than countering the separatist 
dream with a federalist vision of a new and better Canada, the 
federalists offered the status quo plus administrative tinkering.
<P>
	It was only in the last week of the campaign that the Prime 
Minister felt compelled by events to offer something to Quebec 
which could be construed as change. What he offered was not a 
new vision of the federalism of the 21st century, nor a realignment 
of federal and provincial powers, which has been demanded by 
large numbers of people inside and outside of Quebec.
<P>
	What the Prime Minister offered were Mulroney leftovers, two 
items resurrected from the discredited Meech Lake and 
Charlottetown accords. These were the concept of a constitutional 
veto for the government of Quebec and a distinct society clause, the 
subject of the motion before us.
<P>
	I remind the House that Reform favours a fundamentally 
different approach to confronting the separatist threat and 
preserving the federal union. Our approach is two-tracked. On the 
one hand, we offer a package of 20 changes in the federal system 
which can be accomplished without constitutional negotiation, 
changes which strengthen the power of the federal government to 
preserve the economic union, which strengthen the position of the 
provinces with respect to the natural resources, social services, 
culture and language, and which reform federal institutions to 
make them more representative and accountable.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	At the same time, we insist on the development of a Canadian 
position on terms and conditions of separation, terms and 
conditions which Canada would insist on if any province actually 
attempts to secede.
<P>
	I have vowed as a federal political leader that as long as I have 
anything to do with it, federalists will never go into another contest 
with Quebec separatists as ill prepared, as ill equipped and as ill led 
as they were the last time.
<P>
	The next time, and it will be the last time, we will fight separatist 
dreams with a federalist vision of the future and we will fight 
separatist illusions with the naked truth about what separation from 
Canada really means.
<P>
	Therefore I speak as one who fundamentally disagrees with the 
Prime Minister's strategy or lack of strategy on national unity and 
who feels that this motion and the other elements of the Prime 
Minister's Quebec package are backward steps.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16983"> 16983 </A></B>
<P>
	Having said this, my colleagues and I have applied ourselves 
to the Prime Minister's motion to see if there is any way it could 
be amended to permit the statutory recognition of the historical, 
linguistic and cultural distinctiveness of Quebec without the 
negative consequences that have led to the rejection of previous 
attempts to accomplish the same end.
<P>
	I have three proposals to make embodied in three amendments. I 
urge the government to consider these amendments carefully 
because in our judgment they are essential to giving the Prime 
Minister's motion even a 50:50 chance of gaining acceptance 
outside of Quebec.
<P>
	Our first proposal pertains to safeguarding the equality of the 
provinces. During the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accord 
discussions, as many members will remember, the biggest single 
objection to the inclusion of any distinct society clause for Quebec 
was that it would confer on the Government of Quebec powers not 
conferred on the other provinces. In other words, the concern was 
and is that the distinct society clause would violate the concept of 
equality of the provinces.
<P>
	The Prime Minister in his remarks a few minutes ago hastened to 
assure us this is not the intention of the federal government; it is 
not its intention to grant Quebec special powers or status by virtue 
of this motion. If the government really means that, it will have no 
hesitancy in supporting our first amendment to the motion, the 
inclusion of a clear statement that nothing in this resolution shall 
confer on or be interpreted as conferring on the legislature or 
Government of Quebec any new legislative or executive powers, 
proprietary rights, status or any other rights or privileges not 
conferred on the legislature or government of any other province.
<P>
	This amendment is essential to reconcile the motion before us 
with the principle of equality of the provinces. This is necessary to 
get similar types of motions through most of the provincial 
legislatures.
<P>
	Our second proposal pertains to safeguarding minority rights in 
Quebec. One of the legitimate concerns of minorities within 
Quebec, the English speaking minority, the aboriginal minority and 
other ethnic minorities, and the Prime Minister made reference to 
this, is that recognition of Quebec as a distinct society could be 
used by an overzealous separatist government to diminish their 
rights, in particular their educational rights and rights to freedom of 
speech.
<P>
	The fears of such minorities were aroused on the night of the 
referendum when the premier of Quebec blamed ethnic voters for 
defeating the referendum, implying those voters were not part of 
Quebec's distinct society. The fears of such minorities will be 
heightened, not allayed, by clause 2 of the Prime Minister's motion 
because it says Quebec's distinct society includes its French 
speaking majority but says nothing about the distinct society's 
including Quebec's minorities.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	A few minutes ago the Prime Minister said: ``Quebecers who 
come from other parts of the world are full-fledged Quebecers. We 
have not forgotten them''. The reality is that he has forgotten to 
include them in the definition of distinct society included in clause 
2 of his motion.
<P>
	The Prime Minister will hasten to assure these Quebecers that it 
is not the intention of the federal government to allow the Quebec 
government to use any designation of Quebec as a distinct society 
to circumscribe the rights of minorities. Surely no federalist in this 
House and surely no Liberal would ever want this distinct society 
clause to be harnessed to the cause of ethnic nationalism by any 
Quebec government.
<P>
	Again, if that is the case, and if the government is sincere in its 
claim, then it will welcome the second amendment to its motion, 
namely the inclusion of a clear statement that nothing in this 
resolution shall diminish or be interpreted as diminishing in any 
way the rights and freedoms of any resident of Quebec.
<P>
	This amendment is essential to safeguarding minority rights in 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> It was in Charlottetown.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> It is not in here.
<P>
	A third proposal is to safeguard the integrity of Canada. There is 
one further change required to the Prime Minister's motion to 
ensure that it does not reinforce and assist the separatists in the next 
referendum on separation. The Prime Minister is well aware that 
for 20 years or more the separatists have been telling Quebecers 
that because Quebec is a distinct society, therefore it should be a 
sovereign state. We heard that again today. By affirming the first 
part of that sentence, which is what the Prime Minister's motion 
does, the federal government runs the risk of legitimizing the 
second part of the sentence.
<P>
	Again, I assume the goodwill and good intentions on the part of 
the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will hasten to assure us that 
it is not the intention of the federal government to allow the 
separatist Government of Quebec to use the distinct society clause 
to legitimize the division of Canada. If the government is sincere in 
that claim, then it will welcome and endorse our third amendment 
to the motion, namely the inclusion of a clear statement that 
nothing in this resolution shall deny or be interpreted as denying 
that Canada constitutes one nation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, I urge the Prime Minister to not follow in the 
footsteps of the former Conservative Prime Minister, who ensured 
Quebecers that these proposals were acceptable to the rest of 
Canada, when in fact they were not.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16984"> 16984 </A></B>
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister to tell Quebecers that his motion will 
not get the support of a majority of Canadians outside Quebec, 
nor will it get the support of the provinces. Only by amending it 
will that motion stand a better chance of being approved.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If the government will amend the motion as proposed, 
Reformers will support the amended motion, notwithstanding our 
belief that it will contribute little or nothing to the unification of the 
federation. However, if the government votes down these 
amendments, if it puts its commitment to distinct society ahead of 
the equality of the provinces, if it puts its commitment to distinct 
society ahead of minority rights in Quebec, if it puts its 
commitment to distinct society ahead of the unity and the integrity 
of Canada as one nation, then we will vote against the motion and 
we will encourage every citizen loyal to Canada to oppose the 
motion as well.
<P>
	I therefore move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by adding immediately after the word 
``accordingly'', the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``5. Nothing in this resolution shall:</BLOCKQUOTE>
(i) confer or be interpreted as conferring upon the legislature or 
government of Quebec, any new legislative or executive powers, 
proprietary rights, status, or any other rights or privileges not conferred on 
the legislature or government of any province;
<P>
(ii) diminish or be interpreted as diminishing in any way the rights and 
freedoms of any resident of Quebec;
<P>
(iii) deny or be interpreted as denying that Canada constitutes one nation''.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, of course we are going to entertain 
questions and comments for 10 minutes. I will take these 
amendments under advisement and I will return to the House no 
later than tomorrow's sitting, after I have had a look at them.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was somewhat intrigued by the hon. member's sudden 
concern for the minorities in Quebec. When we look at the platform 
of the Reform Party, one of its principal proposals is to repeal the 
Official Languages Act. As a matter of fact, it is not only to repeal 
the Official Languages Act but to replace it with a policy whereby 
Quebec would be for the most part French speaking and the rest of 
the provinces would be English speaking.
<P>
	I can recall debating in the official languages committee time 
after time with the Reform representative on that committee, what I 
consider to be a very hostile proposal to the minorities in Quebec. 
It is a geographical type of bilingualism where Reform would 
recognize, maybe in the city of Montreal, bilingual rights, or in 
some other small part of Quebec, but for the rest  of Quebec it 
would be entirely French speaking. By the way, it would sell out 
the French speaking minorities in the other provinces as well.
<P>
	I am intrigued but not totally surprised by the approach of the 
leader of the Reform Party today. He seems to jump on any 
opportunity for political gain.
<P>
	Does this mean that he is withdrawing his platform proposals to 
repeal the Official Languages Act and his proposals for geographic 
linguistic rights to now adopt a policy for all of Canada whereby 
we will recognize bilingualism?
<P>
	The Official Languages Act has a balance within it whereby we 
recognize the rights of anglophones in Quebec and we recognize 
the rights of francophones outside Quebec, including Ontario, the 
west and the Atlantic provinces. Is that what he is now proposing or 
is he simply proposing this provision today for Quebec minorities 
but tomorrow for something else?
<P>
	I also want to remind him that this is not an amendment to the 
Constitution or to the legislation; it is put forward as a formal 
resolution of this House and a commitment to the Quebec people, 
but it is not a constitutional amendment or legislation. 
Consequently, his proposed amendments to the Official Languages 
Act would be more harmful to the minorities in Quebec than what 
he is proposing as an amendment to this resolution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, somewhere in the hon. member's 
remarks there were about three questions.
<P>
	First, we recognize that this motion is not a constitutional 
motion. We also recognize that senior members of the government 
have implied that if this is passed by the House it may be imported 
into the Constitution at a later date. That is why we gave it the 
scrutiny which we did.
<P>
	Second, with respect to minority rights, in the area of language 
the Reform Party advocates more jurisdiction over language being 
given to the provinces and private associations. That will be more 
popular in Quebec than the current policy of the current 
government. The second thing we say however is that the sole role 
of the federal government should be the protection of the rights of 
minorities from discrimination on the basis of race, language and 
culture.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	Our argument is that under our language policy the federal 
government is no longer both a player and a referee in the language 
area. It is just a referee and it can provide more protection by 
playing that role.
<P>
	The third point I would make is if the hon. member is sincere, 
which I think he is, in wanting protection for the rights of 
minorities in Quebec, that would surely lead him to urge his 
colleagues to support at least the second of these amendments we 
have put forward.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16985"> 16985 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
glad to hear the hon. member say he supports minority rights. 
However, people should be judged not by what they say but by 
what they do.
<P>
	The member's party has held a position which has now been 
proven to be against the charter of rights, which is not to allow 
turbanned Sikhs in the RCMP. His party stood against that group to 
say they should not be allowed in the RCMP. Recently in the courts 
it was ruled that to keep them out would be against the charter of 
rights.
<P>
	I would like to ask the leader of the third party whether he would 
support that ruling in the courts and whether he supports turbanned 
Sikhs in the RCMP.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question has nothing to do with 
this debate here today. Our point is the Reform Party is committed 
to the defence of human rights and the use of the power of the 
federal government to do that.
<P>
	We argue that when the government gets to be both a player and 
a referee in a policy area, whether it is multiculturalism or 
linguistic policy, what suffers is its capacity to be the referee. 
Again I would say to the member if he wants to not just talk but to 
act, if he is really concerned about minority rights, he will support 
the second of these amendments we have put forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder (Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday and today the third party and the 
leader of the third party talked about our proposal on the regions of 
Canada. We proposed four. He has said there should be five.
<P>
	My question to the leader is: Is the fifth region B.C. or Alberta?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is B.C.
<P>
	The other point the member misses which will come up when we 
discuss the bill, is that the bigger issue is giving this constitutional 
veto to the people or the government. We know that all the 
members here were embarrassed by the flip-flopping of the Prime 
Minister on that subject. One day he told this House that he meant 
to give that veto to the people of Quebec. Then he said yesterday 
that no, he was going to give it to the Government of Quebec. He 
was going to give a separatist government a constitutional veto 
over the Constitution of Canada.
<P>
	If the hon. member wants to ask questions about that bill, he 
should direct them to the Prime Minister.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, you may rest assured I am not rising to sing. As 
a French Canadian, however, I am delighted to speak at this historic 
moment  on the motion of the Prime Minister recognizing that the 
people of ``la belle province'' form a distinct society within our 
country and ensuring that our legislation and our actions will be 
guided by this reality.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	A few weeks ago, Canadians from sea to sea showed their 
support for Quebec with a demonstration in Montreal and a number 
of other activities.
<P>
	Our Prime Minister on our behalf and on his own, as a proud 
Quebecer and an honest Canadian, is confirming his commitment 
to recognize Quebec's distinct society. I applaud him on my own 
behalf and on behalf of the people of Madawaska-Victoria and 
especially on behalf of all the people of Canada who believe in the 
strength, determination and positive vision of his leadership for the 
future of our country and of our children, wherever they may be in 
this great and wonderful country.
<P>
	During the referendum period, I canvassed people's homes. I 
also listened to the fine emotional speeches devoid of truth given 
by the separatist wizards in Quebec. How can anyone be trying, in a 
democratic and modern society, to lull Quebecers to sleep as in the 
time of Duplessis?
<P>
	The PQ even spent millions on hidden studies to see if they could 
not come up with an extra dose of sleeping tablets so Quebecers 
would swallow all their speeches.
<P>
	From his emperor's throne, the leader of the Bloc even dared 
tamper with the freedom of the women of Quebec-ah, white only 
and preferably old stock-telling them they should be pregnant and 
in the kitchen. I can assure you that if such a statement had been 
aimed at women in New Brunswick or Canada, the Canadian 
society as a whole, not just women, would have been up in arms 
and would have deposited the leader, regardless of his political 
allegiance.
<P>
	A while ago, I listened to the leader of the opposition, the leader 
of the Bloc Quebecois. I must say that if I were in a position to give 
him an award, a trophy for his separatist theatrics, I would do it 
right now in recognition of the drama he added to the debate this 
afternoon.
<P>
	I noted, among other things, that this great actor talked about the 
prime minister doing an about face concerning Quebec as a distinct 
society. This great actor who likes to talk about other politicians 
doing about faces should look at his own track record regarding his 
political allegiance over the past 20 years. When it was opportune 
to be a federalist, he espoused the federalist discourse, but when a 
separatist discourse became more opportune, he went that way.
<P>
	The past 20 years in the life of this great actor will result in his 
being remembered in history books in Quebec as the number one 
actor in terms of the Quebec people and its future.
<P>
<B></B>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="16986"> 16986 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	I can understand the total confusion of the Bloc Quebecois leader 
who, today in this House, must decide whether or not he will 
support the recognition of Quebec as a distinct society, at a time 
when he is making grand political speeches as he prepares to 
embark on another great adventure, heading for political life in 
Quebec. I can see his confusion.
<P>
	Honestly, does he really believe in the distinct society for 
Quebecers? Does he believe in it or will he try once again, for 
personal political gain, to trick the Quebec people into following 
him?
<P>
	I would also like to remind the leader of the Bloc that, when they 
talk about respect, when they ask for respect for the Quebec people, 
naturally they must also respect all of the Canadian population, 
people like me, a French Canadian living in New-Brunswick, not in 
English speaking Canada like the grand master of this terminology, 
former Prime Minister Mulroney, taught them repeatedly. He also 
spoke of tearing up the Constitution. I must admit he is a good 
pupil of the former Prime Minister of Canada.
<P>
	Today's leadership will no doubt be followed by that of 
provincial premiers who will certainly look after their own 
interests first. I would like to remind them that there must be some 
kind of basis for these interests, a foundation if you will. Since the 
foundation of our country in 1867, Quebec has been recognized, 
not in so many words but by institutions; just read the 1867 
Constitution. Each pillar of the foundation supports our country, 
Canada, and is part of it.
<P>
	My Quebec roots go back to 1642 when my ancestors settled in 
the Boucherville region and I am proud to be a French Canadian 
like the more than a million others all over Canada who feel close 
to the seven million Quebecers and share their pride.
<P>
	I am one of those who want to build and not destroy, one of those 
who welcome the global challenges of the year 2000. We should 
join together, not go our separate ways like some egocentric 
politicians are preaching.
<P>
	I did not sing, even tough my heart and my head agree with this 
motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but your time is up.
<P>
	Do I have the unanimous consent of the House to give the 
member a few minutes more?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Very well. You have two more minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you and I thank 
my colleagues for this expression of great democracy in the House.
<P>
	I thank our Prime Minister who fulfilled his commitments and 
those of Canadians from all across the  country. Contrary to what 
these horror story tellers and these wizards have said, we did in fact 
act with respect and honour before, during and after the October 30 
referendum, whether or not it suits these separatists who would like 
to swindle Quebecers out of a promising future within Canada.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very carefully to the comments made by the hon. member from 
New Brunswick, and I must say that it is true, that we on this side 
are very proud. We are very proud of our leader, because our leader 
has the courage to tell the truth in this House. All Bloc members are 
proud of their leader because, during the election campaign, he said 
things that were true, put historic events in their context, and made 
us proud of being members of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	The hon. member told us that she wanted to build and not to 
destroy. The goal of the Bloc Quebecois, of all Quebec 
sovereignists, is also to build, but to build Quebec, our homeland, 
our country, so that it can fulfil our aspirations. At the same time, 
we want to work with the rest of Canada.
<P>
	We have proposed a formula for partnership with the rest of 
Canada. It was extraordinary. The Fathers of the Canadian 
Confederation, who represented Lower Canada, would tell us that 
we are right, over 120 years later, to propose changes in North 
America north of the U.S. because the current system no longer 
works.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's proposal is a case in point. He cannot even 
approach his provincial counterparts to try to get something 
enshrined in the Constitution. All they are offering us is a motion of 
the House that is practically meaningless, that is not worth the 
paper it is printed on.
<P>
	It is important, I think, to weigh our words in this House, to show 
Quebec a little respect. Quebec was one of the four provinces that 
founded this country, but the time has come to move on. The rest of 
Canada should understand this.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not find a question in what the hon. 
member opposite said but, in his remarks, he complained about the 
Prime Minister's unwillingness to entrench the principles of 
distinct society in the Constitution, when the Leader of the 
Opposition himself is on record as saying that he did not want to 
deal with constitutional changes any more.
<P>
	A minimum of consistency is indicated, do you not think? Public 
statements cannot be made to mean different things from day to 
day, depending on the circumstances. Our colleague from the Bloc 
Quebecois also indicated that he was in favour of a partnership with 
Canada. The Canadian federation is indeed a partnership between 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16987"> 16987 </A></B>
<P>
the ten provinces and the two territories. There  is no bigger and 
better example of partnership than what we have right now.
<P>
	Take the European Community for example. These countries are 
in the process of establishing a federation like ours because they 
have seen how successful this kind of partnership is. So, when I 
hear-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Come on now.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> I guess some members of this House 
cannot take the truth when they hear it. When I hear members say 
that the system does not work-I would like the hon. member to 
comment on this-and talk about areas of responsibility and 
jurisdiction-
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	Personally, as a New Brunswicker, I find that totally 
unacceptable. I cannot understand that the people of Quebec would 
go along with that. Dropping out of school is a serious problem in 
Quebec in an area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. This is 
totally unacceptable.
<P>
	At a time when the whole world is moving toward a major 
achievement in ensuring education for people of all ages, wherever 
they live, Quebec is stalling. And this is an exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	As for what the hon. member opposite said, I think he should 
take a good look at his government's policies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great conviction that I support the Prime 
Minister's motion to officially recognize that Quebec is a distinct 
society within Canada, because of its language, culture, tradition 
and French speaking majority.
<P>
	I am deeply attached to Canada. But I also freely chose to live in 
Quebec. I chose to do my best to promote Quebec's society and 
quality of life. I chose to raise my children in Quebec and make 
them benefit from what is truly the heart of Canada's history, 
culture, heritage and duality.
<P>
	I live in Montreal, the urban gem of Canada. In spite of all the 
obstacles, constitutional and others, in spite of all the attempts to 
divide its French and English speaking communities, Montreal 
remains a city where the Canadian duality is felt daily, but in great 
harmony. It is a place where francophones and anglophones live 
and work in peace and real harmony.
<P>
	Montreal is unique because of its cultural and linguistic duality, 
but also because of the contribution made by so many other 
communities which have given Montreal its unique character as a 
cosmopolitan, friendly, warm and extraordinary city.
<P>
	I had the privilege, after a business career, to enter politics and 
begin my political life in Quebec's National Assembly. I wanted to 
do my best to make a contribution and help Quebec fulfil its goals.
<P>
	While an MNA, I worked with two persons who are now 
members of this House, the hon. member for 
Beauharnois-Salaberry, and the hon. member for Roberval. We 
did not agree and we did not see things the same way, but we all 
worked to promote the well-being of Quebecers, because we felt 
that it was our common objective.
<P>
	It was during my term as a member of the Quebec National 
Assembly that I had the opportunity to defend the Meech Lake 
Accord, to vote for the Meech Lake Accord which was supposed to 
include for the first time in the Canadian Constitution the 
recognition of Quebec as a distinct society, which would make 
Quebec a part of the Constitution of 1982.
<P>
	I listened to the leader of the Opposition with a great deal of 
respect, with all the respect he is due, as he explained to us how and 
why he and the Parti québécois had not supported the Meech Lake 
Accord, why they had voted against the Meech Lake Accord and, 
after that, against the Charlottetown Accord.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	Despite all these explanations, I am convinced that the 
fundamental reason is that, whatever the accord, whatever the 
proposal that is made to either party, the Parti québécois or the 
Bloc, which are fundamentally dedicated to Quebec's 
independence, will reject it. Whatever the proposal that is put to the 
sovereignists in order to make Canada work better, to rebuild 
Canada, to renew Canada, it is logical that these parties, the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Parti québécois, will reject it because, 
fundamentally, as the leader of the Opposition himself emphasized 
before the media, he is not interested in receiving proposals 
because, he said: ``I am a sovereignist.''
<P>
	That is fair enough, but they should not try to delude us into 
believing that they considered these proposals objectively because, 
fundamentally, they do not believe in them, they do not want them.
<P>
	I found it quite ironic that the Leader of the Opposition should 
give lessons to the Prime Minister telling him: ``While you will 
take care of the Constitution, I will be doing something else, I will 
be putting Quebec's financial house in order''. How ironical. We 
all know very well that the leader of the Bloc Quebecois' purpose 
when he created this party involved the constitutional issue of 
separating Quebec from Canada.
<P>
	Since his election, before his election, every day in the House of 
Commons, the constitutional issue has been the principal subject of 
debate. The Parti Quebecois, the Bloc Quebecois' ally in Quebec 
City, naturally spoke  about the constitutional issue and the 
separation of Quebec throughout the electoral campaign. That is 
what happened before and during the election of the Parti 
Quebecois and throughout its life in government up until the 
referendum. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16988"> 16988 </A></B>
<P>
All they talked about was the Constitution, separation and 
independence.
<P>
	Today, the Leader of the Opposition has the gall to tell us: ``We 
will set the Constitution aside and we will deal with public affairs''. 
Yet, it was the Parti Quebecois government that said, during the 
election campaign, it would choose another way of governing, of 
managing public affairs more efficiently. All that has happened in 
Quebec, all that the Bloc Quebecois has done since its election, has 
been to talk about the independence of Quebec. According to them, 
nothing is working in the federal government or in Canada, 
naturally.
<P>
	Every day in the House, it is the same thing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Montreal, the economic motor of Quebec and 50 per cent of its 
population, is severely sick. In many quarters of Montreal the 
economy is dying. Investment is drying up. Leases are being 
curtailed or cancelled. Anybody who knows and follows what is 
going on in Montreal today will say that it is a sick city. The 
economy of Montreal is in desperate straits.
<P>
	Meanwhile, what have we done? We have spent time and money 
on commissions, studies and propaganda instead of looking after 
the well-being of the citizens of Quebec. Today we are told that at 
last this is what they are going to be doing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I will vote with conviction for this motion because I firmly 
believe that the place of Quebec, which is the heart and soul of 
Canada, is within Canada and that its destiny and that of Canada are 
intertwined forever. That is why, on the day the vote is taken, I will 
proudly stand and vote with conviction in favour of the prime 
minister's motion. I invite all hon. members to give it strong 
support.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know this is a 
solemn day and, if I may say, it is the day of awakening for Canada. 
This awakening has been triggered by the resolution introduced by 
the Prime Minister. I must admit that I find it rather amusing. Since 
our arrival here two years ago we have been called all sorts of 
things. The favourite nickname given to us is separatists, but after 
two years this government finally gave birth to this resolution 
which is meaningless, in our view.
<P>
	Why is this resolution meaningless? Why are the members 
opposite surprised by our reaction, by our position on all this? I am 
astonished. Actually, I think I understand. When the Prime 
Minister says he does not  listen to Radio-Canada because he wants 
a good night's sleep, he has deprived himself of a good source of 
information. If the Prime Minister had listened to all the media 
without distinction in Quebec and if he had read all of the 
newspapers, he would already know that Quebec has already stated 
loud and clear what it wants.
<P>
	What we see here today is no response to that. And one should 
not be surprised. Some of my colleagues from the Atlantic region 
understand pretty well what I mean because I have been telling 
them for two years what sovereignty is all about and what the 
difference between a sovereignist and a separatist is. This is the 
period for questions and comments, but I think I will focus on 
comments tonight.
<P>
	I have been explaining to them for two years the difference 
between a sovereignist and a separatist. Mr. Speaker, you were here 
when the issue was raised in this House and I told the House what 
Quebec wants to be, because if you want to inform people you have 
to repeat the message people wish to convey. This is why I had 
explained that a sovereignist is someone who is able to assert and 
accept himself.
<P>
	I believe they understood in part what it means to be a 
sovereignist or to assert oneself. My honourable colleagues have 
even used the expression in a bill, which says that Canada wants to 
affirm its sovereignty over its oceans. I have nothing against that, 
but we have been blamed for two years for using the same 
expression.
<P>
	What are we to think when the members opposite try to scold us? 
We have been told that the regional commissions on the future of 
Quebec were phoney. They have once more deprived themselves of 
an incomparable source of information. Mr. Speaker, I can see that 
you are getting impatient. I will now stop speaking but first I wish 
to say that I will continue my colleagues' education on what 
Quebec really wants. May I add that they really did not choose the 
right way today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. First of all, perhaps 
the member should talk to his leader, who said that there was no 
difference, describing himself as a separatist in Washington. I think 
that, in his mind, the words sovereignist and separatist had the 
same meaning. He boasted about being a separatist in Washington 
and was very proud of that. So I thought there was no difference, 
taking the leader of the opposition at his word.
<P>
	The member talks about Quebec as if he was speaking on behalf 
of all Quebecers. Let me remind him that, on referendum day, a 
little over 49 per cent of Quebecers voted in favour of his option, 
but the majority voted for the other option. So it seems to me that 
the majority of Quebecers have stated their position. If it changes 
some day, then so be it. However, for the time being, what counts is 
that we have won a totally democratic referendum despite a totally 
vague question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16989"> 16989 </A></B>
<P>
	We won a referendum in which Quebec clearly chose to follow 
the lead given by the Prime Minister, which is to have recognition 
of the distinct society, to give a veto to Quebec and to sort out 
jurisdictions. That is what we will do, and that is what we are in 
the process of doing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> A point of order, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 5.30 p.m. this is now private 
members' time. Perhaps there is a compromise that if we allow this 
point of order we can add time to private members' hour so that 
members will not be deprived of any of their time.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, as members know, an amendment to 
the main motion was introduced by the Reform Party a little while 
ago by the hon. leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	I have had an opportunity to examine the motion and I want to 
briefly indicate to the Speaker that I contend the motion is 
irreceivable and out of order. The motion confers-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is debating the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I am not debating the motion. I am challenging the 
receivability of the motion. I understand Mr. Speaker will be ruling 
on it tomorrow morning and it is customary for us when a motion 
comes into the House to argue whether-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As indicated before, this time will be 
added to the private members' hour. The hon. member cannot be 
interrupted on a point of order. When he is finished I will hear other 
members on the same point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, the amendment in question refers to 
conferring on the legislature or the Government of Quebec new 
executive powers, propriety rights and so on. It also refers to 
privileges not conferred on the legislature or the government of any 
province; in other words, provinces including Quebec but possibly 
other provinces as well.
<P>
	Our parliamentary precedents, Beauchesne's sixth edition, page 
176, citation 579 says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) An amendment setting forth a proposition dealing with a matter which is 
foreign to the proposition involved in the main motion is not relevant and 
cannot be moved.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) An amendment may not raise a new question which can only be 
considered in a distinct motion after proper notice.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is on those two points that I believe the amendment is 
irreceivable. I have indicated that it introduces two new concepts in 
subsection (i) which are not referred to in the original motion.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker will also be guided by the decision of 1923 when the 
Speaker of the House decided that the report of a parliamentary 
committee as a prerequisite to  accepting a particular initiative was 
a new concept because it was not in the main motion and was 
therefore out of order. Similarly, subsection (i) of this amendment 
is out of order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Second, I want to point out that, on October 16, 1970, Mr. 
Baldwin moved the following motion: That the motion be amended 
by striking out all the words after ``that'' and adding the following: 
``the government should forthwith introduce legislative proposals 
to meet the conditions referred to in the motion''.
<P>
	That was a totally new element which was not in the original 
proposal. Consequently, it was out of order.
<P>
	For these two reasons, I argue that, when you make your ruling 
tomorrow morning, it will be to the effect that the amendment 
proposed by the leader of the Reform Party is out of order.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously you cannot rule on this 
immediately. This is why the opposition whip is asking you to do 
so tomorrow morning and to ponder the issue this evening.
<P>
	I submit that the point of order should have been raised before 
5.30 p.m., during debate on the motion, and that if we agreed to 
hear that point of order, it was not to prolong a debate which could 
no longer be extended. Otherwise, we will never again get 
unanimous consent to hear a point of order outside the period 
provided for such a debate.
<P>
	I submit that the point of order dealing specifically with the 
debate should be raised tomorrow, or the next time we discuss the 
resolution. I also submit that the Speaker who will be in the Chair 
will not be able to make a ruling, because he must ponder the issue. 
You can no more do it immediately now than he could do it 
immediately then, otherwise it would be too easy to resort to that 
tactic. They want to save time and raise a point of order outside the 
period provided and ask for your ruling on it tomorrow morning. 
That is too soon.
<P>
	I submit that we should follow up on the point of order. We know 
that there is one coming, but we should act as if we had not heard it, 
and entertain it in the period reserved for this debate. Otherwise, 
we will be getting around the rules for the sake of it and also to 
achieve indirectly what cannot be done directly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, while I have some 
sympathy with what the whip for the Bloc Quebecois has said, you 
have allowed a discussion of this because of the request made by 
the government whip and I would like to respond to his comments.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16990"> 16990 </A></B>
<P>
	I assure the House that not only did we verify the contents of 
the motion but it was reviewed by the table prior to presentation 
by the hon. leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	The chief government whip alleges this is not relevant to the 
motion before the House. Relevance under citation 568 of 
Beauchesne is a criterion. I will explain very briefly why the 
amendment is relevant:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(5) Nothing in this resolution shall:</BLOCKQUOTE>
(i) Confer or be interpreted as conferring upon the legislature of the 
Government of Quebec, any new legislative or executive powers, 
proprietary rights, status, or any other rights or privileges not conferred 
upon the legislature or government of any province.
<P>
	Point three of the motion states ``the House undertake to be 
guided by this reality'', that being the reality of Quebec's distinct 
society.
<P>
	Point four states that the House ``encourage all components of 
the legislative and executive branches of government to take note 
of this recognition and once again to be guided in their conduct 
accordingly''.
<P>
	Since we are instructing not only the House but the legislative 
and executive branches of the government to be guided in their 
conduct, it is clear they have an unlimited range of options in terms 
of how to implement this guidance. Subsection (i) of the 
amendment simply refers to a specific route they may take that 
shall not be considered. Therefore it is highly relevant to the 
motion.
<P>
	Under citation 569 of Beauchesne adding words to a motion is an 
acceptable method of adding additional relevant material. Citation 
567 instructs that these amendments can be made to increase the 
acceptability of a motion. Once again, since the stated intention of 
the leader of the Reform Party is to make this acceptable, not only 
to the members of the House but to a broader section of Canadians, 
it is perfectly in order.
<P>
	I hope the government will make every effort to accommodate 
all Canadians in what is, after all, said to be a unity resolution. That 
would be a wiser use of time than trying to construe that the 
equality of provinces, the equality of citizens or the very integrity 
of the country is out of order on the floor of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank all three hon. members for their 
interventions. I agree that it might have been better to deal with this 
point of order during the debate rather than in private member's 
hour. However, the Speaker is seized with the matter. The 
interventions, having heard them tonight, will be available in the 
blues and the Speaker will be able to consider the interventions of 
all three members when he makes his ruling tomorrow. That is one 
of the reasons the Speaker was anxious to hear the interventions 
tonight.
<P>
	It is certainly now 5.30. The House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's 
Order Paper.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP)</B> moved that Bill C-202, an 
act to act to prohibit the export of water by interbasin transfers, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see so many colleagues in 
the House during this private members' hour. There is a lot of 
interest in this topic and I indicate my appreciation for that and also 
my appreciation to my hon. colleague for Regina-Lumsden for 
seconding this motion. I know he has had a longstanding interest in 
the subject material that is embodied in Bill C-202, as well as many 
other members of the House who over the last number of days have 
contacted me with an indication of their support, that they will 
endorse the principle of this bill at second reading and will vote in 
favour of it.
<P>
	If this bill passes it would prohibit any company or any 
organization from diverting water from a Canadian river basin into, 
in this case, an American river basin for export purposes.
<P>
	One might ask what prompts this bill at this time. A few days 
ago one of the officials responsible for the environmental aspects 
of the North American Free Trade Agreement made a speech in 
Montreal.
<P>
	He said high water consumption and pollution could trigger 
disputes within the North American Free Trade Agreement. He 
urged Canadians to better manage their water resources and said 
that while Canada has sovereignty over its water, the resource is 
also a global treasure, much the same as the Amazon rainforest is a 
global treasure, that the world per se depends on it. Implicit in his 
remarks was that the North American continent depends on 
Canadian water.
<P>
	He closed with this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Pressure on Canada to increase exports to the United States will mount as 
scarcity becomes more widespread. Canadians therefore have an interest in 
encouraging their American neighbours to better manage their water too.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As late as November 9, 1995 in Montreal one of the key 
representatives to the NAFTA warned us as Canadians that a water 
crisis is pending in the United States and that the United States is 
obviously considering Canada as a source to relieve this pressure in 
the future.
<P>
	We also want to acknowledge that water diversion schemes per 
se are not new. These are concepts that have been around for some 
time. We are well aware of the grand canal project enthusiastically 
promoted by Simon Reisman, one of our key trade negotiators with 
the United States.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16991"> 16991 </A></B>
<P>
	Another is the North American water and power alliance, 
commonly called NAWAPA; coming out of California a massive 
scheme to divert western Canadian rivers into the southwestern 
United States and northern Mexico.
<P>
	There was also a project to pipe vast quantities of Great Lakes 
water to the high plains states in the southwest to replete their 
depleted aquifer, a 1984 scheme. A few years later there was a 
proposal to feed New York City's vast population with Lake 
Ontario water. A few years later came a concept involving the 
blasting of a 400-mile canal from Lake Superior to the Missouri 
River in South Dakota at a cost of $30 billion.
<P>
	There was also a proposal to construct a canal from Lake Erie to 
the Ohio River, again to move water and shipping between the two 
countries. There was also a federally funded plan to drill a hole in 
the bottom of Lake Michigan and drain the water through bedrock 
layers for southern Illinois cities.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	I have a list here. I could go on and on, but I make the point that 
there has been a long list over particularly the last two decades, 
when water diversion was an entrepreneurial interest by some very 
creative people, primarily to move Canadian water to the United 
States.
<P>
	Anyone who has travelled in the southwestern U.S. and northern 
Mexico will acknowledge that the water sources there are presently 
being used to their maximum. The Colorado River often dries up 
before it actually reaches the ocean because all the water is used up. 
Also, one could wade across the Rio Grande River at El Paso 
probably without even getting their knees wet, which indicates that 
massive river system is exclusively used for domestic, agricultural, 
and industrial water needs.
<P>
	We acknowledge that virtually all of the major aquifers in the 
southwest United States and northern Mexico are being depleted on 
a daily basis. When one travels through the area and talks to people 
who are responsible for water resources for the future, virtually 
everyone assumes that Canada will one day be their salvation, that 
Canada's fresh water, which people in Mexico and the United 
States assume is being wasted, will be diverted one way or another 
for use in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.
<P>
	Major industrial development, agricultural expansion, and 
population increases are occurring in that southern sun belt. There 
has been vast industrialization of Mexico, particularly in the 
maquiladora zone, where just in the last few months hundreds of 
new industries have started up, all with some need for water. The 
case is clear that increasingly there will be a need, much earlier 
than anticipated even a few years ago, to obtain vast amounts of 
water. I can say that our American friends to the south almost 
exclusively look to Canada as a source for that water to make up for 
their shortfall.
<P>
	I think it is fair to say that over the last couple of decades the 
hope was that this matter would go away. All levels of government 
had not taken any decisive action up until very recently in the hopes 
that this was a problem that hopefully would never occur. I refer 
particularly to the governments of British Columbia and 
Ontario-there may be others, but I am not familiar with them 
tonight-which passed legislation in their provincial legislatures 
banning exports of water from their provinces.
<P>
	We have to acknowledge that there are two levels of government 
involved in the management of water resources in Canada. Under 
the Constitution Act the provinces exercise direct control over 
many aspects of water management within their boundaries. Water 
is a natural resource and provincial governments have jurisdiction 
over it within their own boundaries. They are therefore able to 
legislate in the areas of domestic and industrial water supply, 
pollution control, hydroelectric power development, irrigation, 
recreational use of water, et cetera.
<P>
	However, again because of the Constitution Act, the federal 
government has jurisdiction over inland and ocean fisheries, 
including their protection and particularly the protection of river 
basins. In addition, Parliament has the residual power to legislate 
for peace, order and good government of the country, including the 
regulation of trade and commerce. The federal government is 
responsible for conducting relations with other countries, which is 
extremely important with respect to water because so much of 
Canada's water resources are in boundary water basins.
<P>
	We basically have two areas of jurisdiction: provincial 
jurisdiction for use within the province; and because it could 
become a matter of international trade and because international 
trade and commerce is a federal responsibility, there is a need for 
the federal government to become involved in this as well.
<P>
	As I have said, some provinces have taken the only action at 
their disposal and have passed legislation prohibiting this type of 
interbasin sale of water. My thesis would be that may be fine and 
dandy, but the federal government must also act. Some people have 
said that there is a federal policy. Some years ago, back in 1987, 
Canada tabled a water policy, which was essentially a statement of 
what the government would like to do in the future. It has no 
legislative authority. There are no regulations or laws or statutes 
attached to it. It is simply a policy and nothing more. Part of that 
policy states that ``the Government of Canada will take all possible 
measures within the limits of its constitutional authority to prohibit 
the export of Canadian water by interbasin diversions''.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	At the time I was in the House and I thought we were finally 
going to make some headway in this area. I was  absolutely thrilled 
some months later on August 25, 1988 when Bill C-156 was tabled 
in the House. It was entitled the Canada Water Preservation Act, an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16992"> 16992 </A></B>
<P>
act to prohibit any export or diversion of boundary waters for the 
purpose of export. We thought we were finally going to have 
legislation passed in the House that would indicate the will of 
Canada in this area. Unfortunately, Bill C-156 died on the Order 
Paper and it has never been reintroduced. Today we do not have any 
federal legislation that would prohibit the export of water from 
Canada in terms of interbasin transfers to the United States for 
eventual sale into Mexico. That is the purpose of Bill C-202.
<P>
	Part of the motivation for this came from a number of schemes, 
one from my own constituency, namely on the North Thompson 
River. This scheme was intended to divert about 50 per cent of the 
water flow of the North Thompson River into the Columbia River 
basin, which would eventually travel through various water basins 
in the United States for eventual sale in the Los Angeles area. Since 
this scheme was proposed formally to the provincial government in 
British Columbia, people obviously have opposed it in light of the 
fact that there is an absence of federal legislation. Of course they 
are concerned that NAFTA opened the door for this type of 
enterprise, which I will discuss in a moment.
<P>
	Many communities rallied quickly. Over the past few months I 
was able to table in the House 123,000 names of people from a 
variety of communities throughout British Columbia and various 
parts of Canada but particularly from the communities of 
Kamloops, Heffley Creek, Raleigh, Westsyde, Barrière, McLure, 
Avola, Vinsula, Clearwater, Black Pines, Chu Chua, Birch Island, 
Blue River, Louis Creek, Whispering Pines, and many others 
within my constituency, to say nothing about cities, communities, 
and rural areas throughout all of British Columbia, much of 
Alberta, and other parts of western Canada. There has been an 
overwhelming negative reaction to this proposal.
<P>
	There have been times when people have said that NAFTA 
protects us from this. I want to reject that. NAFTA includes water 
as a good under the terms of the agreement. I would emphasize the 
word ``good''. We could also use the term ``commodity''. Article 
102 of NAFTA sets forth the objective of the agreement ``to 
eliminate barriers to trade and facilitate the cross-border movement 
of goods and services between the territories of the parties, to 
increase substantially investment opportunities in the territories of 
the parties, and to establish a framework for further trilateral, 
regional, multilateral co-operation to expand and enhance the 
benefits of this agreement''.
<P>
	Basically it says that the purpose of NAFTA is to eliminate 
barriers to trade in goods. Water is a good. Therefore, 
fundamentally this is one of the purposes of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement.
<P>
	It goes on to describe this more accurately. It is important to take 
a moment to do that. Goods are defined in article 201 of NAFTA as 
products that are understood in the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade, or now the World Trade Organization. This means that
<P>
any good covered by a GATT tariff heading is subject to all the 
provisions of the agreements themselves unless explicitly 
excluded.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will recall that a number of areas in NAFTA 
were excluded specifically. Raw logs, beer, and two or three other 
items were mentioned specifically as being exclusions from the 
North American Free Trade Agreement.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What about water?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Water was not mentioned. The evidence has shown 
that water was never part of the discussions. The negotiators now 
have admitted that. The politicians involved in the negotiations 
have said that water was never even mentioned in any serious way.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Therefore, to understand the basis for the inclusion of water in 
the trade agreements one must first look to the relevant section of 
the harmonized commodity coding system of GATT. The 
harmonized commodity coding system for classifying goods for 
customs tariff and other purposes adopted by the GATT include the 
following: ``2201: It includes waters, including natural or artificial 
mineral waters and aerated waters not containing sugar or 
sweetening material nor flavoured, including ice and snow''. It 
then goes on to article 2201(90) and lists all other water.
<P>
	Let me provide a clarification of this harmonized commodity 
coding system. The GATT harmonized commodity description and 
coding system explanatory notes were adopted by the GATT 
signatories. The explanatory notes state the following: ``This 
heading covers ordinary natural water of all kinds, other than sea 
water. Such water remains in this heading whether or not it is 
clarified or purified''.
<P>
	I could recite a whole number of these subsections and the 
technical aspects of NAFTA, but fundamentally it states that water, 
under the World Trade Organization and under NAFTA, is 
considered a commodity or a good. This obviously causes people a 
great deal of concern.
<P>
	I think it is fair to say that at a time when NAFTA opens the door 
to this type of export and knowing that we have to treat, as a result 
of NAFTA, American and Canadian entrepreneurs on a level 
playing field and that we cannot discriminate against Americans in 
favour of Canadians, since Canadians right now are diverting water 
within the country, exporting water, and selling water in a variety 
of forms, an American entrepreneur can now use NAFTA and come 
forward and do the same. They could export water from the North 
Thompson River in British Columbia to the Los Angeles basin.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16993"> 16993 </A></B>
<P>
	I think it is also clear in international law. I am not an 
international lawyer, but I have talked to many of them. They say 
that if it comes to a dispute in this area, provincial legislatures 
will not have much impact. Even national legislation will not have 
much impact, although this is what we are doing tonight. The 
provisions of the international trade agreement between three 
sovereign nations will be paramount if there is a dispute. Of course 
a dispute settling mechanism panel will take into consideration 
that the three signatories to the North America Free Trade 
Agreement have agreed, as per the schedules I have indicated, that 
water is a commodity, just like coal or codfish or wheat or 
anything else, to be bought or sold among three countries.
<P>
	For that reason and to give us some influence at that 
international dispute settlement mechanism table when the time 
comes, I think we should pass this legislation to very clearly 
indicate where the people of Canada stand on this issue.
<P>
	In closing, I will simply say the following. For Canadians water 
is something special. I think we all agree that water is a commodity 
unlike cod or timber or nickel or whatever. It is virtually like blood 
itself. It is the life of Canada. Water is something very special in 
the Canadian psyche.
<P>
	I would urge my colleagues to pass this legislation in order to 
send a very clear message that this is where Canada stands.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Kamloops on this bill concerning our water resources, which are so 
obviously valuable for our communities and all of Canada.
<P>
	We wholeheartedly share the hon. member's goal to conserve 
our water resources and to keep a tight control over the 
development of these resources. But at the same time, with all due 
respect, we think that the hon. member's approach is too narrow, 
and that the whole issue of water resources should be looked at in a 
much more comprehensive and integrated way.
<P>
	We think the whole issue should be looked at in the broadest 
context possible.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Water is our most precious resource. We have the greatest 
freshwater reserves of the world. It behoves us to use them wisely. 
Our jobs, our economy, our quality of life, our environment, our 
farming and our forestry depend on water. All other resources 
depend on water for sustenance.
<P>
	It is clear that we have to control our water exports. At the same 
time we have to do more than look at  interbasin transfers or 
interbasin exports. For instance, today a large part of the water 
exports are being carried out through supertankers which load 
water from our coastal areas, lakes, streams and rivers, and carry it 
to other parts of the continent and beyond. We have to look at that 
type of export. We also have to look at the draining of water 
resources such as the mining of our groundwater reserves that 
might go southward.
<P>
	I agree with the content of Bill C-202. It is in sync with the 
present water policy of the federal government which opposes 
water exports through interbasin transfers. We should look at the 
whole question of water in a formal, comprehensive manner, 
looking at not only the exports themselves but the use of water, 
water conservation and conception, the impacts of the use of water 
on ecosystems generally and the impacts of various processes such 
as industrial manufacturing and others on our water. We must also 
take into account the jurisdictional question, the input of provincial 
and municipal governments that deliver our water and have much 
to do with the retailing of water to Canadians from coast to coast.
<P>
	The government has been looking at the water issue for some 
time now. For some 10 years there have been consultations and 
workshops. We have decided to accelerate the process. We are 
reviewing our water policies and our water legislation. Throughout 
next year we will consult broadly across Canada to find out from 
Canadians and various levels of government that have a clear 
interest in and responsibility for water issues how we should deal 
with the question of water comprehensively, including the key 
question of water exports.
<P>
	We fully back the principle of the bill. At the same time our 
decision is that a much more comprehensive approach has to be 
taken. We want to look at the full range of water exports, including 
supertankers and the mining of groundwater. We do not want to 
limit the study and future legislation to the question of exports. We 
must treat water issues much more broadly, look at an ecosystemic 
approach, treat water as the most precious resource of the 21st 
century for us and for generations that follow.
<P>
	To our aboriginal people water is the essence of life. They see 
streams, lakes and rivers as the veins and the arteries in the body of 
mother earth. They say that the cleaner the water flows, the cleaner 
the arteries and the veins in the body of mother earth. They also say 
that the healthier the veins and arteries, the healthier mother earth.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	I thank the member for Kamloops for having brought the subject 
forward and enabling us to discuss it. I commit myself to the issue 
being looked at very broadly by the government in an overall 
consultation next year  which hopefully will lead to comprehensive 
legislation on water for Canada.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak about the bill introduced by my colleague from the 
NDP, an act to prohibit the export of water by interbasin transfers.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill, introduced by the member for 
Kamloops, is clear from the title: to prohibit the export of our water 
by interbasin transfers.
<P>
	Many questions come to mind that are not answered in this bill. 
These questions occurred to me after I read an article by 
Louis-Gilles Francoeur, published yesterday in <I>Le Devoir</I>. Its title 
is rather instructive. It is a question: ``Scientists' recommendation: 
fresh water under federal control?''
<P>
	The journalist was referring to the report by the Canadian Water 
Ressources Association and to the Canadian Global Change 
Program, which recommends that the federal government get 
involved in managing fresh water resources, especially by taking 
over control of the main hydrographic basins such as the St. 
Lawrence and the Great Lakes.
<P>
	This report, published in August under the auspices of the Royal 
Society of Canada, suggests that the federal government review its 
1970 Canada Water Act in terms of the new outlook and the new 
circumstances in this area.
<P>
	The bill presented by the member for Kamloops is similar, since 
it suggests that the federal government get involved in the export of 
its water resources.
<P>
	I will now go back to the report, which Mr. Francoeur quotes 
extensively in his article. It says: ``The way the situation is 
evolving, management of fresh water, a provincial 
resource-again, a strictly provincial resource- could become a 
constitutional issue, like many other environmental management 
issues, for that matter. Water resource management is a strategic 
issue, particularly in Quebec, considering the importance of hydro 
power''.
<P>
	In light of this quote, one can clearly see that fresh water and the 
management of this resource is under the provinces' jurisdiction. I 
do not know if the member for Kamloops consulted the authorities 
in his province, British Columbia, before introducing his bill. I am 
sure his province would not agree to lose this jurisdiction. In fact, if 
his province, or any other, decided to export water by interbasin 
transfers, could they not do it since it is a matter of provincial 
jurisdiction?
<P>
	I cannot see how the federal government would once again 
intrude on matters of provincial jurisdiction. We know that it is a 
habit dear to the Liberals, especially with regard to the 
environment, but for a New Democrat to get into the fray, asking 
the federal government to put its  big fat paws into his own 
province's business, is beyond me. I cannot see what the member is 
trying to do with his bill. To protect water? To conserve water? 
These are matters of provincial jurisdiction. Does the member not 
trust his provincial government in this respect?
<P>
	As a matter of fact, his province, the member will correct me if I 
am wrong, made its position very clear with Bill C-9, The Water 
Protection Act, tabled by the minister Moe Sihota. I would like the 
member for Kamloops to tell us more about this piece of 
legislation. Right from the start, minister Sihota stated his 
intentions on this matter.
<P>
	In a press release issued on April 27, 1995, Mr. Sihota said, and I 
quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The key is for the province to have control over that development, not the 
federal through NAFTA or the United States.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I believe it is quite clear. Minister Sihota wants to deal with 
water himself because it comes under his jurisdiction, ``not the 
federal'', as he said so well in his press release .If the Environment 
minister of his own province says that he wants control over this 
matter and is telling the federal government not to interfere, why 
does the hon. member for Kamloops seek to impose a new act on 
his province and on the others? Would it not be better to leave the 
question of water management to the provinces, like British 
Columbia, that have jurisdiction over it?
<P>
	Unfortunately, I have not looked at this issue with regard to the 
North American Free Trade Agreement. We should certainly look 
at this question of water exports, or trade in water, in connection 
with this agreement.
<P>
	I sense that, once again, this will be served to us with an 
ecosystem sauce, that is to say, we will be told that we should 
consider the large living systems as a whole, because they justify 
the interference of Ottawa with provincial jurisdictions. The report 
referred to before is asking Ottawa to develop a strategy for 
interwoven basins. Under this strategy, Ottawa would look after 
large basins like the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence, while 
provinces and municipalities would manage small basins in 
accordance with federal policies.
<P>
	I will read to you two paragraphs from Francoeur's article which 
show clearly the interfering intent of the federal government. He 
says: ``Ottawa proposes to reduce the role of the provinces, which 
own water resources, by drowning their constitutional 
responsibilities in a sea of intervenors. For example, the report 
suggests that we create a consortium with representatives of the 
public sector (federal, provincial,  territorial and municipal 
governments), the First Nations, the universities, the colleges and 
private sector 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16995"> 16995 </A></B>
<P>
businesses, who would tackle various problems related to water on 
a national and international level. The scientific societies' report 
also suggests that we extend federal jurisdiction to estuaries like 
the St. Lawrence estuary and to coastal zones, which are provincial 
properties, in the context of a global approach focused on 
ecosystems and nested drainage basins.''
<P>
	This report puts forward the same arguments as the federal 
government uses to justify interfering in provincial jurisdictions. 
Ecosystems, the nation, globalization, the ingredients are always 
the same and they bring the federal government to push provinces 
around. Contrary to Obelix who was the only one to fall into the 
kettle of magic potion, the federalists have all been cooked in the 
same pot. The hon. member for Kamloops is no exception because 
his bill reflects perfectly the centralizing views promoted by the 
federal government in environmental matters.
<P>
	Finally, the report goes on to say that Environment Canada 
should enhance the protection of fresh water ecosystems by 
assuming jurisdiction over fresh water fishing. Yet, since 1922-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Oh, my God, it is 
unbelievable.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the members opposite listened they 
might learn something.
<P>
	Yet, since 1922, Quebec has been managing fresh water fishing 
within its boundaries, which shows the inconsistency of a system 
where water belongs to the provinces and the fish belong to Ottawa.
<P>
	It is clear from this report that fresh water is under provincial 
jurisdiction. In B.C., minister Sihota goes even further by 
legislating on trading in provincial water.
<P>
	In a federal paper entitled <I>Media Backgrounder Federal Water 
Policy-Executive Summary</I>, we can read this, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the provinces exercise direct control over many aspects of water 
management within their boundaries. Their competence to legislate in water 
matters derives from their jurisdiction over management of public lands, 
property and civil rights, and matters of a local and private nature. Provinces, 
therefore, have authority to legislate in areas of domestic and industrial water 
supply, pollution control, non-nuclear thermal and hydroelectric power 
development, irrigation and recreation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Moreover, in Quebec, the Gérin-Lajoie philosophy, which says 
that Quebec's constitutional jurisdiction should be extended to its 
international relations, has always been the object of an undeniable 
consensus since 1965.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	If we combine all this, that is, provincial jurisdiction over water, 
the provinces' wish to take charge of their international relations, 
as the member of Kamloops' province does through its Water 
Protection Act, and if we add to that the federal government's 
mediocrity, or even paucity in terms of the environment, it must be 
recognized that Bill C-202 is not a desirable bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. I would like a point of clarification. Does debate on 
a private member's bill go from one side of the House to the other?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Usually, but we try to give all three 
parties a chance to speak first. According to my list, it is the hon. 
member for Peace River who now has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is 
quite a bit of interest in this bill. We have been interested for some 
time in the matter of water and water exports.
<P>
	It is a pleasure for me to speak to Bill C-202, which is an act to 
prohibit the export of water by interbasin transfers. I know the hon. 
member for Kamloops has been following this issue for quite a few 
years. Since he is from British Columbia, I can understand his 
interest in the subject.
<P>
	Contrary to what the previous speaker stated, these rivers quite 
often run through more than one province and quite a big area is 
affected.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party have also been interested in the topic of 
water exports. Our 1993 blue sheet, which contains the Reform 
Party's principles, policies, and election platform, states that the 
Reform Party supports the position that notwithstanding the 
inclusion of water in the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and 
the North American Free Trade Agreement, exclusive and 
unrestricted control of water in all its forms will be maintained by 
and for Canada and both free trade agreements should be amended 
to reflect this.
<P>
	The blue sheet went further to state that until federal policies 
related to the free trade agreements are initiated and Canada's 
control over water resources is established within both free trade 
agreements, the Reform Party would not support the 
implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
<P>
	I believe we are covered here. However, in examining the 
research I can see that there are cases that can be made for either 
side of the argument. The first argument is that the free trade 
agreement and NAFTA entitle the United States to a certain share 
of Canada's fresh water. The second argument is that the trade 
agreements do not entitle the U.S. to our water. I would like to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16996"> 16996 </A></B>
<P>
address these two arguments. I will speak about the second 
argument  first, which is the Canadian government's official 
position.
<P>
	Water was never mentioned during the free trade negotiations. 
The free trade agreements are commercial agreements, which deal 
with traded goods and services. Of course bottled water is a traded 
good, but water in rivers and lakes is by no stretch of the 
imagination a traded commodity, so what is the big fuss?
<P>
	Furthermore, the Canadian government amended the 
implementing legislation to the Canada-U.S. Free Trade 
Agreement by stating that none of the free trade agreement 
provisions, such as the proportional sharing agreement, applied to 
natural surface or ground water, other than article 401, which deals 
with tariff elimination.
<P>
	It would seem that our water is secure. Just to make triple sure 
there is no room for misunderstanding or legal manoeuvres by the 
Americans, in December of 1993 the governments of Canada, 
Mexico, and the United States put out a joint statement, which 
states that ``NAFTA creates no rights to the natural water resources 
of any party to the agreement. Unless water in any form has entered 
into commerce and has become a good or product, it is not covered 
by the provisions of any trade agreement, including NAFTA. 
Nothing in the NAFTA agreement would oblige any NAFTA party 
to either exploit its water for commercial use or begin exporting 
water in any form. Water in its natural state in lakes, rivers, 
reservoirs, aquifers, water basins and the like is not a good or 
product and is not traded and therefore is not and never has been 
subject to the terms of any trade agreement.''
<P>
	The official argument goes even further, to state that 
international rights and obligations respecting water in its natural 
state are contained in separate treaties and agreements negotiated 
for that purpose. Examples are the United States-Canada boundary 
waters treaty of 1909 and the 1944 boundary waters treaty between 
Mexico and the United States.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	It would seem that any reasonable person would be completely 
satisfied that all the <I>t</I>'s had been crossed and the <I>i</I>'s dotted. But of 
course we are not all lawyers. Lawyers can find tiny holes and drive 
trucks through them. Before we know it, water could be making its 
way south of the border.
<P>
	Let me give some mention of the other argument, the one that 
says we have goofed and we have allowed the trade agreements to 
be finalized without specifically exempting water in our rivers and 
lakes.
<P>
	The argument could be made that water is a good under the free 
trade agreement and NAFTA. This is because both trade 
agreements state that a good is one that is understood to be a good 
in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Sure enough, the 
GATT tariff schedule has a heading for water, which is  very broad. 
The heading, numbered 22.01, is reserved for waters, including 
natural or artificial mineral waters and aerated waters, not 
containing sugar or any other sweetener matter for flavouring, plus 
ice or snow.
<P>
	With that kind of a description, it would seem that natural water 
of all kinds, other than sea water, could be classified as a good. 
Since the trade agreement says we must allow all parties to the 
agreement the same rights in respect of trade in goods and services, 
we could be forced to give the United States and Mexico the same 
rights to our water resources that we now enjoy.
<P>
	Fancy lawyers notwithstanding, I would like to think that the 
side agreement signed by all three governments carries a lot of 
weight. Even though the free trade agreement and NAFTA were 
never changed to include clarification about Canada's sovereignty 
over its water resource-which is a mistake we could rectify if we 
have a chance to open this agreement again to allow a new country 
in-I believe we still are protected and can never be forced to sell 
our water to our neighbours in the drier climates.
<P>
	Of course our final safeguard is that we can always opt out of 
NAFTA or the free trade agreement. That is our bottom line: if we 
are not happy with what we are expected to deliver, we have the 
right to opt out. All we have to do is provide our neighbours with 
written notification six months in advance.
<P>
	Let me get back to the bill under debate. I agree fully with its 
contents and intent. I do not think that any party in Canada, no 
matter what its political stripe, would support the exporting of 
water by interbasin transfer. Apart from a threat to our sovereignty, 
water exports also carry ecological risks. Interbasin water transfers 
can introduce parasites and other organisms to new environments, 
which could have a very negative effect. A good example of this is 
the introduction of zebra mussels into the Great Lakes by 
ocean-going vessels.
<P>
	Other problems occur when the flow of fresh water is reduced in 
estuaries where sea water and river water mix. This upsets the 
saline balance of the water and has detrimental effects to the birds 
and fish that depend on that particular ecosystem. It is also reported 
that dams can cause a change in weather patterns and climate and 
can cause mercury contamination in the food chain.
<P>
	I would agree with the hon. member for Kamloops that more 
research could be done into the effects of interbasin transfer. To 
that end, I would agree to sending Bill C-202 to committee for 
further study.
<P>
	I support this bill, although I am not entirely sure that it is 
necessary or that we are not sufficiently protected already. 
However, if there is any concern at all that we are not, let us pass 
this bill. It can be added as a further safeguard we can take to 
protect our very valuable water supply.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> A point of order, the hon. for Kamloops, 
who has already spoken on the matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a very short point of order before 
my friend from Broadview-Greenwood participates in the debate.
<P>
	In light of the suggestion by my honourable friend who has just 
spoken for the Reform Party, I wonder if I could ask you,Mr. Speaker, to ask the House whether there would be unanimous 
support to put a motion on the floor to send this matter to 
committee for further discussion and examination.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is clearly not unanimous consent.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to go back to my very first 
speech in the House of Commons in 1988. This was the issue I 
talked about when I opposed the free trade agreement; that water 
was a part of the free trade agreement.
<P>
	I congratulate the member for Kamloops for bringing this 
private member's bill forward. On this issue we should have a 
general debate. Basically our country is water blind when it comes 
to understanding the complexities and depth of what is going on 
around this issue.
<P>
	When I left high school and went to study in Texas I kept in 
touch with a few of my friends over the years. When I was running 
in 1988 for the first time to become a member of Parliament I 
received a call from an old college classmate of mine who said in 
that free trade agreement there has to be something dealing with 
water.
<P>
	I asked my good friend Bert Edmondson to tell me more. He said 
the chief free trade negotiator for President Ronald Reagan was a 
personal friend of his and spent his entire life, including his Ph.D. 
thesis, studying North American water management, Clayton 
Yeutter. He worked as a young political assistant for Congressman 
Jim Wright who spent most of his time studying North American 
water management.
<P>
	My friend, even though he was in Houston, an American looking 
out for the United States, gave me a little friendly heads up that 
there has to be something in that agreement dealing with North 
American water management.
<P>
	I then talked to a few other people, lawyers and experts, much 
more expert than I was on this issue. I was going to focus on the 
whole issue of unfettered foreign investment, something I was 
opposed to, chapter 14. However, when this water dimension came 
into the deal that got my interest even more.
<P>
	I remember standing on the other side of the House saying to 
then Prime Minister Mulroney: ``If water is not part of this free 
trade agreement and yet there is so much worry about it, why do 
you not ask your friend, President Reagan, for a one-page protocol 
letter signed by him and you stating water is not a part of this deal? 
That would put all Canadians across Canada at ease.'' As the 
member for Kamloops said, whatever we do in the House or in any 
provincial house on the whole issue of water is subservient to the 
free trade agreement.
<P>
	I could not sell Prime Minister Mulroney on getting a one-page 
protocol letter exempting water and of course the deal went 
through.
<P>
	However, that very first month I was elected I discovered as an 
MP I had access to the Library of Parliament and the researchers. I 
remember asking them to find out a little more about Clayton 
Yeutter's Ph.D. thesis. Apparently it was on the whole issue of 
water. Lo and behold, about four months later his Ph.D. transcript 
from the University of Nebraska, pulled off microfiche, landed on 
my desk. It was about 700 pages on how the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers was to replumb the entire North American system. I 
remember after I received that Ph.D. thesis of Clayton Yeutter 
sending him letters complimenting him on this great thesis on how 
to replumb the North American water system. I asked him if he 
would comment as the chief free trade negotiator on whether it was 
in or out of the free trade agreement.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	I never had an answer to the first letter, the second letter or the 
third letter. Therefore we must have our heads up on this issue.
<P>
	I can remember the hon. member for Kamloops in opposition 
presenting thousands of petitions on the floor of the House, giving 
us a heads up on interbasin transfers. We have to deal with this 
issue.
<P>
	To the member for Kamloops, his private member's bill today is 
in the right direction but it is too narrow. The member has said no 
interbasin transfers. As my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of the Environment knows, we already have an 
interbasin transfer from Lake Ontario into the St. Lawrence. That is 
one of the reasons we can maintain Montreal as a port. If we ever 
stopped that transfer from Lake Ontario, a joint decision made by 
the International Joint Commission, Montreal would not be a port.
<P>
	This of course is something that was never discussed during the 
last referendum. Our friends who want to create their own country 
do not realize that Canada and the United States together, nation to 
nation, decide on the flow of water from Lake Ontario. We happily 
maintain Montreal as one of the great ports of the world. That in a 
manner of speaking is basin transfer.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16998"> 16998 </A></B>
<P>
	I am happy to participate in this debate today. It touches on an 
issue we will have to deal with in a comprehensive way over the 
next three to five years.
<P>
	A chapter in one of the books by the former premier of Quebec, 
Robert Bourassa, dealt with the grand canal, the recycling of water 
from James Bay up over Mount Amos, down into the Georgian Bay 
system, through the French River, into all the Great Lakes and 
through Lake Michigan into the United States. This chapter had a 
contribution by Tom Kierans from Newfoundland who spent his 
entire life working for that great U.S. firm, Bechtel Group Inc. I am 
intrigued by this idea.
<P>
	What I am trying to say is this is an issue we will have to face up 
to. Fifteen years from now our American friends will not be able to 
carry on without Canadian water. What will we do?
<P>
	The member for Kamloops, who has been consistent on this 
issue and is pricking our conscience and our thought process here 
again tonight, is giving us a heads up on a very important issue. I 
hope through my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of the Environment, and other colleagues we can take this 
issue on in a comprehensive way in the not too distant future.
<P>
	Maybe, as the member said in his speech, there are many 
different factors in this equation, many intricacies related to our 
first peoples, our aboriginals, and our whole environmental system. 
There are the different types of waters, processes and everything 
else that we have to deal with. I hope we can get into that in the not 
too distant future.
<P>
	With respect to my colleagues from the Bloc, water is really not 
a provincial debate or issue. When we look at the way 65 per cent 
of our waters flow north into James Bay, when we see the way 
waters flow back and forth, if there was ever a reason for my 
colleagues across the floor to convert from Bloc Quebecois to Bloc 
canadien, it is around the whole issue of water.
<P>
	Unless we have a strong national government managing our 
water resources for the interests of all Canadians, the entire 
community is in jeopardy. The best way to secure the precious 
resource of water for all Quebecers is by making sure the national 
Government of Canada is working on behalf of all Quebecers. 
Quebec alone would not have the same capacity or the same thrust.
