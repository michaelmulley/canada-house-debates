<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, April has been designated Parkinson's Disease Awareness 
Month to highlight one of the most common neurological disorders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disease is a chronic brain disorder resulting in tremors, 
slow movements and muscle stiffness.  It affects over 100,000 
Canadians, most over the age of 55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parkinson Foundation of Canada, established in 1955, 
consists of more than 100 chapters and support groups nationwide. 
The foundation's activities are committed to funding, research, 
seeking treatments, and eventually finding a cure for Parkinson's 
disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation provides training, counselling and workshops for 
patients, caregivers and health care providers, while developing 
educational material to heighten public awareness about 
Parkinson's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the House to join with me in wishing the Parkinson 
Foundation of Canada and its volunteers a very successful 
Parkinson's Disease Awareness Month.

<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a 
valued frontline federal office in my riding is to be shut down 
soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nipawin employment insurance office is closing and those 
least able to afford it will be forced to make a two hour round 
trip to the next office and no one can say why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken to many upset users, received about 200 letters of 
support, attended a town hall meeting on the subject and had 
representations from both the town council and the chamber of 
commerce who are all opposed to the decision to close the office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is in favour of prudent fiscal management and 
would not support the existence of an office for show, but this 
office is the busiest of its kind in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the residents of Nipawin and district fill out their income 
tax forms this spring, they will see first hand that they are 
paying a lot more and getting a lot less from this Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message from my riding is this:  Reduced services combined 
with high taxes are not acceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in this year of 
Canadian francophonie, I would like to report that last weekend 
the final of the dictée des Amériques was held in Quebec City. 
This international event featured 112 finalists from 12 
countries in America, Europe or Africa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a source of great pride that Canada has hosted such an 
event.  The French language holds pride of place in our country. 
One Canadian in three speaks French and one in four has French 
as his or her mother tongue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Congratulations to the prize winners. 
Three of them came from right here in Canada: Marc Ethier of 
Gatineau, Heidi Garrand of Regina, and Monique McDonald of North 
Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, the French language has an intrinsic value, even if 
we are proud of this country's linguistic diversity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the Liberal's western task force 
prepares for its great expedition to British Columbia, here is a 
brief history lesson to assist them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to this government's election, B.C. used to have an army 
base, a fact that appears to have escaped the Secretary of State 
for the Status of Women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to this government's election, B.C. used to have a fishing 
industry, a fact that appears to have escaped the more aptly 
named minister of “no more” fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to this government's election, B.C. used to have a 
softwood lumber industry, a fact that appears to have escaped the 
Minister of Heritage as her misguided Bill C-55 threatens to 
further decimate the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, prior to this government's election, B.C. used to have 
a booming economy that the federal government sucked billions of 
tax dollars out of.  The boom is gone but the Liberals, well, 
they still suck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would appeal to hon. members to please be 
very judicious in your choice of words.

the area has seen in 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Souris River is predicted to rise well above flood stage. 
Several hundred acres are under water right now in the Souris 
Valley with the river expected to peak around April 21st. Some 
businesses are already feeling the affects of the flood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers could be especially hard hit.  If water stays too long 
in the fields, crops will not be seeded in time and what little 
profits there are will wash away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial flood forecaster, Alf Warkentin, said recently that 
the length of this year's Souris River flood would depend on the

stake.  It is time for the federal government to start becoming 
proactive and develop a long term disaster assistance program.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today Germany unveiled a peace plan to end the crisis in 
the Balkans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This plan offers Milosevic a 24 hour suspension of NATO air 
strikes if he starts withdrawing his forces from Kosovo.  It 
calls for a UN force to move in as Yugoslav forces withdraw.  It 
entails a ceasefire and disarmament plan for ethnic Albanians and 
the return of refugees under a temporary UN administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has Canada endorsed the German peace plan? 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the proposal put forward by the Germans was a 
program that was worked on last weekend at a G-8 political 
directors meeting at which Canada was clearly represented.  A 
series of proposals were looked at with a view to potentially 
having a G-8 ministers meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime there has been a discussion between Foreign 
Minister Ivanov and Secretary of State Albright.  Clearly, not 
only would we support it, but we certainly have to seek out the 
agreement of Russia to be one of the participants in it, and get 
the agreement of Mr. Milosevic to the conditions that were set 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said yesterday, we are hoping that these diplomatic 
initiatives that began last week will bear some fruit.  However, 
at this point in time there are still those kinds of exchanges 
and dialogues taking place. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the German peace plan calls for a heavily armed UN 
ground force to move into Kosovo as Yugoslav forces withdraw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Canadian government was discussing this plan with the 
Germans last week, why did the Prime Minister tell the House that 
the commitment of ground troops was not at all being considered 
at this time? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, clearly the Leader of the Opposition has confused 
two things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always said, and it goes back to the February debate 
that was held in the House, that Canada would participate in a 
peace implementation force.  It would monitor and make sure that 
any agreement that was arrived at would be properly honoured. 
That is exactly what is contained in the proposal that was looked 
at at the G-8 meetings.  There is no difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something that was debated and confirmed in the House last 
February is part of the proposals that are being looked at right 
now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, regardless of the explanation now, the commitment of 
ground troops to action in Yugoslavia is no longer a hypothetical 
situation as it was described a day ago in the House by the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is Canada expected to commit to this UN ground force?  Will 
the Prime Minister now be seeking a mandate for that commitment 
from this House through a votable motion? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do not think the Leader of the Opposition was 
listening very carefully to my last answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that the House has already debated and discussed what is 
being proposed in the G-8 meeting.  That has been part of a 
discussion that the House of Commons has already addressed.  I 
would also like to say with great satisfaction that all sides of 
the House agreed at that time that Canada would participate in a 
peace implementation force.  That is all that is being considered 
as part of the proposal that was developed during the G-8 
meetings this weekend.

parliament. Despite support from all parties in the House, the 
government's attitude on our involvement in this thing borders on 
contempt of parliament.  The government refuses to commit to a 
vote on the conditions that would be involved with the Canadian 
ground troops.  It refused that vote.  It would be so easy for 
the government to come forward with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the minister again, because he would go

it is one thing to take note.  How about we take a vote?  That is 
what Canadians are looking forward to right now. All of us need 
to band together to make sure that we are not just taking note of 
something. We are at war.  We need a vote in this parliament and 
the minister needs it so strongly for that confidence to move 
forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal is not talking about a pause and then something 
happening. We are saying if there is an agreement, which is what 
we have been saying all along from the very first, if there is an 
agreement, then the bombing would stop while Milosevic withdrew 
his troops.  You cannot have troops withdrawing if you are 
bombing, but there would be no pause until there was that 
agreement.

pointless to raise such possibilities. Today, we are being told 
the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were also told that it was pointless to raise the issue at

diplomatic settlement that would include the withdrawal of 
Milosevic's troops from Kosovo.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are desperate for us to continue pursuing diplomatic 
solutions to the Kosovo crisis through the United Nations.  In my 
letter sent to the Prime Minister earlier today, I outlined how 
Canada has a means through its position on the security council 
to overcome the veto barrier.  It has been done before.  Think of 
Lester Pearson in the Suez crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will Canada use its position on the security council to put 
forward a resolution to get the Kosovo crisis before the UN 
General Assembly? 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I certainly agree with the sentiment expressed by 
the leader of the New Democratic Party that Canadians, in fact 
people around the world, want to see a diplomatic solution.  It 
is certainly something we have been actively pursuing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that at the discussions held last weekend and 
at the NATO council, the nature of those diplomatic solutions 
were carefully examined.  It would include going back to the 
United Nations Security Council to provide a mandate for an 
agreement to be followed through in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say at this point in time there is in active play the 
opportunity to use the security council. There are active 
discussions with the Russians about how that can be achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will take note of the idea of the hon. member. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have 
a chance for peace here.  We have a chance to stop the killing. I 
hope the Minister of Foreign Affairs will pursue this proposal 
with a vengeance. It has worked before.  For his role in that 
process Lester Pearson got a Nobel peace prize.  It has worked 
before and it can work again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Foreign Affairs assure Canadians today that 
we will use our seat on the security council to sponsor a 
resolution to get the Kosovo crisis before the UN General 
Assembly? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, last week when I was at the United Nations I met 
with the secretary general as well as representatives from a 
number of delegations.  We talked about a united for peace 
resolution.  The assessment at the time was that there was no 
consensus for that, that there would not be an agreed upon vote 
at the assembly itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying to the hon. member is that there is now in play 
a proposal that would be designed to bring to the security 
council an agreement of all the parties that would lead to a 
settlement in Kosovo.  Right now that is the opportunity we are 
working on very actively in co-operation with other G-8 members 
and other members of the NATO council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, we will continue to pursue that.  If it does not 
work, we will look at other options. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the Prime Minister for his rare but clear and 
concise answer yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to remind the government of the Somalia 
commission of inquiry and its call for a vigilant parliament. The 
Somalia report cautioned about sending troops abroad that were 
not properly trained for their designate mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Deputy Prime Minister assure the House that before 
Canadian ground forces are deployed to the Balkans that they are 
properly trained and equipped for their designate mission?

this is a whole new thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am informed that the 3rd Battalion of Princess Patricia's 
Canadian Light Infantry, our ACE and UN standby units, have been 
training for months for action in the Balkans, including at least 
one trip to the United States for training. 
The training in the United States was not oriented to 
peacekeeping and they are now, in turn, training Lord 
Strathcona's Horse.  With support, that would be about 2,000 
soldiers.  Can the minister confirm that this group is being 
considered for the Kosovo mission and in what capacity?

combat capable.  There are various conditions that come up in 
peacekeeping missions.  We have seen that in Bosnia and in other 
theatres.  They are not always peaceful.  They have to be 
prepared for different eventualities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the hon. member brought up this figure of 2,000.  He 
brought it up because he said that something was being discussed 
at Kingston.  I looked into that and I found out that a month ago 
there was a classroom discussion at the peacekeeping training 
centre there.  Somebody asked a question about different 
theoretical possibilities and there was a general discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Policy for the Canadian forces is not made in a classroom in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on the very day of the Kosovo debate in this House, in 
response to a direct question, the Prime Minister categorically 
stated that the use of ground troops was not being considered, 
period.  So the possibility was not debated.  It was not on the 
table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suddenly we find out that this was actively being considered by 
the government at the time, in fact the week before.  Why would 
the government withhold this information from the House if its 
desire is to get the support of the House for what it is doing in 
Kosovo? 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have been abundantly clear about this. 
The only ground forces we have been talking about are those in 
relation to a peace implementation plan.  There will be 
peacekeepers when a peaceful condition exists in Kosovo.  That is 
the only thing this government has put forward.  It was discussed 
in the House on February 17 and that is what we are preparing 600 
troops to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we will give the defence minister a chance to be even 
more abundantly clear.  If this has been discussed and 
considered, will he tell the House precisely what commitment of 
ground forces Canada is going to make to this international peace 
force under the German plan?  And will the government bring 
forward a motion in this House asking for a votable commitment to 
that commitment? 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, talk about votable situations.  The

not to talk about this subject at all.  If they want a vote, they 
could vote no confidence in this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is taking its responsibility and doing the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the 
Minister of National Defence again raised the possibility of 
Canada's sending between 600 and 800 ground troops to Kosovo. 
They would probably be posted in Macedonia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No mention was ever made in the House of soldiers being posted 
anywhere but in Kosovo and doing anything but playing a 
humanitarian and peacekeeping role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Minister of National Defence confirm that 800 soldiers 
could be sent to Macedonia, and, if so, what role they will 
play?

<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

said.  We had said 600 to 800 troops, but we now have it pinned 
down to 600 troops.  Yes, they would go to Macedonia because they 
would be part of a co-operative effort with the British who are 
located in Macedonia.  We have not determined when they are going 
to be deployed, but their only deployment will be as 
peacekeepers.

Canada is not monitoring our hospitals and health care facilities

can expect that 35% of health care facilities will not be ready 
in time and will need millions of dollars to fix the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Minister of Health let the Liberal policy of pay

<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the first thing we have to do is explain to the hon. member the 
constitutional responsibilities here.  The provinces are 
responsible for the hospitals.  If the provinces are not doing 
the job with the money that we just gave them to make sure that 
their own facilities are Y2K compliant, then the member ought to 
take it up with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as Health Canada is concerned, the second thing the 
member has to understand is that his so-called survey is 
unscientific and unreliable.  I can tell the member what the 
facts are.  Health Canada is 93% compliant with its Y2K 
responsibilities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, last 
week the Treasury Board said that Health Canada was dead last as

When will the government accept its responsibility for health 
care in this country and ensure that the money is available so 
that health care will be available on January 1, 2000?

are 93% of the way there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to hospitals throughout the country, we have 
encouraged the provinces to look after their responsibilities.  I 
hope they do.  I remind the member that in the recent budget we 
provided $11.5 billion to help the provinces do just that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the fact is that pre-tax

today than they were when this minister came to power five years 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the finance minister feels the pain of Canadians.

single income families headed by women is up by $1,000.  What he

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, because of the deepening crisis in Kosovo, Canada has an 
opportunity to use its position on the security council to show 
leadership and bring about a diplomatic solution of this crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister representing Canada take before the security 
council a resolution under the uniting for peace precedent, a 
resolution which does not require a consensus of the security 
council but a simple majority? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will Canada take that resolution before the security council and 
urge an emergency special session of the general assembly to try 
to arrive at a peaceful diplomatic solution to the problem? 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I said to the leader of the New Democratic Party, 
certainly we have been examining a variety of propositions 
including the uniting for peace resolution.  I discussed that at 
the United Nations last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time there is in active discussion the proposal 
that was developed last weekend during a meeting of G-8 
officials.  It was communicated among G-8 ministers and would 
have agreement.  It would go to security council and would 
establish the conditions for peace in Kosovo, including the 
establishment of an international force to monitor the 
peacekeeping and to verify the peacekeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the proposal by the hon. member would cross 
currents with that particular proposal, and I think we should let 
this particular diplomatic initiative play out first.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, all of us fervently and deeply hope that particular 
proposal will bear fruit.  There is no question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How long is the minister prepared to wait?  How many more people 
must die?  How many more villages must be burned and refugees 
driven out of their homes before Canada finally takes urgent 
action, brings this matter before the security council and 
ultimately uses our leadership in the way that Lester Pearson did 
in 1956 to take it before the general assembly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much longer is he prepared to wait before he shows that 
leadership and brings it before the security council? 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there is a very curious undertone to the member's 
question that somehow Canada was responsible for the violence, 
the persecution and the repression.  It is Mr. Milosevic who is 
doing that.  It is not Canada that is doing that.  We are using 
all our resources not only to try to stop that repression from 
continuing but also to try to find a diplomatic solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to do them at the same time in a parallel 
fashion.  What I am saying right now is that the most likely 
prospect we have at the moment is the one we have been discussing 
over the last three or four days.  We hope it can bear fruition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the world of diplomacy we are never sure but we will continue 
to activate that.  If it does not work we will look at other 
options at the United Nations, including the uniting for peace 
resolution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
are now in the seventh year of the cod moratorium in Atlantic 
Canada.  However all scientific data show that cod stocks are at 
a lower level now than they were in 1992.  A particular cause for 
alarm is that there are very few juvenile fish to be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans provide us with an 
explanation as to why, in the absence of a commercial cod fishery 
for seven years, cod fish numbers are so low?  Is it possible 
that seven million harp seals might be a factor?

<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are a number of reasons for the 
decline in cod stocks and for the failure of the cod stocks to 
recover since the moratorium in 1992.  The fundamental reason for 
the difficulty we face with cod was the extreme overharvesting in 
the period prior to 1992 when the hon. member's party was in 
power making decisions as to the total allowable catch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been attempting, through a number of measures which are 
extremely difficult for the fishermen in Newfoundland, Labrador 
and the rest of Atlantic Canada, to try to improve cod stocks. 
There are a variety of reasons, including changes in water 
temperature particularly in the gulf, possible predation and 
difficulties— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for St. John's West. 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
one of the reasons for the demise of the cod stocks is the 
absence of a seal management plan.  There is adequate scientific 
evidence which proves that harp seal populations have doubled, if 
not tripled, over the past seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister acknowledged on Monday to all provincial fisheries 
ministers that for reasons of international trade there would be 
no increase in seal quotas.  In particular, he mentioned 
sanctions against canned salmon from his home province of British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister accept his responsibility and implement, based 
on scientific data and not politics, a seal management plan for 
Atlantic Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again the hon. member's knowledge of 
history and his own party's history is defective.  It was a Tory 
minister of fisheries who happened to come from Newfoundland that 
responded to the threats of overseas boycotts by cutting out the 
sealing in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That started the increase in the population to which the hon. 
member has referred.  If he is concerned about people being 
worried about overseas boycotts, he should speak to Atlantic 
Canadians, 80% of whose product is exported, who know that $2.2 
billion would not be coming into their region were there such a 
boycott.

before.  They have been found 11 miles up the Eagle River in 
Labrador feeding on Atlantic salmon.  The seals are literally 
eating themselves out of house and home because they are 
starving.

that if the House leaders are inclined to have prolongation of 
hours, perhaps they can meet with one another. May I suggest that 
to the House leaders.  This can always come back as a unanimous 
consideration for the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>   Mr. 
Speaker, I respect your kind words and your decision.  However, I 
point out that it was the hon. government House leader who made 
that offer.  I would suggest that this party would be in favour 
of that but with a minor amendment, that we have a vote at the 
end of the evening.  I think our colleagues would agree to that 
right here without waiting for you to make a further decision. 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it seems to me that we need to separate two things here:  the 
ongoing debate which would not be a point of order, about whether 
or not there should be a vote in the event of the commitment of 
ground troops or whatever, and the question of whether or not the 
debate of the other night should be extended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally see no point in having a vote on the motion we 
debated the other night because it was a meaningless motion in 
the first place. The question is whether or not we should 
continue the debate so more members can have a chance to express 
themselves.  In that sense, I would urge the government House 
leader and other House leaders to agree.  But having a vote on 
what we had before us the other night would hardly be worth 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I see we are having negotiations whether we 
want to have them or not.  If you want to take five minutes I do 
not mind sitting in the chair.  Let us hear what the government 
House leader has to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me try this to see if 
the House is agreeable.  I would like to offer the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, notwithstanding any standing order or usual practice, at 
6.30 p.m. this day, the House shall not consider proceedings 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, but it shall resume consideration 
of Government Orders, Government Business No. 23, provided that 
during consideration of the said Government Order, the Chair 
shall not receive any quorum calls, dilatory motions or requests 
for unanimous consent to propose any motion; and, provided that 
when no member rises to speak or at 12 a.m., whichever is 
earlier, the House shall adjourn to the next sitting day. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this motion is adopted, the Minister of Foreign Affairs is

The recent commercial television and radio decision of the

release of relevant taxpayer information. Therefore, it would not 
be applicalbe in the release of taxpayer information to the 
Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation, MPIC. Such information can 
only be released to MPIC when the taxpayer has signed and

Department of National Revenue may release information to MPIC.

the form was modified to meet current standards to ensure that 
there is no ambiguity about the release of information the client 
is authorizing.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1999 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK189">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 12 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-71, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget 
tabled in parliament on February 16, 1999, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to rise today to speak to Bill C-71, the 
budget implementation act of 1999.  The premise today is that it 
is a great budget that will be easy to implement because it was a 
great process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is on the ground that problems are felt, it is on the ground 
that real solutions are formulated and it is on the ground that 
budgets are implemented.  I hope we will never return to the day 
when ministers of finance and a few close advisors cloister 
themselves and then come out of their perceived telephone booths 
to announce to Canadians what they think is good for Canadians. 
We know that does not work.  People do not want to be told what 
is good for them when they have not been included in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been pretty fortunate to have come from an institution 
like Women's College Hospital.  Women's College Hospital had the 
motto “Non quo sed quo modo”, meaning that it is not only what 
we do but how we do it.  It is very interesting that when we have 
a motto such as that we actually look at the way we do things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the federal budget there are two hows:  how we decide what we 
want and how we do what we want.  It was indeed the process in 
terms of how we decide what we want, the thorough consultation 
and rigorous analysis of this budget, that has ensured its 
relevance to Canadians and thereby its success in implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a feminist theory, if we are allowed to use that term, 
which I am proud to use, that is actually part of inclusive 
decision making.  One of my great heroes, Ursula Franklin, once 
told a story of being invited to a PD day at a school.  She 
insisted that all of the staff be included.  The teachers thought 
that maybe just the faculty should be included.  However, because 
the topic of the day was identifying children at risk, Ursula 
felt that she would like to have all of the staff there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was quite interesting that as they began the day, within the 
first half hour the janitor put up his hand and said “I know 
kids from violent homes because they are on the doorstep when I 
open up the school in the morning”.  It was in the next half 
hour that the Jamaican cook put up her hand and said “I know who 
the kids are who are hungry because they help me clear the 
plates.  I know they are eating the scraps on the way to the 
kitchen”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only through inclusive decision making that we end up with 
a result that is relevant and one which we can implement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a new member of the finance committee I was truly impressed 
with the inclusive nature of the process, with the thoughtful and 
impressive deputations and with the ability to analyse problems, 
present solutions that had been tried in other jurisdictions, 
present the risk of doing nothing and the rationale for 
government to invest in these solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from the grassroots across the country.  We heard from 
the researchers, the policy analysts and the business community. 
We heard concerns of health care, brain drain, decreasing 
disposable income and our debt.  We also heard their solutions. 
They felt that reinvestment in health care was imperative.  They 
felt that we should reinvest in research, target tax relief and 
get our debt to GDP in line.  We heard from all of the partners 
whom we will need to implement these policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 16 the Minister of Finance presented what I think 
was a brilliantly crafted balance of the solutions presented. 
The availability of resources were allocated according to the 
priorities stated by Canadians.  Health care was without a doubt 
number one.  Our most valued social program received the major 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was clear that just money would not ensure the restoration of 
Canadians' confidence in the system.  Experts, including the 
National Forum on Health, have been very clear.  There has to be 
real accountability for the dollars spent.  There have to be 
dollars for a health information system that will begin that 
process.  The Canadian Institute of Health Research will begin 
the exemplary process of co-ordinating research in the broadest 
definition of health from the molecule to the community.   We 
will be able to look at health promotion, disease prevention and 
treatment and research into best practices in health care 
delivery. 
We know that best practices could save an additional $7 billion a 
year.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget was exciting because of the other how also, the 
second how of how we do things. That is the landmark agreement of 
the social union.  It will begin a process by which the federal 
and provincial governments will commit to a new transparent 
method of delivering programs.  They will have to report their 
outcomes to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Prime Minister's commitment to getting the health accord and 
the social union signed has rendered the dollars assigned in this 
budget even more important.  Canadians can now be assured that 
every dollar will go as far as it possibly can.  Evaluation and 
accountability are now imperative.  The new social union 
framework values Canadians' equality, respect for diversity, 
fairness, individual dignity and responsibility, mutual aid and 
our responsibility for one another.  These things have been 
agreed upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no longer the survival of the fittest in this big cold 
country.  A long time ago we decided that we would look after one 
another.  We are not going to be asking levels of government to 
report to one another; we are asking all levels of government to 
report to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That all Canadians are created equal and should be treated equal 
and equal per Canadian funding was a principle of the social 
union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to meet the needs of Canadians with sustaining social 
programs and services.  We have reaffirmed the Canada Health Act 
in active participation in a social and economic life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second principle was mobility.  This will allow Canadians to 
pursue opportunities.  It ensures what is so important, that a 
Canadian is a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third premise which is extremely important is the public 
accountability and transparency in terms of getting the health 
information systems, achieving and measuring results, involvement 
of Canadians and ensuring fair and transparent practices.  It is 
this point that will make every dollar spent in the budget go 
that much further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Working in partnership for Canadians, joint planning and 
collaboration, reciprocal notice and consultation was the fourth 
aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth aspect was a proper clarification of the federal 
spending power. This means that dollars assigned in a federal 
budget have been predetermined and will be easily implemented. 
Dispute avoidance and resolution was obviously important, as was 
the three year review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding there was great debate before the budget about 
giving dollars to the provinces in the CHST. One very adamant 
constituent was very clear at our prebudget consultation that we 
were not to just give money to Mr. Harris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The signing of the social union health accord has been a 
tremendous step forward for our federalism.  Canadians need to 
feel confident that dollars dedicated for health care would be 
spent on health care.  The commitment to transparency is 
imperative to rebuild the confidence of Canadians.  It makes me 
very optimistic in terms of the truly positive role for 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social union will ensure that Canadians will continue to be 
consulted to set their social priorities.  The federal and 
provincial governments have to make sure that it happens.  It is 
only in that way that we get to deal properly with the tough 
issues like the preschool development of our children, 
homelessness, and persons with disabilities which cross all 
ministries and all levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week in St. Paul's we had a town hall meeting with the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  We also had a panel 
consisting of Lorne Sossin, a constitutional lawyer; Barbara 
Cameron, a professor of political science from York University; 
Martha Friendly, a child care researcher; and Andrew Coyne.  It 
was an interesting debate in St. Paul's, a riding that is known 
for caring desperately about the big picture and putting Canada 
first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It came from that meeting how complex our federalism is and how 
important it is that we deal with a matrix of responsibilities, 
accountabilities, but together set some real objectives as to 
what it means to be a Canadian and what we care about. It is 
imperative that we move forward with our partners, the private 
sector, the third sector and our provincial colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have our choices, our policy levers and our incentives and 
our programs.  We actually continue to ask Canadians at election 
time what they care about.  We tell them how we interpreted that 
in our speech from the throne, but it is at budget time where we 
get to set the priorities that came forward with the dollars that 
have been allocated.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget was a balanced one.  It reflected the true 
priorities of Canadians as they said to us.  Therefore it will be 
an extraordinarily easy budget to implement because the people 
implementing it were the people involved in deciding what was 
there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have the 
pleasure of working on the finance committee with the hon. 
member. It is always fun to get into the debates and ask 
questions of witnesses when they come to our committee. I have a 
couple of questions for the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She talked a little bit about this new federalism.  The Prime 
Minister and the health minister with the collusion of the 
finance minister have altered our Constitution. By using the 
federal spending power, they have basically held a club over the 
heads of the premiers of the provinces and have thereby intruded 
into what is constitutionally a provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though I say this somewhat reluctantly, I think it was 
probably only the premier of Quebec who had—what do you call it 
in French—the chutzpah to stand up against what the government 
is saying.  Of course, Quebec got the money anyway so it did not 
really matter.  The other premiers did not do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have quite a concern about the federal government taxing the 
dickens out of us.  We are overtaxed and we are talking here 
today about the budget.  We are taxed like anything.  Most 
families have noticed the tax pressure.  The provinces have 
reduced tax room because of this. The federal government by 
taking all this money from us, really backs the provinces into a 
corner in terms of economic freedom of what they can do to manage 
the health care system. Then this government turns around and 
says “Okay, we are going to give you some of your money back but 
the condition is that it must be used only for health”.  That is 
a straight violation of the Constitution of Canada.  Most 
constitutional experts say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I certainly share the concern of the member with respect 
to health and the funding of health, we know that this government 
by its reduction of the transfers to the provinces over the last 
number of years has made a substantial negative impact on the 
reduction of health care services for Canadians.  The Liberals 
are now gingerly giving a little bit of it back and they say that 
is helping while at the same time they are breaking the 
Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would sure like to hear the comments of the member on that 
particular subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the issue is 
the provinces all have agreed that this is necessary.  There was 
no club to their heads.  Even Quebec signed a health accord 
saying it was extremely important that people understand what it 
is for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Constitutionally, actually it was only hospitals that were the 
provincial responsibility.  There has always been an agreement 
that health care is a joint responsibility in terms of what we do 
federally, research and prevention and all of those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is imperative is that throwing money at problems without 
any accountability would not be acceptable to any taxpayer or any 
business person.  We are saying there has to be a set of 
objectives and we will then figure out what the performance 
indicators are, what are the kinds of things that the various 
sectors can agree on as to what is acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that you cannot start measuring things unless you have 
an ability to remedy the things that are not working properly. A 
1995 document from the University of Ottawa and Queen's 
University made it clear that if we moved to what is in the 
social union, best practices, we would be saving $7 billion a 
year in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are doing too many unnecessary surgeries.  We are giving 
antibiotics for colds.  We are doing way too many things that are 
totally ineffective. We are ordering tons of laboratory tests 
that have been outdated for 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a way to help the provinces share best practices and 
help them save money to be able to provide exemplary and optimal 
patient care. 
This is not going to be if we keep allowing money to go places 
without the kind of scrutiny and accountability Canadians expect.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thrilled that these two things have come together. It is 
amazing that the hon. member would say that there was a club to 
the heads of the provincial premiers. They all willingly signed 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social union talks about transparency.  It talks about best 
practices.  It talks about accountability.  It talks about 
involving Canadians in setting their social priorities. 
Hopefully at the end of the turf war of we are going to set some 
objectives and promise Canadians that they are going to happen 
together.  It is the beginning of trying to get some sense out of 
this very complex federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were experts present at our town hall meeting last week. 
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs was fabulous in 
explaining that fact and compared this to other countries.  For 
example in the United States, unless the states sign on to 
lowering the driver's age they do not get any money for highways. 
We could not pull that off in Canada if we tried.  Canadians 
would not want that kind of power for the central government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also huge power for the provincial premiers. We have an 
interesting complex tug in terms of tension. This has been a 
brilliant piece of work that a lot of us were very worried about 
before.  It is thrilling to actually see this work and now be 
able to implement things, to put the meat on the bones of the 
social union, get these sectoral agreements going, start setting 
objectives and actually give Canadians a bang for their buck.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to put a question to the member for St. Paul's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that, on February 4, 1999, under the social 
agreement signed by the premiers, except the Premier of Quebec 
naturally, and the Prime Minister of Canada, the Government of 
Canada promised to consult the provincial and territorial 
governments at least a year before renewing or significantly 
changing the funding of the existing social transfers to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is as follows: How do you explain the government's 
going back on its word and its signature, since two weeks later, 
the federal government radically changed the formula for 
allocating social transfers among the provinces?  Please explain 
this change and this going back on its commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member knows that he must address 
the Chair and not the member directly.  The hon. member for St. 
Paul's. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would draw the hon. 
member's attention to the principle of the social union which was 
to treat all Canadians with fairness and equity.  It was 
extraordinarily important to the finance minister and to the 
government that all Canadians receive on a per capita basis their 
rightful percentage of the CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an anomaly that had been capped by the previous 
government and it needed to be right.  It needed to be fair. It 
is part of the social union principle that all Canadians be 
treated equally.  Therefore that was reflected in the budget. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, I have a 
brief question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear where authority lies for health care.  It is 
under section 92.  It falls within the realm of the provincial 
governments. I would like the hon. member to tell the House where 
she sees within the BNA act, the Constitution of this country, 
authority of the federal government over health care.  If she 
could tell the House that I would be pleased.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  The issue is health care delivery 
and there has been a consensus that health care delivery must be 
dealt with by the province.  Some of the standards that have been 
set in terms of the Medical Research Council of Canada and all of 
the things we have had before have always had joint agreement in 
terms of— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Where is the authority? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  I will be more than happy to find it 
but I do trust— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The spending power, the federal spending 
power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  It is in the federal spending power 
to set priorities which we think are in the best interest of all 
Canadians.  That is separate from health care delivery. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, budget 
implementation is of great interest to me because the budget was 
characterized as a “health budget”.  We have heard a lot about 
the health budget.  The previous speaker being a physician and 
rather glowing about the budget obviously believes it was a 
health budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One issue has been fascinating to me.  I have had an opportunity 
to go about the country and express this sentiment.  The Liberal 
government has promised to put $11.5 billion back into health 
care over the next five years.  There was a significant amount of 
advertising to that effect.  One would not think that it would 
have to advertise such good news.  One would not think it would 
have to spend $2.5 million to tell everyone.  That message should 
go across the country, it is so exciting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the government have to advertise it?  In truth it had to 
advertise it because in the previous five years it took out $21.4 
billion cumulatively since the day the finance minister took 
over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked kids in grade eight what they thought of that as a 
balance and they said “Doc, we don't think that is a very good 
balance.  Doc, we think that is a crazy balance”.  I have a 
little graphic that I used.  I cannot use props in the House but 
I can describe a prop in the House.  Here is the prop I used to 
show what the Liberal government did with medical funding for the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I held up an intravenous bag with 1,000 cc's of IV fluid in it. 
I coloured the fluid red so it would like blood.  Some of my 
colleagues have seen this.  The 1,000 cc's represents the $1,453 
per taxpayer that was being transferred from the federal 
government to the provinces for health care when it took over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I held up another bag with 596 cc's of IV fluid in it. 
There is a significant difference.  Anyone looking at it would 
say that it just about half, which is true.  That is what the 
federal government was transferring per taxpayer for medicare 
just before the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I took a big syringe and put about 100 cc's into the IV 
bag, which pumped it all the way up to 692 cc's.  I showed the 
two bags, the full one and the one with 692 cc's in it.  We must 
remember that it was at 1,000 cc's when I started and now it is 
down to 692 cc's.  The response to that is dramatic.  People just 
say it is not keeping up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been the result, the practical down to earth result? 
The public does not really give a hoot about jurisdiction.  If 
there were no effect on health it would say that was not a big 
deal, but the evidence of problems in our health care system are 
legion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have chosen to look at the newspaper reports over the last 
little while.  There are too many for me to go through.  It would 
take my whole speaking time. 
However I will touch on just a few of the recent news reporting 
relating to health.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Newfoundland 600 people need heart surgery every year.  The 
province can only afford 400 so 200 have a choice.  They can get 
in a waiting line or they can go across the border to the States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 19 this year every surgery was cancelled at the 
Kelowna General Hospital in B.C.  Why?  Because there were not 
enough beds and personnel to look after them.  That comes from 
the CANOE news of January 19.  On and on they go.  There are 
dozens of examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women in Summerside, P.E.I., have to wait one year for a 
mammogram because one machine broke down and the government there 
cannot afford the $75,000 to fix it.  How will it get fixed?  The 
foundation will go out and raise private funds to look after 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Montreal the waiting list for a hip operation can be as long 
as 15 months.  For gallstone surgery, which is a painful 
condition, it takes 2.5 months.  That information comes from the 
<I>Gazette</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another very interesting one.  Patients in Manitoba 
waiting for an MRI are being offered from a private U.S. medical 
clinic in Fargo, North Dakota, a charter air service and free 
night in a hotel so that they can get a timely MRI.  How many 
Manitobans have taken advantage of that?  There have been 120 
Manitobans who have said they will not wait.  That was in the 
Winnipeg <I>Free Press</I> on January 27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Grace Hospital in Winnipeg there were corridors jammed 
with patients.  There was no room for them in the wards.  In one 
case there was no room to put a baby that had sadly passed on so 
nurses hid the little baby behind a curtain while doctors worked 
on other patients beside it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An elderly man was incontinent after days of near neglect in a 
hospital.  His friend asked a nurse to put diapers on him.  The 
response was “We don't have diapers.  You must go and buy those 
yourself”.  On it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting.  We have a nursing strike right now in 
Saskatchewan demonstrating stress.  We have an exodus of trained 
health care workers.  In the last two years 1,400 of our best 
trained specialists have left and will never return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government can say all those things are provincial 
and we do not have anything to do with that.  There is, however, 
a hospital at Sioux Lookout.  It is interesting that the health 
minister mentioned it in question period today.  I will go 
through the story of the Sioux Lookout Hospital which is a 
federal responsibility.  This is a hospital for natives alone. 
The federal government has complete responsibility for that 
hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a story of incompetent bungling.  In the spring of 1997 
Health Canada was first warned that a crisis at the Sioux Lookout 
Hospital was coming.  I have three letters directed to the 
Minister of Health and his officials which said there would be a 
shortage of physicians at the hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The story is quite interesting.  The University of Toronto had 
been looking after physician recruitment for that area for 30 
years and a deficit had occurred.  They said they could not 
continue to look after the deficit.  They warned that by June 
1998 they would be pulling out unless that deficit could be taken 
care of.  It was simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mae Katt, Ontario regional director for Health Canada, said 
there was no problem, that they would have 15 physicians from 
McMaster on that date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conditions deteriorated.  The warnings were raised.  Health 
Canada refused to respond to the University of Toronto. McMaster, 
negotiating with the Sioux Lookout individuals and this Mae Katt, 
just simply said it could not do it in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened on June 30?  This could not happen in a third 
world country.  With five hours notice the Sioux Lookout 
emergency was closed.  A closed sign was put up in an emergency 
department for natives and 16,000 natives were without emergency 
care.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A contract finally appeared.  It was a like a contract for an 
F-18.  It had nothing to do with medical issues.  Things were 
crossed out and whited out.  The physicians who were there just 
simply said they could not sign it.  They were threatened with 
losing their seniority if they did not sign it.  They lost their 
seniority.  They left the north.  Instead of 15 physicians 
looking after Sioux Lookout, today there are 4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been privileged to look over this story and finally, in 
the last month, advertising has gone out for recruiting.  Anyone 
who knows anything about recruiting physicians for the north will 
know how long that will take.  We will not have physicians in the 
north until this summer at the very earliest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the hon. member for Kenora—Rainy River have to say 
about this?  These are his words relating specifically to Sioux 
Lookout: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The medical services branch has totally bungled everything here. 
This issue has been totally mismanaged. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal member for Kenora—Rainy River did everything he 
could do to get our Minister of Health to listen.  He begged him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we know what his response was?  The minister sent up one of 
his underlings who said there was a nursing crisis that was just 
as big. That was the response of Joanne Meyer, an executive 
assistant. They went over the nursing crisis.  We would think 
that there would be an immediate response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an immediate response.  Here is the letter sent by the 
native communities to the World Health Organization in Geneva, 
Switzerland, begging for some help.  We go to Switzerland to look 
after our native brothers in the north.  They went to Doctors 
Without Borders. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were cared for by Doctors Without Borders.  It is 
absolutely abominable. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sioux Lookout is an example of how the federal government looks 
after its specific responsibility.  The diary of this story is 
not through.  The natives today in Sioux Lookout are on a hunger 
strike.  They are sitting there with their arms folded, saying 
this should not happen in a country like Canada, but it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Minister of Health, belatedly, will trot up north, sit 
down with them and say “Come and get involved in my task 
force”.   I would like him to say why he did not respond to 
these problems when he got the initial warnings two years ago.  I 
am willing to provide the letters specifically directed toward 
the Minister of Health to anyone who wants to see them.  Sioux 
Lookout is an example of a tragic situation in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time is so short.  After talking about the bungling at Sioux 
Lookout, let me talk about the bungling on the hepatitis C issue 
in Canada.  As a physician I gave my patients blood.  As a 
surgeon I gave them blood.  I trusted that our blood system was 
as good as it could be.  I found out through Judge Krever that 
was not true, that we gave patients in Canada dirty blood, blood 
infected with hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judge Krever, who became our expert in tainted blood, said we 
should look after everyone who is sick from receiving tainted 
blood; not just give them money because they are positive with 
hepatitis C but give them something if they are in trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understood what he said.  I understood why he said that the 
federal regulators had made a mess.  He said the provincial 
regulators had made mistakes and he said that the Red Cross had 
been involved as well.  I have watched with wonder how the 
government could try to weasel out of that responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also watched with wonder a compassionate Ontario premier 
say that he will not just give narrow compensation to the group 
from 1986 to 1990 but will give compensation to everyone, and he 
did that.  I have watched Quebec now change its proposals.  It is 
looking at compensating everyone.  I have watched as lawyers 
argue, fight and bicker over the funds that should be going to 
the individuals who are ill. 
I had occasion to sit down with a few of them here in Ottawa just 
the other night. I listened to them talk about their needs and 
their worries.  The local regional government is taking better 
care of these individuals than the ones who are really 
responsible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also watched Swiss authorities being charged and huge 
sanctions put upon them for exactly the same actions in 
Switzerland.  I have watched the French authorities bring to 
trial the prime minister, the health minister, the social affairs 
minister of the day for the same actions.  I wonder where are we 
in Canada for these poor people with hepatitis C.  I think this 
will go down as one of the blackest chapters as it relates to 
health.  Of course, I point across the way for that 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk briefly about the future of medicare as I see it. I 
really and truly believe that this social program is so valuable 
even though the Liberal motto seems to be “we will just hide our 
heads in the sand and have the status quo”.  I say that two tier 
medicine is alive and well in Canada thanks to the Liberal 
policies.  There is one tier for the dead and there is another 
tier for the waiting.  That is said with tongue in cheek, but it 
is truly sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we need to do to improve and protect this health care 
system of ours?  The first step needs to be funding that is not 
hidden under the Canada health and social transfer.  That was the 
way the Liberals got away with this tremendous reduction in 
funding.  Health care funding from the federal government should 
be so specific, so clear, so straight, so plain that no one could 
ever get away with reducing it as they did.  It should also be 
indexed to inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would cast this Canada health and social transfer into the 
dustbin of history and have health care funding so plain and 
clear, as I said.  We could have the other funding just the same. 
That is something the Canadian Medical Association has called 
for and it is certainly something I personally agree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to stop thinking of this as a system, but think of 
it as care.  The patient must come first again.  We have had a 
health care system that has been driven by politicians, by 
bureaucrats and frankly by the medical profession. I do not think 
that is the way to drive this system.  The solutions will come 
from the individuals who are most affected.  I would put the 
patient first.  We need specific mechanisms to reduce the waiting 
lists in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where will we go with our medicare system?  It is fascinating. 
Last Friday was the 15 year anniversary of the Canada Health Act. 
Monique Bégin, a Liberal, a good Liberal, was responsible for the 
Canada Health Act.  I listened to comments made by her. She said 
very plainly that the Canada Health Act needs to be revisited. 
She said that there are breakdowns in the Canada Health Act. 
What a brave woman.  She is talking about looking after health 
rather than the politicization of our health care system. That is 
really, truly where I believe we should go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite optimistic about the future of our health care 
system.  If we can get away from the name calling, if we can get 
away from speaking about basic changes to our health care system 
as being an Americanization or two tier, if we can get down to 
the level of actually looking at and trying to fix this system, I 
think we have a real good chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am optimistic because of New Zealand's experience.  It came so 
close to losing its health care system when it hit the debt wall, 
and it did.  New Zealanders lost virtually all their social 
programs.  Their senior citizens programs were battered. They 
lost transportation subsidies.  They lost all the subsidies for 
their agricultural projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did not lose their medicare. They did everything they had 
to do to save their medicare system.  They went so far as to put 
advertising on their ambulances to pay for the fuel so they would 
not lose their medicare system.  They chose a route I do not 
agree with. They chose the route of user fees to improve and 
increase the cash flow for their medicare.  But losing virtually 
every other social program, New Zealanders clung to their 
medicare system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I consult with Canadians across the land, I hear them say

will survive not because of the actions of this Liberal 
administration, but in spite them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have two questions for the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the litany of individual provincial problems with health care 
delivery the member made it sound like this is only about money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member to comment on the Ontario Hospital 
Association's presentation to the finance committee.  The 
association said that this is not about money.  This is about 
mismanagement. It is about not having income-outcome measures and 
setting best practices and those kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member prove that this is just about money?  How can 
he blame the federal government for what some people feel is a 
mismanagement problem in terms of the delivery system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am astounded that as a physician, a profession which is 
criticized for over-medicalizing our health care, the member could 
actually think that we could fund a sort of fix it part of the 
system instead of a holistic model that the patients know works. 
A health transfer does not deal with the social determinants of 
health, poverty, violence, the environment and all those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way to a sustainable health care system is to keep 
people well and not let them get sick.  It is only the doctors 
that seem to have trouble getting the picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure the member missed 
the initial comments I made. Those comments were fairly specific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will have been $11.5 billion put back into health over the 
coming five years, with $21.4 billion taken out in the previous 
five years.  Does the member see that balance?  My colleague will 
shake her head and say this did not happen.  I ask her to look at 
the amount transferred to the provinces in 1993 and look at the 
amount transferred at the end of the next five years.  The member 
will find that this is an incredible reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time is relatively short here but we could go beyond my 
comments on the issue of mismanagement in the system and we 
certainly should go beyond my comments.  I am not trying to talk 
about the whole health care system.  I am talking about the 
federal responsibility when it relates to the funding component. 
If that is beyond the ken of the Liberals, I can understand why 
they would go ahead and make those reductions and think they are 
not a big deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Ontario Hospital Association have the capability of 
finding some mismanagement in the system?  You bet and it 
certainly should do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting to note that the province of Ontario 
spends more on medicare in one year than the federal government 
transfers to the whole country. Where is the rubber hitting the 
road?  The rubber is hitting the road for the provinces and this 
administration made it difficult for them.  In spite of those 
reductions the provinces found more money for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a dreadful debate when we look at just a narrow component. 
This government has done more to harm medicare than any other 
government in Canadian history.

situation in most hospitals.  He is a doctor himself and can 
describe up close what we see from the outside.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Having spoken with many doctors, nurses and especially patients, 
I know things are difficult.  When the Rochon reform began, 
certain adjustments had to be made.  Doctors and nurses, 
particularly those on the front line, had to work twice as hard 
to provide more or less the same level of care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, one of my friends died in the hospital in Rimouski. 
Her husband and children told me she had received exceptional 
care, despite all the federal cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to thank the doctors and nurses who deal 
with this situation, who often work overtime with a limited 
staff to preserve the quality of patient care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate these people because they really care. When staff 
cuts are made, it is not easy to continue to provide the same 
quality of care, because we are dealing with human lives, not 
objects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member, who is a doctor. Earlier, 
he mentioned that many doctors are moving abroad, particularly 
to the United States. Nurses are also leaving. Of course, 
salaries are a factor. The fact that these people are not paid 
the same as doctors in the United States might a reason for 
their leaving the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be possible for a government to remove some of the 
quotas in universities? As we know, there are quotas in medical 
schools. It is hard to get accepted in medical school. We are 
told there is shortage of doctors. I agree that doctors work 
really hard, but there are not enough of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member think there is a way to train more doctors, 
particularly in the regions? Each year, we have to go to the 
universities, almost beg young doctors and give them special 
benefits to convince them to come to our regions. Every year, we 
have to go through this exercise, which should not be necessary, 
in my opinion. The regions should be served as adequately as the 
large urban centres. I would like to hear the hon. member on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a big problem in rural 
areas with the numbers of physicians and nurses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not specifically money problems. There are equipment 
problems. In some northern hospitals the equipment is inadequate 
to meet the needs of patients and physicians alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other problems too. I toured Saskatchewan two weeks 
ago, and 50% of physicians come from South Africa. There are no 
more Canadian doctors in northern Saskatchewan. There are huge 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there a solution to the recruiting problem? People do not go 
up north. Those who practice in very difficult areas should be 
adequately compensated. I agree with the member, there are huge 
problems in rural areas.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
during the member's speech he referred to waiting times for 
certain procedures.  I believe he talked about hip replacements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member would simply comment that it is hospitals 
that have to deliver balanced budgets for their institutions. 
There is a restriction on the operating theatre time that they 
have, as well as on the amount that they have funded for 
prosthetic devices. 
Therefore, waiting times are not necessarily due to funding, but 
rather to other factors beyond—

There is a whole host of factors concerning waiting lists.  One 
factor is the amount of money available for the prostheses 
themselves.  Another factor is the number of nurses and doctors 
available to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that waiting lists in Canada are the longest they 
have been in history.  I do not believe that is acceptable and I 
look for solutions from an individual like this who is actually 
constructive in his comments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to Bill C-71, the budget implementation bill. 
I want to begin by advising Canadians about the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that a budget was delivered by the finance 
minister with a number of provisions, of which I will review a 
few.  Preceding the budget there were substantial consultations 
with Canadians.  I want to assure Canadians that there is much 
more to the budgeting process than simply finance officials 
determining how they might deal with the fiscal affairs of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Finance conducts an annual budget 
consultation in which its members not only hear from officials as 
to the current fiscal state of affairs and apprise themselves of 
the current numbers, estimates and forecasts that are coming 
forward, they also go across Canada to each and every province 
and territory to consult with Canadians who wish to appear before 
the finance committee to have their say as to what priorities the 
government should have with regard to the next budget.  That 
process starts to take place just after the House resumes from 
its summer recess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that process individuals, as well as groups and 
organizations, come before the committee.  They are on panels. 
They have an opportunity to make their presentations orally and 
in written form.  They also have a dialogue with finance 
committee members.  There is often repartee where people are 
asked to elaborate further on some of the matters they have 
raised.  There is no question, notwithstanding that people are 
asked to come before the finance committee to present their views 
on the national finances and our national budget, that many of 
the groups focus entirely on their own specific interests without 
putting them in the context of how they line up with the 
priorities of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very difficult process that we go through.  The 
committee is represented by all parties.  In that process all 
parties have an opportunity to make comments, to question 
witnesses and to give the kind of input that I think is necessary 
to craft a report which ultimately makes recommendations to the 
government with regard to the options and opportunities which we 
saw in our budget consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we finish our cross-Canada consultations we also receive in 
Ottawa other expert witnesses representing major organizations, 
such as research organizations, health organizations and major 
national organizations on poverty. Poverty certainly was a very 
large component of the testimony that was received by the 
committee in its consultations across the country and indeed in 
Ottawa.  Health care was very strong.  I recall a very strong 
presentation about the significance of diabetes in terms of what 
we could do with regard to funding and obtaining measurable 
results to deal with the consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were also a number of economists.  There were 
representatives from organizations like the Fraser Institute and 
the Caledon Institute of Social Policy who came to talk in a more 
macro way about the kind of direction we are going in with regard 
to estimates of growth and interest rates, with regard to the 
strategy of having prudent assumptions and of having a 
contingency for adverse economic fluctuations so that we would 
ensure the budget would be balanced.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these things come together in a very comprehensive way so 
that parliamentarians from all parties can come up with a report. 
That report, as I said, goes to the finance minister, to the 
finance department and in fact is available to all 
parliamentarians and all Canadians so that they can see the kinds 
of things that were gleaned out of the consultation process and 
the kinds of recommendations which flowed from those 
consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance committee has had quite a good track record in terms 
of identifying substantive options and opportunities for the 
government, and the process, I believe, has served us well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have we articulated in our reports the budget as we might 
ultimately see it on budget day?  No.  There are always matters 
which come from other sources for the government to consider, but 
the consultation does serve Canadians very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want Canadians to know that preparations are already in place 
for consultations for the next budget, which will begin in 
October. Canadians who wish to make representations to the 
government and to the finance committee with regard to the budget 
process are welcome to make inquiries and they can do that 
through their member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that by way of background, I simply want to highlight a few 
of the key budget themes or issues within the last budget to 
remind members and to remind Canadians about where we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budgets which have been brought down since the government 
came to power in 1993 have built upon each other.  Canadians will 
know that the year the government came to power the deficit, the 
excess of spending over revenue coming into the government, was 
about $42 billion.  It was a very significant burden to 
Canadians.  It has accumulated a large national debt which is 
still there to be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By taking prudent steps, by making sure that the fiscal 
decisions of the government maintained its perspective with 
regard to balancing the needs of Canadians, as well as our need 
to get our fiscal house in order, we now have a balanced budget. 
We no longer have a $42 billion deficit; we have a balanced 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few years, having balanced the budget, we have also 
had an opportunity to make sure that we continue to meet the 
social needs of Canadians, the health requirements, as well as to 
pay down real debt.  Canadians will be pleased to know that the 
government is paying down its national debt each and every year, 
not only meeting its interest payments but also paying down 
principal payments, minimally at $3 billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of these budgets there is some very good news.  The 
best way to balance our books and to pay down our debt is to make 
sure that Canadians have the opportunity to have the dignity of 
work, to be part of the paid labour force.  Indeed, 453,000 jobs 
were created in 1998 and another 87,000 jobs were created in 
January of 1999 alone.  Our unemployment rate has dropped.  When 
members came to this place in 1993 our unemployment rate was 
about 11.2%.  Today it is 7.8%.  It is at the lowest level since 
June of 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had balanced budgets or better, which is expected this 
year again, and the government is committed to balanced budgets 
in the years 1999-2000 and 2000-2001.  Canadians can be assured 
that fiscal prudence and proper fiscal management of Canadian 
taxpayers' money continues to be a top priority for the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must live within our means.  We must service our debt.  We 
must pay down our debt.  But we also must make sure that the 
fundamental needs of Canadians with regard to health, education, 
research and development, social programs and other things are 
met to ensure that Canadians are taken care of and live in the 
dignity to which they are entitled.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians know, we are also making major investments in 
health care.  There will be an increase of $11.5 billion in 
transfers to the provinces and territories over the next five 
years, as was discussed by previous speakers.  Breaking it down, 
support for the provinces in health care will be increased $2 
billion in the current fiscal year, with a further $2.5 billion 
in each of the following three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also propose to invest a further $1.4 billion over the 
remainder of this year and the next three years to strengthen our 
health system through research and innovation, and health 
information efforts to prevent health problems and improve 
services to the first nations and to the Inuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians may have heard that recommendations such as report 
cards for our health care system have also come in.  The health 
accord with the provinces is a major positive development on 
behalf of all Canadians, as is the social union which has the 
support of all but one province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some major developments which actually complement and 
tie into the budget initiatives which I have outlined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also going to invest over $1.8 billion for the remainder 
of the fiscal year and the next three years in support of the 
creation, dissemination and commercialization of knowledge and to 
support employment by building on the Canada opportunities 
strategy.  It means going after more job creation to promote an 
environment with low interest rates so that companies will be 
able to enjoy an environment in which economic growth and 
expansion are possible and in which more Canadians who want the 
dignity of work will have that opportunity, particularly our 
young people who have experienced the highest levels of 
unemployment in Canada for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to these overall themes, over three-quarters of the 
new spending in the 1998-99 budget reflects two of the highest 
priorities for Canadians.  What Canadians told us through our 
consultations and what they said directly to the Prime Minister, 
the Minister of Finance and their members of parliament was that 
they wanted increased funding for health care and access to 
knowledge and innovation.  In other words, there will be 
education and the knowledge base will be built upon for Canadians 
to learn, to ensure that they, particularly our young people, are 
ready to take those jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will also benefit from personal income tax cuts of 
$7.7 billion over three years, for a total of $16.5 billion in 
tax cuts in the 1998-99 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it enough?  Are those all of the things Canadians wanted? 
There are many other aspects that would be useful which Canadians 
are interested in promoting.  However, we still have to maintain 
fiscal responsibility in attempting to deal with our significant 
priorities.  We also have to continue to promote and stimulate 
other areas.  As I said earlier, each budget has built on the one 
before it.  We start to see the trend line.  We start to see the 
rebuilding of our fiscal health, and fiscal prudence continues to 
remain the hallmark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others have talked about health care, so I will talk briefly 
about income taxation.  It is an issue that is going to seize the 
House of Commons.  It already has, to some extent, with regard to 
the taxation of families.  It will also seize the House because 
there is a growing interest in income tax reform and in 
continuing to reduce the tax burden of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In lay terms, to reduce income taxes for Canadians means that 
they will have more dollars to prepare for their retirement, to 
spend and to stimulate the economy.  I recall in one budget it 
was referred to as a virtuous circle in which there are benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1998 budget there was a modest tax cut.  There was a $500 
increase in the personal non-refundable tax credit which went to 
Canadians who earned less than $50,000 a year.  In the 1999 
budget that amount was increased by an additional $175, bringing 
the total increase in the non-refundable tax credit to about 
$675.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, that same amount was also extended in 1999 to the 
remainder of taxpayers in Canada who made over $50,000 a year. 
Non-refundable tax credits benefit all Canadians when we consider 
the combined federal-provincial rates.  It means that the $675 is 
worth about 25 cents on the dollar of a non-refundable tax 
credit.  It is about $170 in the pocket of each and every 
taxpayer.  That is good news.  It also helps to remove people who 
work part time or are low income Canadians from the tax rolls as 
a whole.  Those numbers have also been significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget in 1998 began the process of eliminating the 
surtaxes.  We have a 3% surtax and a 5% surtax.  The 3% surtax 
was eliminated in 1998 for taxpayers with incomes of up to 
$50,000.  In the last budget the remainder of that building 
process was to extend the elimination of that 3% tax increase or 
the surtax on Canadian taxpayers whose incomes were in excess of 
$50,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of constituents wrote to me and spoke very strongly 
about the 5% surtax which continues to exist.  These surtaxes 
were imposed as deficit elimination initiatives.  Canadians know 
we have a balanced budget.  They are now asking, since it is 
balanced, for the government to get rid of the 5% surtax.  The 
taxpayers are quite right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to deal with that 5%, but there will be some backlash in 
that regard because it will be seen as a tax break for the rich. 
It will be seen that the highest income earners will get a 
reduction or elimination of the 5% surtax which is applied 
against their federal taxes otherwise payable in excess of 
$12,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This generates for the Government of Canada about $650 million a 
year.  It is a substantial item and to eliminate it in one fell 
swoop, or any of these items, would have put the balancing of our 
books on an annual basis under some pressure and likely in 
jeopardy.  We must continue to balance our books and still be 
within our means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it is little comfort to those who are paying the 5% 
surtax, they should know that the finance committee recognizes 
the need to address that.  In our report we recommended the 5% 
surtax on Canadians be eliminated over a five year period by 
reducing it 1% each year.  That has not happened but it does 
recognize the need for us to address it.  It was $650 million 
that instead of being eliminated was put into the health care 
system. It was a choice to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although investing in our health care system benefits all 
Canadians, the 5% surtax was a deficit elimination measure that 
is still there.  We have to deal with it and I know all members 
will have to come forward with a position on the appropriate way 
to address that $650 million.  Because it must be eliminated, 
what is the fairest way to do it?  What is the most timely way to 
do it and still maintain the priorities, the prudence and the 
balancing of our fiscal affairs?  That is certainly something 
that will come before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1998 budget there was a top up of $850 million provided 
with regard to the Canadian child tax benefit.  This was good 
news for low income Canadians.  We have had no shortage of inputs 
from Canadians with regard to child poverty and family poverty. 
The real issue is family poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We invested an additional $850 million in the Canadian child tax 
benefit.  We could not have done that and got rid of the 5% 
surtax of $650 million and maybe just put $200 million into the 
child tax benefit.  The priority was to address low income 
Canadians who needed assistance.

on the heels of an education budget.  I believe there is 
substantial support in this place.  I hope we will look again at 
the priorities as we build on the fiscal renewal of Canada.  I 
hope children and the family will have a significant place in the 
envelope of the next budget.  I hope members will take the 
opportunity to work with the finance committee and to consult 
with their constituents to help us to identify the immediate 
priorities, the medium priorities and the long term priorities so 
all Canadians will benefit in the long term.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague across the way mentioned income tax refunds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope he knows that a taxpayer who makes on average $30,000 a 
year will get a $90 tax refund; divided by 365 days, it is not 
even enough to buy a cup of coffee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not believe that the best way to be fair to everybody 
would be to index tax tables? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure I understood 
the member's question.  If I understood him, he was referring to 
someone making $30,000 a year only getting a $90 refund.  That is 
probably not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the withholdings or instalments were made there should be no 
refund.  Someone who makes $30,000 a year, assuming it is a 
single person filing the tax return, would get a non-refundable 
tax credit of $6,452.  If he had bought no RRSPs he would be 
paying income tax on about $24,000.  Assuming a 50% provincial 
tax rate, that would mean the effective tax rate of someone at 
that level is about 25 cents on the dollar, so I would assume 
that someone would pay income tax of about $6,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure if I misunderstood but Canadians do pay income 
taxes.  Someone who makes $30,000 a year pays about $6,000 in 
income tax or about 20%.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member referred to last year's budget as the 
education budget.  I remind the House that was the same year 
12,000 students declared personal bankruptcy because of their 
inability to get jobs and pay off their student debts.  That was 
the year of the education budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year is the year of the so-called health budget.  The 
amount of money announced by the finance minister, although a 
substantial $11.5 billion which by anyone's imagination is still 
a lot of money, will only bring us back to 1995 spending levels 
by the year 2005.  In other words, we will be 10 years behind by 
the time we catch up after the government having stripped $17 
billion from that same budget.  How does he square these numbers 
as a CA? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, sometimes I get a little 
frustrated with the presentation of members with regard to 
transfers.  If members want to talk about the facts of health 
care transfers, they know that the cuts to the provinces were a 
lower percentage of provincial revenues than they were for the 
federal government.  In other words, the federal government cuts 
to its own spending were higher than were asked of the provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will also know that the National Forum on Health, an 
independent body, made the report that there was enough money in 
the system but the problem was how it was spent, the wisdom of 
spending money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also did not say, and he should say, that the 
transfers to the provinces were not just cash.  There are tax 
points.  Even under the old system, as growth in the economy 
occurred and the provinces were able to generate more money 
through income tax revenue, the amount of cash was going down. We 
have to take into account how much the cash transfers would go 
down as a result of economic growth and increased tax revenues to 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that there was a cut, but the member will 
also have to recognize that the delivery of health care in Canada 
is through the provinces.  We have provinces such as my own 
province of Ontario that decided to give 15% income tax cuts and 
at the same time cut health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the priorities of the province of Ontario?  I know the 
priorities of Mike Harris.  Mike Harris wants to buy an election. 
He cut health care.  He cut it badly.  It reflected on services 
and I am not denying that, but the provinces have a 
responsibility to deliver health care and Mike Harris did not do 
it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too 
listened with interest.  I think the hon. accountant has his 
numbers wrong.  It is quite clear if we look at the actual 
numbers that the amount being restored is considerably less than 
the level before the Liberals took over in 1993.  There was a 
substantial cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the hon. member and his colleagues to continually rip into 
Harris in Ontario and Klein in Alberta for cutting health care is 
like whipping a guy because he is running in a race and his leg 
has just been cut off.  They think that whipping him will make 
him run faster.  It just does not work that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally the federal government financed health care to the 
tune of 50% of expenses.  It has been cutting back, cutting back 
and cutting back.  That happened under the Conservatives and it 
has been greatly increased under the Liberals.  The fact of the 
matter is that while the government is still continuing to tax us 
more and more and more, it is giving back less and less and less 
to the provinces.  The poor provinces with limited funds just do 
not have the money to put into health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take a province like Alberta, for example—and it is the 
same in Ontario—the actual component of what the province has 
put into health care has increased in the same length of time as 
the government was cutting its funding for health care. Then the 
federal government turns around and blames the provinces.  It is 
unjust.  Let the hon. member try to defend that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is incorrect.  He 
said the provinces did not have the money to put into health 
care.  Mike Harris cut income taxes at a cost to the provincial 
treasury of $5 billion.  The cuts to Ontario for health care were 
under $1 billion.  It is a matter of priorities.  In Alberta the 
Klein government is running surpluses and it cuts health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that a province can choose to give tax breaks, run 
surpluses, cut health care and blame the federal government?  The 
Reform Party is suggesting in the alternative budget to cut $9 
billion from spending on health care.  The only way Reformers 
will pay for the spending on health care is that they make a wild 
assumption that the economy will grow by 5% a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members are in opposition they can say a lot of platitudes 
and make lots of promises without having to articulate exactly 
how they will pay for them or how they will be delivered.  That 
is the difference.  Canadians understand and I think they 
reflected their understanding in the results of the election in 
Windsor—St. Clair when the Reform Party did not even get its 
deposit back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will not stand for this nonsense of playing with 
numbers.  Let us always give them the facts and let Canadians 
have an opportunity to understand those facts and decide. 
As far as I am concerned members of the Reform Party continue to 
give half the story and only the story that suits their own 
purpose.

the hon. member is a member who does not mislead intentionally. I 
would like him to respond to this simple question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Harris government has put $1.5 billion more into health care 
than there was being spent in 1995.  Would the member tell me 
how he can make that a reduction in health care in Ontario?  It 
is not so; $1.5 billion more since 1995.  Argue with that, if he 
will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the fact is that we cannot 
have it both ways.  Mike Harris is saying, “We've spent $1.5 
billion more on health care than we did back in 1995”. That is 
what he is saying to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, $750 million of that was severance costs for nurses. I 
think he had to spend the same amount again to get them back. 
That is not delivering health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason that I say we cannot have it both ways is that if the 
member is standing in the House saying that waiting lists are up, 
health care is down, health care is awful because we have had 
these awful cuts from the federal government and yet the province 
of Ontario delivered $1.5 billion more in spending, how do we 
rationalize that we spent more but got less service?  It has to 
do with the provincial administration of health care.

your permission I will be sharing my time with my colleague, the 
member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to take the floor to cast light on what I consider 
to be some of the most troubling aspects of the federal budget 
of last February 16.  Although my time is too short, I will 
begin by addressing the underlying trends of this budget, which 
are evidence of a growing desire by the federal government to 
invade areas of jurisdiction defined by the constitution as 
provincial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I shall attack the myths being spread by the federal 
government about Quebec's receiving its fair share of Ottawa's 
spending, every year in every budget.  To do so, I merely need 
to refer to the insufficiency of job-creating spending by Ottawa 
in Quebec on the one hand, and on the other the orgy of spending 
on federalist propaganda in Quebec, spending that is anything 
but job-creating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Martin budget confirms the Ottawa government's strong 
tendency to use its spending power to gradually centralize all 
power within its hands.  The federal budget for 1999-2000 fits 
within a continuing trend which is most revealing of the 
long-term political objective of the Liberal Party of Canada. 
Some editorials have rightly described this as a political 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again this year, the federal government's spending 
power is being used as a Trojan horse in order to sneak into 
areas of provincial jurisdiction.  After education, this year it 
is health care, and this time there is no attempt at disguise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Constitution ensures that health is an exclusively 
provincial responsibility. Yet this budget is taking away funds 
the provinces need to administer their health systems so that it 
can create bureaucratic monsters that will usurp provincial 
powers and duplicate programs.  The obvious purpose of this is 
federal exhibitionism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was amused to hear my colleague from St. Paul's say ,in 
response to a question from my Bloc Quebecois colleague on 
social union, that health services were certainly a provincial 
matter, but the establishment of standards was a federal matter. 
I find that revealing.  My hon. colleague considers therefore 
that the establishment of standards is a federal responsibility, 
while carrying them out is a provincial one.  This is an 
original view of an area of jurisdiction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In invading the health care field, the government did not trot 
out a single Trojan horse, it released an entire stable of them. 
These Trojan horses are the national health surveillance 
network, the Canada health network and the Canadian institute 
for health information.  This last one is the most insidious, 
since it amounts to putting Quebec and the other provinces under 
guardianship in the area of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian institute for health information will monitor, 
diagnose and provide treatment to these health care networks, 
unilaterally and against their wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, programs such as the research and evaluation fund 
for nursing staff, prenatal nutrition, rural community health 
and the telehealth pilot project represent very costly and 
totally useless Canadian flags planted beside Quebec government 
programs in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the political level, it is remarkable that this slow job of 
sapping provincial responsibilities has produced no major 
reaction from the provincial governments, except that of Quebec. 
Despite the commitments the provinces made in Saskatoon, they 
signed the social union agreement without balking, selling the 
birthright of their jurisdiction for a plate of federal largesse 
lentils. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come to the second part of my remarks.  Ottawa has for years 
claimed that Quebec receives more than its share of federal 
budget spending.  We must take the wind out of this statement 
once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us talk about equalization. What is the equalization 
program? It is a federal initiative designed to compensate the 
relative poverty of certain provinces. Sure, we get money under 
that program, but why are we poorer in the first place? It is 
easy to find at least one reason. It is well known that, given 
its demographic weight, Quebec receives much less than it should 
when it comes to productive investments and the procurement of 
goods and services by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, while Quebec accounts for 24% of the Canadian 
population, it always gets less than 15% of the federal money 
for research and development. By comparison, beloved Ontario, 
which accounts for 37% of Canada's population, gets close to 60% 
of that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This lack of productive spending is a fundamental cause of 
Quebec's relative poverty. 
Now, Ottawa is trying to justify its reduced social transfers to 
Quebec with this compensation under the equalization program. 
However, by its very nature, that compensation is absolutely not 
guaranteed in coming years. This strange calculation clearly 
sets a precedent which might later be used to justify the 
reduction of overall federal spending in Quebec. This will 
happen as soon as our province's economic situation changes, at 
which time Quebec will become a contributor instead of a 
receiver under the equalization program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like me, members probably wonder how Ottawa hopes to impress 
Quebecers with this budget. While we do not have the federal 
government's recipe to promote its visibility, we know those who 
are trying to use it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know of some of the ingredients used in that recipe. 
There is the Canada Information Office, a propaganda tool with 
some $21 million to spend this fiscal, the Treasury Board, and 
the Department of Canadian Heritage, which have explicit 
instructions to bury Quebec deep in directives and programs all

Canada Day budget in Quebec every year?  Flags, flags, and more 
flags.  They are the only thing the federal government gives us 
way more than our share of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would say that the reaction, or non-reaction, to 
this new federal budget in other provinces once again proves 
that there are two incompatible visions of government in Canada: 
Quebec's, calling for decentralization, and the rest of 
Canada's.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to have my turn to address Bill C-71, which relates 
to certain provisions in the budget tabled in the House on 
February 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A budget can be labelled either good or bad, and this is, I 
believe, a bad one, because it contains some bad provisions.  It 
can also be looked at according to what it should contain but 
does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member representing Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, I can be 
excused for speaking of a matter of great importance to my 
riding, the Lévis shipyard, and for pointing out that this 
budget contains no additional measures relating to shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a number of questions from us, mobilization of the unions 
and demands from the shipbuilding association, the Minister of 
Industry still maintains that there is, in his opinion, no need 
for additional measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what is it that the industry is calling for?  Not subsidies 
but tax measures, a loan guarantee program, consideration of 
leasing as a tax compensation, as other major industries are 
treated, including railways and especially aerospace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget, there is also a very glaring lack of new 
measures to create employment and to help small and medium 
businesses, although these are the main creators of jobs in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to not creating employment, this budget adds nothing 
to compensate for the cuts experienced by the regions, 
particularly those affected by seasonal unemployment. 
Obviously, each riding has faced cuts in this regard.  In my 
riding, the cuts to benefits amounted to $20 million or $21 
million a year.  That had an impact on the economy.  In certain 
ridings, however, in the more remote regions, which have 
seasonal unemployment, it was even worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would expect that the government would set aside additional 
funds for these regions.  Instead of doing that, it cut more 
than $100 million in the budgets for regional development, in 
the west, the maritimes and Quebec.  It cut $27 million in 
Quebec in regional development.  Real sensitivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, I spoke in the House on the motion by the member for 
North Vancouver on western alienation over the money that comes 
from Ottawa, or the way this money is managed for the west. 
I not only mentioned the amounts allocated to regional 
development in Quebec—because I am most familiar with this—but I 
also noted certain anomalies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the figures I had for the first six months of 1998 
indicated to me that the riding of Westmount—Ville-Marie in 
Quebec received the most money for regional development, an 
amount that is usually given for regions far from the major 
centres.  The riding of Westmount—Ville-Marie is represented by 
the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that in this period, the ridings represented by the 
Liberal members had, oddly enough, budgets 50% higher than those 
of other ridings in Quebec, regardless of whether they were 
represented by Conservatives or members of the Bloc Quebecois. 
That was fairly distressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there were cuts to employment insurance that 
permitted the creation of an employment insurance fund.  If it 
were an independent fund, it would soon be worth $20 billion. 
That is a lot of money.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What takes the cake is to see the Minister of Finance use this 
surplus to solve his deficit problems, pay back part of the debt 
and use new money to intrude in provincial programs and 
jurisdictions, especially since the social union agreement 
reached with nine provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In exchange for money, nine premiers out of ten gave up their 
claims and told the federal government “these are not your 
jurisdictions, but give us money”. Quebec did not sign that 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts that this government decided to make to the transfers 
to the provinces between 1994 and 2003 are of the order of $33 
billion. This is not peanuts. But now the federal government has 
decided to put money back in the health sector, to the tune of 
$1 billion in Ontario and $150 million in Quebec. Ottawa also 
gave a cheque of $1.4 billion under the equalization program, 
but let us not forget that this same Liberal government cut $6 
billion in the transfer programs for health, education and 
social assistance. To give back $1.4 billion after making cuts 
of $6 billion is not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Terrebonne—Blainville spoke about something I 
wanted to mention regarding equalization and tax points. Since I 
do not have much time, I will not repeat the examples he gave, 
but I will say that this is not necessarily linked to the 
transfer payments, as a number of economists have shown. 
These are pre-established formulas and the Liberals have nothing 
to do with them. They were established through agreements a long 
time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is exasperating for Quebec to see that it is not getting 
funds through productive expenditures in the area of research 
and development, and the procurement of goods and services. I 
could start a war of numbers regarding taxation and equalization 
payments, as the federal and Quebec governments did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec commentators and those who know history will recall that, 
at first after Confederation, the federal government did not tax 
individuals directly, the provinces did. The federal government 
went about it indirectly through excise taxes and customs 
duties. This is how it raised money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As provided in the Constitution in cases of emergency and for 
the sake of public order, during both world wars, the federal 
government asked the provinces if it could tax Canadians 
directly through personal income taxes. This was to finance the 
war, but once it had a taste of it, it got used to it and never 
went back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It had reached an agreement with every province, except Ontario 
and Quebec, in order to continue taxing Canadians directly. 
Eight existing provinces had agreed. Ontario, which was 
reluctant, finally came on board after it was offered a very 
advantageous auto pact. Quebec found itself isolated, and since 
that time we have been the only province where individual 
taxpayers must file two returns, contradictory returns with 
provisions that sometimes cancel each other out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During a referendum on sovereignty, we will have to make it very 
clear to people how urgent it is to repatriate all our taxes to 
Quebec so that we can spend according to our own priorities. 
Quebec has a distinct culture, and we do business in a distinct 
manner. The Civil Code is distinct. In every field we see, feel 
and act differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude with the hope of being asked a few questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Canada Health Act is the instrument which the federal 
government has to enforce health standards in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are five principles enshrined in the Canada Health Act. 
One is universality, which means that the health care system is 
for all Canadians. The second is comprehensiveness, which means 
that it will cover medically necessary health costs for all 
Canadians. The third is accessibility.  it is accessible to all 
Canadians. The fourth is portability so that no matter where you 
are in Canada, no matter where you live and where you may travel 
it is going to be available.  Finally, it is publicly funded, 
which means it is on a not for profit basis.  That is why we do 
not have a two tiered system.  We do not have a system for the 
rich and a system for those who do not have the funds.  We have 
one system for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How the federal government manages to enforce those standards is 
by the cash transfer system.  Before the CHST, under the old 
system we had established program funding.  One of the programs 
was health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec's case, the combination of cash and tax points 
amounted to what it was entitled to based on the funding 
formulas.  The cash portion in Quebec was going down and was 
expected to hit zero.  I believe the cash amount going to Quebec 
would have been zero by the year 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the case, I simply ask the member, how can he argue 
that there were transfer cuts which were inappropriate relative 
to the Quebec situation? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for the 
member who just spoke.  I worked with him on the Standing 
Committee on Health.  He is a very caring person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I urge him to reread the Constitution. 
Under health, the wording is very clear: except for certain 
things, such as drugs, or the introduction of potentially 
diseased animals or plants into the country, health is 
recognized as a federal jurisdiction under the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But for the rest, specifically health care administration, the 
Constitution is very clear that this comes under provincial 
jurisdiction. 
We are forever hearing that, because certain provinces were 
perhaps not operating exactly as the present federal government 
would have liked, it is important that all Canadians be treated 
the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This specious principle can be used to flout the Constitution. 
That is what is creating problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After slashing EI and making all the other cuts mentioned 
earlier, suddenly the federal government finds itself with a bit 
more money.  With this money, which belongs to Canadian 
taxpayers, it wants to tell the provinces how to run their 
health care systems.  This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also unacceptable that the premiers of all provinces 
except Quebec agreed to the social union framework in order to 
get money. 
They renounced their powers and jurisdiction under the 
Constitution for money.  I dare not use the word that comes to 
mind, because it would be unparliamentary, but I cannot help 
thinking it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is my duty to 
inform the House that the time for questions and comments on the 
speeches is over.  We will now go to 10 minute speeches with no 
questions and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this debate is reminiscent of any budget debate. It 
always amazes me to listen to the government side.  The Liberals 
have this institutional memory but it is a very selective memory 
when they talk about what they have done in terms of the 
management of the economy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the Liberals refer back to the government I was a part 
of.  They blame the ills of the world on that previous 
government.  It is true that I was a member of that government. 
We did not do everything wrong and we certainly did not do 
everything right.  But I remind the House that in the timeframe 
of the Trudeau era, between 1968 and 1983 when the Liberals left 
office, the federal debt increased by 900%.  That is not a lot to 
be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals fail to mention another statistic.  It is a memory 
lapse.  It is a selective institutional memory I am speaking of 
when I speak of the Liberals.  They forget to remind the Canadian 
public that program spending increased by 800% in that same time 
period. It is important to put that on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does take credit for some of what it has done and 
maybe we could give it a little credit.  It is talking about a 
balanced budget which at first glance is pretty good.  No one 
will argue with that.  It is something we would all like to see, 
and apparently we have one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This really confuses me.  When the Liberals talk about this 
balanced budget, they never talk about the $22 billion brought in 
by the GST.  I know why. Because everybody sitting on that side 
of the House, with the exception of a few, were brought in on 
that promise to scrap the GST.  What happened to that promise? I 
guess it got lost in the red book.  I suppose the red books have 
been recycled and are now compost.  Maybe they are growing 
tomatoes or something else with the remains of those old red 
books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals conveniently forget that $22 billion.  Where would 
their balanced budget be today without that $22 billion?  They 
would be far short of the mark.  I can even see some government 
members nodding in agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing that is really interesting.  Where is the 
$26 billion in the employment insurance fund?  Does that show up 
somewhere in the books?  My guess is that it does.  The 
government is effectively taking it out of the hides of employees 
and employers. It is a hidden tax the Liberals are using to 
balance their books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time I speak on budget measures in relation to the 
government, I am reminded of the old Mark Twain expression 
“lies, damned lies and statistics”.  I always question into 
which category the minister's figures fit.  It is probably the 
latter category. There is also the old expression that liars 
figure and figures lie.  The minister is a master at manipulation 
of the figures.  The truth is they have balanced the budget and 
they have done it on the backs of ordinary Canadians and on the 
backs of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals take great pleasure in calling it the health care 
budget.  The sad reality is that after putting back $11.5 
billion, which is a lot of money if that is what they are putting 
back, over the course of the next four or five years, in the year 
2005 we will be back to the same spending levels in health care 
that we were at in 1995.  Can that by any measure be called a 
success or an accomplishment?  I would not call it that.  There 
is nothing to brag about in this budget when it comes to health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a clipping regarding the health care budget.  It comes 
from the province that runs the <I>Daily Gleaner</I>.  It was in 
the April 12 edition of the Fredericton <I> Daily Gleaner</I>.  It 
refers to the 122 recommendations contained in a report for the 
long term recovery of the New Brunswick health care system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT40"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT40"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1715

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were 122 recommendations.  Why so many?  Because health 
care was destroyed in every single province.  Because premiers 
like Premier Thériault in New Brunswick stood in silent agreement 
as funding was ratcheted away from health care.  Now they are 
scrambling to pick up the pieces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premier is quoted as saying they cannot afford to do it. 
They cannot afford to do it because it is going to cost the 
little province of New Brunswick in the vicinity of $400 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of that $11.5 billion that was announced as going back 
into health care, is going to pay off previous debt incurred over 
the last number of years since this government took office.  It 
is nothing more than smoke and mirrors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a crisis in the country and it is called health care. It 
is quite interesting that the Liberals call it the health care 
budget, but why not?  Last year they called the budget the 
education budget.  That was the same year that 12,000 students 
declared personal bankruptcy because of their inability to pay 
off student debt and get a job.  If this is the same type of 
budget in terms of health care when compared to the so-called 
education budget, then it is going to have a very short shelf 
life indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not stop there.  Another difficulty we have in the 
Canadian economy, which all goes back to the budget and the 
management or mismanagement of the present government, is in 
terms of productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the lowest rate of productivity in the G-8.  That is not 
just me speaking.  The government has been told this by a number 
of people, including Sherry Cooper who is the chief economist 
with Nesbitt Burns.  If we do not believe her, how about Michael 
Marzolini who is the Liberal Party's own pollster?  He says that 
Canada has the lowest rate of productivity among the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the difference if it is the G-7 or the G-8? Productivity 
in this country is extremely low and it is costing us.  The only 
way we can compensate for that is with a low Canadian dollar, but 
that is not the way to do it.  What the country needs is sound 
fiscal management.  Unless we have that, our standard of living 
is going to continue to decline year in and year out, which it is 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question we would ask ourselves is:  What would happen in 
Canada if the Canadian dollar suddenly rose?  I know where we 
would be.  We would be in a heck of a lot of trouble, because the 
government has paid scant attention to productivity. We are 
relying on a low dollar to move our goods into the marketplace. 
At the end of the day, we are all going to be poorer because of 
it. There will be a day of reckoning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not want to talk about this.  When it does 
talk about it, it tries to remove itself from its own very words, 
as did the Minister of Industry not long ago when he actually 
gave a speech and spoke about our dismal productivity levels in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I can say with the little bit of time I have left is that I 
am pleased to take part in this debate.  I think what Canadians 
want is some real information from the government so we know 
exactly where we stand in terms of the Canadian economy, in terms 
of taxation and in terms of productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get real about some of those numbers.  I see them always 
hacking away at that so-called inherited $42 billion debt. Let us 
talk about the 900% increase in that federal debt in the period 
when the Liberals were in power from 1968 to 1983.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will comment about the broad economic 
philosophy of the government as represented in the bill, and the 
themes of its economic measures by using the example of some 
aspects of the personal income tax form.  For what we see helps 
us put into perspective what social attitudes underlie the bill 
before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the big myth is that the Liberals are good managers of 
the public trust.  They are not.  It is a myth that they have 
presented balance to the country in their budgets?  What myths. I 
challenge the media and the folks at home to check the numbers 
rather than the Liberals spinning machine.  The Liberals have 
shown not to be wise managers of the public trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, to help with general understanding today about the 
appropriateness of the underlying philosophy of the bill, I cite 
the historical social attitude of the Liberals toward traditional 
families in the tax category where parents decide that one of 
them will forgo a working income to stay home and provide quality 
child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That social choice is denigrated by the government through its 
tax policy.  It is expressed clearly, in the unashamedly unfair 
differences that it has given since at least 1993, and have 
deepened in each successive budget.  The government's record is 
that it is not family friendly.  Reformers have been talking 
about it since 1993, but the news media has finally woken up, so 
when we talk about it and make a point we are now getting it 
reported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister was wrong when he said that his tax 
discrimination against one income, two parent families was a 
recent issue for Reform.  The Reform blue book as far back as 
1993 said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports a revision of the federal income tax 
regulations to end discrimination against parents who provide 
child-care at home—and—supports equitable treatment for 
one-income families with dependant children. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our election platform of fresh start for the June 1997 election 
clearly included the desired changes on taxation for families. 
The <I>Hansard</I> shows that I spoke about it clearly in the 
debate for last year's 1998-99 budget, because by then the hurt 
against families was really getting deep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been asking why the finance minister would not even 
admit in the House that his policy documents and budgets have 
delivered tax discriminations since his first budget in 1994. Why 
will he not change?  Perhaps because he is a Liberal and the 
cabinet has a mindset of socialist engineering from another era 
that it cannot let go of.  Belatedly, he has now sent the hot 
potato to committee.  It will buy him some political time for 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The insincere answers that we have received in question period 
from the finance minister on this subject is avoidance when he 
claims we Reformers voted against budget measures related to 
children.  His falsity boggles.  Reform has voted generally 
against the tax and spend habits of the Liberals, not specific 
child programs.  We have voted against the lack of accountability 
in government spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budgets continue to spend too much, therefore tax too much, 
and thereby the country still owes too much.  It is about 
competence to govern.  It is about fairness.  It is about helping 
instead of hurting and equality before the tax law.  It is about 
a Liberal mean-spirited view of the family as expressed in tax 
law, and about penalizing parents, like giving them a fine for 
having a traditional family child care arrangement.  What hurts 
the most is that it does it openly and justifies it while it 
calls us on this side of the House, who have defended the family 
since coming here, as being just too negative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence is that the Liberal economic policies hurt people. 
The whole country knows it, and I am again reminding the House of 
this again today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask:  When will the finance minister provide the tax changes 
we are talking about today?  When will he begin to help rather 
than hurt families with his tax discrimination? Roughly 82% of 
Canadians want the tax code changed to make it easier for parents 
with young children to have a parent stay at home.  According to 
a November 1998 Southam-Compas poll, this is a very high priority 
for 42% of Canadians, a high priority for 23% and a priority for 
17%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The C.D. Howe Institute's latest report, entitled “Giving Mom 
and Dad a Break”, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Current Canadian tax policy affords no universal recognition of 
children.  In effect, it treats children in middle and 
high-income families like consumer spending, as if parents had no 
legal or moral obligation to spend money on their care.  This 
treatment is indefensible. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The balanced budget was achieved by squeezing the people:  76.7% 
of the balancing came from higher tax revenues; 14% from slashing 
health and social transfers; 7.2% from cutting transfers to 
persons; and a minuscule 2.1% by cutting federal spending itself. 
Where was the government required to live within its means 
instead of imposing on the weak individual taxpayer?  Children 
are directly hurt by Liberal policy design.

increased health transfers to the provinces by $2 billion a year; 
and an immediate $1 billion reinvestment in Canada's armed 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 2, 1999 the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> reported that “Sherry 
Cooper, chief economist for Nesbitt Burns, said Reform's 
proposals are realistic. This is feasible” she said.  Cooper 
said “If spending is kept in line, the government should have 
enough money to fund both tax cuts and debt reduction because the 
surpluses are going to be huge”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents know that the best child care program is a dad and a mom 
but sadly, commercial day care is the only child care option 
recompensed by the Canadian tax code.  In her 1998 submission to 
Parliament's finance committee Heather Gore-Hickman, chartered 
accountant, found that only 16% of families with kids claim the 
child care expense deduction for commercial day care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Roughly speaking, in 19% of families, both parents work full 
time but they either use informal child care, work out of home, 
or work flex time.  So one parent is always at home. Twenty-two 
per cent of families have a second part time income while 
providing parent care.  Over 33% of families have a parent 
providing full time unpaid child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Fraser Institute in its pamphlet “Tax Facts 
Ten”, twoearner families earning $30,000 paid $3,492 in income 
tax, while a one earner family paid $4,317, or 24% more in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A report showed that a family earning $60,000 paid $6,383 in 
federal income tax; if a two earner, $10,300; if a one earner, a 
whopping 61% more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax code of this government sends the message that private 
parenting has no public value and if chosen, families will be 
penalized.  The suggested changes to bring fairness can be made. 
These policy problems are only the tip of the iceberg of an 
outdated Liberal ideology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already cited how the administration is incompetent and 
how it hurts people and then runs from responsibility, how it 
fails to fulfil the public trust; but the capper of it all is 
that when serious policy problems are outlined by the opposition 
parties and then constructive alternatives are presented from 
this side to help Canadians, the smugness of the cabinet 
continues the old style Liberal way and they assert that they 
have all the answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that the Liberals are part of a harsh culture that 
hurts family life, puts unreasonable pressure on families and 
poorly serves kids.  Heaven help us when the next generation of 
children returns the favour to our culture.  Just 38% of people 
voted for Liberals, and they still behave as if they had the 
divine right to govern with impunity and with little 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today is the implementation of spending 
intentions.  This legislation is a big fuzzy housekeeping bill 
that contains a lot of feel good stuff.  The Liberals have failed 
to simplify the tax code.  They are announcing money they have 
already deleted from the taxpayers' surplus in previous budgets. 
They have failed to give Canadians what they really need, which 
is massive across the board tax cuts and smaller government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust there will be some better economic policy thought on the 
Liberal side as a result of these debates.  If there is not, we 
in the official opposition are ready and waiting to govern for 
the 21st century.

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK210">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 4 consideration of the motion and 
the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there 
is a growing body of evidence, most of it still anecdotal, that 
strongly suggests that marijuana has unique therapeutic 
properties in the treatment of several life and sense threatening 
diseases.  For example, some people with multiple sclerosis 
believe that smoking marijuana helps them to control their 
spasticity.  In certain instances the use of marijuana has helped 
to reduce nausea and stimulate the appetite of those living with 
HIV and AIDS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the board of directors of the Canadian AIDS Society 
passed a position statement on the medicinal use of smokable 
marijuana stating that people living with HIV-AIDS and their 
physicians should have access to marijuana for medicinal purposes 
in the treatment of these conditions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1730"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are indications that smoking marijuana can likewise reduce 
nausea and vomiting brought on by chemotherapy, principally among 
cancer patients.  This is not simply a matter of comfort, as some 
cancer patients have had to cease treatment because the constant 
vomiting can make it impossible to continue taking the 
therapeutic drugs they need.  Many chemotherapy patients complain 
that other anti-nausea drugs are ineffective and in some cases 
produce unwelcome side effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marijuana is reputed to be helpful in the treatment of glaucoma 
through the reduction of intraocular pressure caused by fluid 
accumulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other medical conditions or situations for which marijuana is 
reputed to have some effectiveness include an anti-convulsant 
action which may have an application in the treatment of 
epilepsy, and an analgesic action for pain relief.  Marijuana 
cannot be said to cure any of these conditions but the potential 
exists with rational, medically supervised use to help alleviate 
pain and suffering.  One recent report would term this belief 
based medicine.  In Canada we strive for evidence based medicine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The therapeutic products program, the regulator in Health 
Canada, has in place an expert advisory committee that since last 
year has been examining a number of issues relating to the 
medical uses of marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted that Canada will be among those jurisdictions to 
gather evidence in a safe and controlled manner so that our body 
of evidence can be evaluated along with that being done 
elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the U.K., GW Pharmaceuticals has been granted licences by the 
British Government to cultivate cannabis plants and to store and 
dispense the cannabis preparations for research.  Initially it 
will develop standardized extracts of cannabis plants grown under 
controlled conditions.  Research will also be concentrated on the 
best way to give the drug to patients and on which conditions it 
can safely treat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They intend to proceed to clinical trials with a smokeless whole 
plant extract while also supplying marijuana to other 
investigators interested in medical research and pharmaceutical 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year the International Narcotics Control Board, 
which is responsible for the implementation of United Nations 
drug conventions, released its annual report for 1998.  In the 
report the board called for unbiased research into the possible 
medical benefits of marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the medical usefulness of marijuana is established, which I 
believe it will be, it would remain a drug no different from any 
other narcotic drugs.  It would still be subject to licensing and 
other control measures according to international treaties, just 
like morphine and opiates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last month the American Institute of Medicine issued its report 
entitled “Marijuana and Medicine:  Assessing the Science 
Base”.  It declared that the medical use of marijuana may be one 
of the most effective treatments available for people with 
serious diseases such as AIDS and cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This study, the product of more than 18 months of research, 
highlights continued concerns about marijuana but says it clearly 
controls some forms of pain, was not particularly addictive, and 
did not appear to be a gateway to harder drugs.  The report also 
states that new research on the medical uses of marijuana should 
try to develop a non-smoked rapid onset delivery system to 
simulate the action of smoking marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To assist desperately ill patients who may not want to wait for 
a safe alternative to be developed, the report suggests doctors 
be allowed to launch clinical trials of marijuana, telling each 
test subject the benefits and risks of smoking it, including the 
negative impact of the smoke itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present moment a licit supply of medical research quality 
marijuana for clinical trials in Canada is potentially available 
and obtainable from the American National Institute on Drug 
Abuse.  GW Pharmaceuticals may also be interested in performing 
some clinical trials with its developed alternate delivery 
systems outside its jurisdiction of Britain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada no scientific evidence that smoked marijuana has 
medicinal benefit has been submitted to the therapeutic products 
program.  I believe very soon there will be a need for 
researchers to come forward and present proposals to study the 
benefits of the medicinal use of marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Controlled Drug and Substances Act there is sufficient 
latitude to distribute marijuana without having to now change the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the CDSA the Minister of Health can enact regulations to 
authorize the possession, import, export and production of 
cannabis for medical purposes.  Section 56 of the act states the 
following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister may, on such terms and conditions as the Minister 
deems necessary, exempt any person or class of persons or any 
controlled substance or precursor or any class thereof from the 
application of all or any of the provisions of this act or the 
regulations if, in the opinion of the Minister, the exemption is 
necessary for a medical or scientific purpose or is otherwise in 
the public interest. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the regulations of the CDSA, the minister also has the 
authority to authorize research on controlled substances. 
Together with others, specifically those in our social policy 
caucus at the time, I worked on the rework of the relevant bill 
in the 35th parliament.  <I>Hansard</I> debates recorded this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the summer of 1997 I commissioned the Library of Parliament 
to prepare a report regarding the use of the new CDSA act and 
medicinal marijuana.  This report was delivered to me in 
September 1997, at which time I provided it to our Minister of 
Justice and our Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have pushed this matter very hard inside my government and 
since that time with these departments.  I, with others, 
understand that even now there will not be overnight change; but 
let us not underestimate the progress made.  The answer to my 
question to the Minister of Health on March 3 was a significant 
embarkment on a new policy direction for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are drugs that contain THC, the active ingredient in 
cannabis, which have received therapeutic drug approval by Health 
Canada.  These drugs went through the drug submission process, 
received a notice of compliance and then were granted drug 
identification numbers.  The drugs can be sold legally in Canada 
pursuant to a prescription by a practitioner.  Since the active 
ingredient in cannabis is already available for medicinal 
purposes in Canada, expanding its use may seem to be an 
appropriate development once we have the supportive research in 
hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time in Canada there are two approved drugs that 
contain the active ingredients derived from the marijuana plants 
in pill form: Marinol and Cesamet.  For many patients these 
synthetic versions of marijuana's active ingredients are 
expensive, unpalatable, and if they are trying to control nausea 
to be able to take oral medications they are ineffective 
oftentimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Smoking marijuana meanwhile appears to provide immediate relief 
of nausea and a stimulation of the appetite, allowing people to 
hold down both their pills and some food.  There may be better 
mediums, for example inhalers, that reduce the negative side 
effects associated with smoking marijuana.  These are still under 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently some people who suffer from these diseases discussed 
above, for whom the legal medical options have proven ineffective 
or painful, have made choices.  Some have obtained marijuana 
illegally in Canada and therefore risk suffering consequences 
such as arrest, fines, court costs, property forfeiture, 
incarceration, probation and criminal records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once evidence has been gathered the federal government will need 
to establish quickly an approach that would provide medical 
quality, licit marijuana so that people suffering from disease do 
not have to take further risks with their health by buying 
potentially impure, contaminated or chemically adulterated 
marijuana as is the case currently in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of legalizing marijuana for medical purposes has 
been debated on and off in Canada for a number of years.  I 
stress today that it is not the so-called legalization of a 
controlled substance that is the real issue.  It is the legal 
access through the CDSA, which could be dealt with easily. In a 
recent court case in my riding, Regina v Clay and Prentice, 
Ontario Court Justice John McCart stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament may wish to take a serious look at easing the 
restrictions that apply to the use of marijuana for the medical 
uses as outlined above as well as for alleviating some of the 
symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis, such as pain and 
muscle spasm.  There appears to be no merit to the wide-spread 
claim that marijuana has no therapeutic value whatsoever. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a welcome step what we are doing.  We need solid research 
efforts to commence soon.  We also need to help set up a system 
so that those on trials are not open to criminal harassment.  It 
is a matter of compassion.  It is not fair to these people who 
have to fight both their disease and the law at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud members on all sides of the House who have worked on 
this matter over the years.  I think it is very important to 
recognize them.  I also think it is important to recognize the 
Minister of Health who has taken this step forward at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to also thank my constituents and those across Canada who 
have brought the poignancy and the tragedy of this issue to my 
attention.  I am proud to be part of our government as we move 
forward on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take part in today's debate on the use of marijuana for health 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a health debate, a justice debate, based on the values 
of fairness, mutual aid and compassion that we all share as a 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the motion, as amended by the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Health, no longer mentions the 
legalization of marijuana, which is a matter of concern. It now 
talks about the “possible legal medical use of marijuana”. In 
our view, this is a step backwards since the government has 
asserted many times that it was open to the idea and eager to 
look into it further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, more than a year ago, my colleague from Rosemont asked 
the Minister of Health to set up a parliamentary committee to 
consider the issue. The minister replied that the question was 
under consideration, that some people were already studying the 
matter. He said, and I quote: “The issue is under consideration 
by my department and by the Department of Justice. Along with my 
colleague, we are reviewing all the aspects of the issue. We 
hope to present our policy in the coming months”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirteen months after this statement, we are still waiting for 
some answers and for some concrete measures by the minister or 
his colleague, the Minister of Justice, who, a year ago, had 
already started to review all the aspects of this important 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view, at the present time the government is holding 
hostage thousands of people who are suffering and waiting for a 
sign of hope while risking six months in jail and a $1,000 fine 
in order to buy marijuana on the black market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, this debate is about medical issues. But it is also a 
matter of compassion. More often than not people with HIV/AIDS 
or other diseases suffer from extreme nausea and are unable to 
eat. This is a problem, since some of the drugs prescribed to 
them must be taken with food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the patient is successful in taking his medication in spite 
of the nausea and lack of appetite, he might be affected by side 
effects: more nausea or even total intolerance to the drug 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some, the solution to these problems has been to smoke or 
inhale marijuana. It eases nausea and stimulates the appetite. 
Currently these men and women must break the law to get relief. 
This is intolerable in a country boasting one of the best health 
care systems in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody doubts the therapeutic effectiveness of THC, the main 
active ingredient in marijuana. As a matter of fact, for a 
number of years already physicians have been prescribing Marinol 
pills containing synthetic THC. This drug is available in 
drugstores. However even Marinol is not as effective as inhaled 
marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many physicians are asking to be allowed to prescribe THC, 
arguing they are in the best position to determine in which form 
marijuana will be the best able to help their patients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The positive effects of THC have been know for a long time, but, 
strangely enough, it is only recently that medical authorities 
have started to examine seriously through clinical research 
these effects and potential medical applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last March, the American medical institute published a report 
that found, once again, that marijuana has an excellent medical 
potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November of 1998, the British science and technology 
committee of the House of Lords took a strong stand in favour of 
the legalization of marijuana for therapeutic uses. The chairman 
of the committee stated “We have enough evidence to be convinced 
that physicians should be allowed to prescribe marijuana to ease 
the suffering of the sick or the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, 
criminal code notwithstanding”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent research has confirmed earlier reports, including those 
of the World Health Organization, which are more and more 
dispelling myths about the therapeutic value of marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the beginning of his campaign, my colleague from Rosemont 
has gathered a great deal of support, and more support keeps 
coming in. The Canadian AIDS Society, the Quebec chapter of the 
Canadian Hemophilia Society and the Coalition des organismes 
communautaires québécois de lutte contre le sida support motion 
M-381 without any reservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not too long ago, the National Pensioners and Senior Citizens 
Federation urged the health minister to act quickly on this 
issue. 
The Canadian Medical Association has been defending the 
decriminalization of simple possession of marijuana since 1981 
and deplores the lack of any systematic scientific research on 
the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Support for decriminalization of marijuana for therapeutic 
purposes does not come just from the medical associations or 
social groups; according to a survey carried out last month, 
close to 80% of the population are in favour of this major 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada has had a program since 1966 whereby certain 
patients may receive unauthorised drugs so that they do not have 
to suffer needlessly while awaiting authorisation of a product 
that could help them.  Jean-Charles Parizeau and James Wakeford, 
among others, have applied to obtain marijuana The government 
has not, however, given any concrete response as yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a problematic situation, because a recent Ontario Court 
decision on the Wakeford case almost found the Narcotics Act 
unconstitutional, since it has the effect of depriving certain 
individuals of the only effective treatment to alleviate their 
condition.  It did not do so for just one reason: there is a way 
to obtain  marijuana and other drugs, such as morphine and other 
unauthorized drugs, under the current legislation, via the 
special access program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that, if the government persists in refusing to 
respond to requests, or refuses access to marijuana through the 
special access program, part of the Narcotics Act will become 
unconstitutional, not by law but by fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Parizeau and Mr. Wakeford, and others in their position, 
would have two choices available to them. 
First, to play the good citizen, to suffer and to die in the 
near future, or second to improve their condition and their 
quality of life by an illegal act.  This is the impossible 
choice this government offers to those in needs.  It is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the government must stop holding sick people 
hostage, stop waffling, stop letting the courts decide for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore like to propose an amendment to the amendment 
of Motion M-381.  If the government is sincere in its desire to 
settle this important question, it will acknowledge that the 
change is well-founded.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I will take a few moments to give the history of <I>Cannabis 
sativa</I> and to talk about the various reports and commissions on 
this issue, and I will then explain why I strongly support the 
motion and the amendment to legalize the use of marijuana for 
health and medical purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To better understand the issue, I did some research and I 
consulted the Le Dain report, among others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Cannabis sativa</I> is cultivated or grows wild in most countries in

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This plant, which probably came originally from Asia, has been 
cultivated for a very long time. The street language has given 
marijuana different names, including pot and grass in English. 
In India, medium quality marijuana is called bang and high 
quality marijuana is called ganga. It is called kif in Marocco, 
dagga in South Africa and ganga in Jamaica. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cannabis also produces an amber coloured resin which, in the 
almost pure state, is a drug called charas in India and hashish 
in western and middle eastern countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the word marijuana, its etymology is not clear. 
Some sources say that it is the contraction of two first names 
that are popular in Mexico, namely Maria and Juana. Other 
believe that this word comes from the Mexican word mariguano, 
which means intoxicant, or the Panamanian word managuango, which 
has the same meaning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cannabis has many uses. Its stem provides strong textile fibres 
that are used in the manufacturing of wires and cables. They can 
also be used to make blankets, clothes, flags and boat sails. 
The seeds contain a kind of oil similar to linseed oil that is 
used in the manufacturing of soap and paint. In Canada, people 
used to grow cannabis to fight erosion and strong winds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After this brief historical overview, I will know look at the 
medical use of that plant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our first description of cannabis comes from a medical treatise 
attributed to the Chinese emperor Chen-Nong, who lived around 
2700 B.C.  In addition, archeological discoveries at a site in 
Egypt between 3,000 and 4,000 years old have revealed its use. 
Herodotus, a Greek historian, mentions in his writings that 
inhaling the smoke from cannabis was a funeral purification rite 
of the Scythians, a people speaking Iranian and living between 
the Danube and the Don starting in the 12th century B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The oldest of the Veda, the sacred Hindu books, written in 
Sanskrit after 1800 B.C., indicates the properties of cannabis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, the Avesta, the holy book of the Zoroastrians, who 
originated in Northern Persia, which dates from 600 B.C., 
mentions that the cannabis resin produces drunkenness. 
One of the Hindu god Siva's titles is lord of the bongs and even 
today, the bong plays an important role in many Hindu religious 
practices, both symbolically and therapeutically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Europe, interest in the use of cannabis did not really 
develop socially and medicinally until 1798, or after the return 
of Napoleon's expeditionary forces from Egypt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 19th century, western medicine paid a lot of attention to 
cannabis because of the influence of two authors: Dr. 
O'Shaughnessy, an English doctor who returned from India in 
1843, and Moreau de Tours, a Frenchman who wrote considerably on 
the medicinal use and the abuse of cannabis in 1848. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Europe, cannabis only began to gather a following in 1844, 
when the Club des Hachichins, whose members included Balzac, 
Hugo, Baudelaire and Gautier, was founded in Paris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, the French apothecary, Louis Hébert, who arrived with 
Samuel de Champlain in 1606, was the first colonist to cultivate 
marijuana in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been many studies and commissions on the subject, the 
most exhaustive being the 3,281-page, seven-volume 
Indian Hemp Drugs Commission report, published in India in 1894. 
It was followed by the Guardian committee report, named after 
the mayor of New York, England's Baroness Wootton report, and 
our own Le Dain commission report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One argument used against legalizing marijuana for medical 
purposes is that marijuana now exists in the form of a drug, THC 
or tetrahydrocannabinol, marketed under the name Marinol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that THC, like most drugs, is absorbed by the 
gastrointestinal tract slowly and irregularly and its speed of 
absorption can be affected by the stomach's contents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, THC frequently has undesirable side effects, and 
patients stop taking it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for marijuana, which admittedly also has harmful side 
effects, its rapid absorption by the pulmonary route is a real 
benefit to certain patients.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all that medicine has done to understand the human being 
and try to stave off death as long as possible, it seems that 
compassion for human suffering sometimes falls short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still a wide range of treatments, medical cocktails, 
for the seriously ill, of course.  But what good are they if 
ingesting them makes people sicker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, its benefits for those with MS, glaucoma, epilepsy or 
cancer were mentioned.  There is also the wasting, or loss of 
muscle and fatty tissue seen in those with HIV and AIDS. 
In this particular situation, inhaling marijuana not only brings 
speedy and significant relief, but also helps patients' physical 
and psychological recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Demonstrating compassion towards the sick is also the role of 
politicians and that is why I support any legislative measure to 
provide controlled access to the therapeutic and medical use of 
marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before continuing, I want to point out that 
debate will now be on the amendment to the amendment moved by

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  It seems to me that the subamendment changes the intent 
of the motion and the amendment and I question whether it is in 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  In the opinion of the Chair, the 
subamendment does fall within the amendment that was proposed. 
It simply clarifies the amendment.  If the clarification is such 
that the House finds it objectionable, the House can reject it 
when voting on the subamendment.  However, I think the 
subamendment appears to be in order and I have accordingly put it 
to the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate the hon. member for Rosemont for this motion on the 
medical use of marijuana. This debate needs to be held. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, cannabis for palliation has a place.  There are 
instances of terminal cancer, AIDS, chemotherapy wasting, 
epilepsy and glaucoma where it looks like cannabis has a positive 
effect.  I especially believe that it has a place when there is 
no other product that works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating the medical use of marijuana only.  I think that 
good medical practice would say yes to the medical use of 
marijuana if there were no other choice.  As an example, heroin, 
which is considered to be an illicit drug in Canada, is available 
to medical practitioners for this very purpose and if heroin, 
which is a potent illicit drug, is available, the argument would 
say, why not the medical use of cannabis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some difficulties with the medical use of marijuana. 
This is not a straightforward issue.  Smoked marijuana is impure. 
In fact it is a chemical cocktail. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT49"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT49"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1800

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the medications we use for palliation are in fact a 
cocktail, but we have some choice over their constituents. The 
impurity of THC and the other constituents in marijuana is a 
problem.  THC or cannibinoids are but one component of smoked 
pot, which is the common expression for this medication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some new studies that state that cannabis has some 
positive medical effects.  The recent one which I would like to 
quote from today is from the Institute of Medicine in the U.S. 
This was reported recently in <I>The Washington Post</I>.  The 
Institute of Medicine is an independent advisory body and the 
study did take some time.  It was quite eagerly looked upon for 
some help in this debate, a debate that is complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic conclusions of this study were that marijuana smoke 
can have an important effect on certain disease states.  The 
study states “While we see a future in the development of 
cannibinoid drugs, we see little future in smoked marijuana as a 
medicine”. There we have the division.  The cannibinoids in 
marijuana have a fairly positive future.  This study suggested 
that smoked marijuana might well not be the way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the study went on, there were very specific issues raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pain relief is probably the biggest commercial marketplace for 
cannibinoids.  It went on to say that for nausea and vomiting 
caused by chemotherapy, cannibinoids are mildly effective but 
other preparations may be just as good.  For the other things, 
glaucoma, migraines, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease and 
whatnot, not nearly as impressive results were found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I can summarize this report, I would say that cannibinoids or 
THC in marijuana do have some positive benefits, especially in 
the treatment of pain.  That would suggest to me for pain relief 
in a palliative sense for serious illnesses such as cancer and 
possibly AIDS this may well be a useful product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other big difficulties with the medical use of 
marijuana is the likelihood that recreational use will become 
more difficult to control.  That is not the case with other 
products, like heroin, which are chemically produced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marijuana of course can be grown and is fairly easily grown. It 
can be grown in a house under certain circumstances.  It can 
certainly be grown in the summer in Canada.  That makes the 
control of recreational use more difficult.  There are some who 
say that recreational use should be allowed unfettered.  That is 
not something I agree with at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to suggest some potential solutions for the 
problems we have.  On the one hand, it looks like cannibinoids 
may well be useful for palliation.  On the other hand, there are 
some difficulties with control of the recreational use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The potential solutions would be, number one, to isolate these 
cannibinoids for specific use.  There is some new research being 
done along those lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also find alternate routes of administration.  As my 
hon. colleague across the way mentioned, the oral route is not 
the best route for this particular preparation.  Gastric 
absorption is not perfect and patients have told me that.  There 
are three other potential routes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a new waxy capsule that has been developed.  This is 
from the University of Mississippi in the United States.  Initial 
research there looks very positive.  It is absorbed quite 
rapidly.  It is not the ideal way to administer for many people, 
but for individuals in these tough circumstances I think that 
might be a fair alternate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An oral or nasal spray of the very specific THC might also be 
possible.  It has been suggested and in fact has been used in 
research.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A patch which is another mechanism of administration has also 
been looked at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would not be a controversy at all if it were not for the 
recreational use of marijuana.  This would have been done long 
ago under an enlightened medical system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a host of individuals who use the medical use of 
marijuana as a gateway toward a larger use.  As a practitioner, I 
had the opportunity to treat patients for drug problems.  I do 
not go down the road of softening marijuana use for recreational 
purposes for one second.  The reasons are legion but I do not 
have too much time so I will be narrow in this focus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 5% to 15% of the youth using cannabis become habituated.  I 
did not use the word addicted because that is not the appropriate 
word for marijuana.  Habituated is a more appropriate word. There 
are those who say not to bother with those small numbers because 
many, many kids who use this preparation go on to become 
perfectly healthy.  I grant that as absolutely true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask those individuals to attend in any city in the 
country a drug rehab facility.  Go to a NarAnon meeting and 
listen to the youth and sometimes the adults who talk about the 
problems they have had with marijuana misuse.  Ask about the 
school attendance from youth who have been habituated to 
marijuana.  Ask about the personality changes these youth 
undergo.  Ask about the problems they have undergone with the 
legal system, not just because of their marijuana use but because 
of fencing and the other things that go along with the drug 
subculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The medical use of the specific components of marijuana have 
some merit.  I am quite cautious about going down the road of 
recreational use and in fact am vigorously opposed in that 
regard. Purifying and looking at THC in its purest form is ideal. 
Smoked marijuana for those who have absolutely no other choice 
or those at the end of life could be approached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is one that is timely.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for Rosemont for bringing forward private 
member's Motion No. M-381, to allow the legal medical use of 
marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is a very good demonstration of what we can do as 
parliamentarians to examine an issue. In some ways this 
institution of the House of Commons is sort of far behind public 
opinion, even where the medical community is.  Certainly people 
who are suffering from pain and diseases like AIDS or cancer are 
very eager to see this motion pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for his diligence in bringing this 
issue to the House and seeking out support from other members.  I 
think that support is now quite strong.  Many of my NDP 
colleagues are very supportive of this motion.  Our health 
critic, the member for Winnipeg North Centre, spoke on March 4 
and outlined very well the medical evidence that already exists 
to demonstrate that this motion should be approved in full rather 
than with the amendment put forward by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is lots of evidence before us to show that the medical 
profession has made it quite clear there are very good grounds 
and information to show the medical use of marijuana is actually 
something beneficial.  It helps people who are suffering from 
HIV, AIDS, cancer, MS and other ailments.  We have received 
communications from groups such as the Canadian AIDS Society.  It 
has very strongly outlined and advocated its support for this 
motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question there have been numerous studies. Also, 
very brave individuals in our society have taken on the justice 
system, sometimes almost alone, to challenge the archaic laws 
when it comes to the medical use of marijuana. People like Jim 
Wakeford, Terry Parker and others with a lot of expense and 
anxiety have had to take on the system to get this issue before 
the courts and to challenge the sanity and the rationale of why 
this law still exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numerous polls show us that even the Canadian public believes 
very strongly that the medical use of marijuana is something that 
should be sanctioned and supported. It creates a very strange 
situation that we have public opinion, and we even have judges 
making court rulings, we have health professionals, and the 
medical profession all telling us that this is the right thing to 
do.  The lack of political will and commitment to follow through 
is now the greatest obstacle we face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I along with other members were very happy to see the Minister 
of Health make his announcement on March 3 that Health Canada 
will study and develop a plan around clinical trials for the 
medical use of marijuana.  I do think we have to question whether 
or not this is simply a stalling tactic that is going to cause 
people more harm and more suffering as they wait for more studies 
to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be very clear that the Minister of Health has the 
discretion and the power today.  He had it last year and the year 
before that but he has it today to approve applications on 
compassionate grounds for the medical use of marijuana. There are 
applications before him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Vancouver Compassion Club is an organization in my riding 
with a membership of about 700 individuals. Marijuana is actually 
dispensed for medical purposes.  They have a lawyer who is 
signing people up to apply for an application for exemption. They 
are even prepared to go to a legal challenge based on their 
constitutional rights to have this medical exemption take place 
while the trials are taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage members of the House, particularly government 
members, to continue to put pressure on the health minister.  It 
is a useful and good thing to have these clinical trials go ahead 
as there are things that we need to learn.  However, we have 
enough information now to ask the minister to go ahead with the 
exemption so that people can get relief, help and support now 
without having to become criminals if they seek help through 
places like the Vancouver Compassion Club or other organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we afraid of taking immediate action on this?  Why is 
the government afraid of doing that?  It is partly wound up in 
the morals we have.  We heard from the health critic of the 
Reform Party.  It is all wound up with people's concerns about 
recreational use.  This is part of a debate which I think is very 
necessary on Canada's drug laws. We need to have progressive 
reform in our drug laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been working on an issue that affects my riding very 
much. It deals with injection drug users, heroin addicts who are 
literally dying on the streets.  I have been advocating for 
heroin prescription trials as a way of medicalizing support and 
help to actually prevent people from dying, to get support for 
those people who now are completely outside of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest barrier is not from the medical community, nor even 
from the public.  It is from elected representatives, 
particularly the government representatives who are afraid to 
take this issue on.  It deals with the taboos around a drug 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say very strongly that this is a place to begin in terms of 
drug reform policy. There is strong public support but we do have 
to go further.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can make a very rational, articulate and well reasoned case 
why the motion should be approved.  The Minister of Health should 
be approving applications today for exemptions so that Canadians 
do not suffer any longer, so that they can get the relief they 
need without having to go to all kinds of difficult means and 
being made to feel like they are being marginalized and 
stigmatized by having to get medical marijuana illegally.  That 
is a shame.  It is something that does not need to exist if we 
had the political will and the leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank members of the House who support the motion. We must 
continue this work.  There is a lot at stake here.  This is an 
important debate.  We must put pressure on the health minister to 
provide those exemptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must make it very clear that we do not want to wait another 
two or three years for the trials to be conducted.  We do not 
want to wait for another study or another plan.  We want help and 
relief to be provided now while those trials are going on.  That 
is what we must urge the government to do in the interest of 
compassion and of providing people with real help and assistance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak today on an issue that is important for the well-being 
of some sick people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legalizing the use of marijuana for health purposes is an urgent 
necessity for many sick persons, and the government's reluctance 
to set up an concrete plan of action is unacceptable to the many 
sick people who must act like criminals, even though they are 
using a drug prescribed by a doctor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is a first in the history of the House of Commons. 
At last, thanks to the motion of my colleague, the hon. member 
for Rosemont, we have a unique opportunity, as representatives 
of our fellow citizens, to discuss the legalization of marijuana 
for medical purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the issue is not a new one. In this regard, we lag far 
behind our civil society. We want to catch up by making sure 
that Motion M-381 gets the support of a majority of members from 
all sides, when we vote on it here, in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain why this is such an important issue. First, the 
Ontario court has already found part of the Narcotic Control Act 
to be unconstitutional, including the provisions on the use of 
marijuana for health purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As legislators, we have a duty to make a decision before the 
current legal vacuum forces judges to make that decision for us. 
Judges are not elected and should not be forced to make the 
final decision in a debate involving all of society because we 
hesitate to play our role as legislators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also a matter of compassion towards those who suffer 
from nausea, vomiting and other symptoms that often accompany 
chronic illnesses or are side effects of their treatments. 
Thousands of patients affected by cancer, AIDS, multiple 
sclerosis, epilepsy and other illnesses reported considerable 
relief from smoking marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effects are so positive that many patients and their 
families are ready to risk jail sentences to buy their drug on 
the black market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always shocking, especially for parents, to see relatives 
suffering when there is no efficient drug to alleviate pain. For 
all those who suffer, it is unacceptable that someone having to 
live with a chronic disease should risk six months in jail and a 
$1,000 fine for using a drug recommended by a doctor. In several 
cases, marijuana is the only drug that can effectively reduce 
some symptoms associated with an illness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above all, it is unacceptable to make a criminal out of a person 
who uses for medical purposes a product whose therapeutic 
virtues are well established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, practitioners have been prescribing Marinol pills for 
years. This drug is known to contain tetrahydrocannabinol, or 
THC—that is a lot simpler to pronounce—which is the main active 
ingredient of marijuana. 
Indeed, no one will deny the therapeutic value of THC, which is 
prescribed to relieve terminally ill patients from nausea and to 
stimulate their appetite.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this synthetic pill is not a valid alternative to 
inhaled THC. According to the famous American medical magazine, 
the New England Journal of Medicine of January 30, 1997, 
inhalation is the only way to increase rapidly the level of THC 
in blood. Hence, inhalation of THC considerably improves the 
therapeutic efficiency of this substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides, numerous patients who would use marijuana for 
therapeutic purposes already have to swallow every day an 
astronomical number of pills. This can cause vomiting and 
patients are therefore forced to swallow again the medication 
they have rejected. This is totally inhuman. It is obvious that 
in such cases, it would be better to administer THC by the 
pulmonary route rather than by the digestive route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now answer a question that many people ask about 
therapeutic inhalation of marijuana. Are the side effects of 
this practice acceptable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inhalation of marijuana has well-known side effects. One only 
has to think about the damages caused to the lungs by inhalation 
of noxious smoke or about certain psychotic effects. We must 
understand that many medications, and not only marijuana, have 
side effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think, for example, of the undesirable and serious side effects 
of chemotherapy or AZT treatments. 
Let us consider, as well, the precautions that must be taken by 
those who use, for therapeutic purposes, by-products of morphine 
and cocaine. Even in the case of a simple Sudafed tablet, it is 
recommended not to drive a motor vehicle because of side 
effects. Indeed, this restriction would probably also apply to 
those who take marijuana for therapeutic purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must bear in mind, however, that the side effects of 
marijuana are considered less harmful than those of at least two 
products that are widely used. As a matter of fact, a report 
produced by a group of French and foreign experts, and entitled 
<I>Problèmes posés par la dangerosité des drogues</I>, came to the 
conclusion that the use of marijuana is less hazardous than the 
use of alcohol or tobacco. 
These conclusions are consistent with the results of a similar 
study conducted on behalf of the UN World Health Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The side effects of a drug cannot be dissociated from its 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many patients the various benefits of marijuana far outweigh 
the side effects known to be less serious than those of alcohol 
or nicotine. It is in this context that the British Medical 
Association publicly asked the police and the courts to tolerate 
the therapeutic use of marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its report, the association says that some patients are 
condemned to using an illegal drug to relieve symptoms no 
existing medication can control and that there is compelling 
evidence that marijuana can help in some circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British government responded to this request by allowing a 
pharmaceutical company to grow and supply cannabis for medical 
research, which led the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great 
Britain to say she is confident prescriptions will be allowed 
within the next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the U.S., 28 states already have laws on the therapeutic use 
of marijuana. During the 1998 elections, six other states held a 
referendum on the issue. In all six cases, measures favouring 
the therapeutic use of marijuana got the majority of the popular 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada and Quebec, physicians are mobilizing to make the 
medical benefits of marijuana better known. 
They point out that marijuana relieves nausea and stimulates the 
appetite, which can help save the life of patients suffering 
from anemia because of chemotherapy or AIDS treatments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A cross-Canada poll has shown wide support, 83%, for the 
legalization of marijuana for therapeutic uses. The <I>Globe and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I 
want to commend the hon. member for Rosemont for putting this 
private members' motion before the House and for the key role he 
has played these last few weeks in urging the federal government 
to take concrete measures to support the use of marijuana for 
therapeutic and medical purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to congratulate all those who, in their own way, 
have constantly put pressure on the elected representatives so 
that this debate could be held and concrete measures could be 
implemented to help the people who need to use marijuana for 
medical purposes, who need to find some relief from pain and 
suffering or to deal with the symptoms of chronic or terminal 
illnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, I am glad to join all those who have worked together 
to urge the federal government to have the political courage and 
the leadership to recognize the medicinal value of marijuana by 
immediately implementing measures to legalize the use of 
marijuana for therapeutic purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from New Brunswick Southwest said, this issue 
must be addressed from a compassionate point of view. We must 
keep an open mind and show compassion throughout this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to keep in mind that for the sick who need marijuana for 
therapeutic purposes, every day they suffer is one day too many. 
Do not think I am talking in abstractions. I know what I am 
talking about, because my mother died of cancer after many long 
years of suffering. 
I will never forget how useless I felt as I watched her suffer 
and I wish I had known the therapeutic effects of marijuana at 
the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it was unfortunately only a few years later that I 
learned about its therapeutic use, and I support the actions of 
those fighting for its medical use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell you that this decision was very easy when I learned 
that the leaders of this campaign were those who were themselves 
sick and had to obtain marijuana illegally at the risk of being 
arrested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is totally unacceptable that someone who is 
chronically ill or in the final stages of AIDS is being 
penalized for medical treatment that many doctors would 
recommend if they could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experiments have shown—and a significant number of health care 
professionals have recognized it publicly—that the use of 
cannabis has beneficial effects in the case of at least four 
serious diseases.  First, by lowering eye pressure, it controls 
glaucoma.  Second, it reduces spasms in victims of MS.  Third, 
it reduces nausea and suffering of those with cancer.  Finally, 
it helps those with AIDS fight depression and regain the 
appetite they need to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also felt that marijuana can help those suffering from 
certain diseases such as migraines and emphysema. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other factor working considerably in favour of the use of 
marijuana for medical purposes is that it produces no side 
effects, as too often occur with other treatments and which can 
be of such intensity as to discourage those who are ill from 
taking their medication, despite their suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but 
the time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired. The order is dropped to the bottom of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise on behalf of my 
colleagues in the Marine Workers Federation and other 
organizations on the west coast, on central inland waters and on 
the east coast. The reason I am rising is because of a very 
fundamental and important issue to my colleagues on the east 
coast, specifically in Atlantic Canada in my home town of 
Halifax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this country does not have, and I will repeat it throughout 
my four minute presentation, is an industrial strategy for a 
shipbuilding policy.  We just do not have one.  Italy has one. 
France has one.  Britain has one.  Spain has one.  Korea has one. 
China has one.  The United States has one.  We do not, and we are 
a mariner nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked a question of the Minister of Industry in the House.  He 
has been in that portfolio for six years.  I asked him whether he 
would at least meet with these people, the unions and the 
workers, to discuss their concerns.  His answer was no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For six years Les Holloway, head of Marine Workers Federation in 
Atlantic Canada, has been asking to meet with the minister, and 
the minister's answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is quite clear.  I want the parliamentary secretary, 
or whoever will respond for the government, to tell me why the 
government is refusing to meet with these workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members say that they have open, transparent 
policies, that they want to be open to Canadians.  However, in an 
era of solidarity, in an era of co-operation which I have heard 
the government constantly preach about for the last six years, it 
is unbelievable that it would act in the way that it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Buzz Hargrove, head of CAW, is aligned with the Marine 
Workers Federation as is Mr. Irving who represents one of the 
largest corporations on the planet, a billionaire.  An empire 
builder, Mr. Irving, and a labour activist, Mr. Hargrove, two 
people from the opposite ends of the political spectrum, are 
singing out of the same hymn book.  They are both saying that the 
country needs an industrial policy for shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government not grabbing the opportunity in 
co-operation, in transparency, in openness and in fairness?  It 
could put these two people in a room with the government industry 
officials and come up with a policy that will benefit thousands 
of Canadians in hundreds of communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government so intransigent and not willing to help 
Marystown Shipyard in Newfoundland; Saint John, New Brunswick; 
Halifax, Nova Scotia; the Pictou yards; Vancouver; the Great 
Lakes; and ports in Quebec?  It is probably because it is a 
central based government and the extremes of Canada outside this 
place mean absolutely nothing to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government can be very proactive when it comes to the 
high tech and the aerospace industries and give them hundreds of 
millions of dollars, all I am saying is why can it not come up 
with an industrial policy for shipbuilding.  Why will the 
minister not meet with the workers to come up with a decent 
proposal?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to answer the 
question of the member for Sackville—Musquodoboit 
Valley—Eastern Shore.  He has given me the opportunity to speak 
on the subject of shipbuilding.  I am sorry he did not mention 
the shipbuilding in my area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first say that the industry minister and I met with the 
representatives of the shipbuilding industry on March 25.  On 
that day we had a very frank discussion with the president of the 
Shipbuilding Association of Canada and presidents or 
vice-presidents of most of Canada's shipbuilding companies.  I 
should also remind the member that I met with the shipbuilding 
industry and the unions previous to that in the fall of 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the meeting on March 25 we discussed the generous package 
of measures the federal government currently maintains to support 
shipbuilding.  May I make perfectly clear some of these measures: 
a 33.3% accelerated capital cost allowance for Canadian 
shipbuilding, a 25% duty on most non-NAFTA ship imports, domestic 
procurement on a competitive basis for all government 
shipbuilding and ship repairs, a favourable research and tax 
credit system, and Export Development Corporation financing for 
commercially viable transactions.  In 1998 we extended that from 
8 years to 12 years in discussions with the shipbuilding 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also explained that Industry Canada had the enabling 
technologies element of Technology Partnerships Canada.  I must 
remind the member that shipbuilding programs lie with the 
departments of foreign affairs and international trade and that 
is why we coordinate them on a sector by sector basis.  These 
representatives have met with EDC and have made these 
improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, substantial support has been provided to the 
shipbuilding industry in the past and we will continue to 
support—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my speech will surely enable the parliamentary secretary to 
continue to speak, because I too wish to address shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 5, I asked a question of the Minister of Finance, but 
it was the Minister of Industry who replied.  The Minister of 
Finance, having had interests in shipping, does not wish to 
answer questions.  Even if his interests are held in trust, he 
does not wish to answer questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question was on taxation, and went as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Minister of Finance tell us why he does not want to do 
for the shipbuilding industry what he did for the film and 
television production industry, that is to harmonize federal 
taxation with measures introduced by the Government of Quebec? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures include a tax credit for the shipbuilding 
industry. This program has been in place for two years. The 
federal tax almost wipes out the benefits provided to 
shipbuilding companies through the provincial tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the parliamentary secretary is here—I met him last 
summer when I visited the Port Weller shipyard, in Ste. 
Catharines—because he knows the shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can he not convince his minister or the Minister of Finance 
to add tax measures? We are not asking for subsidies. We are 
asking for tax measures and additional tax deductions, as asked 
by the Canadian shipbuilding association, the employers, with 
the support of unions, and the various stakeholders in the 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the shipbuilding industry is not doing well—it is currently 
operating at 40% of its capacity—it means that millions of 
dollars are not invested in the regions and this has a very 
significant impact, particularly in the maritimes because, as we 
know, that region is affected by seasonal unemployment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument is just as valid for any region in Canada with a 
shipyard, like the one in my riding of 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when people would have pointed out that the 
question was coming from a Bloc Quebecois member.  I wanted to 
change that perception by touring all Canada's shipyards, with 
the exception of Port Weller, which I visited at the same time 
as the parliamentary secretary.  He was kind enough to be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we realize we are miles apart on design and 
productivity, as people realize that the pay and the 
productivity in Canada's shipyards are better than in other 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, as the NDP member has just said, unlike certain European 
and Asian countries that subsidize their shipbuilding, we do 
not.  Some countries, such as the United States, adopt 
protectionist measures for shipbuilding, but we do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is in the worst of all possible situations:  we do 
neither, and the world is passing us by.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member from Lévis 
for giving me this opportunity to speak. As he mentioned we 
visited the Port Weller dry docks, and I thank him for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is well aware of the generous package. People 
need to understand that there is a very generous package in the 
shipbuilding industry, especially the accelerated capital cost 
allowance.  That is a very quick writeoff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I keep repeating that the following items are in place: duty on 
ship imports, domestic procurement for all government 
shipbuilding and ship repairs, Export Development Corporation 
financing, and a very favourable research and development tax 
credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the federal government participated in an industry led 
rationalization process that culminated in a more streamlined and 
viable industry.  The federal government contributed $200 million 
between 1986 and 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about shipbuilding in Quebec.  The federal 
government invested $1.6 billion in Davie Industries during the 
period from 1983 to 1996 in the form of contracts, contributions 
and loan guarantees.  Moreover, commercial arrangements for EDC 
are currently moving forward to provide additional support to 
this company through a loan guarantee on the <I>Spirit of 
Columbus</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member acknowledged we have an overcapacity of 
shipbuilding, in fact 40%.  The OECD workshop on shipbuilding 
policies reported that there would be 40% world overcapacity by 
the year 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is poised to be a leader in a global knowledge based 
economy for the 21st century.  While focus is based on these 
knowledge intensive sectors where we are strong, where the 
opportunity for growth and leadership is highest and where the 
opportunities for young Canadians are greatest, the government 
has not and will not abandon an important sector like 
shipbuilding.  In fact the EDC—

<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
every day people in my riding of Vancouver East come to me with 
their hopes and their concerns for their families and their 
community.  Lately the concerns that I hear very often centre on 
the issue of safety.  People are concerned for their own personal 
safety.  They are concerned about keeping their children out of 
harm's way and they are concerned that their neighbourhoods are 
becoming less secure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On two recent occasions in the House of Commons I raised the 
issue of safety and asked the government to respond.  On February 
16, I asked the government what it would do to support B.C.'s 
request to keep people safe in their homes as there is a huge 
concern about home invasions.  I also called on the government to 
support the initiative of the Vancouver Safety Coalition for a 
community based crime prevention program funded under the 
national crime prevention strategy.  Unfortunately the response 
from the government has been very inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out in the House on March 2, in order to be 
effective the recently announced $5 million revitalization 
program for the downtown east side must be directed toward 
programs and social supports that will benefit residents and 
improve safety.  So far we have been told that the funds will be 
used to open an office to study ways to bring people together.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of providing jobs for social facilitators we need to 
ensure that these funds are used to help stabilize our 
communities.  We need to improve social conditions.  We need to 
improve housing and addiction treatment programs.  These are the 
types of programs that will make our neighbours and our 
neighbourhoods safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committing to a sane approach to the drug crisis is also a 
crucial step in securing safe communities.  We know that drug 
treatment programs are capable of reducing crimes by 80%. 
Research shows that for every dollar we spend on drug treatment 
services $7 can be saved in medical, social and criminal 
enforcement costs.  Reducing the harm of obtaining illicit drugs 
on the street is critical to saving lives and improving safety 
for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Toward that goal I have worked for accessible detox and 
treatment services, better housing conditions, a safe resource 
centre for drug users so they can get away from the desperate 
life on the street, and for clinical trials for a national heroin 
maintenance program modelled on successful programs in Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time I have called on the government to show 
leadership in providing adequate funding for the establishment of 
community policing and neighbourhood safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must have the courage to support a 
comprehensive strategy for increasing community security that 
includes commitments to social supports and community policing. 
The people of Vancouver East are demanding some assurance that 
safe and healthy communities are achievable goals, not just catch 
phrases of a political public relations campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Keeping our families and our neighbourhoods safe is something 
that concerns us all.  That is why I will continue to fight for 
the resources and the commitment necessary to address this 
important issue.

Speaker, on Wednesday, March 17 I asked the Minister of Justice 
an important question which she failed to answer, so I will ask 
her again.  How would the justice minister like it if her face 
showed up on someone else's firearms licence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what happened to Mr. Robert Soltis of 
Abbotsford, B.C.  He received his firearms licence from the 
Canadian firearms registry and it had someone else's picture on 
it.  He has no idea whose licence his picture ended up on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked the minister about the serious breach of Mr. 
Soltis' privacy, the minister responded “Our firearms registry 
system is working quite well, thank you very much”.  She went on 
to brag about all of the paperwork the CFC has processed.  She 
was not bragging about the lives saved or how much public safety 
has been improved, but about the paper shuffled by her 
bureaucrats.  She said that they have processed 40,000 
applications for licences and registrations, issued over 17,000 
registration certificate numbers and over 12,000 photo ID 
licences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had the chance to ask another question that day I would 
have asked how many of the 12,000 licences issued had the right 
pictures on them.

photograph.  The officer approaches the house and encounters John 
Doe on the street.  Not associating him to the photograph, the 
officer would not recognize him as a possible threat.  I need not 
explain the possible disastrous consequences of this scenario.

this position?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Moss returned his bogus licence to the Ontario Provincial 
Police and was told about a number of similar mistakes that have 
been reported to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a frivolous complaint.  A firearms licence is a 
primary piece of identification.  Have members every heard of a 
passport, or a social insurance card, or a health card, or a 
driver's licence being issued with someone else's picture on it, 
or being sent to the wrong person at the wrong address?  Just 
think of the possible abuses that could occur.  Yet the minister 
seems unconcerned or unaware of the consequences that these 
colossal errors made by her department could have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals who receive faulty licences will be stopped by the 
police.  If they are in the possession of a firearm, the accuracy 
of their government issued licence is the only thing that will 
keep them out of jail.  If even one law-abiding firearm owner is 
harassed by the police because of bureaucratic incompetence it 
will be inexcusable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key question remains.  How many other mistakes like these 
have been made by the Department of Justice?  Do we have to wait 
until each and every individual holder of the licence complains 
about the breach of privacy?  How does the minister propose to 
find all the mistakes that have been made by her department?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the 
question of the member for Yorkton—Melville.  It was an isolated 
case of issuing a firearms licence with the wrong photograph. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An individual in British Columbia applied in November 1998 under 
the previous legislation for a firearms acquisition certificate, 
an FAC.  Since the licence was issued after December 1, the date 
the new law took effect, he received a new possession and 
acquisition licence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The licence was processed under the procedures of the previous 
legislation which relied on local police personnel to handle the 
photograph and paperwork.  This is a responsibility they no 
longer need to worry about under the new system, which I might 
add is saving police forces considerable sums of money which they 
may redirect to other important local policing priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many firearms owners waited until the last days of the old law 
to apply.  We have so far handled over 23,000 of these cases 
under the old system.  It is not clear where the mistake 
happened, whether it was at the local police station where it 
handled a flurry of last minute applications or whether it was 
when the photograph was scanned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is clear is that under the new law and its procedures this 
would not have happened.  Under the new system firearms owners do 
not visit the police station, but rather fill out the form at 
home.  It includes all relevant information, including a photo of 
themselves.  I can assure the member that the Canadian Firearms 
Centre central processing site has taken precautions to ensure 
that this type of switch will not happen under the new system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that we are pleased with the way this new system is 
working.  We are indeed very pleased with the emerging proof that 
it already has made a difference in public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can also tell the House that 159 new licence applications in 
the first four months of the program, between December 1, 1998 
and April 1, 1999, were refused, mainly due to public safety 
concerns, and 129 licences were revoked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be many examples of enhanced public safety in the 
months to come.  I hope that the member understands.
