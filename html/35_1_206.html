<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATIONENFORCEMENTIMPROVEMENTACT">IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from May 12 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-316, an act to amend the Immigration Act and the 
Transfer of Offenders Act, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity 
to congratulate the hon. member on his initiative. I know how 
hard he has worked in order to introduce this private member's 
bill. His constituents are very fortunate to have him as their 
representative. He is hard working and I wish him well.
<P>
	The bill relates to immigrants or refugees in Canada who have 
criminal records. On the surface the bill would help the 
government deport those refugees or immigrants immediately 
after sentencing provided a provision is made to pass the 
authority to the provinces to deal with this issue.
<P>
	On the surface the bill makes a lot of sense. It is precise and to 
the point. However, it causes quite a bit of confusion when one 
goes a little deeper into it.
<P>
	The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has already 
indicated publicly that he supports the intent and the spirit of the 
bill but has raised a number of concerns which I will reiterate. 
On November 1, 1994 the minister tabled a document entitled 
``Into the 21st Century: A Strategy for Immigration and 
Citizenship''. He made a number of comments but I will 
mention only a couple which I believe are relevant to the 
legislation before us.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	The minister said: ``A number of legislative changes will be 
considered to the control and enforcement provision of the act. 
For example, currently deportation orders can only be issued by 
an immigration official. Consideration is being given to 
authorizing judges to issue deportation orders at the time of 
sentencing rather than requiring a separate step''.
<P>
	He also said there may be other improvements we can usher 
into the system. One such recommendation coming from chiefs 
of police is to permit judges to not recommend deportation at the 
time of sentencing but to order deportation at the time of 
sentencing so that the system is leaner and the issues of 
individuals are all dealt with at the right time and that there is 
full due process for the individual, counsel and lawyer to react to 
the judge's ordering of a deportation rather than recommending 
and then having it go back to immigration and before an 
immigration appeal division and so on.
<P>
	In other words, the minister is already trying to streamline the 
process and make it easier for the justice system to deport 
people with criminal records who are here as refugees or landed 
immigrants.
<P>
	He further stated that as parliamentarians we should be 
interested in this issue and also be prepared to look at making 
the relevant amendments if we think the amendments will work, 
which is very important, and if we think those amendments are 
fair. The minister supports the spirit and the intent of bill C-316. 
However, I will outline some concerns of the Department of 
Justice as well as the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration.
<P>
	Immigration falls under federal jurisdiction when it comes to 
deliberation and delivery of the justice system. If we were to 
pass on this jurisdiction to the provincial level there would be a 
number of problems. The department which deals with the issue 
of immigration is not the same department which deals with 
delivery of other relevant aspects of immigration.
<P>
	If this were transferred to the provinces since this is where the 
issue would fall under Bill C-316, we would have to introduce 
training for judges and lawyers in some cases. That would cause 
more delays. Over and over we have seen cases tossed out of 
court because they were delayed for too long. It would mean 
more appeals. We already have an overloaded provincial court 
system.
<P>
	When dealing with the provincial justice system we know 
attorneys can make recommendations to the court based on a 
number of factors which are not part of immigration agenda but 
are a part of other aspects of the justice system such as plea 
bargaining. Judges would then require proof beyond a 
reasonable doubt which would make the issue before the court 
difficult to prove.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12868"> 12868 </A></B>
<P>
	This legislation contravenes the charter of rights when it 
comes to challenges. A number of sections could be challenged 
such as section 11(h) which deals with double punishment. It 
could be argued that deportation is a second form of punishment 
in addition to any other sentence; only a non-citizen would be 
subject to this punishment.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	Section 12 deals with cruel and unusual punishment. It could 
be argued that removing the permanent resident from Canada 
would offend standards of decency by denying for life the 
person's right to be with family and friends.
<P>
	Under section 15, equality under the law, it could be argued 
that permanent residents were being treated differently from 
Canadian citizens under the law. Two persons convicted of the 
same offence would be subject to different consequences based 
on their immigrant status.
<P>
	Simply by looking at these recommendations from both the 
Department of Justice and the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration, while the intent of the bill is good I suggest my 
colleague might want to take it back and look at it with the view 
that if anything is put before the House it should be consistent 
with the charter of rights and freedoms and should meet the 
criteria set out by the Department of Justice and the Department 
of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I remind members that 
when in doubt in seeking the floor please rise; do not depend on 
any lists that might or might not be in circulation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to this bill which if 
successful and sufficiently improved could be a good first step 
in ensuring the quick deportation of foreign born criminals.
<P>
	I appreciate the work the Canadian Police Association has 
done on the bill. I appreciate that my colleague from the Liberal 
Party was brave enough to sponsor it. Clearly the goals of the 
bill are not shared by the minister of immigration. If they were, 
these measures would have been amended to Bill C-44 when it 
was up for debate.
<P>
	The minister knew the recommendations of the Canadian 
Police Association but chose not to act on them. He chose to 
ignore these common sense measures which, when the legal 
language is cleared up by a competent lawyer, would take a 
small step toward ensuring non-citizens who commit serious 
crimes in Canada will make two stops after they leave the court 
room, one to the prison and one to the airport where, unless 
Canadian immigration allows them to run away on the tarmac as 
was the case last week, they will be sent where they belong, out 
of Canada.
<P>
	The bill has a lot of serious problems that will require serious 
study and fixing before the bill can be made effective. I trust it is 
the intention of my colleague to work on these weak points. I 
hope the bill is not window dressing, the sort of smoke and 
mirrors tactics the minister of immigration loves to engage in.
<P>
	My colleague from Cariboo-Chilcotin dealt with the bill's 
problems admirably during the last hour of debate. I will not 
beat that dead horse. However, before the bill goes any further it 
is necessary to look at the big picture of deportations. It is 
necessary to understand what the Reform Party wants to see with 
deportation policy.
<P>
	The Reform Party's stand on non-citizen criminals is clear, 
simple and in line with what the majority of Canadians want, 
something the minister for immigration would have a hard time 
understanding. Our policy for non-citizen criminals would not 
result from bargaining with special interests or with refugee 
lawyers but from consulting with our members, our constituents 
and with the people of Canada.
<P>
	I am sure my hon. colleague, the sponsor of the bill, 
understands what the people are saying on immigration matters. 
I understand a lot of Liberal backbenchers are feeling the heat 
from their constituents. It is too bad they cannot do anything 
about it. It is too bad they have to toe the Liberal Party line.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	We believe that the people who have not exercised a claim to 
Canadian citizenship or who have not lived in the country long 
enough to claim citizenship and who commit serious crimes 
have violated a moral contract entered into with the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes that immigration to Canada is a 
privilege, not a right. We believe that the people of Canada, the 
citizens of Canada, have the collective right to determine who 
comes into Canada, how many people are allowed to come into 
Canada and under what conditions.
<P>
	A newcomer to this country enters into a moral contract with 
Canada. There are several terms of that contract. The most 
important of them is that the newcomer must abide by the laws 
of this country. There is nothing that angers my constituents like 
recently arrived immigrants to Canada who commit crime. That 
drives them up the wall, and rightly so. Canadians collectively 
have the right to be morally outraged when the wonderful gift of 
Canadian residency is extended and then the recipient of that 
gift violates our laws.
<P>
	We are above all else a nation of laws. That defines Canada. 
We demand of anyone who immigrates here that those laws are 
to be respected. That is a demand. When someone ignores that 
demand, violates the moral contract with Canadians and makes a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12869"> 12869 </A></B>
<P>
mockery of the Canadian generosity by breaking the law, then 
that person should be removed quickly and permanently.
<P>
	I challenge the government. I challenge the immigration 
minister and the Prime Minister to poll Canadians, ask 
Canadians if they feel that newcomers who break the law should 
be removed quickly and permanently. Mr. Speaker, I will bet you 
Sergio Marchi's pension that they will say yes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Order.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You know better. You are not a rookie any 
more.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am sure that although we 
have been away from this place for a week, colleagues will 
remember very well the traditions and rules of the House in 
referring to one another either by riding name or portfolio in 
terms of ministry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will heed that caution.
<P>
	Immigrants are responsible for a small percentage of crime in 
Canada. Immigrants are under represented in Canadian prisons. 
That speaks to the character of immigrants to Canada. That 
speaks to the gratitude of the immigrant population. The 
immigrant population, like in all populations, there are some 
who will break the law.
<P>
	Immigrants have come to me on a tragically regular basis 
asking me to do something about crime in their communities. 
When we deport foreign born criminals, we are not picking on 
immigrants; we are protecting them. Immigrants come to this 
country seeking a better life and because the overwhelming 
majority of immigrants do not break the law, Canada has a duty 
to ensure that the problems and the crime that many immigrants 
have left behind in their countries of origin stay there, out of 
Canada. That is our duty.
<P>
	Do immigrants who break the law deserve to be doubly 
punished? No. Should they serve more time because they are 
immigrants? No way. However, if a non-citizen breaks the law 
then they have done more than just violate our law, for which the 
criminal justice system will deal with them. They have also 
broken a moral contract: they have broken their promise to obey 
the laws of the country they have adopted and that has adopted 
them.
<P>
	As a result of the violation of that contract Canada has the 
right to say we don't want to include them in our national family. 
We have the right to view that period of time between the date 
the newcomer comes to this country and the date they receive 
their citizenship as a period of probation. If that probation is 
violated, then there is no onus on Canada to provide a home for 
that person any longer.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports quick deportation after 
conviction. We will support this bill on the condition that the 
gaping holes in this legislation are plugged by the committee. 
We will cooperate with the sponsor of this bill to work out those 
problems, despite the fact that those are huge problems as the 
bill is presently written.
<P>
	Today let me speak briefly to one of the big problems in this 
legislation, and that is the problem of reciprocal agreements 
with other countries.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	This bill says that a criminal court judge can only order 
deportation back to countries with which we have a 
co-operative agreement. In other words, the only countries we 
can deport people to are countries that say they will take them 
back.
<P>
	The problem we run into is that a lot of our foreign-born 
criminals come from countries that are notorious for not taking 
back their own. What is this bill going to do about that problem, 
the so-called travel document problem? It does nothing except 
to give in to it. That is not good enough. It means that a large part 
of the overall problem will not be dealt with by this legislation.
<P>
	I do not expect my colleague to be able to single handedly fix 
that problem, but the government can fix the problem. The 
inability to secure travel documents is no excuse for not being 
able to deport.
<P>
	The Reform Party today is putting this government on notice 
that we will no longer accept the excuse of not being able to get 
travel documents. We give away far too much foreign aid for 
that excuse to be valid. If a country will not take back its citizens 
who commit crime in Canada, then the minister of immigration 
should recommend to the Minister of Foreign Affairs that all 
foreign aid in any form be suspended to that country until they 
change their tune.
<P>
	No deportation, no foreign aid: it is a simple solution. Most of 
the solutions to Canada's immigration problems are simple 
ones. They only require a little political will.
<P>
	I thank my hon. colleague for sponsoring this legislation. I 
hope this gesture has implications within his caucus. I hope we 
can impress on the immigration minister the need to get serious 
with immigration policy. So far the minister has not figured that 
out.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Roberval would like to raise a point of order. Please give me a 
moment, as I would like to check something.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank 
you for allowing me to raise my point of order. I would like to 
seek from the House unanimous consent for an emergency 
debate. I realize that, according to the order of business-I will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12870"> 12870 </A></B>
<P>
be brief-such a request can normally be made only after the 
regular period of routine  proceedings, which will end at 
approximately 3.15 p.m. today.
<P>
	However, given the importance of the issue in question and 
the need to prepare ourselves for the debate, if the House were to 
accept my proposal, I think that you would find unanimous 
consent in this House for the following motion: ``That the House 
take into consideration the situation of Canadian peacekeepers 
in Bosnia-Hercegovina''.
<P>
	Given the extremely serious situation there, it is important 
that the House immediately consider this request for a three hour 
emergency debate, to begin at 6.00 p.m. The details of the debate 
could be worked out with the government later, but it is 
important that we immediately make up our minds on the 
necessity of the debate.
<P>
	Therefore, I would ask my colleagues whether they will give 
their unanimous consent right now to holding a debate at 6.00 
p.m. tonight on the situation of the peacekeepers, an extremely 
important issue.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Firstly, I would like to 
thank the hon. member for Roberval for his patience while I 
verified the rules governing this process. I give the floor to the 
parliamentary secretary to the Leader of the Government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on the same point. I can see the hon. member's point of 
view, but I am quite surprised that he did not inform me that he 
planned to introduce this motion this morning.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am prepared, to enter into discussion with him. We are 
always willing to entertain such discussions with hon. members 
in the opposition when they have suggestions concerning House 
business. However, I am aware of no such discussions on the 
subject this morning.
<P>
	In the normal course the hon. member and others may wish to 
bring forward an application under Standing Order 52 at three 
o'clock. I think it is entirely appropriate that this be done, and 
the Speaker then will consider whether the circumstances exist 
for an emergency debate.
<P>
	Tomorrow is an opposition day. It has been designated as such 
and it is available for discussion on the subject should the 
opposition choose. There is plenty of opportunity for the House 
to engage in the debate, and I do not feel there is need for us to 
set aside business and indeed the hon. member is not suggesting 
that we set aside the business that is scheduled today for the 
House. I suggest we proceed with it at this time.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I give the hon. 
member for Calgary Centre the floor I would like to remind the 
House to be cautious. I do not intend to get into the debate at this 
time. As soon as possible I would like to put the question to the 
House with respect to the request from the hon. member for 
Roberval for unanimous consent. I do not want to prejudge what 
the decision of the House might be in the matter.
<P>
	I will hear the hon. member for Calgary Centre on a brief 
intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like you to clarify whether in 
fact under the standing orders other business can be brought up 
or new items can be brought up during Private Members' 
Business. Do we not have to stick to the agenda for the hour and 
then seek unanimous consent? I am just questioning the timing 
of the request.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> That is exactly the point I 
was taking time to get more information on while I asked the 
hon. member for Roberval to be patient before getting the floor.
<P>
	I have been assured that the request can be made for 
unanimous consent at any time and the House will deal with the 
question as it arises.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would point out that the hon. member for Red Deer has already 
made an application to the government to have an emergency 
debate on Bosnia.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let me deal with the 
matter at hand, following the intervention of the hon. member 
for Roberval.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	You have heard the hon. member for Roberval's arguments for 
unanimous consent. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> No.
<P>
	Therefore, let us resume debate.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise this morning to deal with private 
member's Bill C-316.
<P>
	I know there has been a lot of discussion surrounding this 
issue in the larger cities of Canada, but make no mistake, this 
issue is not just of concern to large cities. I represent the people 
of Souris-Moose Mountain, a rural riding in southeast 
Saskatchewan. Crime for them is of great concern as it is to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	The people of my riding are honest hard working individuals. 
They work every day to see that the future of Canada is a good 
one for their children. We are not so different from the people in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12871"> 12871 </A></B>
<P>
Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver. We dream of the future and we 
hope for our children. We feel strongly that we live in the best 
country in the world and we want to keep it that way.
<P>
	Let me say that the murders of Georgina Leimonis and 
Constable Todd Baylis were reprehensible crimes. The sad thing 
is that these are not isolated events. We should be able to stop 
these kinds of things from happening in our country. We must 
work together to see that we reach a balance which protects the 
rights of individuals and allows for freedoms, but also provides 
for security for us to live and raise our families and walk our 
streets in safety.
<P>
	I congratulate the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. 
He has done an admirable job this past year and one-half in 
producing reforms and actions that have and will greatly 
improve our immigration and deportation system.
<P>
	Measures contained in Bill C-44 have limited the rights of 
serious criminals to appeal under the immigration system. 
However, there still seems to be room for further tightening on 
the rights of serious criminals. There is still room for a criminal 
to fall through the cracks between the courts and the 
Immigration Act.
<P>
	Many appeals are available to a convicted criminal both 
through the criminal process and the Immigration Act. Bill 
C-316 would still permit the criminal to have access to appeals 
through the criminal process. It would only limit his or her 
access to the appeals in the Immigration Act. Remember, we are 
talking about convicted criminals who have committed a serious 
crime.
<P>
	This bill applies to criminals convicted of an offence 
punishable by a sentence of 10 or more years. The measures 
contained in this bill will accelerate deportation by allowing the 
court in addition to any other sentence to order the removal of a 
non-citizen.
<P>
	It would save the Canadian taxpayer money because the two 
separate hearings, immigration and sentencing, would not be 
needed. Instead of two hearings, the courts would decide both 
the sentencing and deportation. It would not just save money; in 
the case of Todd Baylis, it may very well have saved his life. We 
believe strongly in freedom in this country but we cannot allow 
our freedom to go so far as to limit our security.
<P>
	Some people have criticized this bill because they believe it 
punishes non-citizens more than it does Canadian citizens and it 
treats them differently. Of course this is already true of our 
current laws. Non-citizens cannot vote. Under the current law 
non-citizens are already subject to deportation.
<P>
	The only difference contained in Bill C-316 is that the sole 
responsibility for both the criminal sentence and deportation 
would lie within the courts and not within those two bodies, the 
courts and immigration. Taking out this extra step leaves less 
room for error, less room for bureaucracy to step in and less 
room for criminals to get lost in the shuffle.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me cite one incident. Mr. Ng, the individual who came 
from California, ended up in Calgary. There he stayed for five or 
six years while the taxpayers had to absorb the cost. Hopefully 
this mechanism put forward by my fellow parliamentarian 
would alleviate this kind of excessive tax burden on individuals 
having to put up with dangerous criminals hiding within the 
existing law.
<P>
	This bill has been endorsed by the Canadian Police 
Association and the Metro Toronto Police Association. 
Certainly that should tell us something. These are the people 
who come face to face with these problems each day. They are 
trying to make our streets safer. We would do well to give them a 
hand.
<P>
	An additional measure in the bill that ensures fair treatment of 
non-citizens is the provision that it does not apply to anyone 
who arrived in Canada before the age of 16 years, as long as that 
individual remained free of criminal charges for a period of five 
years. That is a very important feature. We do take 
responsibility for those who have been raised in our society 
whether they are citizens or not.
<P>
	Before concluding let me touch upon a couple of issues that 
have come forward with regard to party line. Within the 
framework of this bill we have the ability to cross party lines to 
support those initiatives that make good sense to all taxpayers.
<P>
	The member of Parliament for Cambridge has wrestled with 
the bill. I am sure he is prepared to entertain any amendments 
that would strengthen it. In that way we can resolve that those 
people who do not understand it is a right and a privilege to be 
here and want to abuse both, we would rather not have them as 
citizens of our country. It would be much better if they were 
back in their own country.
<P>
	Concerning the criminal element, we have some real 
problems. As some amendments go before the committee we 
will deal with the deportation aspect. I have strong reservations 
about suggesting that because criminal elements come here 
from foreign countries that we would then punish those people 
by removing foreign aid. I would not support that.
<P>
	The private member's bill by the member for Cambridge is a 
good one. It has given us reason to think on how we can improve 
our society.
<P>
	In conclusion, I support and commend my colleague the 
member for Cambridge for a job well done. He certainly has the 
best interests of his constituents and his country at heart. I urge 
other members of the House to consider the intent of this bill 
very carefully. We want to make our streets safer. We want to 
create a society which will continue to be the number one 
country in the world in which to live, as stated by the United 
Nations.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in the debate on Bill C-316, an act to amend the 
Immigration Act and the Transfer of Offenders Act.
<P>
	I congratulate my colleague, the Liberal member for 
Cambridge, for getting involved in this matter. Crime is a matter 
of the highest concern to myself and the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois, as it is to everyone. We believe that government has 
the obligation and also the right to protect people against 
criminals, whether they are born in Canada or elsewhere.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	The aim of Bill C-316 is to improve the process of deporting 
those who have committed violent crimes and to transfer the 
powers of the Department of Immigration to the courts. As 
justification for this bill, the member cited two murders, which 
took place in Toronto last year and which moved the public, 
including the members of the Bloc Quebecois. We deplored 
these two murders-one of a young woman, the other of a police 
officer. We do not, however, consider the bill justified in the 
present context. I believe it will create more problems than it 
hopes to resolve. I note the hon. member included a clause 
providing for an exception whereby, for example, young 
immigrants under the age of 16, who had arrived in Canada at an 
early age, would not be deported. This is an excellent principle, 
but contained in a flawed bill.
<P>
	I have often said that young people who arrive in Canada 
when they are very young become the products of Canadian 
society rather than their society of origin. Poverty and 
adversity-problems we have here in Canada-sometimes lead 
to crime, and we must fight these problems at their very root.
<P>
	A few months ago, here in this House, we debated Bill C-44. 
As we know, present legislation already gives the Department of 
Immigration powers to deport criminals who have committed 
crimes here in Canada and to prevent foreign criminals from 
entering the country. Bill C-44 accords additional powers to the 
Department of Immigration and, particularly, to the minister.
<P>
	As you know, and my colleague knows this because he sits on 
the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration with 
me, just about every organization, except the police association, 
came and testified against Bill C-44. We understand why the 
police association always adopts the same position against 
crime.
<P>
	One of the observations made in the discussions on Bill C-44 
was that the bill would impose a double penalty for the same 
crime, that is, it would punish an individual twice for a single 
crime. This is unacceptable in any legal system, here or 
elsewhere. Under Bill C-316, this is even more clearly the case. 
An individual would be punished twice, particularly by the 
courts. The courts would punish the offence and then add a 
second punishment: deportation.
<P>
	To date, deportation, the expulsion of immigrants, has been an 
administrative process. It is the responsibility of the 
Department of Immigration, and, according to my colleague's 
bill, it should be the responsibility of the courts. We all know 
that the courts lack jurisdiction to decide on matters where 
human life is at risk. There are matters of life or death involving 
the application of the Geneva convention, which imposes 
certain conditions on signatory countries, such as Canada.
<P>
	Existing legislation provides a process whereby those 
accused may turn to the law. Deporting an individual requires a 
decision by an arbitrator. This decision may be appealed before 
the Immigration and Refugee Board.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	This bill also addresses the issue of transferring criminals 
from Canada to other countries. True, some bilateral treaties 
now in effect allow such a transfer if requested by the offender; 
if there is a bilateral agreement, these people are sent back to 
their countries of origin. However, not all countries are willing 
to sign such treaties. Why would the country of origin pay the 
cost of incarcerating a criminal for several years for a crime that 
was not committed on its own territory? In this sense, I do not 
find this bill realistic.
<P>
	This bill would also penalize the families of criminals. 
Having been trained as a lawyer, I know that this infringes on the 
most basic of rights. This is unacceptable. Why should two year 
old or three year old children pay for their father's crime or a 
woman for her husband's crime? In my opinion, the philosophy 
currently evolving in Canada against immigrants with criminal 
records goes too far.
<P>
	I read the presentations carefully and I listened to my 
colleagues earlier. No one in this House mentioned that the 
crime rate among immigrants is lower than among those who 
were born here. Statistics show that the percentage of immigrant 
inmates in Canadian prisons is lower than the percentage of 
Canadian-born inmates. So punishing an individual by 
association is both unacceptable and inhumane.
<P>
	I have noted that Reform members have serious reservations 
in this regard and that Liberal members support this bill. I really 
followed with great interest the speech by the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, and I 
agree with her analysis.
<P>
	I think that this bill raises many constitutional issues as well 
as many questions in connection with the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. It violates the following sections-which 
I did not have time to read-namely section 11, which provides 
that any person charged with an offence has the right not to be 
denied reasonable bail without just cause; section 12, which 
provides that everyone has the right not to be subjected to any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12873"> 12873 </A></B>
<P>
cruel and unusual treatment or punishment; and, above all, 
section 15, which provides that every individual has the right to 
equal protection and equal benefit of the law  without 
discrimination based on race, religion, national origin, and so 
on.
<P>
	For this reason alone, this bill is unacceptable. But there are 
other compelling reasons to reject this bill. There are always 
humanitarian considerations that anyone can invoke. The 
current law, as well as Bill C-44 now before the Senate, 
provides that a person can always invoke humanitarian 
considerations. This bill, however, would prevent these 
considerations from being put forward.
<P>
	The current legislation is adequate. In fact, every day, the 
minister of immigration and his officials prevent hundreds of 
potential immigrants with criminal records from coming here. 
Every day, dozens of people are removed from Canada to 
foreign countries. Since the minister already has this power, I 
think that this bill is totally unnecessary, and that is why I will 
vote against it.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as you are aware, Bill C-316 is a private member's bill 
put forward by the member for Cambridge. In short, the bill 
proposes to give provincial court judges the power to order 
deportation at the time of sentencing.
<P>
	On the surface the proposal seems to make sense. In spirit and 
intent the bill would simplify the bureaucratic process, 
eliminating the need for a deportation inquiry. Instead, a foreign 
born criminal would be ordered deported at the time of 
sentencing and hopefully be removed without incident 
following the completion of his or her sentence.
<P>
	Both the Canadian Police Association and the Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police have called for this type of 
legislative change. There are a number of gaps in the present 
system through which foreign born criminals can disappear 
underground between the time they complete their sentences 
and the time they are called for the deportation inquiries.
<P>
	The minister is sensitive to the concerns raised by the 
Canadian Police Association. He has discussed the possibility of 
such a change on two separate occasions. On November 1, 1994 
the minister tabled a document entitled ``Into the 21st Century: 
A Strategy for Immigration and Citizenship''. In the document 
the minister raises a number of possibilities for legislative 
change:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A number of legislative changes will be considered to reinforce the control 
and enforcement provisions of the Act. For example, currently deportation 
orders can only be issued by an immigration official. Consideration is being 
given to authorizing judges to issue deportation orders at the time of sentencing, 
rather than requiring a separate step.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That can be found at page 59. He further referred to such a 
possibility in his speech at second reading of Bill C-44.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There may be other improvements that we can usher into the system and one 
such recommendation, for instance, coming from some of the police chiefs is to 
permit judges to not recommend deportations at the time of giving sentence but to 
order deportation at the time of sentencing so that the system is leaner, so that the 
issues of that individual are all dealt with at the right time, and that there is full due 
process for that individual's counsel and lawyer to react to that judge's ordering 
of a deportation rather than recommending and then having it go back to 
immigration and before an immigration appeal division and so on.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In light of the foregoing it is safe to say the minister supports 
the spirit and intent of Bill C-316. However, there have been a 
number of technical concerns raised not only by the Department 
of Citizenship and Immigration but also by the Department of 
Justice and the Solicitor General.
<P>
	Take a look at some of the concerns from the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration. This legislation raises some 
serious constitutional questions. The supreme court has 
established that deportation is not a form of punishment but 
rather an administrative decision taken by Canada. Bill C-316 
seeks to change this. By making deportation a sentencing option 
it suddenly becomes a criminal punishment.
<P>
	There are no fewer than three constitutional clauses that could 
be used to argue against the sentence. For instance, section 15 
deals with equality under the law. It could be argued that two 
tiers of punishment would be available to judges if Bill C-316 
came into effect, one for citizens and the other for non-citizens. 
We would have a case where two people commit the same crime, 
yet the punishment would be harsher for one than for the other.
<P>
	Section 11 deals with double punishment. It could be argued 
that removal from Canada would represent a second form of 
punishment in addition to any other sentence. In effect, 
non-citizens would face the prospect of being punished twice 
for the same offence.
<P>
	Section 12 deals with cruel and unusual punishment. It could 
be argued here that removing a permanent resident from Canada 
is tantamount to denying for life a person's right to be with 
family and friends, to earn a living or to communicate freely in 
the course of daily living.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us look at some of the concerns raised by the Department 
of Justice. There is a clear potential that even the simplest case 
could become mired in constitutional wrangling, which could 
stretch on for years and cost the taxpayers hundreds of 
thousands if not millions of dollars.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12874"> 12874 </A></B>
<P>
	If the bill were to pass we would be transferring the 
responsibility for removing potentially dangerous criminals 
from the federal immigration department, whose 
representatives are experts in the field, to the provincial crown 
attorneys and judges. We should not dilute federal 
responsibility for something as important as the deportation of 
violent offenders.
<P>
	It would take both time and money to train lawyers and judges 
to deal with immigration cases. The international obligations 
that Canada has with respect to immigration matters are not well 
known to judges acting in criminal matters.
<P>
	Plea bargaining could become a convenient way for people 
who should not be in the country to stay in the country. There 
would be also be more appeals to our overloaded courts.
<P>
	Deportation can be a complex process requiring travel 
documents and international co-operation. These are affairs 
which are best handled by the immigration department, which 
will continue to be responsible for all other deportations of 
persons who have entered Canada illegally, have been convicted 
of serious crimes in other countries or have otherwise violated 
the Immigration Act.
<P>
	Judges require proof beyond a reasonable doubt before they 
can issue any court order. Bill C-316 as it stands could not 
withstand a charter challenge. The federal court has established 
that deportation is not a form of punishment but rather is an 
administrative decision taken by Canada.
<P>
	Let us look at some of the concerns raised by the Solicitor 
General. The purpose of the Transfer of Offenders Act is to 
accommodate non-Canadians serving sentences by making it 
possible, on the basis of an arrangement between states, to 
transfer offenders so they can serve time in their homeland. This 
act is not meant to support orders which may have been made by 
the court.
<P>
	Bill C-316 proposes that the act be amended to allow Canada 
to remove any foreign criminal serving time in a Canadian 
prison. There is absolutely no incentive for foreign countries to 
pass treaties with Canada whereby we would transfer to them the 
cost of punishing offenders who have committed crimes in 
Canada.
<P>
	The government wants to ensure that all dangerous foreign 
offenders are ordered removed. We also want to ensure that the 
humanitarian concerns, which are an important part of the 
immigration system, are consistently applied to all persons 
subject to removal orders.
<P>
	Bill C-44 seeks to remove all appeal rights from the 
Immigration and Refugee Board by dangerous criminals hoping 
to delay or prevent their removal from Canada. It also would 
prevent the release of unescorted convicted criminals under 
deportation order from Canadian prisons until they can be 
removed from Canada.
<P>
	Many of the proposals which this bill would seem to resolve 
have already been dealt with in Bill C-44. The system works, 
but it could work far better than it does at the present time. The 
hon. member for Cambridge is clearly pointing out that there is 
need for change. We are taking action, but we must weigh our 
options carefully. All too often there is a difference between 
what sounds good and what is practical.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to address the House of Commons today on the 
issue of Bill C-316, an act to amend the Immigration Act and 
Transfer of Offenders Act, tabled by the hon. member for 
Cambridge.
<P>
	There is no doubt that Canada is one of the most welcoming 
countries in the world for those emigrating for family or 
business reasons and for those fleeing persecution around the 
world. Because of this tradition, the people of Canada were 
awarded the Nanson medal by the United Nations high 
commissioner for refugees, a recognition of the entire nation's 
outstanding efforts on behalf of refugees.
<P>
	We all want to preserve this tradition. However, it has become 
apparent in the past few years that a system that was designed to 
be fair, compassionate, and open became overburdened with the 
number of applicants waiting to come to Canada. The system 
showed signs of breakdown. Cracks began to appear. Some 
immigrants and refugees were being processed who perhaps 
should not have been. Many immigrants who had arrived as 
youngsters may have found themselves in their teens or early 
twenties in the midst of a recession and perhaps with a lack of 
opportunities.
<P>
	Any society during tough economic times sees the crime rate 
rise as people become frustrated. Several high profile 
horrendous crimes that were prominently reported in the 
newspapers involved non-citizens. I think of the tragic shooting 
deaths of constable Todd Baylis and Georgina Leimonis. 
Canadians began questioning what had gone wrong. Why had 
these young men with lengthy criminal records slipped through 
the cracks?
<P>
	When this government was elected it promised to make homes 
and streets safer places for all Canadians. In response to our 
promises and to address the problems demonstrated by these 
high profile crimes, the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration introduced Bill C-44. This bill took steps to 
eliminate the cracks that had previously appeared in the 
immigration and deportation systems.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Cambridge has been moved by the 
letters and interventions from constituents in his riding, young 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12875"> 12875 </A></B>
<P>
and old alike, and has therefore taken the initiative to learn what 
could be done and to respond with legislation on the issue.
<P>
	The highlights of Bill C-316 can be summarized as follows. 
The proposed bill aims to improve the way in which 
deportations of violent offenders who are non-citizens are 
carried out. The bill enables the court, in addition to any other 
sentence, to order the removal of a non-citizen convicted of an 
offence punishable by 10 or more years. The bill accelerates the 
deportation process, thereby saving Canadian taxpayers much 
money.
<P>
	The bill does not apply to anyone arriving in Canada prior to 
16 years of age as long as that individual remains free of 
criminal convictions for a period of five years. We must, as 
Canadians, take responsibility for some of those who are raised 
in our society.
<P>
	Foreign offenders could be returned to their country of origin 
if reciprocal conditional release conditions existed and if so 
ordered by the courts. Currently an offender is transferred if he 
agrees to be transferred.
<P>
	I too have heard from constituents on this issue. Many are 
outraged over the senseless killings of constable Baylis and Ms. 
Leimonis. I support the general intent of this bill and I believe it 
to be in keeping with both our immigration and justice policies.
<P>
	I do have some concern that the dependants of individuals 
would also be subject to removal. This perhaps could be an area 
that could be revisited on a case by case basis as the practical 
implications are considered.
<P>
	It is my understanding that provisions allowing the judge to 
order the removal of offenders is something that may be 
considered by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration at 
some future time. While some of our hon. colleagues have 
difficulty with the constitutionality of this provision, some say 
that such treatment would discriminate between citizens and 
non-citizens. Non-citizens are, under the law, subject to 
removal in any event under the current immigration policies. 
This bill only provides for an expedient and cost efficient 
alternative as to who might make this removal order. I do 
recommend, however, that safeguards be built in as to the ability 
to avoid plea bargaining to avoid the removal order. I would like 
to see some provisions that the removal order not be dealt with 
in conjunction with the sentence.
<P>
	I certainly support the addition of the clause that provides for 
exception for those offenders who entered Canada before the age 
of 16 years and who have been free of criminal conviction for 
five years. This is fair and in keeping with our immigration 
policy principles. I refer to the situation of Mr. Clinton Gayle, 
who came to Canada at a young age and was under a removal 
order. It was over two years old. While Mr. Gayle may have been 
socializing in Canada, it was determined that he should be 
removed. These removal orders must be dealt with immediately.
<P>
	The bill before the House does not deal explicitly with the 
issue of enforcement and process. One can conclude that if an 
offender is in custody and has been sentenced and a removal 
order made, the offender will not be released back into the 
community. Deportation of undesirables who have no respect 
for the laws of our country and who jeopardize our safety and 
security should be removed. This should be done swiftly, surely 
and immediately.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of private members' business has now expired.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. On Friday I sent letters to the Prime Minister, the Leader 
of the Official Opposition, and the Speaker's office requesting 
an emergency debate on the Bosnian situation. I believe that 
Canadians are totally outraged by the lack of action and the lack 
of information.
<P>
	I rise and ask for unanimous consent to suspend the business 
of the House for today and begin an immediate emergency 
debate on this issue. Canadian troops are being held hostage and 
are in imminent danger. It is therefore vital that Parliament 
immediately deal with this issue.
<P>
	I realize that the BQ has asked for unanimous consent to begin 
debate at 6 p.m., but given the urgency of the situation I do not 
believe we should wait any longer. We need a debate now and I 
am asking for that decision now.

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of

when he rose a half hour ago and made essentially the same 
request.
<P>
	I am aware that the hon. member regards the situation as 
urgent. Standing Order 52 of the rules of the House of Commons 
provides an opportunity for the hon. member to ask the Speaker

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUSINESSDEVELOPMENTBANKOFCANADAACT">BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT BANK OF CANADA ACT</A></H3>
On the Order: Government Orders:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>May 29, 1994-The Minister of Industry-Second reading and reference to 
the Standing Committee on Industry of Bill C-91, an act to continue the Federal 
Business Development Bank under the name Business Development Bank of 
Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-91, an act to continue the Federal Business Development Bank 
under the name Business Development Bank of Canada, be referred forthwith to 
the Standing Committee on Industry.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to begin debate on the 
motion to refer Bill C-91, the Business Development Bank of 
Canada Act, to committee before second reading.
<P>
	I have every confidence that the members of the committee 
will bring their ideas and convictions to bear on this legislation, 
which establishes a new mandate for the Federal Business 
Development Bank under the name of the Business 
Development Bank of Canada.
<P>
	The objective of Bill C-91 is to make government assistance 
in the area of commercial financing more efficient, effective, 
and relevant to the needs of small business.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The bill reaffirms the bank's mandate, which is to provide 
management, consulting and training services to Canadian 
entrepreneurs. Small business is faced with a variety of 
challenges, ranging from the tax burden and deregulation to 
skills improvement and technology acquisition. But the most 
pressing need certainly remains sufficient financing and 
adequate consulting services in commercial management.
<P>
	Without financing and adequate consulting services, small 
business cannot set out to conquer either the national or the 
international market.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	It is essential that small businesses have access to financing 
through debt financing, as well as equity financing at every 
stage of their development, but especially at the initial stage.
<P>
	Let us look at the challenges small businesses face when 
seeking debt or equity financing, in terms of four weaknesses in 
the services currently provided by Canada's financial markets.
<P>
	First is the risk factor, as several lending institutions are 
reluctant to grant loans to certain small businesses, even at rates 
that take into account the higher risk associated with such loans.
<P>
	Second is the size of the loan. Whether the loan requested is 
for $1 million or $50,000, the cost to the bank or venture capital 
holders to prepare and assess business plans and financial 
proposals as well as to monitor the progress of the venture 
generally remain constant.
<P>
	Third is knowledge. Often financial institutions are not 
familiar with the nature of industries emerging in the new 
economy. They do not have any tried and true method to assess 
the risk associated with granting a loan to new industries or 
investing in them.
<P>
	Fourth is flexibility. Lenders are often reluctant to provide 
financing to potential winners on flexible terms. Traditional 
lenders usually require payments to spread over the term of the 
loan. This type of financing can prove overwhelming for 
businesses at the product development stage, as these businesses 
have not yet reached the point where they can generate enough 
sales revenue to offset their debt.
<P>
	These four problems arise from the fact that our economy is 
changing rapidly. In meeting the challenges of a knowledge 
based market, small business has modernized much more 
rapidly than traditional financial institutions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The small business community in Canada must move swiftly 
to innovate and to secure a share of emerging  business opportu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12877"> 12877 </A></B>
<P>
nities. The Canadian economy as a whole relies upon their 
abilities and entrepreneurship to sustain economic growth and 
to create jobs.
<P>
	Here is an instance where government can make a difference 
to the marketplace. No one is suggesting that governments can 
replace private sector financial institutions in meeting the needs 
of the marketplace, but it is in situations such as those I have 
described where government can provide leadership. We need 
leadership to demonstrate that it is possible to address the needs 
of small business in the knowledge economy. One government 
institution has experience and skills to provide that leadership: 
the Federal Business Development Bank.
<P>
	Members may be aware that the bank is approaching its $3.2 
billion statutory ceiling for capital and liabilities. With no 
change to this ceiling, the bank would have to ration credit, 
turning away qualified entrepreneurs who otherwise are 
positioned to create jobs. Under this legislation the bank's 
capital and liability ceiling would be removed and the bank 
would be subject to a 10-year legislative review, which is 
similar to the requirements imposed on chartered banks under 
the Bank Act.
<P>
	Hon. members will recall that in the 1995 budget the finance 
minister said that the bank and regional agencies will forge new 
strategic alliances to ensure co-ordinated delivery of business 
financing. The bank's new mandate will encourage stronger 
partnerships and increased cooperation with the regional 
agencies and other federal financial institutions such as the 
Export Development Corporation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the issue of regional 
development by showing how important the Federal Business 
Development Bank is in Quebec. Its head office is located in 
Montreal, and nearly twenty per cent of its offices are in 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Over the course of 50 years, the FBDB has provided more than 
$4.5 billion in loans to small and medium size businesses in 
Quebec. At present, the loan portfolio for Quebec totals $1.1 
billion, shared among 3,600 clients. These past five years, 
FBDB clients have created 8,500 new jobs and more than 9,000 
entrepreneurs in Quebec have benefited from management 
consulting services provided by the bank.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A similarly impressive story can be told elsewhere in the 
country. The arrangements we are making with regional 
agencies, in co-operation with the provinces and territories, will 
avoid costly overlap and duplication.
<P>
	Finally, I want the House to understand that Bill C-91 is a key 
element in our commitment to provide leadership in creating a 
business climate that promotes small business growth, 
innovation and job creation. I believe that the innovative 
approaches the Business  Development Bank of Canada will 
take after this legislation comes into effect will show the 
chartered banks in Canada that there is a profitable future for 
them in the service of Canadian small businesses.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to speak on Bill C-91, an act to continue the 
Federal Business Development Bank under the name Business 
Development Bank of Canada. I want to draw your attention 
immediately to the fact that the legislation proposes to continue 
the Federal Business Development Bank. However, after my 
comments, you will see that this is hardly the case.
<P>
	We oppose this bill. As the critic for industry, I oppose this 
bill for three main reasons, but also for another reason which my 
colleagues will tell you more about and which concerns regional 
development. The three main reasons we oppose this legislation 
are the name change from Federal Business Development Bank 
to Business Development Bank of Canada, the change in the 
status or purpose of the new Business Development Bank of 
Canada, compared to that of the original Federal Business 
Development Bank and, finally, the issue of the new so-called 
hybrid capital instruments, which we will discuss in greater 
detail.
<P>
	I will first deal with the name change from Federal Business 
Development Bank to Business Development Bank of Canada. 
The issue was discussed by members of the Standing Committee 
on Industry, after the parliamentary secretary made that 
proposal somewhat unexpectedly. The committee did not reject 
the suggestion for reasons of courtesy and also to avoid any 
conflict. However, even Liberal members seemed 
uncomfortable with the idea. The proposal made by the 
parliamentary secretary sought to change the name Federal 
Business Development Bank to Canadian Bank for Small 
Businesses.
<P>
	Again, committee members accepted that proposal out of 
respect for the parliamentary secretary. If you read the report 
tabled by the committee, you will not see any mention of that 
proposal. That recommendation was made out of the blue, and 
everyone felt that the name Canadian Bank for Small Businesses 
was too restrictive. The fact is that the Federal Business 
Development Bank is involved in the financing of more than just 
small businesses. Consequently, the proposed name was too 
restrictive and should have been rejected, but was accepted out 
of courtesy.
<P>
	Now we find ourselves at the other end of the spectrum with 
the name Business Development Bank of Canada. Please note 
that the French name of the new bank makes no reference to 
``business''. So what we have with this bill is a switch from 
small businesses alone to the development of the whole of 
Canada. And this is just as extreme. I do not think that Canada's 
development is related to a bank, nor is that of Quebec. All this 
is to say that the original name, Federal Business  Development 
Bank, is well-known and respected in Canada and Quebec, and 
we do not see why it should be changed. Such a change would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12878"> 12878 </A></B>
<P>
result in a waste of money and energy, given the costs generated 
in terms of paper burden, logos, etc. Again, this change would 
result in useless spending and a waste of energy.
<P>
	The name Business Development Bank of Canada is no better 
than that of Canadian Bank for Small Businesses.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	The second point that deserves criticism, and a fundamental 
one, is the change of mandate implied by the so-called 
maintenance of the Federal Bank, which is becoming the 
Business Development Bank of Canada. This is being done 
without debate or consultation. It has come out of nowhere and 
is not based on any mandate. Nobody asked the federal 
government to change the name of the Federal Business 
Development Bank. This is done in a routine manner, on the sly, 
by administrative means, the way this government likes to do 
things; and that may be the Canada of the future, where things 
will be done in a routine manner, on the sly. They have come up 
with this proposal that has nothing to do with what the 
proceedings of the Standing Committee on Industry, of which I 
am the vice-chairman, led us to expect. There was no 
recommendation to that effect.
<P>
	Previously, the Federal Business Development Bank had a 
very specific mandate as the last resort for small and medium 
size businesses. Its primary concern was the development of 
small and medium size businesses, as stated in section 20(1)(b) 
which specified that the borrowing legal entity could get a loan 
if: ``credit or other financial resources are not otherwise 
available to that person on reasonable terms and conditions''.
<P>
	That is what led the Federal Bank to be described as a last 
resort bank. After one or two refusals at the hands of lending 
institutions, the borrower, provided it had a good record, could 
get a loan from the FBDB, once those conditions were met.
<P>
	At that time, the federal bank was concerned only with 
economic development through the assistance provided to small 
and medium size businesses. As we can see in subclause 4(2) of 
the Business Development Bank of Canada Act, the purpose of 
the bank will now be to support Canadian entrepreneurship. In 
carrying out its activities, the bank must give particular 
consideration to the needs of small businesses.
<P>
	What is being proposed is a far cry from the last resort bank 
totally dedicated to small businesses development in Canada. 
As we will see later on with my colleagues, the scope of the 
bank's activities is being extended. Clauses 20 and 21 of the bill 
allow outright interference in everything related to development 
in Canada, at the expense of provincial governments, and more 
particularly the Quebec government, by promoting regional 
development in Quebec's stead by way of  unconstitutional or 
virtually unconstitutional dealings, with Quebec parties.
<P>
	We already know the Canadian government will try to entice 
Quebec institutions and companies by telling them: if you want 
our money, you should ask an equal amount from the Quebec 
government; if it refuses, that will put an end to our 
involvement. We can see through that kind of trickery, specially 
on the eve of the referendum.
<P>
	If Quebecers vote no at the next referendum, it is that kind of 
centralist instrument that will be used in the Canada of the 
future.
<P>
	With Bill C-91, the bank will not be a last resort bank but a 
complementary lender to other traditional banks on the market. 
It will be empowered to make agreements with any organization 
to become its agent in order to provide services, programs, and 
financing. It will also be allowed to set up lending consortiums. 
This is a far cry from the development of small businesses. 
Those lending consortiums could include both private and 
public partners.
<P>
	We think that the complementary role of the Business 
Development Bank of Canada should be limited to filling the 
gaps on the market and thus improving the situation. We should 
specify that its primary role and mandate is to meet the needs of 
small business, as is said in the act.
<P>
	Before I conclude, I would like to touch briefly on the new 
so-called hybrid capital instruments. That means that the 
federal bank will be able to tap private capital instead of relying 
solely on government funds, as it has up to now.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Nowhere is it mentioned that, in order to attract private 
capital, there will be a fixed rate of return. So, the new bank may 
have to focus on profit maximization in order to provide the 
most interesting rates of return possible. This will mean a 
complete turnaround for the new bank, since the old one had 
fixed rates and could focus solely on economic development.
<P>
	I want to draw the attention of members to clause 36 that 
provides for the confidentiality of the information held by the 
bank. It says that the bank has to protect the information it 
gathers.
<P>
	Members have to remember that the committee recommended 
that information be systematically gathered from all financial 
institutions in Canada under the direction of the Bank of 
Canada, Statistics Canada and the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions. This bill will hopefully include a provision in order 
for the new bank to co-operate in inquiries supported by 
Parliament.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12879"> 12879 </A></B>
<P>
	By the way, I see that the Bankers' Association is against the 
bill, which is a good indication that the government has some 
very concrete plans in mind. We all know that the Liberal 
government and the bankers usually agree, but not this time. 
Why? Probably because the government has some other 
motives that are political and not economic, especially where 
the province of Quebec is concerned, in order first to influence 
the referendum and then to be the only one in charge of 
economic development in Canada, hence building a centralized 
and increasingly unitary state.
<P>
	These are some of the reasons why we will vote against this 
bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would like to take a 
moment to remind the House that pursuant to Standing Order 73, 
under which we are presently conducting our affairs, members 
have 10 minutes for their interventions, without questions or 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to participate in the debate. Once again I am 
moved to ask myself the rhetorical question: What is it about 
getting elected that makes venture capitalists out of us all? What 
is it about getting elected that makes us feel we should be 
imposing our collective wisdom on the private sector? I would 
like to address my short remarks at this juncture to that basic 
premise.
<P>
	When those of us in this body get together to deliberate, to 
create laws and entities, the overriding principle we should 
have, is this: Government should not be involved in any 
enterprise which is being carried out or could be carried out by 
private enterprise. We have no business, in my estimation, 
getting involved in any way, in setting up a crown corporation, 
which is what we are doing, in competition with existing 
businesses.
<P>
	We may not like the banks. Canadians may not get up in the 
morning and say: ``Thank God we have the Royal Bank'' or 
``Thank God we have the Toronto-Dominion Bank'' or any bank 
for that matter. We already have mature, functioning and very 
capable banking institutions.
<P>
	In the context of what the establishment of a crown 
corporation in the financial sector will do to enhance the 
competitiveness of Canadian business, to promote 
entrepreneurship, to be an incubator of new business, or in any 
way enhance the standard of living in Canada, we will find that 
the legislation falls far short of the mark. All it does is create one 
more bureaucratic organization.
<P>
	Having said that, I do not fault the rationale or the thinking 
behind the initial desire to do this. Not too long ago the people of 
Ontario and Quebec, in particular, found that the heavy hand of 
recession dealt a vital and terrible blow to the entrepreneur and 
to the people involved in the business sector, particularly the 
small business sector. In the west particularly in Alberta, we felt 
that about 10 or 12 years earlier.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	The industry committee, in its report dealing with small 
business which we worked on for months and months and 
months, the whole idea was to make the banking institutions in 
Canada far more responsive to the needs of Canadian business, 
small business in particular. Then what is it about this new 
expanded Federal Business Development Bank that is going to 
change all that?
<P>
	The role of opposition is to oppose legislation preferred by the 
government. The intent is to make the legislation better, to point 
out weaknesses in the government's legislation. Looking at it 
from that perspective and looking at this legislation and the 
rationale behind the change in the Federal Business 
Development Bank, we would first have to ask what the mandate 
is.
<P>
	Looking at it from the devil's advocate point of view, what is 
the mandate of the new Federal Business Development Bank, 
renamed the Business Development Bank of Canada? According 
to a news release under the minister's hand the mandate of the 
new bank is to develop and deliver innovative responses to small 
business financing and managerial needs. If ever there was a 
motherhood statement, that has got to be it. How could we 
possibly argue with such a motherhood statement?
<P>
	I am a small businessman. The Reform Party is 100 per cent 
behind the notion of incubating, helping and working with small 
business. However we are not in the business of competing with 
existing businesses, even if those competing and existing 
businesses are, God forbid, banks. Banks already exist.
<P>
	There is no need for Canadian taxpayers, however tenuously, 
to be supporting or propping up yet another crown corporation 
which is what this new entity will be. We are at this very moment 
trying to get rid of crown corporations. There is the privatization 
of CN and the recent privatization of Air Canada. Why on earth 
would we want to set up a crown corporation in the banking 
sector?
<P>
	I have already covered the point that there are many people in 
Canada represented by this side of the House, and I am sure 
many people in Canada represented by the people opposite, who 
feel that we should not be reinventing the wheel. We should not 
be putting our energies into creating something that already 
exists.
<P>
	Then the question is: Will this new entity do something 
different? I tried to find out if it would or would not. I went into 
the historical record. A speech was delivered to the Board of 
Trade of metropolitan Montreal on October 25, 1994 by Mr. 
François Beaudoin. Mr. Beaudoin is now the president and chief 
executive officer of the new Business Development Bank. He 
quite accurately pointed out that there are three developing 
sectors of our economy that need attention: export markets, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12880"> 12880 </A></B>
<P>
new economy, and working capital.  He said that these are three 
areas in which business really needs some significant support.
<P>
	He makes the case that 85 per cent of Canada's exports are 
generated by only 900 businesses. Only 900 businesses in 
Canada represent 85 per cent of our total exports. The majority 
of our total exports is in lumber and cars. That very clearly 
identifies the fact that we should have far more emphasis in our 
country on entrepreneurial zeal in exporting. What then is this 
new bank going to do that the Export Development Bank does 
not already do? We already have the Export Development Bank. 
Its mandate is to do exactly that.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	That portion of the business development bank's new mandate 
that has as its central purpose the incubation and education of 
entrepreneurs is something we can support very handily. This 
new bank is to be nothing more than a bigger, broader 
representation of the bank which is already in place.
<P>
	The legislation allows the federally funded crown corporation 
business development bank which is eventually backed by the 
Government of Canada to have as an asset base almost $20 
billion. The total small business portfolio of all the banks in 
Canada combined is something in the region of $40 billion. 
According to the banks, there is more money available than 
there are people asking for it, based on quality loans.
<P>
	The last thing in the world we want is the situation whereby 
the existing banks in Canada are able to tell people who ask them 
for a loan: ``Hey, we think you have a great idea but it is a little 
risky for us. Why not go over to the new business development 
bank and ask it for the money?'' Therefore, the government is 
going to absorb the responsibility and liability for all these loans 
which should rightfully go to the chartered banks. They are the 
ones that exist in Canada and have the utility, ability and the 
experience to do everything that is already being done. Our role 
is to make sure they do the job. Our role is not to put together a 
complementary lender.
<P>
	One area the Federal Business Development Bank wants to 
get involved in is providing working capital loans based on 
receivables and inventory. Well, where has it been? Does every 
bank not extend operating loans based on receivables and 
inventory?
<P>
	In the vast majority of loans existing with the Federal 
Business Development Bank today, 53 per cent are in loans of 
$100,000 to $500,000. The loan portfolio for loans of less than 
$25,000 for the Federal Business Development Bank which is 
really the incubator of small business is 1.2 per cent of its total 
portfolio. Writing these small loans is very risky and very 
expensive. Of course, the banks do not want to do it. However, 
we in the House should be very careful that we do not increase 
the liability to individual Canadian taxpayers just so we can 
make it easier for the banks to slough off their responsibility to 
the government funded bank.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to support Bill C-91, the Business Development Bank of 
Canada Act. The legislation represents the next step in the 
evolution of an institution that has a long and honourable 
tradition of helping Canadian business respond to the changing 
demands of the economy.
<P>
	Fifty-one years ago the industrial development bank was 
created to help wartime manufacturers convert their facilities 
for peacetime operations. These businesses needed special 
attention because it was virtually impossible for them to obtain 
term loans. At that time chartered banks were prohibited by the 
Bank Act for making loans against mortgage security.
<P>
	The majority of IDB loans during its early years went to 
companies such as machine shops, sawmills, textile and 
garment factories, flour mills and auto parts manufacturers. In 
other words, the bank responded to the emerging industries of 
the day in a nation that was converting its wartime industrial 
capacity to new challenges.
<P>
	As the nation's economy changed, so did the nature of the 
bank's customers. The business community began to respond to 
new opportunities of the post-war boom and the bank began to 
lend to wholesalers, retailers, restaurants and the hotel industry 
among others.
<P>
	In the 1950s and 1960s the bank began to open branches in 
non-metropolitan areas of the country. This was a bold move at 
the time. The chartered banks followed the experiment with a 
great deal of interest. By the end of its second decade, the IDB 
had 22 branches across the country.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In 1971, the bank began to give businesses regular advice on 
how to run their operations efficiently. The bank became the 
only national organization to provide management services, 
such as consulting, training and planning, to small businesses.
<P>
	In 1975, the Federal Business Development Bank was created 
as a crown corporation. Since then, businesses could no longer 
rely on government grants to execute their bank transactions. 
The new agency also decided to take up the challenge of 
providing risk capital to entrepreneurs. Today, the bank has 
offices in all provinces and territories. It employs 900 people 
who furnish financial as well as management services to 
Canadian small and medium size businesses.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12881"> 12881 </A></B>
<P>
	Last year, the bank's share financing increased by 45 per 
cent, for a total of $80 million. As the years went by, the bank 
acquired an excellent reputation in the field of customer 
services. According to the most recent survey, 97 per cent of 
the bank's customers said that they would deal again with the 
bank and the same proportion of customers said that they would 
recommend the bank to other people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It has become apparent that the FBDB must continue to evolve 
to meet the changing demands of the economy. This need to 
change has been widely discussed. In its report ``Taking Care of 
Small Business'', the Standing Committee on Industry 
recommended that the mandate of the FBDB be ``refocused as a 
complementary lender to small and medium sized businesses 
and that it be authorized to use new financial instruments to 
fulfil its mandate''.
<P>
	The small business working committee emphasized that 
government sponsored programs should be refocused to fill 
financing gaps that are not now served adequately by the private 
sector. Among its recommendations are the following: ``To 
enforce the FBDB's mandate to ensure that its activities are 
filling the financing gaps, and funding small businesses in all 
regions of the country including those associated with small and 
micro businesses requiring loans of less than $100,000, as well 
as addressing gaps in regional and sectoral lending and working 
capital requirements''. The committee stated: ``These 
objectives should be pursued on a full cost recovery basis''.
<P>
	The Federal Business Development Bank Act has not been 
amended since originally passed in 1974. It requires updating to 
reflect market developments such as the use of financial 
instruments that had not been invented in 1974. Moreover, the 
bank is now operating at near its statutory ceiling and financial 
ratios. To respond to forecasted business volume we need to act 
quickly to provide the legislated authority to increase the bank's 
equity. If the statutory lending cap is not changed soon, the bank 
could be forced to ration credit to businesses in the near future.
<P>
	Under its proposed expanded mandate the Business 
Development Bank of Canada will be better positioned and 
equipped to address the specific needs of small business through 
innovative financing. It will operate where market forces fail to 
provide access to financing for promising business ventures.
<P>
	Under its new mandate the bank will continue to be active in 
smaller loans and investments in its lending and venture capital 
programs. It will increase quasi-equity and working capital 
financings. It will also focus more on knowledge based firms 
without abandoning its traditional activities.
<P>
	The Business Development Bank of Canada Act will provide 
the bank with the ability and resources to keep abreast of 
changing requirements at a time when the  small business 
community in Canada needs the flexibility the bank can offer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am glad to rise in the House to talk about Bill C-91, which aims 
at changing the function and mandate of the Federal Business 
Development Bank and at renaming it the Business 
Development Bank of Canada.
<P>
	I have a few questions to ask about the bill. It is a bit 
disturbing because the Federal Business Development Bank as 
we know it works very well.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	I met its president in Quebec City. As we know, the Bank 
lends almost one third of its money-about $1.3 billion-in 
Quebec. Finally, it serves very well its purpose of bank of last 
resort. Moreover, the Federal Business Development Bank, as it 
is now, gives training courses for people who want to start new 
businesses. These are excellent courses and many Quebec 
entrepreneurs have taken them. Right now, the bank is 
self-financing and does not cost Canadian taxpayers one penny.
<P>
	Nonetheless, Bill C-91 will change the mandate of the bank 
and radically transform its capital structure. The bank now has a 
statutory borrowing limit of about $3.2 billion but it is proposed 
to eliminate that limit and to allow the new bank to borrow as 
much as it wants. I will come back to that later. This change in 
the capital structure is disturbing because it will allow the bank 
to enter into partnership with other organizations and other 
banks.
<P>
	The capital structure and the mandate of the bank will be 
changed completely. Right now, the bank is a last resort lender. 
It makes loans to business people who cannot borrow from 
commercial banks via the usual channels. There is a real need 
for that kind of service. But the Federal Business Development 
Bank will not necessarily have this last resort mandate any 
longer since the new mandate will require the FBDB to support 
other projects through partnerships or through top-up funding. 
This compromises its original mandate which was to offer last 
resort funding to businesses.
<P>
	This is quite disturbing because one has to wonder who will 
do this job if the Federal Business Development Bank is no 
longer doing it. If the FBDB changes its mandate and works 
increasingly in partnership with other banks, who will take over 
the mandate that is presently carried out so efficiently by the 
Federal Business Development Bank? It is just as though all last 
resort cases will be ignored.
<P>
	But the most troubling question regarding this bill relates to 
the government's motive for introducing it. Why is the 
government proposing to change the bank's capital structure and 
mandate? Why is it removing the loan ceiling and telling the 
bank not to be a last resort lending institution any longer but to 
go into partnership with other banks and other agencies in 
projects related  mainly to small and medium size businesses 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12882"> 12882 </A></B>
<P>
and exports? There are good reasons for trying to find out the 
motive for such changes.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Do we really want to help small and medium size businesses 
or do we want to compete with existing financial institutions? 
We have to ask the question because this bill allows the Federal 
Business Development Bank, under its new mandate, to 
compete directly with existing financial institutions. It is 
troubling.
<P>
	In fact, should the federal government compete with the 
private sector? The government has already made such an 
attempt in another bill, Bill C-52 brought forward by the 
Minister of Public Works, giving itself the power to compete 
directly with engineering and architecture firms. Strangely 
enough, this bill was withdrawn when we started to criticize the 
government after realizing that these engineering and 
architecture firms were concentrated in Quebec. We realized 
that 90 per cent of the businesses that the government would 
compete with were located in Quebec, and that is why the bill 
was withdrawn.
<P>
	But the government is at it again, giving the Federal Business 
Development Bank a similar but broader mandate since we are 
no longer talking about one sector, engineering and architecture, 
but almost any kind of partnership for economic development. 
And anybody who takes the time to read the definition of the 
mandate in clauses 20 and 21 will see that it is very broad. There 
are no limits to this new bank's mandate.
<P>
	This is what is troubling, because we know that some of the 
best examples of the growth of small and medium size 
businesses in Canada have been in Quebec. It is well known that, 
if there is one sector in Quebec that has distinguished itself, and 
is on the cutting edge, it is the small and medium size business 
sector.
<P>
	We have established funds in Quebec for the development of 
small and medium size business, such as the solidarity funds of 
the FTQ and the CNTU, and a number of programs, such as those 
of the caisses populaires. It is a very active sector. Why, then, is 
Canada changing the mandate of the Federal Business 
Development Bank in order to enter this sector? Does it want to 
compete with Quebec's caisses populaires? Does it want to 
compete with the solidarity funds of the FTQ and the CNTU?
<P>
	Ultimately, can it overstep the authority of the province, 
which has already established a regional development program, 
in order to once again increase the visibility of the federal 
government in Quebec, as it has done elsewhere in Canada 
furthermore, but particularly in Quebec? Is there a hidden 
agenda in this bill, a deliberate wish to weaken the many 
programs that have been established in Quebec by the banks and 
the solidarity funds, as well as the programs established by the 
Quebec government itself?
<P>
	These are some of the questions that come to mind with 
respect to Bill C-91. There is no compelling need for the Federal 
Business Development Bank to have a new mandate, when the 
one it now has is perfectly sufficient. One could wonder whether 
beyond the economic purpose of this bill there is not another 
deeper political purpose. That, in fact, is why I personally will 
not support this bill. Basically, the purpose of this bill is a purely 
political one. Coming from Quebec, from the riding of 
Québec-Est, I can see that the Federal Business Development 
Bank, this new bank, holds nothing for us. It would be better to 
keep it in its present form.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are debating whether Bill C-91 should be referred 
to the committee before second reading. In many ways that is 
positive in the sense that it opens up the debate and allows 
elements to be raised which would otherwise be restricted 
because of the conventions of the House. I hope that will be the 
case and that it will not be a way to circumscribe or limit certain 
amendments or debate which might otherwise receive the light 
of day in the House.
<P>
	I have concerns about Bill C-91 which we ought to look at 
before we submit it to committee. Changing the name of this 
bank I do not think will change anything at all. It will cost a lot 
of money to print new stationery, to put up all the new signs and 
all those things. What will changing the name do to the actual 
purpose, function and operation of the bank? I submit it will do 
nothing.
<P>
	It sets up a crown corporation which has as its capitalization 
part a number of instruments which are being used. It has 
common shares which have a par value of $100. It has preferred 
shares which are unlimited in number, as are the common 
shares. The preferred shares have no par value. Hybrid capital 
instruments will be part of the capitalization. These will be paid 
in capital by the Parliament of Canada by a parliamentary 
appropriation but there will be no indication as to how much. 
There will be retained earnings and contributed surplus to a 
maximum of $1.5 billion.
<P>
	There are other provisions which I will draw to the attention 
of the House, particularly sections 21 and 22, specifically 
section 22(e). Section 22 includes the ancillary powers but 
section 22(e) is particularly interesting. The bank may acquire, 
hold, exchange, lease, sell or otherwise dispose of any interest 
in real or personal property and retain and use the proceeds of 
disposition. That kind of provision raises some very interesting 
questions. How much real estate will the new business 
development bank of Canada be prepared to buy? What will it do 
with that real estate? Will it deviate from its traditional role, 
which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12883"> 12883 </A></B>
<P>
has been to lease real property in which it carries on its business, 
or will it develop a series of branches throughout the country?
<P>
	Other sections of the bill also give to the board, to the 
Minister of Finance and to the cabinet powers which rightfully 
belong to the Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	Section 27 gives some very specific powers to the board:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Subject to the approval of the governor in council on the recommendation of 
the Minister of Finance, the board may make bylaws</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) setting out the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to 
preferred shares, creating one or more additional classes of preferred shares 
and generally determining the rights and obligations of the holders of 
preferred shares, including</BLOCKQUOTE>
(i) limiting the right of the shareholders to specific dividends or repayments, 
whether fixed or variable,
<P>
(ii) authorizing the purchase or redemption of the shares by the bank, either 
at the bank's option or at the shareholder's request, and
<P>
(iii) limiting or extending the rights of the shareholders in any other way;
<P>
	That is the second class of shares which makes up the capital 
of this bank, which really gives to the board the authority to 
determine how the bank shall be structured. That kind of power 
ought not to be given to a cabinet. It ought to exist with 
Parliament because this bank through the Minister of Finance 
and the cabinet, given this provision, allows that group to create 
a liability of $18 billion for the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	Who is the shareholder talked about in section 27? The 
shareholder is the Government of Canada. The Government of 
Canada now will be told it may or may not own these preferred 
shares. It may or may not be paid a dividend. It may be paid this 
much of a dividend or this little of a dividend. That becomes the 
issue.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Other provisions of the bill ought to be of direct interest to 
each of us. In particular, I would like to look at subsections 18(4) 
and (6).
<P>
	Subsection 18(4) states that the bank may enter into any 
transactions for the financial management of the bank, 
including any financial instrument of financial risk such as 
interest rate or currency exchange agreements, options, futures 
contracts and any other similar agreements.
<P>
	Another way of looking at this is that these are derivatives. It 
permits the personnel of the bank to enter into futures contracts, 
options, purchasing and selling of options with public money 
which should be considered a sacred trust. If we look at the way 
the options market operates and the futures contracts work it 
means the bank is speculating with Canadian money or has the 
opportunity to do so.
<P>
	I am sure the argument will be presented that it will use this 
only for purposes of hedging interest rate and currency 
fluctuations. If the bill specified that there were limitations one 
might not have such grave concern. Because there are no 
limitations it does not prevent the manager or the president or 
whoever is in charge from getting into the market directly. It 
should be a major concern to all of us. Just remember what 
happened in the Barings bank.
<P>
	Other sections of the bill should give us grave concern. The 
designated minister is identified in section 21. Who is the 
designated minister? At the moment it is the Minister of 
Industry. It is possible that cabinet could designate any other 
minister. For example, FORD-Q is one of the regional 
development portfolios. We heard the Minister of Industry say 
this morning that one of the purposes of the new mandate is to 
expand it so that it would include regional development and 
things of that sort.
<P>
	Would it not be interesting if for certain matters the Minister 
of Human Resources Development were designated as the 
minister of the bank and could direct the bank? In another 
instance it could be the minister of FORD-Q and in a third 
instance it could be the Minister of Industry and so on down the 
line. There is nothing in the bill to prevent that sort of thing from 
happening.
<P>
	The obvious questions we have to ask is what can this bank do 
that the other banks cannot do. What can the other banks do that 
the this bank cannot do? If it is none of those things and this bank 
is doing nothing more or less than what the other banks are 
doing, what in the world are we doing this for?
<P>
	Some specific arguments ought to be addressed as well. The 
indication is that this bank shall be complementary to the 
existing financial institutions, particularly the banks. Then the 
bill does not define the word ``complementary''. The only 
reference in the proposed bill that deals with the previous act is 
that complementary is taken as that section which deals with the 
previous section saying that it must be the bank of last resort. In 
other words, the applicant has to be refused by some other 
institution before he can apply for money here.
<P>
	Does complementary mean that it will make loans of an 
operational capital requirement? Does it mean that it will 
become a deposit taking institution? What will the Business 
Development Bank of Canada do that other banks do not? I 
submit that it will do nothing more or less than is currently 
available in the marketplace and it is not required.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12884"> 12884 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to throw out two more questions. First, will the bank 
be able to expand its network of offices? Second, which is more 
important, is: What is a hybrid capital instrument? It is not 
defined in the bill. When asked what this means certain officials 
were unable to answer that question but more significantly than 
that hybrid financial instruments are different from any other 
capitalization that is provided for in the other sections of the 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	The other one says that common shares, preferred shares and 
hybrid capital instruments are not given to the government but 
may be given to private individuals or persons other than the 
government. What does it mean?
<P>
	We must answer these questions before the bill is presented 
seriously to the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to contribute to the debate on sending Bill C-91 to 
committee before second reading.
<P>
	Before that however I would like to address a couple of 
statements made by the hon. member from Edmonton who 
questioned the need of the FBD bank and indicated in his earlier 
remarks that when there are already banks out there servicing 
the community, do we need this?
<P>
	I want to address those concerns because it is a fair question. 
The very existence of this bank shows that the present banking 
system does not meet the needs of small and medium sized 
businesses. If it did, we would not need it. The present banks do 
not service the financial requirements, sometimes the operating 
line, and other needs.
<P>
	As a small business person I and the hon. member who was 
also in small business, know that there are a lot of good ideas out 
there that often do not get financing, that do not get the funds or 
the financial support from the community. For example, small 
businesses may start as one or two person operations and expand 
to become 100 and 200 person operations. As a government we 
always have to look into the long term. We have to ensure that 
we have a financial infrastructure to provide small business 
people with the opportunities to expand and to create new 
opportunities and employment.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, it is the small businesses that are 
creating the jobs right now. We want to make sure that the 
infrastructure is there for them to continue to do that. He will 
know that many times many good ideas get lost because they are 
not financed.
<P>
	We can bury our heads in the sand and say: ``Everything is 
fine. Everything is great out there. Every businessman, small or 
medium, will be able to get financing. They will be able to get 
the money when they need it for a very good idea that has great 
opportunities,'' but that is not the reality.
<P>
	Reality is a need for an organization such as the FBDB to 
ensure the financing of those ideas that exist, that have a future, 
that have potential. The government understands there is 
tremendous opportunity not only in the short term but in the long 
term to create employment and to create a strong, dynamic, 
vibrant economy. That is what we have to do as a government.
<P>
	We cannot stick our heads in the sand and say: ``Everything is 
fine. We will leave it up to the big banks. We will leave it up to 
the financial institutions. They will take care of small business. 
They will do all the funding. They will fund the new 
opportunities in the new economies''. That is not reality.
<P>
	Innovation has always been the hallmark of the Federal 
Business Development Bank. The secret of a bank's success has 
been the close co-operation it has enjoyed with entrepreneurs 
across the country. The bank has been able to stay abreast of 
rapidly evolving markets and major trends such as the use of 
information technology. It has always sought ways to offer new 
services tailored to meet the increasing, complex needs of 
entrepreneurs.
<P>
	For example, a year ago the FBDB introduced a $50 million 
financing program called working capital for growth. The hon. 
member knows that one of the problems small businesses have is 
getting working capital which is very important for their success 
and growth.
<P>
	Hon. members will recall that last year, the economy was 
starting to gain momentum. For many businesses the new 
opportunities were not matched by sufficient cash flow after 
several years of a recession. They lacked sufficient cash to 
finance the opportunities that arose.
<P>
	The FBDB created its working capital for growth loans that 
top up financing when conventional lending institutions that the 
hon. member said would be able to provide these do not offer 
sufficient lines of credit to support a company's growth.
<P>
	In addition, FBDB business counsellors work with business 
owners to ensure that their growth plan is well managed. The 
maximum loan amount under this program is $100,000 and 
repayment schedules are flexible and tailored to individual 
needs.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	Another example of innovation by the FBDB is the pilot 
program called patient capital where returns take a long time 
and where the return is not over a year or two years but a much 
longer time. It responds to the needs of companies that do not 
have the necessary financial resources to service debt during 
their development stages. This is a problem particularly for new 
companies in the knowledge based economy that may not have 
tangible assets to offer as security.
<P>
	These knowledge based economies have incredible barriers to 
financing because they are difficult to assess. It is very difficult 
for many bank managers to look at anything but basic fixed, 
hard, tangible assets and assess  the knowledge based assets, the 
engineering, design and all the software knowledge. It is so hard 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12885"> 12885 </A></B>
<P>
to grasp the value of that and are very difficult to finance. They 
do not have tangible assets to offer as security and therefore 
financing is difficult.
<P>
	The FBDB offers patient capital in quasi-equity forms of 
financing which provides firms with long term capital on 
flexible repayment terms. The repayment of patient capital can 
be postponed for up to three years until a company begins to 
generate revenues and a royalty on sales can be arranged.
<P>
	The bank has been pilot testing this patient capital program in 
Kitchener-Waterloo in co-operation with the Royal Bank and 
Innovation Ontario. We hope that the test will prove successful 
so that the FDBD can begin to offer this service across the 
country. In this way the bank will help to close what the Minister 
of Industry has referred to as the flexibility gap, one of the four 
critical gaps that prevents small business from obtaining the 
financing they need.
<P>
	The flexibility gap refers to the problems small businesses 
encounter when conventional lenders require a stream of 
payment over the term of the loan. This can be impractical, for 
example, for viable firms in the product development stages 
which are not yet generating a mature cash flow.
<P>
	The FBDB has already demonstrated innovative solutions by 
providing quasi-equity financing approaches through long term 
loans with flexible repayment requirements. This is what 
Canada's small business communities need to obtain their 
capital requirements and the FBDB is leading the way.
<P>
	The other four gaps that the minister described have also been 
addressed by the FBDB. Hon. members will recall that he spoke 
of the risk gap. Conventional financial institutions, to which the 
member would like to leave everything, are reluctant to set an 
interest rate for high risk, smaller term loans that would 
compensate them for increased risk. They tend to adopt 
self-imposed ceilings with respect to the rates that are charged.
<P>
	This has advantages for companies that are able to secure 
financing. They will rarely pay more than the prime plus 2 per 
cent. But many companies will be willing to pay higher rates in 
acknowledgement of the increased risk the lender is taking.
<P>
	A third structural weakness in the conventional financing 
requirements in Canada the minister has described as the size 
gap. I am sure many hon. members who have been involved in 
business know about this. It is a result of the overhead costs that 
a lender must incur in administering any loan, whether large or 
small. The administrative costs associated with loans are similar 
for the lender, whether it is a $50,000 loan or a $5 million loan. 
Comparing the profits that the lending institution can make by 
providing the two loans, there is no question that a conventional 
lending institution tends to serve its larger customers first.
<P>
	In Canada today we can point to hundreds of examples of 
small customers who have grown to become big customers. The 
$50,000 loan of today may become the $5 million loan of 
tomorrow. The FBDB has been created precisely to respond to 
the needs of the smaller customer.
<P>
	The fourth gap in lending institutions the minister has 
referred to is the knowledge gap. It is carefully interrelated to 
each of the other gaps but has a particular emphasis on what the 
lender understands about the nature of the new economy.
<P>
	How does the lender take into account the assets that leave the 
building each night? I am referring to the human assets, the 
ingenuity, the creativity of engineers, the vision of the design 
teams, the basic entrepreneurial skills of the owners? In the 
knowledge economy these are perhaps the most valuable assets 
of all.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	How can lenders assess the viability of new forms of 
enterprise? By what standards can they compare the economic 
performance of young companies in the newly emerging field of 
environmental technologies? For example, how can they 
measure the potential benefits and risks of a new software 
design?
<P>
	Industries emerging in the new economy have trouble 
securing appropriate financing because they are knowledge 
based and may not possess assets that could be realized in the 
event of a default.
<P>
	The team at the FBDB has made it its business to understand 
the needs of the new economy. Its clients have evolved with 
changes to Canada's industrial base. It is precisely because 
those gaps do exist under the present situation that we need the 
FBDB. That is why I am supporting this bill; to ensure small and 
medium size businesses that we have the infrastructure to fulfil 
their financial needs and create more jobs for Canadians and 
greater opportunity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleagues before me did a good job explaining the subject 
matter of Bill C-91. Therefore, I will only say that it is mainly 
aimed at transforming the Federal Business Development Bank, 
commonly known as the FBDB, into the Business Development 
Bank of Canada.
<P>
	To create this new entity, the government is not amending the 
Federal Business Development Bank Act; it is introducing a new 
piece of legislation, Bill C-91.
<P>
	I will deal with three aspects of this bill. The mandate of the 
FBDB, as we know it, will be extended. Consequently, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12886"> 12886 </A></B>
<P>
modified FBDB will no longer be solely a financial institution 
geared to last resort funding. From now on, the new Business 
Development Bank of Canada will be able to provide 
complementary funding to other financial institutions.
<P>
	Second, it will now be easier for the Business Development 
Bank of Canada to enter into agreements with public and private 
partners, either at the federal or provincial level, to set up 
financing syndicates.
<P>
	Third, the bank will have financial instruments, such as 
shares, which will enable it to increase its capital without 
depending on government funds.
<P>
	I will therefore focus on the disastrous consequences of this 
amendment on regional development. Unfortunately, it would 
appear that, under the guise of regional development, Bill C-91 
is the new way the federal government has found to once again 
interfere in provincial affairs.
<P>
	As in many other areas, it has not been clearly established 
whether regional development is a provincial or a federal 
responsibility. Some provinces, such as Quebec, have long 
demanded exclusive powers in this area. As you might expect, 
the federal government has always refused to recognize regional 
development as a strictly provincial responsibility.
<P>
	At each round of constitutional negotiations, this claim was 
summarily rejected. However, under Quebec-Canada 
framework agreements the federal government had made a 
commitment to the Quebec government to limit its regional 
interventions.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	The Economic and Regional Development Agreement for 
Quebec came to an end in December 1994 and the federal 
government refused to renew it. Clauses 20 and 21 of the bill 
will make the Business Development Bank of Canada more 
visible in the outlying regions since it will have the authority to 
sign agreements directly with other federal departments, 
regional agencies like the conseils régionaux de développement, 
and, eventually, with the corporations de développement 
économique and even with individuals.
<P>
	If the bank can deal directly with local stakeholders, it could 
have a negative impact on provincial strategic plans since it 
could induce the CRDs to model their priorities on Ottawa in 
order to get money. Therefore, the bill disregards the joint 
efforts made by the provincial governments and the local 
business community. Once again the federal government comes 
trampling in, saying: ``Make way, here we come with our 
spending power!''
<P>
	Let me remind you that this famous spending power has given 
the federal government a debt which now stands at $550 billion. 
Let me remind you also that this $550 billion debt has been 
accumulated largely, if not totally, over the last 25 years. And 
except for a period of nine years, who were the leaders of this 
country during those last 25 years? We all know that the Liberal 
Party of Canada was in office during those years. That is what 
spending power gives us. They meddle in everything and often 
spend ill-advisedly. Just look at the facts. In the present case, a 
simple name change will cost Canadian taxpayers millions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez: </B>It is a disgrace.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> This is indeed a disgrace. What is 
even more regrettable is that the federal will, once more, impose 
the same medicine to all the regions of Canada. Well-meaning 
civil servants will decide, from Ottawa, what is good for the 
regions and other civil servants, also well-meaning, will apply 
the decisions made in Ottawa.
<P>
	Decentralization is presented as the way of the future but Bill 
C-91 shows that the federal government has no use for 
regionalization. The Government of Quebec is trying to 
decentralize certain powers and give regions the money they 
need to exercise them. Bill C-91 goes blindly in the opposite 
direction. At a time of cuts, when money is getting scarce, with 
Bill C-91 the federal government is opting for a less cost 
effective solution simply because it will get increased visibility. 
This is very sad for taxpayers.
<P>
	The federal government would rather withdraw from social 
programs and use taxpayers' money to intrude needlessly on 
Quebec structures designed to deal with small and medium size 
businesses. These political choices are not made in the interests 
of regions but rather in the interests of the federal government. 
Therefore, I will oppose Bill C-91 because I respect the work 
done by the Government of Quebec and by regional 
stakeholders, and because I also respect the choices they have 
made. Using these means to foster the popularity of the federal 
government among the people cannot be justified.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	I could mention all the duplications that are already costing 
taxpayers so much because they always end up paying the bill 
through their municipal, school, provincial and federal taxes. 
Let us take for example manpower training. It should come 
under provincial jurisdiction. Yet, because of this duplication, 
the federal government spent needlessly, in Quebec alone, $265 
million in administrative costs. We are literally stepping on each 
others toes.
<P>
	I have no objection to the federal government meddling in 
provincial affairs. It can show off its spending power all it 
wants. But it should start by paying its own debts. We had to 
fight, in this House, to obtain that the federal government pay its 
share of the 1992 referendum, a promise made by the previous 
Prime Minister that the present Prime Minister wanted to renege 
on.
<P>
	The native crisis in Quebec cost hundreds of millions of 
dollars and we are still negotiating the federal government's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12887"> 12887 </A></B>
<P>
share. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, rest assured that the Bloc 
Quebecois will oppose this bill that we consider totally useless.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
very interested in the comments of the hon. member for 
Vancouver South in response to the speech of my colleague from 
Edmonton Southwest. He said the Liberals feel we have to have 
a financial infrastructure to create a strong, vibrant and dynamic 
economy. That is exactly the problem with Canada at this point. 
The Liberals today feel the way they have felt for the last 25 
years, that if the government does not do it then probably it will 
not happen.
<P>
	The Liberals consistently are coming forward with legislation 
like this which will interfere even further in the affairs of 
ordinary Canadians in its own small insidious way.
<P>
	I will speak about this issue from the point of view of what I 
call coffee shop common sense. There is a real vacuum of talk in 
the Chamber which comes from the common sense that we hear 
from Canadians as they gather in coffee shops, in their living 
rooms or around their kitchen tables at home. There is very little 
talk using the ordinary English or French used there. We always 
seem to end up hearing speeches from people using wonderful 
75 cent words to describe dead end situations.
<P>
	I suggest to my friend from Vancouver South that the 
Liberals, when using this act along with other acts to create a 
financial infrastructure, to create a strong, vibrant, dynamic 
economy, might do well to take a look at what capital is and 
where capital comes from.
<P>
	As far as the Liberals are concerned, and many people of that 
thought process, the idea of taxation is to gather in the capital so 
it can be redistributed as the people who supposedly know best 
think it should be.
<P>
	I believe, as do many people in my constituency, the big banks 
are failing small business. There may be a good intention on the 
part of the big banks, and certainly they do a lot of advertising 
and window dressing, but the biggest single problem is there is 
no real competition in the banking industry as it presently sits. I 
would be in favour of our looking at creating a situation, not as 
set out in Bill C-91, but a situation in legislation that would 
create some real competition between banks so that we could 
have a pool of capital.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	We know the big banks are asking to get into non-traditional 
banking services. Of course they have gone into brokerage and 
now they are asking to break into insurance. They are looking at 
the fact that although they have countless billions of dollars 
flowing through their coffers on a day by day basis, nonetheless 
they can extract only a very small percentage of those dollars. 
They are therefore looking to insurance, to brokerage. I do not 
know what is going to come next.
<P>
	The difficulty is that the banks are not in a situation where 
there is real competition so that they have to go out and gain the 
business. I say this on the basis of what I call coffee shop 
common sense. If I were to walk down Baker Street in my 
hometown of Cranbrook, or a street in Invermere, Fernie, 
Creston, Golden, or any of the towns in my constituency, and 
walk into a coffee shop and sit down with the local business 
people and ask what the real problem was that they were having, 
almost invariably they would tell me that the real problem they 
are having is in getting a sufficient amount of working capital. 
They are constantly constrained in the area of capital.
<P>
	This government should really be looking at, and perhaps it 
can be looked at under Bill C-91 in committee, the creation of 
an independent investment pool of real dollars. These would not 
be dollars that are extracted from business by way of a tax grab, 
not dollars that are extracted from individuals by way of a tax 
grab, not money lost under regulation harassment that 
businesses are under these days, but real dollars that people 
would put into an investment pool.
<P>
	Let us look at why businesses are having difficulty 
maintaining a capital base. They pay school tax and municipal 
tax. In many cases they pay water, sewer and garbage collection 
tax and provincial taxes. In my home province of British 
Columbia if a person has the audacity to have too much money, 
and it can be borrowed money invested in equipment in a 
business, that person will be taxed on the money that is invested 
in the items that are actually generating the profits in the first 
place. There is federal income tax.
<P>
	There is the GST compliance costs, which of course we should 
talk very briefly about as a side bar issue. This government came 
to Parliament telling Canadians it was going to be doing away 
with GST and has done nothing. Anyway, there is the GST 
compliance costs and regulation harassment. There are good 
reasons for having municipal, provincial and federal 
regulations, but in many cases the application of those 
regulations for businesses becomes a harassment.
<P>
	Why do many businesses have a problem keeping dollars in 
the business? Let us look at the list. The dollars go out to school 
tax, municipal tax, water, sewer, garbage, provincial tax, federal 
income tax, GST compliance costs and all of those things. It is 
no wonder that small business is having a difficult time 
retaining capital. There is a tax grab by all levels of government 
as they scrounge to find more dollars rather than doing the 
obvious which is to cut down on the expenditures.
<P>
	This bill is going to committee. It is excellent that this bill has 
come to the House and under an agreement between the 
government and the opposition parties will be going into 
committee. There is the opportunity in committee for my very 
competent and capable Reform Party colleagues to bring some 
coffee shop common sense to that committee in order to move 
forward in an  active and proactive way to make something of 
this bill which quite frankly I find to be a little questionable at 
this time. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12888"> 12888 </A></B>
<P>
could bring it forward with the provision that there is no attempt 
on the part of the industry committee to repeat the shenanigans

process has the opportunity to be open, constructive and 
positive. I encourage all members who will be working on that 
committee to be sure that process is capable of happening.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	I say again, the Liberals have the idea that if it is worthwhile 
doing then surely the government has to do it. The Reform Party 
believes that the government should get out of the lives, get out 
of the faces, get out of the pocketbooks of ordinary citizens and 
ordinary businesses and let them get on with doing what they do 
best, which is to make profits, to reinvest them and to get this 
country going.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
talk today to Bill C-91, an Act to continue the Federal Business 
Development Bank under the name Business Development Bank 
of Canada, that was tabled on May 15 by the Minister of 
Industry. According to its drafters, over and above changing its 
name, the bill aims at streamlining the bank and modernizing its 
operations.
<P>
	As we all know, the role of the Federal Business Development 
Bank is to promote and support companies which are starting up 
or at any other stage of development. It was created in 1944 
under the name Industrial Development Bank. In 1974, it was 
incorporated under its current name as a crown corporation in 
accordance with a law passed by Parliament.
<P>
	The Federal Business Development Bank offers three types of 
services to companies: financial services, venture capital 
financing and management consulting services, including 
consulting, planning and information.
<P>
	This bill broadens the bank's mandate so that it will not only 
be a financial institution responsible for last resort financing. It 
will also, from now on, be authorized to offer complementary 
financing to other financial institutions and to set up 
subsidiaries.
<P>
	Moreover, clause 21 of the bill allows the Minister of Industry 
to use the bank to promote entrepreneurship in Canada. Clause 
20 gives more leeway to the bank to negotiate agreements with 
other federal departments and provincial and local agencies in 
carrying out its specific mandate and any other mandate that the 
minister could assign to it under clause 21.
<P>
	My first criticism is that I do not see the need to change the 
bank's name. We are only wasting taxpayers' money.
<P>
	However, the most important flaw of this bill is without a 
doubt the fact that the federal government is going to interfere 
even more in regional development throughout Canada. In 
Quebec alone, it intervenes through the Federal Office of 
Regional Development which implements all of the federal 
programs. The mandate of this office is to create a dialogue 
between federal stakeholders in Quebec. This office has already 
established contacts with these consultation structures in 
Quebec and even wants to sit at the consultation table for 
Montreal.
<P>
	Bill C-91 constitutes another centralizing offensive from the 
federal government resulting in costly and needless overlaps.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	This bill completely negates the role of provincial 
governments regarding support to small business. This goes 
against the declarations of the Liberal government which said it 
wants to eliminate overlapping and duplication with provinces.
<P>
	Clause 20 of the bill allows the Federal Business 
Development Bank to enter directly into agreements with a 
person or agency, which means it will be able to sign agreements 
with regional development councils among others.
<P>
	However the Quebec act respecting the Ministère du Conseil 
exécutif du Québec prohibits provincial agencies from entering 
into agreements with the federal government without the 
minister's authorization. Once more the federal government 
dismisses the responsibilities of the Government of Quebec and 
its very existence by giving itself the power to act without 
consulting provinces.
<P>
	In the area of regional development the centralizing offensive 
of the Chrétien government goes directly against Quebec's 
regionalization policy. The federal government has always 
refused to recognize regional development as an exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction. The government dismissed this claim in 
all constitutional negotiations. Yet, the federal government had 
promised Quebec it would limit its action in regions under 
general agreements between Canada and Quebec. However, the 
regional economic development agreement expired in december 
1994 and the federal government has refused to renew it.
<P>
	Federal intervention in regional development is becoming 
scattered, without consultation with the Quebec government. It 
is competing with Quebec programs while trying to increase the 
federal government's visibility in the outlying regions and is 
using the Federal Office of Regional Development to establish 
Canadian standards in various departments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12889"> 12889 </A></B>
<P>
	What I find really shocking is that the federal government 
is financially getting out of social programs and using 
taxpayers' money to unnecessarily overlap Quebec structures 
that are dealing with small and medium size businesses. On the 
other hand, it refuses to get out of manpower training, as was 
asked by the Quebec government, labour and employer 
organizations, as well as by economic and social sectors in 
general.
<P>
	In my riding of Bourassa, where there are numerous very 
small businesses, the Federal Business Development Bank has 
been involved with several projects that have created or 
maintained jobs. However, some business people tell me that 
this institution is taking too long to examine and respond to their 
requests or is asking for too many guarantees.
<P>
	This institution should also be providing more consulting 
services and in particular, more consulting and training services 
to students who wish to operate small businesses during the 
summer. The government is already giving it grants large 
enough to allow it to carry out that part of its mandate. I hope 
that the FBDB will always be different from other financial 
institutions in that it will not try to maximize its profits, but only 
to recover its costs.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois does not want the FBDB to compete with 
other development tools available to Quebecers, such as the 
Fonds de solidarité de la FTQ and the caisses populaires. Also, 
we would like it to have the means to support Quebec 
businesses.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the 
accomplishments of the FTQ's Fonds de solidarité over its ten 
year existence. I took part in the last annual meeting, during 
which the fund's 10th anniversary was celebrated. This fund has 
invested in, and helped, hundreds of businesses and has created 
or saved over 25,000 jobs in Quebec. I would like to pay tribute 
to its leaders, Louis Laberge, Fernand Daoust and Claude 
Blanchet. I would not like to see the Federal Business 
Development Bank duplicate the exceptional work already 
being done by the Fonds de solidarité.
<P>
	The potential impact of Bill C-91 on the bank's role as an 
instrument of economic development is very worrisome.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Firstly, the bank is no longer restricted to its role of a last 
resort lender and will be able to offer complementary financing. 
The danger lies in the fact that the bank is moving away from its 
mandate of last resort financing and more towards 
complementary financing.
<P>
	The bill must clearly stipulate that the bank's primary role is 
to offer last resort financing. Clause 21 gives the minister the 
discretion to involve the bank in initiatives which have nothing 
to do with its primary activity. Such a measure is unacceptable, 
because it could prevent the bank from concentrating on what it 
does best, which is providing last resort financing.
<P>
	Clause 36 of the bill restricts access to information regarding 
the bank's clients. This practice is normal for a financial 
institution. It would be useful, however, to add a provision 
stipulating that Parliament could access this information for a 
parliamentary inquiry.
<P>
	Like the other Bloc Quebecois members who preceded me, I 
would like to state that I do not support this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-91, the motion to 
refer the bill to committee prior to second reading.
<P>
	I know other members before me including my colleagues the 
member for Edmonton Southwest, the member for Okanagan 
Centre and the member for Kootenay East have spoken to the 
contents of the bill and what they hope to accomplish in 
committee, the weaknesses and strengths of the bill regarding 
the Federal Business Development Bank.
<P>
	I will take a slightly different attack. This motion refers the 
bill to committee prior to second reading. As members know, 
this is a new process which has just been implemented in this 
35th Parliament. We are doing some experimentation with 
regard to how we pass legislation.
<P>
	The Reform Party agreed with the procedure of sending bills 
to committee prior to second reading because the Liberals had 
promised that under this new process there would be ample time 
for substantive amendments to be debated and discussed in 
committee before the bill was approved in principle as it is 
during second reading debate.
<P>
	I will read what the standing orders say with regard to 
referring bills to committee prior to second reading. Bill C-91 
falls into this category. Standing Order 73(1):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Immediately after the reading of the order of the day for the second reading 
of any public bill, a minister of the crown may, after notifying representatives of 
the opposition parties, propose a motion that the said bill be forthwith referred 
to a standing, special or legislative committee. The Speaker shall immediately 
propose the question to the House and proceedings thereon shall be subject to 
the following conditions:</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In the case of Bill C-91 these requirements were followed. 
The minister did make a request that the bill go to committee 
prior to second reading and there had been consultation with the 
other parties.
<P>
	Standing Order 73(1)(b) says: ``the motion shall not be 
subject to any amendment''.
<P>
	That means as we debate this motion today we cannot 
implement any amendments. I can understand that because we 
are not dealing with the substance of the bill. We are dealing the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12890"> 12890 </A></B>
<P>
procedural matter, whether the bill should go to committee prior 
to second reading. The standing orders preclude any 
amendments to this motion.
<P>
	Standing Order 73(1)(c) states no member may speak more 
than once nor longer than ten minutes. Standing Order 73(1)(d) 
states that after not more than 180 minutes of debate, three 
hours, the Speaker shall interrupt the debate and the question 
shall be put and decided without further debate.
<P>
	We are not having a second reading debate right now. We are 
debating a motion to refer Bill C-91 to the Standing Committee 
on Industry. The committee will be challenged with the task of 
reviewing the bill, listening to witnesses, proposing 
amendments and having a vigorous debate on the value of Bill 
C-91; whether it is a strong and good piece of legislation, 
whether it needs to be substantially changed or whether it should 
be defeated. I am sure when the bill goes to committee these 
issues will be looked at.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	I am really concerned about whether we can take the 
government at face value when it says it will permit open and 
complete debate in committee prior to second reading. When we 
agree to this process we forego debate at second reading.
<P>
	We are not really having a full blown debate right now 
because we are limited to 180 minutes. We cannot make 
amendments because we are dealing with a motion, not with the 
bill. It is critical that if we also lose our second reading debate 
we have a committee that functions well, is open to 
amendments, takes time to consider the bill and will not rush the 
bill through committee stage without proper analysis, without 
enough witnesses being called and without time taken at the 
clause by clause review of the bill.
<P>
	I am concerned, not because of Bill C-91 and the industry 
committee, but about what happened in the human rights and 
disabled persons committee which also received a bill through 
this process. The member for Kingston and the Islands said that 
bill was before the committee for five months. Let me tell the 
House what the committee did for five months.
<P>
	I think members of the committee allowed only four 
witnesses Reform suggested to appear before the committee. All 
others were government witnesses. That does not sound like a 
very open process. Maybe the Bloc had a few, I am not sure. 
Certainly the appearance of witnesses before the committee was 
restricted. That does not sound like the spirit of Standing Order 
73. It certainly does not fall under the spirit of the red book. We 
are having some real problems with the credibility of the red 
book in light of all the broken promises we see amassing at a 
rapid pace. Almost on a daily basis we see new broken promises.
<P>
	The bill came before the committee and it refused to hear our 
witnesses. We were let to sit a simmer for a long time. Suddenly 
it was time for clause by clause debate. Our members brought 
forward amendments, some prior to the clause by clause debate 
and some on the day of the clause by clause debate. These 
amendments were refused  contrary to Standing Order 62 
because the chairman said they were only submitted in one 
official language. I hope that does not happen with Bill C-91.
<P>
	I understand the industry committee functions a little better 
than the human rights committee. It almost sounds like an 
oxymoron to use the term human rights when we are talking 
about the actions which transpired in the committee the other 
day.
<P>
	The chairman ruled contrary to Standing Order 62 and refused 
to even consider debating amendments put forward by my 
Reform colleagues. Initially the committee refused to accept 
amendments from the floor, saying they had to be submitted 
ahead of time. It is contrary to the rules and spirit of the motion 
to submit these bills to committee prior to second reading.
<P>
	There were some other problems. Suddenly a motion was 
passed limiting debate per clause to five minutes. I hope this 
does not happen with Bill C-91 because this makes a sham of the 
committee process. That five minutes included reading the 
clause; some clauses were a whole page, some clauses were 
difficult to complete in the time limit. After reading a clause all 
three parties had far less than five minutes to comment on each 
clause. That is not meaningful debate. It is not in the spirit of 
Standing Order 73. It is not why Reform supported this change 
to the committee process.
<P>
	I trust this will not happen with Bill C-91. If this reoccurs it 
will indicate the government did not bring the changes to the 
standing orders forward in good faith. It was using this as a 
mechanism whereby the debate on bills could be shortened, 
particularly on contentious bills such as C-64, and therefore 
prevent the House from dealing with the bill at a second reading 
debate. This is a very serious matter and why I bring it to the 
attention of the House.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, in the committee the chairman refused to hear 
points of order. I know, Mr. Speaker, you have never in the 
Chamber refused to hear points of order; neither have the 
Deputy Speaker nor any of the acting speakers. The standing 
orders indicate points of order must be heard. The chairman in 
the human rights committee refused to hear points of order, 
again a breach of the standing orders and the common 
procedures we follow in the House.
<P>
	Therefore I hope Bill C-91 when it goes to committee prior to 
second reading will not face this type of abusive procedure on 
the part of the chair of the committee. I am sure it will not 
because I understand that committee works quite a bit more 
co-operatively.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12891"> 12891 </A></B>
<P>
	In this committee the chair, if challenged on a point of order, 
said: ``Do I have the agreement of the committee to proceed? 
Is my ruling sustained?'' The Liberal members would jump up 
and say ``sustained'', and there was no debate on the issue.
<P>
	The debate on the Federal Business Development Bank is 
important. It could be equally as important as the debate on 
employment equity, although the employment equity bill is 
certainly a more emotional issue. However, all bills are 
important. If they are brought to the House we expect them to be 
dealt with in a serious manner. We expect the rules of the House 
and the rules as they apply to committees to be followed.
<P>
	I implore the government to review whether it is really open 
to honest debate in committee prior to second reading. When we 
use Standing Order 73 and refer bills to committee prior to a 
second reading debate, I challenge the government never again 
to implement draconian measures which would restrict debate 
on a particular clause to five minutes or less. That cannot 
happen. That takes away all credibility from the legislative 
process. It is demeaning to members of Parliament and, most 
important, it is absolutely wrong.
<P>
	We will in good faith agree to send the bill to committee prior 
to second reading. I expect the discussion will be of a far higher 
quality than was the case in the human rights committee. Not 
only would I expect it, I think the House should demand it. 
Members of Parliament deserve to be heard and deserve to have 
their positions adequately expressed so there can be a vote taken 
after full and free debate. I recommend that for Bill C-91.

	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have grave 
concerns respecting the current status of infectious disease 
notification in Canada. Without regard for their personal safety 
firefighters, police and ambulance workers routinely provide 
emergency medical treatment in unsanitary field conditions on 
patients they know nothing about. As a consequence they can be 
exposed to an increasing variety of dangerous, contagious and 
sometimes deadly diseases.
<P>
	Is it asking too much that these brave men and women be 
entitled to notification about possible exposure to an infectious 
disease? Is it asking too much that our emergency response 
personnel themselves be given the right to early treatment? Is it 
asking too much that their family, friends and literally everyone 
they come into contact with be protected from further 
transmission?
<P>
	The answer is obvious. I implore the government through 
Health Canada to set the standard for uniform notification 
protocols in conjunction with those provinces that have 
endorsed national guidelines. The confidentiality of patients can 
and will be protected. The health of our emergency response 
personnel can and must be protected.

Kasonde were shot to death in their father's west end apartment. 
I can think of no greater horror for a family to face than the one 
their mother and little brother now face. Our hearts go out to 
them as they try to survive this terrible tragedy.
<P>
	The children's school and others in the neighbourhood are 
seeking to reassure hundreds of children who have lost their 
sense of security and innocence with this tragic event. The pain 
of these two deaths permeates the whole community.
<P>
	Tonight the people of Carlington will hold a candle light vigil 
in memory of Wilson and Margret and to declare their 
determination to end violence that destroys so many lives and to 
control the instruments of violence that can kill so quickly and 
so finally. I ask us all to join them in that determination.

	Despite his slash and burn approach, Mr. Harris claims that he

on May 29, 1987, a group of concerned Canadians made a 
decision that in a few short years would change the course of 
Canadian history. On that day delegates from the four western 
provinces gathered in Vancouver to discuss Canada's economic 
and political future. Most of these people had never met before, 
but they were united by their desire to build a better Canada and 
by a common belief that our political system was in need of 
urgent and fundamental change.
<P>
	After much debate, this assembly made an historic decision 
by resolving to launch the Reform Party of Canada and thereby 
revitalize Canadian politics. On the anniversary of this event, I

<P>
	By its lack of conviction, this remark is surprisingly 
reminiscent of the moral victories the PQ used to claim in the

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BOSNIA">BOSNIA</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, last Thursday, in retaliation against the UN air 
strikes, the Bosnian Serbs bombed civilian populations, in Tuzla 
in particular, and took some 370 peacekeepers hostage, 
including 10 Canadians. The Serb forces went so far as to keep 
some peacekeepers chained to ammunition depots to be used as 
human shields against further raids by NATO.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. What concrete 
measures does the government intend to take to free the 10 
Canadian peacekeepers being held hostage by the Bosnian 
Serbs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I would like to state that the Canadian 
population is appalled by the events mentioned by the Leader of 
the Opposition. As you know, all the troops engaged in the 
humanitarian work that needs to be done in that troubled part of 
the world are doing an exceptional job, and I would like to take 
this opportunity to tell the soldiers posted over there and their 
families that the government and Canadians are very concerned, 
and that we will make every effort to support them.
<P>
	We are currently in contact with most of the 10 Canadian 
hostages. As members know, the same thing happened last year, 
and we managed to have the hostages released after two weeks. 
The current situation is no worse than last year's. We are now 
making arrangements to talk with the Serbs. We may be in a 
slightly better situation than the French or the British, because 
our soldiers, those who were seized are only a few kilometres 
away from the base at Visoko. We hope that, once the situation 
calms down, our soldiers will be able to return to their base, and 
to safety.
<P>
	In the meantime, we spent the weekend in contact with our 
allies who have troops over there to try, through diplomatic 
means, to bring things back to normal in that very complex part 
of the world. I spoke with the British Prime Minister, the French 
President and the Secretary General of the United Nations over 
the weekend. In particular, we want to change the troops' 
mandate because of the imbalance between the resources at their 
disposal and the positions they must take. The mandate must be 
redefined to make it difficult for any one of the  warring factions 
over there, especially the Serbs, to engage in such hostage 
takings.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if this can be any encouragement to our fellow 
citizens being held hostage, they should know that they have the 
support and sympathy of all Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> As he just reminded us, the Prime Minister 
consulted with his French and British counterparts and with the 
Secretary General of the UN, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, over the 
weekend. In the light of those discussions, can he tell us what 
position his Minister of Foreign Affairs will defend at the NATO 
meeting tomorrow with respect to the peacekeepers' mandate 
and the safety of our fellow Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, tomorrow, the Minister of Foreign Affairs will meet 
with his NATO colleagues and defend Canada's position that the 
time has come for the United Nations to redefine the 
peacekeepers' mandate.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	As I said earlier, the work to be done by our troops and the 
resources available to them must be reviewed so that small 
groups of peacekeepers are not as exposed as they are at present.
<P>
	Through our ambassador to the United Nations, we outlined 
our position. I spoke with Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali yesterday to express Canada's views before he 
submits a new plan to the Security Council tomorrow. This 
position will be defended by the Minister of Foreign Affairs at 
the meeting of NATO foreign affairs ministers tomorrow.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I understand that the government is surrounded by 
advisers, that the Prime Minister and his Minister of Foreign 
Affairs have the opportunity to talk with their counterparts in 
other countries, that they are well informed, and so on, but very 
complex questions are being raised.
<P>
	Many people in Canada and Quebec are asking themselves 
whether we should keep sending troops over there, whether 
changes should be made to the peacekeepers' current mandate, 
and if so, what those changes should be. Will they continue to 
stand helplessly by and fall victim to the events? If we maintain 
a military presence over there, why, and on what conditions, will 
we do so?
<P>
	In other words, Parliament must be consulted on this. In this 
context, can the Prime Minister tell us whether he will approve 
the opposition's request that an emergency debate be held today 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12896"> 12896 </A></B>
<P>
on the safety of the peacekeepers in Bosnia and the mandate of 
UN forces?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the House had the opportunity to debate our presence 
over there on three occasions-and I am very glad that it did.
<P>
	I do not know the status of the discussions between the 
opposition parties and the government. Tomorrow is an 
opposition day and would be a very good opportunity to raise 
this issue. There would be more time available, instead of 
holding a debate late tonight.
<P>
	I think that tomorrow's opposition day is reserved for the 
third party, and I hope they will use the opportunity to debate 
this issue. I know that the British Parliament will debate its 
position on Wednesday. I would welcome a debate in this House 
tomorrow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, I would like to remind the Prime Minister that it is 
important that the debate be held today since the meeting is to 
take place tomorrow morning. If we want the debate to be 
relevant, it must be held today.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jacob:</B> My question is for the Prime Minister. In the 
context of the mandate, the French Prime Minister set certain 
conditions on maintaining troops in the former Yugoslavia. 
First, that UN soldiers be regrouped in order to minimize the 
likehood of further hostage takings; second, that those soldiers 
be provided with heavy artillery and given permission to use it; 
and, third, that a standing response force under UN and NATO 
control be set up.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell us if he agrees with the French 
Prime Minister on redefining the mandate, which he just 
mentioned, for UN soldiers in the former Yugoslavia along these 
lines?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is exactly what we are discussing with the UN 
Secretary General.
<P>
	In my answer to the Leader of the Opposition, I indicated that 
it was important to redefine the role of our soldiers and to ensure 
that they are not exposed, as they are right now, several 
kilometres from their base, in small numbers and completely on 
their own; we have been adamant on this. As for the right to 
attack or take firmer defensive actions, they have the power to 
do so, but right now, the engagement rules need to be reviewed.
<P>
	As far as setting up a standing response force, I would like to 
know exactly what they mean. In our view, we are there to 
maintain peace, not to start a war with parties which are already 
fighting with one another.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, by 
his answer, the Prime Minister has shown once again that we 
should have a debate today, and not wait until tomorrow.
<P>
	This morning, the Minister of Foreign Affairs said that 
Canada intended to step up its diplomatic efforts and that a 
military approach would be a disaster.
<P>
	Are we to understand from this statement that the Canadian 
government is opposed not only to redefining the mandate of the 
UN troops, as proposed by France, but also to any new air 
strikes?
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are not against any new air strikes. Last week we 
said that we thought, and this was echoed by the French and the 
British Prime Ministers, that the air strikes had probably not 
been planned as well as they could have been.
<P>
	Had we been given earlier notice, we could have taken the 
necessary steps to protect our soldiers. I raised this issue with 
the UN Secretary General who, to a certain extent, recognized 
the validity of my argument. I was pleased to hear the new 
French Prime Minister express the same point of view, 
yesterday, on French television.
<P>
	A review of the situation is needed, but we cannot say that 
there will never be other air strikes because that would mean 
that, if we were attacked, we would not defend ourselves.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadians are 
rightly outraged that our soldiers are being held hostage and 
their lives endangered. The government has failed our 
peacekeepers and has failed Canadians. It renewed our mandate 
in Bosnia without any criteria for evaluating the mission.
<P>
	The facts are plain. The warring factions continue to target 
UN troops. Ceasefires are not respected. Humanitarian efforts 
are impossible and there is no peace to keep. The government 
knew this in October, it knew this in March and it knows it know. 
Will the government commit itself to the withdrawal of 
Canadian troops as soon as possible?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would say to the hon. member that at this moment 
when Canadian soldiers have been kidnapped it is not the time 
for the Canadian government to run for cover and be subjected to 
blackmail.
<P>
	We are there to play a useful role. Thousands and thousands of 
lives have been saved because our troops are there. The 
Canadian troops are among the best, if not the best. I would like 
to tell our soldiers that we support them. When they went there 
they knew they were not going to a picnic. I am grateful to the 
Leader of the Opposition who said that we are backing the 
Canadian troops.
<P>
	We have had similar incidents before and there will probably 
be more. In the meantime we are saving thousands of lives there, 
making sure that medication and food gets to the population. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12897"> 12897 </A></B>
<P>
The Canadian people are  proud of this role and the Canadian 
people are backing the troops who at the moment are in 
difficulty.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no one is 
questioning the calibre and the jobs our peacekeepers have done.
<P>
	The Liberal red book promised that Canada would no longer 
be a foreign policy camp follower. In Bosnia however, we have 
become a camp follower to all of NATO and to a contact group 
with limited involvement in the conflict. Germany for example, 
does not have one single soldier on the ground, yet has more 
voice than Canada. Our soldiers are being chained to posts 
outside ammunition dumps. Why is the government being 
diplomatically correct in letting the governments of France and 
Britain make our decisions for what we do in Bosnia?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are not part of the contact group. As I said before, 
25 countries are there, some with more troops than Canada in 
Bosnia, and they are not part of the-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Not troops.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Some are and they are not 
members of the contact group. This is a diplomatic effort by the 
Russians, the Americans and three European countries which 
have more direct influence than we have. We do not have a 
traditional presence there and I admit that. However neither are 
the Dutch, nor the Belgians, nor the Spanish and many others. 
We should not take offence at that.
<P>
	We are on the ground and we are making the decisions in 
relation to Canadian soldiers. We are participating in the 
discussions at NATO. We are participating in the discussions at 
the UN.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	I had the chance to talk to many of the leaders, the president of 
Croatia, Prime Minister Major and President Chirac, and the 
minister of foreign affairs in Bosnia who unfortunately was 
killed over the weekend. I met him in Paris. He told me the best 
soldiers in that very difficult situation were the Canadians. 
Therefore we will keep backing them up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we agree we 
have the best soldiers. They should also have a say in the 
decisions.
<P>
	The Reform Party warned the government not to renew 
Canada's mandate. The situation was unstable and the lives of 
Canadians would be placed in unacceptable danger if they were 
recommitted to Bosnia. The government ignored this advice and 
for a third time Canadian soldiers are being held hostage.
<P>
	Canadians are demanding action. According to a recent poll 
of thousands, 90 per cent wanted Canada to pull out now. Why is 
the government refusing to listen to Canadians? Why is it 
showing such a total lack of good judgment in setting its policy 
toward Bosnia?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have had discussions with the Canadian military 
and we are supported by people who know something about this 
very difficult circumstance. Canadians have always been there 
in difficult circumstances. I am very happy that all parties 
except the Reform Party are supporting Canadian troops and the 
Canadian position.
<P>
	It has been a tradition that when lives of Canadians are at 
stake in a difficult circumstance we back them up. The 
government is participating in discussions and decisions. We 
will make the best judgments to save lives.
<P>
	In the meantime I know the millions of people living in that 
region are very grateful that Canadians are there to save lives 
and provide food and medication in a terrible situation.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of National Revenue.
<P>
	It is unjustifiable on the part of the federal government to help 
a professional hockey club to the tune of $20 million, while 
cutting billions of dollars in social program funding.
<P>
	After deciding that the federal assistance was inadequate, the 
Manitoba Entertainment Complex Save the Jets group applied to 
Revenue Canada for charitable status, so as to become eligible 
for indirect federal assistance in the form of tax deductions.
<P>
	Can the Minister of National Revenue tell us what is the status

Winnipeg Jets through tax deductions?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the rules governing charities are set out by 
the courts, not by Parliament or the government. They are set out 
by a series of court decisions.
<P>
	It has been determined over a fairly lengthy series of court 
cases that an organization entirely for the promotion of a sport is 
not a charitable organization. I cannot comment on the 
particulars of any one organization and where it stands within 
the process. I can as a general rule assure the hon. member that 
any

organization strictly for sporting purposes would not qualify for 
charitable status.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
will the Minister of National Revenue confirm information 
suggesting that the donations made to Manitoba Entertainment

federal assistance to the Winnipeg Jets by allowing the 
deduction of such donations for federal income tax purposes?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>

attempt to avoid the existing law as it has been laid down by the 
courts will be objected to by Revenue Canada. The law should be 
applied directly and fairly to all, as it has been in the past. It is 
always possible for people to attempt to alter the nature of an 
organization's objectives or to alter the nature of gifts to a 
charitable organization or to bring it within a charitable status. 
That is within their right. We will examine it thereafter when we 
receive that information and determine whether it meets the law.

Speaker, I will make it plain from the outset that the Reform 
Party, like all parties in the House and all Canadians, supports 
and has great respect and admiration for our troops in Bosnia.
<P>
	The Bosnian Serb reaction to NATO air strikes on Pale last 
week was entirely predictable, indeed a forgone conclusion. 
Was the Canadian government consulted on the decision to carry 
out the air strikes and if so did it approve?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a decision made by NATO and the UN. In my 
discussion with the secretary general of the UN yesterday he 
said he had agreed.
<P>
	We have not been formally consulted like the others. It was a 
decision made at that moment by the people who have the 
authority. We were not formally consulted for this air strike. We 
discuss policies all the time but the people on the ground make 
these decisions. It was approved by the UN, as requested in the 
policy of double keys.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, while Canada may not have the largest contingent of 
troops in the former Yugoslavia, we certainly have had a 
substantial commitment throughout the conflict and that 
commitment is highly rated.

taking which resulted, did the Canadian government not insist 
its approval be sought before NATO air strikes were approved?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to 
reiterate what the Prime Minister said.
<P>
	A procedure was put down a year ago when NATO discussed

question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	With its bill redefining the mandate of the Federal Business 
Development Bank, the federal government is once again going 
over the head of the provinces by assuming the right to sign 
agreements directly with organizations which come under the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister justify this new federal 
interference in regional development through the signing of 
agreements with organizations which come directly under 
Quebec's jurisdiction? Is this another example of what the 
Prime Minister calls flexible federalism?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, Canada's constitution clearly states that banks come 
under federal, not provincial, jurisdiction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	By refusing to renew the federal-provincial agreement on 
regional development, Ottawa rejected any form of dialogue 
with the Quebec government.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister recognize that the federal 
government is laying the foundations of another confrontation 
with Quebec by allowing the new Business Development Bank 
of Canada to sign agreements directly with organizations which 
come under Quebec's jurisdiction, and also by keeping the 
province from playing any role in the process?

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
more questions have surfaced concerning the diversion of funds 
from highway 104 in Nova Scotia and the role of the public 
works minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has said this is an issue for the Minister of 
Transport, and when one of his caucus members called it 
misappropriation of funds she was told to keep quiet.
<P>
	If the minister of public works was such a minor player in all 
this, how could he have announced the funding diversion in 
February 1994 when according to a letter from the minister of 
transportation federal and provincial officials amended the 
agreement only three months after that? On whose authority was 
the minister of public works acting?
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member has been on a bumpy road with this 
line of questioning.
<P>
	A meeting was held with the minister of transportation for 
Nova Scotia in January during which agreement in principle was 
achieved on the reallocation of the funds. In February the 
minister of public works on my behalf announced we had agreed 
to the funds being spent as was consented to by the province of 
Nova Scotia and the Government of Canada.
<P>
	I reassure my hon. friend this situation has occurred over and 
over again in these agreements. The reason it occurs is that, 
unlike my hon. friend, most of us on this side of the House 
understand that the construction of highways and the choosing 
of routing for highways are within provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is ironic the minister said that because in 1986 the Tory 
revenue minister diverted $20 million from a federal-provincial 
agreement to a road through his Nova Scotia riding and the 
Liberals here were incensed. Now the Liberal minister of public 
works has diverted $26 million from a federal-provincial 
agreement to his Nova Scotia riding and the Tories are incensed. 
It is déjà-vu.
<P>
	Since the minister of public works refuses to answer anyone's 
question on this serious issue, we would like to borrow the 
words of the minister. Would the Prime Minister ``put up or shut 
up?'' Will he refer this issue to the ethics lap-person or is he 
content to go down in history as being just as big a hypocrite as 
Brian Mulroney?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very unfortunate the hon. member does not 
understand that when the Government of Nova Scotia looked at 
the funding available for the highway to which the funds were 
originally dedicated it understood very little would be achieved 
in the spending of the very limited amount of money available.
<P>
	It deemed it was in the best interest of Nova Scotians to 
allocate the funds to another highway. We consented to that, as 
is provided for under section 12.2 of the agreement where the 
agreement can be amended by consent. That is what occurred.
<P>
	Unfortunately for the hon. member he will have to keep 
beating his dead horse because he does not seem to be able to 
find another one these days.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, according to John McCallum, chief economist with the 
Royal Bank, the Bank of Canada's policy has been responsible 
for the steady drop in the standard of living of Canadians since 
1990. And the new governor of the Bank of Canada has admitted 
that the bank is still implementing the policy introduced under 
the Conservatives by his predecessor, John Crow, a policy which 
the current Minister of Finance at one time denounced.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance realize that the Bank of 
Canada's current monetary policy and the Conservatives' 
monetary policy are one and the same and that the policy is the 
direct cause of high unemployment rates and the drop in our 
standard of living, as he himself claimed during the last election 
campaign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I must say that I 
find it difficult to understand why the hon. member has chosen 
this time to raise this point, since over the past two months, 
interest rates have dropped a total of close to 100 basis points.
<P>
	It is very clear that the Bank of Canada's policy, which is to 
anticipate inflation, has a big impact on job creation. We cannot 
compare today's monetary policy to the monetary policy of four 
or five years past. There is an enormous difference and that is 
why the hon. member's claims do not wash.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in my opinion what does not wash is that the Minister 
of Finance sang a different tune altogether when he was still 
a member of the opposition. That is what does not wash.
<P>
	I would like to know whether the Minister of Finance realizes 
that since he took office-I am mot talking just about the past 
five months-interest rates have gone up by one third. This 
stopped the weak economic recovery dead in its tracks, for, over 
the past five months, there has been no net job creation in 
Canada-a figure supported by Statistics Canada.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, 
100,000 jobs were created in the private sector in the last 
quarter. That is nothing to sneeze at.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	We must compare the Bank of Canada's current policy to that 
of four or five years ago. As we all know, interest rates were at 
their peak in 1989. Therefore, there is no comparison.
<P>
	The hon. member was right to quote me and the solicitor 
general, who was finance critic when we were both in the 
opposition. We were opposed to the monetary policy of the Bank 
of Canada then. The government of the time, in which the 
Leader of the Opposition was a cabinet member, and many 
erstwhile Conservative members who are now Bloc members, 
defended the policy.
<P>
	So, instead of putting his question regarding the McCallum 
report and the Bank of Canada's policy to the government, I 
would suggest that the hon. member talk to members of his own 
caucus and maybe even have a private conversation on the issue 
with his leader.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs.
<P>
	The Quebec Minister of Public Security has criticized the 
federal government's inertia vis-à-vis the expansion of the 
Mohawk cemetery in Oka. According to the minister, the federal 
government, which is paying its negotiator a handsome salary, 
still refuses to buy the 60,000 square foot piece of land being 
offered by the Municipality of Oka for the Mohawks.
<P>
	How does the Minister of Indian Affairs justify the fact that he 
and his department are dragging their feet and have yet to 
purchase the land made available by the municipality to expand 
the cemetery?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I disagree with the premise. 
On the houses north of 344, it was 100 per cent federal money, 
several million dollars. On the houses the Province of Quebec 
requested we purchase south of 344, there was not one cent of 
contribution from the Province of Quebec.
<P>
	We went in there and set up the Mohawk negotiator, the 
facilitator and the mediator and we purchased those houses. All 
the money being spent north and south of 344 has been 100 per 
cent federal money.
<P>
	It is okay for Mr. Ménard to sit there and give me a lecture, but 
if he is serious about doing it they should be at the table offering 
some kind of contribution, more than just tokenism.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all I know is that the problem is not resolved. It has cost 
over $350,000 for a negotiator to do nothing and leave.
<P>
	How does the minister explain the fact that the negotiations 
conducted by the federal government with the Mohawks, which 
have cost a fortune to date, have resulted in absolutely nothing 
tangible, when a matter such as the purchase of land, if settled 
by the federal government, would prevent another confrontation 
between the Mohawks, the City of Oka and the Government of 
Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again the hon. member 
says there is nothing tangible. When we took over the 
government there were 70 or 80 illegally held houses north of 
344. Now I believe we have it down to a dozen. We have a 
housing authority. South of 344 most of the houses are 
purchased; there are only three that are illegally held, and we are 
working on those. So there have been tangible results. There 
have been tangible results at the Mohawk round table and 
tangible results in individual negotiations with each of the three 
First Nations.
<P>
	We are supposed to be honourable here. When the hon. 
member uses the death of two Mohawks and a funeral to further 
a political agenda, I think the hon. member falls below what is

<B><A NAME="12902"> 12902 </A></B>
<P>
every other member of the government time after time. The 
basic premise of his question is incorrect.
<P>
	With respect to the issue of whether any organization is 
entitled to charitable status, I have to tell the hon. member what 
I told my hon. friend from the Bloc a moment or two ago. That 
is, past decisions of the courts have said that organizations that 
are strictly for sporting purposes are not charities within the 
definition that has been put forward by the courts over the years. 
That is the situation in law. That is the law I must follow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
point is that this government, which is cutting $7 billion from 
public spending in the area of health care, social assistance, and 
post-secondary education, suddenly found $20 million to put 
into a building to house a professional sports team.
<P>
	Why cannot the minister do something very simple? He has 
given us the definition. Will he absolutely guarantee as a 
minister of the crown that the people of Canada will not be 
putting any more in than they are already going to be putting in 
at the figure of $20 million?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue,

explained to the Reform Party that Calgary and Edmonton are 
using infrastructure money for hockey arenas. It is strange to me 
that in Winnipeg they want different rules. They want things to 
be done differently from the two Alberta cities that are receiving 
money in this regard.
<P>
	With respect to the position in law, I cannot guarantee that I 
will refuse any application that comes before me. They are 
judged on the merits in accordance with the law. The hon.

of the law, but on this side of the House we obey the law in these

point out is that we have made a substantial addition to the 
budget for youth employment this year. We have increased the 
actual employment program from $193 million to $236 million 
so that we could ensure young people would have effective 
work.
<P>
	We have enough money to provide approximately 30,000 jobs 
and to provide wage subsidies to private business and 
community organizations. A major investment has gone into 
loans so that students can start their own businesses, thereby 
creating their own employment. There is a substantial amount 
going into the summer youth service corps in order that they will

policing and better environmental controls.

debate this matter before the government presents them with a 
fait accompli and, given the importance of the positions the 
government must take, it seems undeniable that there is every 
advantage in having this Parliament debate this matter tonight.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> As my colleague said, I did receive a letter 
from the Official Opposition House Leader.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to consider everything that has been said and 
everything that has taken place concerning this topic. I will 
return to the House as soon as possible, but I will return today 
before the adjournment motion.

<P>
Question No. 181-<B>Ms. Beaumier:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to the Department of National Revenue's Assessment 2000 
effort, (<I>a</I>) why is there a provision for backhauling from a CW licensed 
warehouse to a BW licensed warehouse in cases where the department will not 
grant a BW licence, and (<I>b</I>) what is the threshold in terms of volum of business 
for granting a BW rather than a CW licence where all other criteria have been 
met?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> A BW sufferance warehouse is a primary public facility 
licensed by Revenue Canada for the receipt of in bond freight 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12905"> 12905 </A></B>
<P>
imported by highway. These facilities are serviced by Revenue 
Canada and are licensed when a demonstrated need exists for 
either a new or additional highway sufferance warehouse in a 
customs area.
<P>
	A CW sufferance warehouse is a secondary facility for the 
private use of an operator for the deconsolidation of in bond 
freight arriving by any mode of transportation. In the case of 
highway freight, goods must first be reported to the primary BW 
highway warehouse before being transferred to a CW warehouse 
for customs clearance. These facilities are operated by freight 
forwarders, consolidators and deconsolidators for freight 
carried in their system.
<P>
	In reference to part (a) of the question, an increasing number 
of companies have been applying for CW sufferance warehouse 
licences in the Toronto area. Faced with limited resources, local 
Revenue Canada officials introduced a system to allow freight 
forwarders to backhaul goods requiring customs examination to 
the BW sufferance warehouse rather than having Revenue 
Canada provide the service to the CW facility. This arrangement 
has permitted the department to license additional CW 
warehouses since no on site customs service is required for 
examination purposes.
<P>
	In reference to part (b) of the question, the policy on the 
licensing of BW highway sufferance warehouses is one per 
customs area, with exceptions made for high volume locations. 
Current departmental policy provides for the licensing of an 
additional type BW facility if the volume of commercial 
highway traffic handled at a particular customs office exceeds 
40,000 shipments per year over a sustained period of time and 
the potential operator demonstrates the ability to attract a 
minimum of 20,000 shipments per year.
<P>
	There is no volume of business criteria for CW facilities, 
however the department must be able to service them within 
existing resource levels.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUSINESSDEVELOPMENTBANKOFCANADAACT">BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT BANK OF CANADA ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to rise today to speak to Bill C-91 on second reading.
<P>
	Through this bill, the government wants to streamline the 
Federal Business Development Bank and modernize its 
operations, two words that are undoubtedly tied to the reality of 
markets as we near the end of this century, but which fool 
nobody as far as the intentions of the federal government are 
concerned. The government simply wants to interfere even more 
in regional development, and in the case of Quebec, to increase 
its presence in the most important economic development 
mechanisms of the Quebec state.
<P>
	The government is proposing major changes with this entirely 
new act, the Business Development Bank of Canada Act, which 
changes the name of the Federal Business Development Bank 
and repeals the FBDB Act.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is therefore opposed to any amendment 
of the actual Federal Business Development Bank Act. This 
bank must not lose its role as banking service of last resort for 
small and medium size businesses in Quebec looking for venture 
capital and development capital.
<P>
	In the past, the FBDB has always been a very efficient 
development tool, greatly appreciated by Quebec's small and 
medium size businesses.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12906"> 12906 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	It should be noted that more than 33 per cent of current FBDB 
loans are made in Quebec, that 23 per cent of the bank's offices 
are located in Quebec, that the annual volume of FBDB loans to 
Quebec is in the order of $310 million, or 38 per cent of the 
annual volume for the whole of Canada, and that 50 per cent of 
the organization's staff is active in Quebec.
<P>
	That is why the Bloc Quebecois is proposing the status quo 
with respect to the FBDB. We should not forget that the Quebec 
state exists and that it is trying to create its own development 
mechanisms, despite strong federal interference in regional 
economic development. The FBDB remains a parallel structure, 
an administrative duplication, when it cannot adapt to regional 
specificity because of so-called national policies.
<P>
	Several structures and programs of the government of Quebec 
are already geared to small and medium size enterprises in 
Quebec. The Société de développement industriel (SDI), with 
programs such as Aide à la production, which can contribute up 
to 35 per cent of capital expenditures for a minimum investment 
of $100,000, or Reprise de la PME, a program which provides 
loan guarantees covering up to 80 per cent of the net loss on a 
loan made by a financial institution, are among the many 
examples that attest to the economic involvement of the Quebec 
state in small and medium size businesses.
<P>
	There is also the Fonds d'aide aux entreprises that is 
administered by the Conseils régionaux de développement, an 
association of individuals where a greater importance can be 
given to the specific policies of these same regions. There is also 
the Fonds décentralisés de création d'emplois that are 
administered by the Secrétariat au développement des régions, 
and other programs for small businesses, including Innovation, 
administered by the Quebec department of industry, commerce, 
science and technology, that also attest to the existence of a 
small business financing structure in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	Moreover, in his last budget, Quebec finance minister Jean 
Campeau announced that he intends to really play the 
venture-capital card by increasing regional funds and by 
creating the Fonds de solidarité de la CSN. We already had the 
FTQ solidarity fund. By adding another solidarity fund, we 
expect to be able to create many more jobs. I would like mention 
one of these regional funds in particular: SOLIDE, a venture 
capital fund related to the SOLIDEQ program and designed to 
promote local development. SOLIDEQ is a joint venture of the 
Fonds de solidarité du Québec and the Union des municipalités 
régionales de comté du Québec.
<P>
	I must also mention the Caisses populaires Desjardins, which 
play a major role in financing small business by granting loans 
at the local community level. This network of more than 1,232 
credit unions accounts for nearly 25  per cent of all commercial 
loans in Quebec. This is unequalled anywhere in Canada.
<P>
	There is no point in looking for more evidence of the fact that 
the new bank will not operate at that level, that broadening the 
Federal Business Development Bank's mandate as suggested in 
Bill C-91 constitutes not only duplication of small business 
assistance structures in Quebec and every other province in 
Canada, but also overlap of responsibilities.
<P>
	The question we must ask ourselves regarding the role of the 
FBDB in Quebec is: How can this last resort institution be 
integrated into the assistance facilities already available in 
Quebec without causing duplication or overlap? For many years 
now, the FBDB has been moving away from venture capital 
financing and development assistance for new businesses.
<P>
	The FBDB had its place in remote areas, where capitalization 
through the creation of medium or large size businesses often 
proves impossible. Why then mess with this assistance that 
remote areas need so desperately and start competing with 
provincial governments and traditional banking institutions?
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois members sitting on the Standing 
Committee on Industry prefaced their dissenting report by 
saying that the Quebec government is in a better position to 
assess the financial requirements of small and medium size 
businesses, as well as to develop and implement appropriate 
programs; yet, the federal government has currently taken over 
most of this area of jurisdiction, thereby causing many costly 
instances of overlap. It is obvious that, with Bill C-91 
broadening the FBDB's mandate, the federal government is only 
reinforcing this tendency.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, this bill could also have a very worrisome 
impact on the FBDB's role as an instrument for economic 
development. Indeed, since the bank will no longer be limited to 
its role of lender of last resort, it could provide complementary 
financing.
<P>
	The risk, of course, is that the FBDB might go the easy way 
and concentrate on complementary financing, rather than on last 
resort financing such as stock or risk capital. Since 
complementary financing is less risky, the FBDB may naturally 
be inclined to concentrate its activities on that type of financing.
<P>
	The expansion of FBDB's mandate, combined with the fact 
that it will now be able to issue hybrid capital instruments, is 
likely to distort the bank's role of supporting economic 
development, while also changing the nature of its mandate.
<P>
	Before concluding, I want to draw the members' attention to 
clauses 20 and 21 of Bill C-91, which are totally unacceptable to 
the provinces, and particularly Quebec. Clause 20 reads: ``The 
Bank may enter into agreements with, and act as agent for, any 
department or  agency of-a province-for the provision of 
services or programs-on their behalf-''
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12907"> 12907 </A></B>
<P>
	That provision in the bill goes against the decentralization 
process undertaken by the Quebec state within its territory, 
where the regions want to take control of their own 
development.
<P>
	With this clause, the federal government pursues its 
centralizing strategy, a political strategy the objective of which 
is to significantly reduce the power of the Quebec state to 
become involved in economic development and, ultimately, to 
keep it from achieving political independence.
<P>
	By assuming the right to act, through the FBDB, as agent for 
Quebec organizations or departments, the federal government 
totally ignores the authority of Quebec's National Assembly and 
its executive council act, which provides that any Quebec 
organization or department must seek the authorization of the 
Quebec government prior to dealing with the federal 
government.
<P>
	The new Federal Business Development Bank, or the 
Business Development Bank of Canada as it is called in Bill 
C-91, is now the federal government's main means of 
interfering in Quebec's economic and regional development. 
This government wants to act as a banker and take over the role 
of financial institutions in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	This is a definite departure from the FBDB's current mandate. 
The federal government wants to use the FBDB as a tool to limit 
the powers of the Quebec state to become involved in economic 
and regional development so as to take over provincial fields of 
jurisdiction and, ultimately, weaken the Quebec government's 
autonomy.
<P>
	This is why the Bloc Quebecois opposes Bill C-91 and is in 
favour of maintaining the existing structure if the government is 
not prepared to propose new ways which would truly promote 
regional development and which would also help the regions 
take control of their development.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to add some observations about Bill C-91 before the 
legislation is sent to the Standing Committee on Industry.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This new bill will enable the Business Development Bank of 
Canada to expand its activities and to provide programs and 
services to meet the changing needs of Canadian small business, 
particularly with respect to improved access to financing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It has been 20 years since the current Federal Business 
Development Bank was established by legislation. At that time 
the hon. member for Windsor West spoke in the House on the 
incorporation of the FBDB saying it would further encourage 
and assist the establishment and growth of Canadian small 
business and indeed it has. The  bank has lent over $4 billion to 
Canadian entrepreneurs at no cost to taxpayers. This amount is 
estimated to have created more than 30,000 jobs in the past six 
years alone.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	Hon. members are well aware of the important role small 
businesses play in the new knowledge based economy that has 
emerged in the 1990s, an economy characterized by rapid 
technological change, intense global competition and 
innovation.
<P>
	As the economy becomes global the smaller players are 
becoming more influential. Small businesses have the 
flexibility to respond quickly to niche market opportunities; 
they can keep up with change and innovate aggressively. This 
was summarized by the Standing Committee on Industry in its 
report last October entitled ``Taking Care of Small Business''. 
The committee wrote: ``The smallness of these firms is a clear 
advantage. It makes it easier for them to sustain innovation and 
an entrepreneurial spirit. Indeed, several of the most prosperous 
and competitive economies in the world today are based on 
small firms.''
<P>
	Canada now has about two million small businesses, an 
increase of one-third since 1982. Today, 99 per cent of all 
registered businesses have fewer than 100 employees. Since 
1992, in the last three years, small businesses have created 
virtually all of the net new jobs in Canada. Canadians will 
continue to look to small business for new jobs and economic 
growth. Small businesses, including the self-employed, now 
account for almost two-thirds of private sector employment and 
60 per cent of our economic output.
<P>
	However, small businesses face unprecedented challenges. In 
the face of intense global competition, small businesses need to 
upgrade their management skills, find employees with the right 
skills mix for their market niche, develop or acquire technology 
that helps them to innovate, and develop very quickly the ability 
to tap into foreign markets.
<P>
	The government has addressed small business issues in a 
variety of ways. I will point out that this government has placed 
a high priority on responding to the challenges faced by small 
businesses. We made small businesses the centre of our 
economic platform in the red book. We published a position 
paper entitled ``Growing Small Businesses'' to accompany the 
1994 budget. Since that time we have received valuable input on 
small business issues from a wide variety of informed sources 
from within government, the private sector, and parliamentary 
groups.
<P>
	We have had numerous combined discussions within our 
federal Liberal caucus, a working group set up under Industry 
Canada with the private sector and leadership from within 
Industry Canada. Throughout these various studies several 
recurring themes emerged. One message was that small business 
has a vast untapped potential for creating more jobs and more 
wealth. Another theme was the government role must be to 
facilitate the efforts of  those outside government to build an 
innovative and entrepreneurial economy. Finally, the various 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12908"> 12908 </A></B>
<P>
studies brought home the point that government programs must 
become more efficient, effective and relevant to the needs of 
small business.
<P>
	This government has responded through initiatives 
announced in the 1995 budget and in the report, ``Building a 
More Innovative Economy''. This legislation is not in a vacuum; 
it is in the context of a whole series of initiatives to allow small 
business to do what business does best, which is to grow the 
economy, grow new opportunities and new jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	The Federal Business Development Bank has from its 
inception been designed to help tap the potential of small 
businesses to create jobs and wealth, and it has done so in a way 
that is self-financing. This legislation has been drafted so the 
new Business Development Bank of Canada can become more 
efficient, more effective, more relevant to the needs of small 
business.
<P>
	The Business Development Bank of Canada will not compete 
with private sector lending institutions but it will provide 
complementary services.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	The private sector banking community still faces many 
challenges in adequately serving the needs of small and 
medium-sized businesses. Four gaps particularly exist in the 
financing of small business. The first is the so-called risk gap, 
the unwillingness of lending institutions to provide certain 
small businesses loans even at interest rates that reflect the 
higher risks associated with those loans. The second is the size 
gap, the high transaction costs associated with smaller loans and 
investments relative to larger ones. Third is the knowledge gap, 
the reluctance of lenders to provide financing to knowledge 
based, soft asset firms. Finally, the flexibility gap, the 
unwillingness of lenders to provide flexible financing to 
promising businesses that have yet to reach cashflows sufficient 
to service debts.
<P>
	The FBDB has been one of the government's primary policy 
instruments for responding to these gaps as well as to the need of 
small business for management services.
<P>
	It is important that we move quickly on this legislation. I do 
not think there is a member of Parliament in the House who does 
not regularly hear from and meet with small business 
constituents who say consistently that lending, financing, 
dealing with their bank is a major problem for them. There has 
been a substantial change in that relationship. Whether it is an 
existing small business that has been going for many years and 
suddenly finds itself in a different situation because of a 
changing economy or whether it is a new entrepreneur wanting 
to start up and needing the foundation to get started, the 
problems we hear from our constituents, and certainly I do from 
many small businesses in Ottawa West, all focus around the 
problem of financing, either start-up or continuing or expanding 
business.
<P>
	The initiatives being taken to give the Federal Business 
Development Bank more flexibility under its new name to allow 
it to seek out new partnerships will allow it to ensure that small 
business can continue to drive the Canadian economy forward 
into the 21st century. By supporting small businesses through 
the evolving stages of their development, the FBDB helps them 
create jobs and succeed. Now as the Business Development 
Bank of Canada it will have greater flexibility to respond to the 
changing needs of Canadian entrepreneurs.
<P>
	I look forward to the range of debate that can take place in the 
industry committee on this bill and to seeing it reported back to 
the House of Commons quickly so that we can get on with the 
task of helping small business in this country grow the economy 
and grow prosperity for Canadians.

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> When we last examined Bill C-82, 
there were 12 minutes remaining to the hon. member for 
Edmonton Southwest.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege today to speak to Bill C-82, a bill 
that would see the Canadian Mint issue a new coin for use by 
Canadians. This would be a $2 coin to replace a $2 bill.
<P>
	There apparently was a survey done by the mint that stated 
that Canadians would support converting the $2 bill to a $2 coin. 
It also stated that if this was implemented it would save 
Canadian taxpayers $250 million. It may seem odd that perhaps 
Reform would oppose a cost saving measure, but I do not think 
the whole story was told when this survey was implemented. It 
almost seemed like a bit of a fixed survey. Obviously the $2 bill 
is costing Canadian taxpayers because of its short shelf life. 
However, there were a lot of questions that were not asked in the 
survey such as whether Canadians are in favour of having a $2 
denomination at all. Do we need a $2 denomination? In fact if 
we were to remove the $2 bill and not replace it with a $2 coin we 
would save even more dollars. However, I do not believe that 
option was included in the survey the mint used.
<P>
	I think it is important that we not let this thing quickly slip 
through but that we do point out that perhaps there were some 
flaws in the survey and we do need to consider this matter a little 
further.
<P>
	Before I get into this, it does surprise me that this is a high 
priority on the government's legislative agenda, that we are 
talking about the minting of a $2 coin. The House denied 
unanimous consent to debate the Bosnia situation. I guess the 
government members felt that the debate of a $2 coin was more 
important than our concern for our peacekeepers in Bosnia, 
because this is on the Order Paper and we are debating it now 
rather than debating the work of our peacekeepers in that very 
ugly situation.
<P>
	One would have thought the government would have hurried 
the drunk defence bill through committee and to the floor of the 
House so we could debate that. There are several justice bills 
that the government tabled months and months ago. However, it 
seems to be willing to let them lay dormant until the very end of 
the session. It must want to just ram this legislation through at 
the end of the session to try to avoid public exposure to its bills.
<P>
	Here we are today, very near the end of the month of May with 
just a few sitting days left and we are debating the minting of a 
$2 coin. I wonder what Canadians think of the Liberal 
government's priorities in this case. One would think that it 
would be more important to be talking about balancing a budget 
than creating new coins. This is just more money to go into the 
hole with. It is  really strange that we are debating the minting of 
a $2 coin.
<P>
	There has been lots of discussion as to what will be on this 
coin. I may get to that later in my speech. However, I do want to 
talk a bit about the survey the Royal Canadian Mint submitted. 
Approximately 80 per cent of respondents in the survey 
favoured the introduction of a $2 coin to replace the $2 bill. 
However, as I said, this result was achieved only after telling 
Canadians that they would be saved $250 million of their own 
taxpayers' money.
<P>
	The Reform Party is not questioning the fact that the 
government will save the $250 million, which is over 20 years 
by the way, but we are having a problem with the Liberal 
government not taking the time to examine particularly what the 
cost would be to the private sector. At odd times the government 
pays lip service to the private sector and says it is supportive of 
the private sector. But when the rubber hits the road, actions 
always speak louder than words. Here we go again: the Liberal 
government is making a proposition that will cost the private 
sector a big bundle of their own cash.
<P>
	My colleague from Elk Island outlined many of the different 
groups that were not consulted in this survey and that had 
opposition to the bill. The vending machine operators will take 
the brunt of the cost. It is vending machine operators who are 
dependent on coinage in their machines. The conversion of 
existing vending machines to accept the new $2 coins could cost 
up to $800 per machine. That is an additional cost to the private 
sector, small business.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	What will it do with these added costs? Will it swallow them 
and see lost profit? I doubt it very much. Business is usually a 
little smarter than that. It will more than likely pass that cost on 
to the consumer. It will come out of the same old pocket again. 
The consumer taxpayer will be paying not only for the minting 
of this coin but the additional cost passed on by the vendors.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that soft drink manufacturers such as 
Pepsi and Coca Cola are furious about the changes. Vending 
machine operators have still not converted all of their machines 
to accept the loonie. It has been eight years since the loonie was 
introduced. We still do not have all the vending machines 
accepting loonies and now we are talking about minting a $2 
coin and all of the vending machines have to be adjusted to 
accept the new coinage.
<P>
	The Canadian Banking Association has concerns. I know 
there is a member on the other side who was involved with the 
Canadian Banking Association. It has some real problems with 
issuing the new $2 coin. It estimates that right now it has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12910"> 12910 </A></B>
<P>
between 30 and 50 million surplus loonies in its vaults. That is a 
lot of money. If those are recirculated perhaps we would not 
need a $2 minted coin.
<P>
	Heather Sinclair, president of the Canadian Banking 
Association, suggested recirculation of the surplus loonies 
would provide all the coins needed during the removal of the $2 
bill from circulation. We may be able to save Canadian 
taxpayers much more than $250 million if we take a longer look 
at this and do the right thing. The cost of this survey was 
approximately $20,000. It seems a shame to spend $20,000 on a 
survey that was incomplete and perhaps leads us to the wrong 
conclusions.
<P>
	In the survey the mint also asked what 10 themes Canadians 
would prefer on the tail side of the coin. That is an interesting 
question to ask Canadians. I can imagine some of the answers. I 
imagine dead politicians were on the list, perhaps heroes, 
wildlife, landscapes. I wonder if anyone suggested putting Brian 
Mulroney's picture on the $2 coin. Nobody would use it in that 
case. It would be a symbol of bad luck, bad taste and would settle 
the matter right there and the coin would not be issued.
<P>
	It seems the government wants to mint a new $2 coin and that 
this bill will follow the usual passage through the various stages. 
The Liberals will line up and like little voting machines they 
will vote for this piece of legislation without giving it very much 
consideration and we will have a $2 coin.
<P>
	A number of groups have proposed designs for the new $2 
coin. Some of them are rather plausible and certainly have some 
credibility. Others we kind of smile at a little and say we doubt 
very much whether Canadians would want that image stamped 
on to the new $2 coin. Apparently Glendon, Alberta has 
proposed the new coin take on the likeness of the town's symbol, 
a giant perogie on a giant fork. That would be great. We also 
have a big oil can in the town of Rocanville, Saskatchewan. I do 
not know if it has submitted that but it would be another worthy 
suggestion. There is the Ukrainian Easter egg from Vegreville. I 
am sure if we had the former finance minister with us that would 
be his suggestion.
<P>
	I thought of a great Canadian symbol, probably the greatest 
symbol we have of a white elephant in Canada, the Mirabel 
airport. I do not know how we would stamp Mirabel airport on a 
$2 coin, but I am sure our former Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau, 
would be very happy to see that stamped on a $2 coin in memory 
of his great project, probably the most under used airport in 
Canada.
<P>
	We know the minister of public works is looking at a number 
of plausible suggestions for design on his coin. Perhaps the 
minister would want a dingy on it. Perhaps the minister of 
fisheries would want a turbot on it. If it were a turbot we would 
have to make sure it was not a small one. I am sure the minister 
would insist on a sexually mature turbot. That would be only 
reasonable.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	We know the Liberal government is to implement this new 
design. It is very unlikely it will change its mind. It seems to be 
bent on minting a new $2 coin. I thought in all seriousness, if the 
House goes against my wishes and decides to mint a new $2 coin 
without looking further at the cost perhaps it would be time to 
have a prairie symbol stamped on a coin. The prairies have often 
been overlooked and they have much to contribute to the 
national perspective. We have contributed a great amount of 
money to the national economy, as my hon. colleague from 
Lethbridge has said. Canadians hold the prairies in high esteem 
and it is only fitting the new $2 coin, if it is passed by the House, 
be stamped with a prairie symbol.
<P>
	I am sure even hon. colleagues from Ontario and Quebec, the 
Atlantic provinces and our western maritime province in the 
north realize they have had their fair share of symbols stamped 
on our currency. Perhaps it would be time to show some more 
recognition to the prairie region.
<P>
	I have a proposal for the new coin. It is in the image of a white 
tailed deer. These deer are common species on the prairies. They 
are one of the primary game animals of the region. They are still 
plentiful across the prairies and can be found in northern Ontario 
and northern Quebec.
<P>
	They are beautiful animals. They are enjoyed by sportsmen, 
by shutterbugs, by artists and by nature lovers alike. They are 
synonymous with Canadian history and the development of the 
prairie region. They helped sustain our aboriginal peoples long 
before white man even discovered the prairie region.
<P>
	They were important to the pioneers who settled the area in 
the late 19th century. They are very much an appreciated species 
on the prairies.
<P>
	White tailed deer hunting brings more money into 
Saskatchewan than any other hunting or fishing activity. The 
Saskatchewan ministry of the environment and resource 
management calculates $800,000 per year is put into provincial 
coffers alone from the sale of deer licences and a further $3 
million is brought into the province each year by out of province 
and out of country hunters.
<P>
	In 1993 a constituent of mine, Mr. Milo Hansen of Biggar, 
Saskatchewan, a progressive community in the 
Kindersley-Lloydminister constituency, was fortunate enough 
to shoot the world record white tailed buck. The old record was 
set in Nebraska in 1914.
<P>
	That is an incredible accomplishment on the part of Mr. 
Hansen. It has become famous in my part of the world and it 
needs some national exposure. Since the Hansen buck was 
taken, hunting activity in the area has increased and more 
American hunters are coming to Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12911"> 12911 </A></B>
<P>
	A new $2 coin featuring the Hansen buck would be a fitting 
way to commemorate this internationally acclaimed 
achievement of my constituent.
<P>
	Here are some historical reasons why a prairie symbol should 
adorn the new coin. While other parts of Canada have been 
represented on our coins in the past, none have strictly 
represented the prairies. For example, the maple leaf on the 
penny and the beaver on the nickel represent central Canada for 
the main part. The sailing ship on the dime, the beautiful and 
famous <I>Bluenose</I>, represents the Atlantic region. The moose on 
the quarter and the loon on the dollar represent the Canadian 
shield in the north. Putting a prairie symbol on the new $2 coin 
would create a regional balance on our nation's coins.
<P>
	I understand the mint has done some public consultation 
about the nature of the new coin and I trust the continuing 
tradition of representing Canadian wildlife remains a popular 
option. I assure the House that the town of Biggar, Saskatchewan 
is supporting this proposal, as are many other Saskatchewan and 
prairie members of Parliament.
<P>
	The Hansen buck is truly a great Canadian achievement and 
therefore I propose the new coin be designed in the image of a 
white tailed deer as nearly as possible in the minting of coins to 
the actual Hansen buck. I have a poster of it in my office. If any 
members would like to see this beautiful animal they are more 
than welcome to stop by. I would be very happy and very proud 
to show them how beautiful this specimen is.
<P>
	I have been a bit facetious in some of my remarks about some 
of the potential images that could go on the coin. Probably we 
should not even mint the coin unless we are absolutely sure 
Canadians understand all the alternatives.
<P>
	If that does not happen, if that dialogue is not permitted, if the 
mint goes ahead with this plan after it is approved by the House I 
would ask the House and the mint, the department of public 
works, to give serious consideration first and foremost to a 
prairie symbol being on the coin. Second, if it pleases 
Canadians, members of the House and the mint, and I hope it 
would, I ask they give serious consideration to stamping an 
image of the Hansen buck on the new $2 coin.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the remarks of the hon. 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to remind him that during the last 
election campaign and in our red book we undertook to reduce 
the deficit, and we believe that by introducing this new $2 coin 
we will realize some extremely interesting profits on the order 
of $250 million.
<P>
	I am a little confused because, since their arrival in the House, 
the members of the Reform Party have repeatedly told us that we 
must make cuts in every way possible and now what do I hear but 
this member and the member for Elk Island telling us ``yes, 
but''. The member for Elk Island actually said that the Reform 
Party would go so far as to vote against the bill. I can hardly 
believe my ears, and I would like some further explanation from 
my colleague.
<P>
	As for vending machines, it should be pointed out that 
operators will not be obliged to conform immediately to the new 
legislation and adjust to the new coinage.
<P>
	It should also be said that vending machine operators will 
undoubtedly take the opportunity to increase their profits, since 
this $2 coin will make it possible to offer complete meals, that is 
meals that will cost a bit more. With the new technology, it will 
be possible to have hot meals, just as it will be possible to have 
larger refrigerated meals.
<P>
	I ask my colleague, in all fairness to the Canadian men and 
women listening to us, to comment on what I have just said.
<P>
	I would also like to say that during the survey done with 
respect to this $2 coin, Canadians were split almost equally in 
their response to the first question concerning their wish to have 
such a coin. In response to the second question, which pointed 
out that there would be savings of $250 million over twenty 
years, the percentage in favour rose sharply to 79 per cent. I 
would like my colleague's comments on this matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. I took a stab at answering that question in my speech 
but I would be happy to review some of those facts with the hon. 
member.
<P>
	As I said in my speech, all the options were not considered in 
that survey. We really should have asked Canadians whether 
they felt there should be a $2 currency at all. Maybe we should 
eliminate the $2 bill, which is very expenses, and not replace it 
with a $2 coin. Perhaps in five years with inflation having done 
its thing there would be a recommendation for a $5 coin. Then 
we would have to revamp all the vending machines, mint a new 
coin and go through the procedure once again.
<P>
	We should be talking how we can save Canadian taxpayers the 
most money. I suggest in that consideration we look at whether 
there should be a $2 currency period, coin or bill. If it were 
determined we do not need that it would save much more than 
$250 million. That is what I was trying to get across to hon. 
members on the other side, had they been listening a little more 
closely.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Another thing we should be looking at is whether we still need 
the penny in Canada. Pennies are extremely expensive. We have 
been minting pennies because people hoard them. Pennies are 
put into jars and never get back  into circulation. It is even worse 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12912"> 12912 </A></B>
<P>
than the loonie which apparently is being stored in bank vaults. 
There are millions of them.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, forgive me for interrupting the 
answer. Of course, the hon. member will have the floor when we 
have finished.
<P>
	Earlier today we had a request from the hon. member for Red 
Deer and the hon. member for Roberval and I am prepared to 
make my ruling in the application for an emergency debate.
<P>
	I have listened carefully to the application of the hon. 
members for Red Deer and Roberval under Standing Order 52 
for an emergency debate on the current crisis in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina. I have decided that the two applications 
do meet the exigencies stipulated in Standing Order 52. 
Consequently a debate will take place this day at 8 p.m.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
<P>
	There have been conversations among the parties in the House 
in anticipation of the ruling of the Speaker. I think you would 
find unanimous consent that the debate commence at 6.30 p.m. 
rather than 8 p.m. and that the debate finish at 10.30 p.m. rather 
than at midnight. The effect would be to have the usual four 
hours for the emergency debate but to allow for the debate to 
proceed immediately after adjournment at 6.30 p.m.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if you were to offer that to the House, I believe 
you would find in the spirit of co-operation that such an 
agreement has been made among the parties and you would find 
consent to commence the debate at the time I have just suggested 
and to end it accordingly.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, you have heard the explanation 
of the government whip. Is there unanimous agreement that the 
debate do begin at 6.30 p.m. and terminate at 10.30 p.m. this 
day?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-82, an act to amend the Royal Canadian Mint Act, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was speaking about the 
penny in answering the hon. member's question. I suggested we 
should view whether or not we need the penny in circulation 
because it is of an extremely high cost to Canadians because 
they hoard them.
<P>
	The real problem why we need the penny is rather ironic. It is 
because we have the GST which adds 7 per cent to everything. 
The Liberals promised to do away with the GST. I am sure that 
retailers and businesses across the country would be happy to 
deal in increments of 5 cents and we could do away with the 
penny. But how do they not charge GST on 39 cents or 59 cents 
of goods? If the government had kept its promise to eliminate 
the GST, perhaps we could be talking about not only doing away 
with the $2 currency but doing away with the penny as well and 
saving considerably more than $250 million for Canadian 
taxpayers and consumers.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my understanding that a bimetallic $2 coin requires new 
technology. My opinion is it would be a terrific advantage. The 
Royal Canadian Mint and Canadian suppliers are working 
together to compete for foreign production contracts for 
bimetallic coins.
<P>
	I would be interested to hear from the hon. member about the 
advantages and the source of revenue this might provide.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I tried to follow the question 
but I missed a little bit of it there.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	It seemed to me that the hon. member was talking about the 
opportunities to market the minting of coins which would 
stimulate jobs and would have some economic spinoff. 
Certainly, if we can do that internationally that is fine. If the 
Mexicans want to mint a new peso and they ask us to provide the 
technology, that is wonderful. If we can have a long term plan to 
improve the minting of our own Canadian coin that would be 
wonderful.
<P>
	However, there are flaws with this survey. It states that there 
are two main concerns with the implementation of the $2 coin. 
First, it seems as though there is no overall strategy with regard 
to our currency. We are talking about different weights and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12913"> 12913 </A></B>
<P>
fact that we may have to re-mint all of our coins. Why are we 
going to implement a new $2 coin and then find out that we have 
to change our loonie, quarter, nickel and dime because the 
weights are not right?
<P>
	It is going to be a cruel joke on Canadian business. Certainly it 
will be a cruel joke on those who are manufacturing vending 
machines because they are going to have to refit those machines 
annually or every two or three years. It is just not well thought 
out. We also have to consider the cost to the Canadian consumer 
which would be immense, far more than $250 million and far 
more than any economic stimulus generated by the minting of 
new coins in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise in the House today to speak about Bill 
C-82, an act to amend the Royal Canadian Mint Act.
<P>
	Allow me to begin my speech with a digression. I am making 
my comments in the House of Commons today as the Bloc 
Quebecois' deputy critic for Government Services and Public 
Works; the Bloc Quebecois' main critic for this department is 
the hon. member for Québec-Est, Jean-Paul Marchand.
<P>
	As deputy critic and member for Charlevoix, it is my pleasure 
to take the floor regarding this bill. I may be present in the 
House today, but my thoughts are elsewhere. In my riding, 
workers are threatened by the closure of employment centres in 
La Malbaie, Forestville and Baie-Comeau. I am also thinking of 
all of the problems associated with unemployment in my riding, 
which affect all workers, unemployed persons and welfare 
recipients in the RCM of Charlevoix East and West.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary may feel that this has no bearing 
on the bill. If he lets me continue, he will realize that what the 
people of Charlevoix want is to work in order to have money in 
their pockets, whether it be in the form of a bill or a coin. This is 
a superficial issue and, in my opinion, discussing whether the 
denomination is made of paper or another material is a waste of 
time: the people of Charlevoix are concerned with working and 
earning money.
<P>
	I would also like to remind the parliamentary secretary of 
what he mentioned earlier to the Reform member regarding the 
red book, and I would ask him to reread the three little words 
which got the government elected: ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. Closing 
employment centres, declaring the employees of manpower 
centres surplus and determining unemployment zones will not 
stimulate local economies.
<P>
	If this legislation is passed, the two dollar bill will be replaced 
by a two dollar coin at the beginning of 1996. All two dollar bills 
will be returned to the Bank of Canada for disposal. The federal 
government can only introduce this new two dollar coin if it 
obtains Parliament's approval, since the proportion of nickel, 
bronze and aluminum in this new coin is not specified in Part II 
of the schedule to the Royal Canadian Mint Act.
<P>
	If Part II of the schedule to the Royal Canadian Mint Act 
already specified the coin's composition, the government would 
not be required to obtain Parliament's approval prior to minting 
it.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	The government's main argument in an effort to get the House 
to adopt the bill is that the introduction of a $2 coin will generate 
savings of approximately $250 million over 20 years. They do 
say every little bit counts, but, taken over 20 years, this amount 
is almost negligible compared with the amount of the deficit.
<P>
	In its information paper, the Royal Canadian Mint states that 
the introduction of a $2 coin, which, in passing, will be larger 
and heavier than the $1 coin, serves the needs of business. They 
should have said, ``some businesses'', because not all business 
people look kindly on this bill. The proof lies in the fact that the 
federal government had to conduct two surveys of businesses 
and consumers, since the results of the first survey were not in 
favour of introducing the $2 coin.
<P>
	The surveys were done by the Environics firm. It surveyed 
1,020 people in Sherbrooke, Toronto and Calgary-far too few 
in my estimation. The first survey revealed strong opposition of 
46 per cent and weak support of 50 per cent. In the second 
survey, they let it be known that the federal government would 
save $250 million over 20 years. The government's project then 
received the approval of 80 per cent of respondents.
<P>
	Clearly the Royal Canadian Mint wanted immediate public 
support for the introduction of a $2 coin. Further on in the 
report, we note that some survey respondents felt that any saving 
made by introducing a $2 coin would be offset by the start up 
costs of producing the new coin and that jobs would be lost in the 
pulp and paper industry as a result.
<P>
	The government report also indicates, and I quote: ``The 
introduction of the $1 coin was accompanied by increased use of 
the $2 bill, indicating that the public might resist the 
introduction of a $2 coin''.
<P>
	Given that the trial coin chosen for the new $2 coin is heavier 
and larger than the loonie, I am sure the public will not support 
the introduction of such a coin.
<P>
	Here is a surprising point about the survey questions. At no 
point did the Environics survey include a question about 
completely eliminating the $2 denomination. It is a bit odd, is it 
not? Instead of introducing a $2 coin, the federal government 
should simply eliminate the bill and the $2 denomination and 
encourage people to use the loonie more.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12914"> 12914 </A></B>
<P>
	Many countries, such as the United States and Great Britain, 
have never had a $2 denomination or have simply done away 
with it. So, we can certainly do without it.
<P>
	This is how the federal government could make real savings. 
There would be no new coin to strike nor new bills to print for 
the Royal Canadian Mint. There would be no expense for 
retailers. And, finally, better use would be made of the $1 coins. 
The Canadian Bankers' Association speaking on behalf of the 
financial institutions, has reached the same conclusion. What is 
more, many retailers' and consumers' associations have no 
official position on Bill C-82, quite simply because they do not 
know the government is preparing to introduce a $2 coin. They 
have heard nothing about it and are surprised to discover that the 
bill has gone so far.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Once again, the government seems to be trying to pull the 
wool over our eyes, if I may say so. If it had really wanted to take 
the pulse of the nation, it would have launched an information 
campaign on the possibility of legislating the replacement of the 
$2 bill by a $2 coin. The response to such proposed legislation 
would certainly have been negative. People are still having a 
hard time accepting the loonie, and eight years later, the 
government wants to burden their pockets with yet another coin.
<P>
	Contrary to what the parliamentary secretary to the Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services would have had us 
believe, last week, the $1 coin is not as popular as the 
government would like it to be. The proof is that more than 50 
million $1 coins lay dormant in the vaults of Canadian banks. 
According to its own management, the Royal Canadian Mint 
must manufacture 1.25 times more $1 coins than it did $1 bills, 
because people empty their pockets, stockpile the coins at home, 
and then deposit them inn their bank or credit union account. It 
is estimated that there are around $10 million worth of $1 coins 
in Canadians' piggy banks. This is really incredible. 
Subsequently, financial institutions must store these coins in 
their vaults. I have trouble imagining the amount of space 
necessary to store all these coins and the personnel required to 
handle this job.
<P>
	Moreover, I would like to point out to my colleagues that 
financial institutions do not earn interest on the coins they have 
in their vaults, which translates into lost revenues for them, and 
that they cannot return them to the Bank of Canada. It does not 
take back uncirculated coins, and banks and credit unions will 
have to manage their own stock of coins.
<P>
	Although the government is anticipating savings of $250 
million over 20 years, one should not forget that there are costs 
associated with the introduction of this new coin. We only have 
to think of all the cash registers, the vending machines, the 
parking meters, and the laundromat machines, and other 
automated dispensers of  all kinds which will have to be 
modified in order to accept this new coin.
<P>
	The government estimates that it will cost $25 million to 
modify vending machines. Owners, for their part, will have had 
to modify their machines twice in less than 10 years since, as 
you may recall, the federal government introduced the $1 
coin-also known as the loonie-eight years ago. And if that 
was not enough, the government now wants to alter the 
composition of the penny, the nickel, the dime, the quarter and 
the fifty cent coin to make them lighter. This will entail the 
additional cost of altering vending machines so that they can 
take all Canadian coins whatever their composition. In addition, 
the alloy used for the penny would be of much lower quality than 
the current version. This will result in premature rusting of the 
coin.
<P>
	Who will pay for all these changes? You and I, Mr. Speaker, 
along with all Quebecers and Canadians. The items now 
available for $1.75 or $1.90 from vending machines will cost $2 
tomorrow, as happened after the $1 coin was introduced, when 
the cost of items formerly priced at 80 or 90 cents quickly rose to 
$1. This point was also raised by the people polled by 
Environics. As usual, the government passes the cost of the 
changes on to retailers, who can only pass it on to their 
customers.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I suggest that the federal government should 
launch a publicity campaign aimed at finding out the opinion of 
the Canadian people on this issue. However, the government 
must play fair and promote all possible alternatives, that is, to 
issue a new $2 coin, keep the $2 bill or simply eliminate the $2 
denomination.
<P>
	I am sure that, in the end, the people would choose to abolish 
the $2 denomination in order to achieve greater savings in the 
short, medium and long term. Finally, with the developments in 
debit card technology, people will see a gradual reduction in the 
number of bills and coins in circulation, as they are being 
replaced with electronic money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to what my hon. colleague from 
Charlevoix said, and I note that he recognizes that substantial 
savings, to the tune of $250 million, will be made.
<P>
	Must I point out at this time that, if this measure were also 
applied to the penny, nickel, dime, quarter and 50 cent coin, we 
would save an extra $500 million? That is a rather significant 
amount.
<P>
	I must say that the technological know-how gained while 
producing this new $2 coin will certainly be used in the future 
for other Canadian coins and, as a bonus, we can export this 
technology anywhere in the world for a profit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12915"> 12915 </A></B>
<P>
	Although my hon. colleague from Charlevoix did not refer 
to it specifically, I would like to address the initial remarks 
made by the public works critic, my hon. colleague for 
Québec-Est, who put forward extremely alarmist figures in his 
remarks, stating that it would cost coin-operated vending 
machine operators approximately $400 million to adjust to the 
introduction of the new $2 coin. I am sure that my hon. 
colleague from Charlevoix, who just spoke in support of his 
colleague from Québec-Est, will be able to explain to this 
House and to all Canadians where this $400 million figure 
comes from, so as to not scare people needlessly.
<P>
	Vending machine operators will have a full year after this bill 
receives royal assent to adjust. Even then, they will not be 
required to do so. We must always bear in mind that any vending 
machine operator who decides to raise his prices will have to 
hold up to the competition.
<P>
	I would like my hon. colleague from Charlevoix to comment 
on these two points, explaining where this $400 million figure 
comes from and whether competition should continue to come 
into play with respect to vending machines.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, it goes without saying that we 
support the idea of saving money; the government mentioned 
the figure of $250 million over a 20-year period by replacing 
two dollar bills with two dollar coins. True, the coin would last 
much longer; but there are costs involved in issuing such a new 
coin. The government does not need to issue another coin; it 
should simply abolish that denomination.
<P>
	If the two dollar bill is replaced by a two dollar coin, it will 
result in savings of $250 million over 20 years, but how much 
would be saved if we issued more two dollar bills?
<P>
	In reference to the figure of $400 million mentioned in the 
speech made on Friday by the Bloc critic, the hon. member for 
Québec-Est, Jean-Paul Marchand, it may be that I am missing 
some element, but I said that, in my opinion, it would be 
possible to save $25 million, in the short term.
<P>
	I challenge anyone in this House to tell me just how much, 
give or take two dollars, it would cost the municipalities to make 
the necessary changes to their parking meters, not to mention 
such other items as vending machines. What would be the costs 
of such changes?
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	I doubt anyone here can provide such an accurate figure. 
However, before passing such legislation, we have to take a look 
at the costs involved for those who own vending machines. 
These costs will also be passed on to consumers. Indeed, 
consumers always end up footing the bill.
<P>
	In conclusion, the government should seriously consider 
abolishing the two dollar denomination. This would help 
circulate the $10 billion in one dollar coins which are currently 
unused and kept in Canadian banks. The minute people have a 
couple of one dollar coins in their pocket, they exchange them 
for a two dollar bill, because they find these coins to be 
cumbersome.
<P>
	Indeed, when we have a few of these coins, we quickly 
exchange them for bills. Consequently, if you add an even 
heavier and more cumbersome two dollar coin, you will create a 
problem for everyone, and that becomes a real nuisance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the hon. member. It would seem to me 
that if someone gets $4 in change, four loonies would certainly 
be heavier than two $2 coins, so I am having difficulty 
understanding that argument.
<P>
	Has the hon. member taken into consideration in any of his 
numbers the value of the new technology and the advantages we 
as Canadians could receive from exporting such technology?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I explained that earlier. Consumers 
are turning increasingly to electronic money, to cards from 
various financial institutions. We must get used to this 
technology. But I think that the purpose of today's debate is not 
to determine whether four loonies weigh more than two $2 
coins. Let us get real.
<P>
	We are ready to help the government reduce the deficit, and 
we are ready to eliminate the $2 denomination, and I am 
convinced that, in the interest of eliminating the deficit, the 
Canadian public will certainly agree. The loonie which was put 
into circulation eight years ago, can be used for a much longer 
period of time that the dollar bill it replaced. If we did away with 
the $2 denomination, the loonie could be used more effectively.
<P>
	The United States and Great Britain have eliminated the $1 
coin and the $2 bill and the two pound note. Let us follow their 
lead and we might save even more that what we are now 
contemplating. The government just decided one day to issue a 
$2 bill and today finds itself wondering whether this 
denomination continues to serve any purpose.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to congratulate my colleague for Charlevoix for 
taking such a responsible stance. He demonstrated, for example, 
that we in this House are reduced to discussing bills of this kind 
which are of little or no importance. This bill does not really 
create savings, will actually cost consumers money and, to top it 
off, does not even create any jobs. I agree that we should use 
more of our time to debate bills that are much more serious than 
this one.
<P>
	I would also like to ask my colleague, if you will allow me Mr. 
Speaker, if in effect he can see any good in this  bill? Regarding 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12916"> 12916 </A></B>
<P>
the $400 million he mentioned, we calculated that business 
people are going to have to buy new cash registers, that 
municipalities may have to install new parking meters and that 
all vending machines will have to be recalibrated and changed. 
This will cost the private sector a lot of money and consumers 
will ultimately foot the bill.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The consumer will be the one who pays. In fact, the only party 
that this bill will help is the Royal Canadian Mint. So I ask my 
colleague for Charlevoix if he can see anything good about this 
bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for Québec-Est for his question. It has enabled me to 
digress and say that, this afternoon, I felt I was wasting my time 
in the House. I would have preferred to be in the riding of 
Charlevoix, working with the people there who are threatened 
with losing their jobs and who will be declared redundant as the 
result of the Axworthy reform.
<P>
	I think we are wasting our time discussing such a trivial 
matter as the introduction of a $2 coin. We are not talking about 
the real problems of the economy. We are going to create 
problems. The purpose of government is to resolve problems, 
not to create them.
<P>
	I am a bit embarrassed knowing that, in my riding of 
Charlevoix, the unemployed have mobilized to combat the 
Axworthy reform. Some of them are now on welfare. As I was 
saying, as far as paying for groceries is concerned, it makes little 
difference whether $2 is a bill or a coin; the main thing is to have 
some money. People are willing to work to earn some money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
start with, I would like to tell my colleague from Charlevoix that 
I am in complete agreement with him, especially on what he said 
in the conclusion of his speech. Not knowing that he would talk 
in the House about the workers in Charlevoix, and the relevance 
of the $2 coin, I will start my speech this way.
<P>
	I was pleasantly surprised to hear that the Liberals had given 
in to the joint demands of the Bloc and of the Reform Party and 
agreed to an emergency debate on Bosnia, but not before this 
evening. In spite of the fact that 326 hostages, including 55 
Canadians, are being held in Bosnia, that we have learned that 
the head of Bosnian diplomacy was killed yesterday, that the 
conflict has led to 200,000 deaths, that the Reform Party and the 
Bloc Quebecois are asking for an emergency debate to be held 
immediately on a matter of extreme urgency, we are told that 
there are too many emergencies, too many important debates, 
such as this one on the $2 coin.
<P>
	We now know what the priorities of our colleagues opposite 
are. Canadians soldiers and UN troops have to take a back seat to 
the debate on the relevance of the $2 coin. In this context, I will 
be pleased to spend a few minutes discussing whether the $2 bill 
should be maintained or withdrawn from currency.
<P>
	First, I would be pleased to provide you with a few facts and 
figures. Today, in Canada, it costs around $30 million a year to 
produce, print and issue $2 bills. They have approximately a one 
year life expectancy, some do not last as long, but the average 
life expectancy is around one year; as I said, the total cost of 
producing $2 bills is approximately $30 million.
<P>
	So, we question and rightfully so-the thinkers and 
mandarins are probably conducting studies on the subject and 
they will spend tens of thousands of dollars, maybe 
millions-whether we should continue this great Canadian 
tradition of a $2 bill with the Queen's effigy.
<P>
	A $2 coin could save $250 million over a 20-year period. 
Therefore, many Canadians will say: ``Down with the $2 bill and 
up with the $2 coin which will make us save $250 million over 
20 years''. A simple decision.
<P>
	However, we should go a little deeper and look at more 
rational arguments. Earlier we were talking about technology. If 
we do not proceed with a $2 coin will we still have nickels, 
dimes, quarters and loonies? Why not apply technology to this? 
Do not try to make us believe in a lot of things which make no 
sense.
<P>
	First of all, the Royal Canadian Mint and it alone will save 
money, not you and me, not the taxpayers, not the merchants and 
certainly not the people operating vending machines.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	There was no lobbying from vending machine manufacturers 
because the whole thing was obvious. We had estimations based 
on the same principle as the figures given to us earlier. As the 
member for Charlevoix said, it is estimated that the $2 coin will 
necessarily cost vending machine manufacturers around $300 
million.
<P>
	This is an estimate just as our colleagues opposite used the 
word ``estimated'' to say that there will be savings of around 
$250 million. Why an estimate? Because there has been no 
serious study on a change like the introduction of a $2 coin.
<P>
	Therefore, I and the Bloc Quebecois propose to abolish the $2 
bill or at least to undertake a serious study showing the real 
savings that could result from the replacement of the $2 bill with 
a $2 coin.
<P>
	While bringing these changes to the Canadian monetary 
system we could take the opportunity to abolish the penny, 
which costs one and a half cents to produce. There are presently 
an estimated 10 billion of those coins in circulation. Ten billion 
one cent coins which cost one and a half cents each to produce. It 
is important to repeat it. Lets put an end to that waste by 
eliminating the one cent coin and the two dollar bill. For once 
the government could recover that money, that is tens of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12917"> 12917 </A></B>
<P>
millions of dollars a year, and put it clearly and totally into a 
definite policy designed to create jobs and help the poor.
<P>
	Tens of millions of dollars, even billions of dollars, are 
currently being cut in transfer payments to provinces and 
systems such as these will be allowed to continue.
<P>
	What we are saying is that we will save tens of millions of 
dollars by abolishing the $2 bills, but instead of losing this 
amount in overall public spending, we should develop a good 
framework and put in place a specific program of job creation or 
assistance to poor people.
<P>
	In view of the current economic and social situation, we have 
neither the right nor the means to invest funds in areas such as 
these, when thousands of our fellow citizens live below the 
poverty line and destitute people are knocking at our doors every 
day.
<P>
	To quote only one example, a lady came to my riding office. 
This 62-year old lady cannot get old age benefits from the 
federal government and does not have any salary insurance 
because she never had a job. Many women of her generation 
stayed at home, so they are not eligible for salary insurance. So, 
this woman is getting welfare payments of $642 a month. She 
came to me asking: ``Is there a solution to my problem?'' 
Situations such as these, how many dozens are there in my 
riding, how many thousands are there in Quebec and in Canada? 
And here we are discussing changing $2 coins for paper bills. As 
my colleague for Charlevoix was saying earlier, I think that it is 
a shame to brag about such things in the House.
<P>
	Do not tell me that the government has no other possibility or 
place to spend the savings that could be made, to help people 
like that woman or thousands of others in our ridings, rather than 
perpetuating a timeworn system or replace it with a system just 
as inappropriate, because the $2 coin would be inappropriate. 
Our American neighbours have no $2 bill, and they are not any 
worse off for it. The same can be said of other countries. It is a 
very easy system to understand.
<P>
	The Royal Canadian Mint-someone talked earlier about the 
Royal Quebec Mint but there is no such thing-says its position 
is based on a survey. Before we go to the questions and 
comments period, it is important to put this survey in its true 
context. This survey was biased because of the questions it 
contained. You will ask how it was biased. Simply because it 
asked people if they were in favour of keeping the $2 bill or if 
they preferred to save tens of millions of dollars. People were 
never asked if they were in favour of abolishing the $2 
denomination, because the answer was known already. 
Quebecers are used to biased surveys. They have seen many of 
them in the past.
<P>
	People never had a chance to ask themselves if they were for 
or against the abolition of the $2 denomination. I am convinced 
that we cannot allow such a waste of public and private money at 
a time when our society faces serious problems and our country 
is sick.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	My speech is a drop in the ocean of words spoken in this 
House on this debate. However, it is through such savings that 
we must show our concern for the population. If we wish to 
restore people's confidence in politics, politicians and the 
House of Commons, minor debates that may not seem very 
important can enable us to save tens of millions of dollars per 
year, as we have seen in this case, perhaps even hundreds of 
millions of dollars with one cent coins and two dollar bills, in 
order to ensure proper redistribution among our businesses, 
create jobs and help the disadvantaged, as I said earlier.
<P>
	Concrete examples such as those I just listed would allow us 
to save millions of dollars and hopefully create thousands of 
jobs.
<P>
	In closing, simply eliminating the $2 denomination would 
save some $30 million a year and the one cent coin, several 
millions of dollars. In addition, except for children with piggy 
banks, everyone would be happy not to have these coins in their 
pockets.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a very simple question to ask my hon. colleague 
for Terrebonne. He nevertheless recognizes that rather 
substantial savings will be made, to the tune of $250 million. I 
would like to say a few words about the metal content of the new 
coin. It will be made of copper, aluminum and nickel. Would it 
be more acceptable to the Bloc members if the base material for 
this coin came from Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Let me just say this to my hon. colleague that 
I do not know the periodical chart by heart; perhaps a chocolate 
coin wrapped in gold foil would be better. Seriously, our point is 
that the $2 coin your are proposing makes no sense. The people 
of Canada know it. Content-whether nickel, plutonium or what 
not-is not the issue, but rather the basis or rationale for this 
bill. Tell me which clause deals with coin alloys in the bill 
before us, then I will take your question seriously.

IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from May 15 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-88, an act to implement the agreement on internal 
trade, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
afternoon I will finish the speech I started a couple of weeks ago 
on Bill C-88, an act to implement an agreement on internal 
trade.
<P>
	Just to set the stage, Bill C-88 is like Bill C-85, which is the 
bill dealing with pension reform. There is a lot more fluff than 
real substance in this bill. Indeed it is another failure to deal 
with the serious problems that we have in Canada.
<P>
	Past federal governments have preoccupied themselves with 
provincial concerns such as social programs. They have spent 
time rewriting our Constitution over and over while failing to 
live by the one already in place. They have stepped on 
provinces, taken their resource revenues and used them to fund 
their grant infrastructure projects, but they have not enforced 
the constitutional provisions which require free trade among 
provinces.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	The federal government has also been and continues to be the 
instigator or accomplice in a number of interprovincial barriers. 
Because of various fiscal transfer programs such as regional 
development and block funding, Ottawa manages to hide the 
true costs to provincial residents of the barriers their provinces 
have erected.
<P>
	If jobs are killed in one province due to barriers, then federal 
welfare dollars and federal grants to inefficient business help to 
alleviate the fiscal pain that a province would otherwise suffer. 
In fact, the more inefficient a province is, the more it is 
compensated by Ottawa. There is no incentive here for a 
province to correct its mistakes.
<P>
	Ottawa also inhibits the free movement of labour. The 
unemployment insurance scheme the Liberals so cherish has 
provided incentives for the unemployed to remain in place 
rather than moving to regions where jobs are more plentiful. 
This is indisputably borne out by the facts.
<P>
	For example, our Atlantic provinces continue to suffer from 
chronic higher unemployment than the rest of the country. This 
is due in most part to the incentive provided by unemployment 
insurance for the unemployed to remain in place. The problem is 
especially severe because in regions that do not fare worse than 
others, the federal government has increased the benefits 
available, sinking those who use the benefits further into 
dependency on the government.
<P>
	We have been hearing for a long time now about social 
program reform and the wonderful job our human resources 
development minister is doing, but we have yet to see 
meaningful changes to the system that will actually give a hand 
up to Canadians rather than just a hand out. When this happens, 
consumers will see more clearly that certain provincial policies 
have worked to their detriment and that eliminating barriers is in 
everyone's best interests.
<P>
	It is long past time for the federal government to take 
leadership on these issues. This problem is costing the economy 
billions of dollars and thousands of jobs. Yes, the Liberals were 
given a mandate to govern using the methods they find most 
appropriate, but this was based on a series of promised outcomes 
contained in the red book, most of which have been broken.
<P>
	The red ink book promised: ``A Liberal government will be 
committed to the elimination of interprovincial trade barriers 
within Canada and will address this issue urgently''. Where is 
the elimination of trade barriers which was so clearly promised 
in the election rhetoric? Yes, it looks fairly certain that a few 
barriers may be reduced with this agreement but as I have 
already pointed out, new barriers could also arise.
<P>
	We are a long, long way from barrier elimination. Based on 
the current pace of progress, we are not going to see this promise 
fulfilled by the next election. This is the time the Canadian 
people will have an opportunity to judge these Liberals for their 
failure to keep their promises. By then the Liberal inaction will 
have cost billions more dollars and will have prevented 
thousands of Canadians on the welfare and unemployment lists 
from finding meaningful employment.
<P>
	Reformers have the policies and the people to implement a 
Canada-wide free trade plan. If the Liberals will not do this, 
then I believe the Canadian people will give Reformers the 
mandate to do it.
<P>
	What are the problems I am talking about? Where are the 
barriers today? Obviously, I am not going to list each of the 
several hundred, but I would like to mention a few major 
barriers that must come down quickly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12919"> 12919 </A></B>
<P>
	The first barrier which comes to mind is one that has a large 
effect on employment in my riding. There is a modern brewery 
in Simcoe Centre that employs hundreds of Canadians. Over 
the years this brewery could have employed more people, 
expanded its operations and even become efficient enough to 
compete with major American brewers. This did not happen 
because its market has been restricted by trade walls erected 
by provinces, including Ontario, in an attempt to protect their 
local brewers.
<P>
	The protectionism that insulated and sustained these 
inefficient brewers for so long will now be the death of many of 
them. International trade pressures are already forcing smaller, 
inefficient breweries out of business. Brewing is a $9.6 billion 
retail industry in Canada so even small reductions in production 
costs due to greater economies of scale will produce better 
prices for consumers and a more competitive economy.
<P>
	To their credit, some brewers have taken the initiative and 
have used our external free trade agreements to their benefit. As 
a result, it is now easier to find certain New Brunswick brands of 
beer on store shelves in San Antonio and Los Angeles than it is 
to find them in Toronto or Montreal. It saddens me that this is the 
current twisted reality.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, the success story I just described has a 
downside at least for those breweries that are not ready to 
compete. American brewers are gaining more and more access 
to our domestic beer market through GATT, NAFTA and free 
trade and will force out those who cannot compete.
<P>
	As an example, a single brewery in Colorado Springs, 
Colorado produces all the beer under a particular label for the 
entire United States market, a market of 250 million people. The 
facility is so large it ships bulk product 3,000 kilometres to 
Virginia for canning. Then it is distributed up and down the east 
coast of the United States. How can we expect breweries that 
produce only enough product for a few hundred thousand 
consumers to remain in business? It is difficult to compete with 
that economy of scale.
<P>
	I believe Canadians wish to see these impediments to freedom 
done away with and receive the most efficient and economic 
value possible for their hard earned wages. Beer is such an 
obvious area of concern for consumers that I was amazed to 
learn the industry had been exempted from the provincial 
agreement altogether. We need to focus serious efforts in this 
area or risk losing thousands more jobs in an increasingly 
competitive world.
<P>
	Another barrier of major importance that must be dealt with 
quickly is the barrier each province erects when conducting its 
own government procurement. The provinces have a long 
history of purchasing from within their own borders regardless 
of cost. This raises the cost of purchasing.
<P>
	According to the Consumers' Association of Canada some 
provinces pay up to 10 per cent more for local products, which in 
turn raises government expenditure and taxes. It also costs jobs 
in other provinces because the most efficient producers cannot 
sell outside their own provinces. Some jobs may be protected 
locally but just like the brewing industry, these local producers 
are insulated and inefficient.
<P>
	The higher taxes affect all Canadians and cost more jobs in 
total than attempting to protect the local industry they will save.
<P>
	One writer on economics remarked 200 years ago: ``It is the 
maxim of every prudent master of a family never to attempt to 
make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy. 
The tailor does not attempt to make his own shoes, but buys 
them from the shoemaker. The shoemaker does not attempt to 
make his own clothes, but employs a tailor. The farmer attempts 
to make neither the one nor the other, but employs those who 
can.
<P>
	``All of them find it for their interest to employ their whole 
industry in a way in which they have some advantage over their 
neighbours, and to purchase with part of its produce, whatever 
else they have occasion for. What is prudence in the conduct of 
every private family can scarce be folly in that of a great 
kingdom''.
<P>
	Adam Smith wrote that in <I>The Wealth of Nations</I>. Yet it would 
seem that centuries later our brilliant political elite has not yet 
been able to grasp this simple truth.
<P>
	The industry minister attempted to achieve a deal on the issue 
of government procurement but due to the shortsightedness of 
some provinces their agreement was window dressing only. 
Crown corporations which do much of the procurement in 
question are completely exempt from this arrangement. With all 
the exemptions available elsewhere in the agreement it is 
unclear if there will be any meaningful improvement in 
government procurement either.
<P>
	It is important that we make it a high priority to get the 
provinces back to the table and to remove these barriers to 
competitiveness. Interprovincial barriers to trade and financial 
services create once again a higher cost to consumers, cost 
financial institutions their competitive position and cost 
Canadians jobs.
<P>
	This also affects another major employer of my riding, a trust 
company which finds restrictions on selling its services outside 
Ontario. Conversely, trusts from outside Ontario also find 
difficult and expensive barriers to entry to the Ontario financial 
markets.
<P>
	Trust companies find barriers to trade in the different 
regulations each province sets up. A highest common 
denominator approach must be taken to selling services in more 
than one market, thereby increasing costs. A standard set of 
regulations for all provinces would eliminate administrative 
overhead, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12920"> 12920 </A></B>
<P>
would produce more competitiveness, would lower costs for 
consumers and ultimately would create more jobs.
<P>
	A further barrier to trade is the restriction placed on various 
types of labour mobility between provinces. This is a particular 
concern to an area such as Ottawa-Hull which straddles a 
provincial boundary but it still affects other Canadians in 
serious ways.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	Many of us are familiar with the dispute which erupted last 
year between Ontario and Quebec on the issue of construction. It 
was one of many trade barriers which prevented professionals 
and labourers from offering their services across Canada. It 
meant that competition was reduced and it resulted in higher 
costs and taxes for consumers. Fortunately, Ontario and Quebec 
managed to resolve their differences on this single issue to the 
benefit of both.
<P>
	That deal is the exception rather than the rule. It is time for us 
to dispense with these issues once and for all. For generations 
we have allowed the inefficiencies of small, protected, regional 
markets in many goods and services to constrict the economy, 
hurt our political and cultural objectives and cost us jobs.
<P>
	Labour mobility is an area of trade which has been opened up 
between Canada and the United States under the free trade 
agreement. Once again as with beer, professionals such as 
accountants and engineers can more easily ply their trade 
between Ontario and the American states than they can between 
Ontario and Quebec. If we are to remain a developed country we 
must keep on developing our resources, especially our human 
resources, or risk losing them to more developed countries.
<P>
	It is important to look at other examples of trade 
arrangements to determine what is best for us. The United States 
is a good example of a country where wide open commerce 
between jurisdictions negotiated and enforced by a national 
government has led to greater prosperity for the whole nation. 
Barriers were challenged and eliminated in the United States 
early in the history of the country and it has prospered ever 
since. The previous example of the Colorado brewery is a good 
example of the reason that Canadians need the same freedoms.
<P>
	In Canada we have spent great energy concentrating on our 
external trading relationships which account for 25 per cent of 
our economy. The Americans count on exports for only 8 per 
cent of their economy and yet are a far more prosperous nation. 
There is certainly a message for Canada in this. We must become 
more focused on reducing barriers when it comes to domestic 
trade.
<P>
	The European Union is a modern day example of a trading 
relationship which has sprung out of the realization that free 
trade benefits everyone regardless of language or region. There 
are some real lessons for Canadians in this. The European Union 
has not only established free trade in goods, produce and capital, 
but also has free trade in labour as well. The citizens of any  
European country now have the right to work in any other 
European country. Because labour was made more transferable, 
common certification had to be implemented in a number of 
areas.
<P>
	While the system has not achieved perfection yet, it is an 
improvement in the lives of all citizens. Surely if Europeans of 
different languages and ethnic backgrounds can achieve such an 
agreement over the borders of nations, then Canadians must be 
able to resolve the few differences which exist between 
provinces.
<P>
	In present day Canada there is over $146 billion worth of trade 
between the provinces. There are also at least 500 barriers to 
interprovincial trade in Canada and each one costs jobs, money, 
growth and competitiveness which has hurt all Canadians 
directly. They are forced to pay higher prices for products such 
as eggs, milk, beer and financial services. They have to pay 
higher taxes in order that the provincial government can favour 
inefficient local producers over best value for money producers 
elsewhere.
<P>
	These barriers are a problem which can be solved unilaterally 
in many cases by a determined federal government. Even small 
improvements in reducing barriers can mean big gains for the 
country. It is time for us to get serious about dealing with them.
<P>
	Reformers have written policies on these issues. I will share 
them with the House.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports the removal of interprovincial 
barriers to trade through agreements which include trade dispute 
settlement mechanisms among the provinces. Should the 
provinces fail to co-operate in the removal of interprovincial 
trade barriers, the Reform Party supports constitutional 
challenges to such impediments wherever possible.
<P>
	I believe this statement is self-explanatory and I mentioned 
earlier that Reformers have a plan to deal with trade barriers. It 
is the constitutional law already set in place to deal with exactly 
such problems.
<P>
	Section 121 of the British North America Act states: ``All 
articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of any one of the 
provinces shall, from and after the union, be admitted free into 
each of the other provinces''. Also, section 91 of the British 
North America Act states: ``The exclusive legislative authority 
of the Parliament of Canada extends to the regulation of trade 
and commerce''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12921"> 12921 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	It is obvious from these two sections that interprovincial trade 
is an exclusive federal jurisdiction and the provinces are 
violating the intent of the Constitution when they erect barriers 
to trade. A Reform government would do everything necessary 
to enforce these constitutional principles.
<P>
	The industry minister stated, after signing the deal last July, 
that: ``Our governments have achieved this voluntarily, not 
through arbitrary and contentious attempts to use federal powers 
or other forms of coercion''. This statement underlines the 
fundamental difference between Liberals and Reformers. 
Liberals, always anxious never to rock the boat or step on any 
toes, are happy with tiny steps or even stepping backward if they 
think they can put a good face on it.
<P>
	Reformers are much more interested in dealing with reality 
and solving problems. It is plain to see that the provinces are 
violating the intent of the Constitution. In the best interest of all 
Canadians, Reformers wish to see the situation rectified. If this 
means using some federal power or coercion to see fundamental 
constitutional law complied with, then so be it.
<P>
	The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, also a 
constitutional appendix, states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every citizen or permanent resident of Canada has the right to move to and 
take up residence in any province and to pursue the gaining of a livelihood in 
any province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This right has been successfully used in court challenges to 
strike down provincial laws that prevent professionals from 
working in different jurisdictions. Most notable was the case of 
a New Brunswick accountant who wished to conduct some 
affairs in P.E.I. Because island law prohibited him from working 
there, he took P.E.I. to court and won, based on his charter 
mobility right.
<P>
	Reformers support the free movement of labour across 
provincial borders. We believe the government must work 
quickly to ensure that these goals are achieved.
<P>
	In analysing the facts, it is all very well and good to say that 
Canadians have these rights, but what businessman has the time, 
money and patience to pursue court cases in every jurisdiction 
just so he can go to work? This has to be recognized as an 
impediment to the free flow of labour and it is past time for the 
provinces to remove these impediments. They have 
significantly added to the cost of doing business and have 
deterred new business. We benefit our American cousins when 
we abuse our own citizenry. Many now look south to expand 
because the walls east and west in Canada are too high to climb 
over.
<P>
	Governments, not private citizens, have the responsibility to 
deal with these issues and to do so urgently, as the industry 
minister stated.
<P>
	Reformers find themselves unable to support a bill that lends 
credibility to the first ministers' failure of last summer. We 
demand that the federal government enforce the Constitution 
which contains the necessary authority to allow free trade 
between the provinces, especially section 121, section 91 and 
the charter mobility right and to do everything in its power to 
ensure that all provincial barriers are eliminated.
<P>
	We also demand that federal programs that compensate for 
provincial barriers by redistributing wealth and programs that 
inhibit the free trade of labour be eliminated.
<P>
	The bottom line is that interprovincial trade barriers mean 
lost jobs for Canadians, higher taxes and product costs, and a 
less competitive economy with which to face the world.
<P>
	As I said at the opening of my remarks, Bill C-88, approving 
the trade agreement in its present form is a major 
disappointment for two major reasons. The first is that it fails to 
give Canadians a golden opportunity to create the thousands of 
jobs so desperately needed today.
<P>
	The second and perhaps more important reason is that it is 
another broken red book promise. This is at a time when all of us 
here should be doing all we can to restore that lost trust between 
voters and the politicians. Another lost opportunity, another step 
backward.
<P>
	For all the reasons stated, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``that'' 
and substituting the following therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-88, an act to 
implement the agreement on internal trade because it fails to eliminate all 
interprovincial trade barriers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The amendment of the member for 
Simcoe Centre is receivable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to participate in the debate on this very 
important bill, which has almost gone unnoticed and has the 
potential to alter the very basis of internal trade in Canada. That 
is why I welcome this opportunity to speak on Bill C-88, an act 
to implement the Agreement on Internal Trade.
<P>
	We will recall that this agreement is the fruit of very difficult, 
very strenuous negotiations that went on from 1987 to July 
1994, less than a year ago, when 11 governments, together with 
the governments of the Yukon and the Northwest Territories, 
finally came to an agreement. The purpose of the agreement was 
obviously to enter into some kind of domestic free trade 
agreement for Canada.
<P>
	This agreement affects 11 main fields of economic activity, 
which I shall list for the sake of clarity. These fields of activity 
are as follows: government procurement, investments, work 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12922"> 12922 </A></B>
<P>
force mobility, consumer standards, agri-food production, 
alcoholic beverages, natural  resources processing, 
communications, transportation, energy and environmental 
protection.
<P>
	At this stage, I want to tell this House that the Bloc Quebecois, 
as the official opposition, is for internal trade and, in that sense, 
supports the bill. On the other hand, the Bloc Quebecois flatly 
rejects the role, powers and importance the federal government 
gives itself in this bill. And this is what we will be illustrating.
<P>
	We disagree with this bill in three regards: first, the context in 
which this bill was introduced; second, the actual wording of 
clause 9, which is the main clause in Bill C-88; and third, the 
rationale behind clause 9.
<P>
	First, with respect to the context in which Bill C-88 was 
presented, it is very shocking as it exemplifies this 
government's logic, its habit of making decisions without prior 
consultation with the provinces, preferring to do things on the 
sly, while at the same time having no mandate to do so. We 
learned from a reliable source that, at the last meeting of the 
federal and provincial ministers responsible for internal trade in 
Canada, which was held on April 10, 1995 in Calgary, the 
federal government never stated its intention and never received 
from the parties the mandate to do what is being proposed today.
<P>
	Second point with respect to the context, although the parties 
agreed that the dispute settlement mechanism, which is often the 
stumbling block in this type of agreement, should be based on 
the good faith of the parties and not on judicial procedures, that 
is what the federal government chose to do, again without 
consulting anyone. It chose the judicial route through clause 9, 
to which I will come back in a moment.
<P>
	Finally, still as regards the context, this bill shows how the 
federal government sees its role in internal trade and gives itself 
the power to interfere in interprovincial disputes, although this 
power is not granted anywhere in the agreement.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	I now come to clause 9 which, as I said earlier, is the 
cornerstone of this bill. I will read it to you because it is worth 
reading. I can assure you that this clause will soon change the 
way this country is run. Through clause 9, the federal 
government gives itself the following powers:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>9.(1) For the purpose of suspending benefits or imposing retaliatory 
measures of equivalent effect against a province pursuant to Article 1710 of the 
Agreement, the Governor in Council may, by order, do any one or more of the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) suspend rights or privileges granted by the government of Canada to the 
province under the Agreement or any federal law;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) modify or suspend the application of any federal law with respect to the 
province;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>c</I>) extend the application of any federal law to the province; and;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>d</I>) take any other measure that the Governor in Council considers necessary.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) In this section, ``federal law'' means the whole or any portion of any Act of 
Parliament or any regulation, order or other instrument issued, made or 
established in the exercise of a power conferred by or under an Act of Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Two phrases are worthy of note: ``by order'' and ``pursuant to 
Article 1710 of the Agreement''. I will look at this clause more 
closely with the emphasis on the words ``by order''.
<P>
	Therefore, the governor in council may, ``by order'', suspend 
benefits or impose retaliatory measures of equivalent effect 
against a province. ``By order'' means that, without 
consultation, debate, or resolution of the House of Commons, 
the rights or privileges granted by the Government of Canada to 
said province at fault may be suspended under the agreement or 
a federal law.
<P>
	The governor in council may, ``by order'', modify or suspend 
the application of any federal law with respect to the province. 
The governor in council may, ``by order'', extend the 
application of any federal law to the province. And, as if this 
were not enough, the federal government may, again without 
any mandate, ``by order'', take any other measure considered 
necessary.
<P>
	This is why Premier Parizeau referred to this as a trade war 
measure. This is quite a statement, considering it comes from 
the Premier of Quebec.
<P>
	There is also the reference ``pursuant to Article 1710''. Let 
me read you quickly the provision which, I feel, is the most 
important one of the 13 paragraphs of Article 1710.
<P>
	Paragraph 7 reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In considering what benefits to suspend, or retaliatory measures to impose, 
the complaining Party shall:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) suspend benefits or impose measures in the same sector as the measure 
found to be in violation of the Agreement; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) only if such suspension or imposition would be impracticable or ineffective, 
suspend benefits or impose retaliatory measures in other sectors covered by the 
Agreement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are referring to Article 1710 which implies that, if there is 
a problem with manpower mobility, and if it is not possible to 
impose a similar retaliatory measure against the province at 
fault, it is implied that retaliatory measures could be taken 
regarding natural resources, communications or investment, for 
example. This is what is provided.
<P>
	It must be pointed out that this whole agreement, and 
particularly Article 1710, is very vague as regards the role of the 
federal government. Can the government intervene in a dispute 
between two provinces, once it is determined which province is 
at fault? This is not at all clear in the agreement as it is worded.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12923"> 12923 </A></B>
<P>
	Given our Canadian history, we know how much the federal 
government resents any vacuum.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Now, we are faced with a legal vacuum. We know how much 
the federal government abhors a vacuum. Given the way it has 
used its spending and residual powers in the past, we can count 
on the federal government to take full advantage of vague 
wording in the bill. As a matter of fact, it just took the necessary 
means to be able to interfere freely to have unruly provinces toe 
the line.
<P>
	Reactions have been quite interesting. The Minister of 
Industry, who is the minister responsible under the act, said that 
the official opposition's reaction is paranoid and that our 
remarks are weird. However, Manon Cornellier, who has been 
following this issue for years, questioned two officials of the 
internal trade secretariat, Mr. Lecherson and Mr. Knox, hours 
after the tabling of the bill.
<P>
	Mr. Lecherson is a senior strategy advisor. When asked about 
the scope of the bill and its compliance with the intent of the 
agreement and the scope of the bill, he said: ``As a matter of fact, 
the bill goes further than the agreement itself``. Mr. Knox, who 
is the executive director of the secretariat, said: ``In theory, the 
government could take retaliatory measures deemed appropriate 
in any sector, but that is very unlikely. They would be basically 
economic measures''.
<P>
	Now, we are dealing here strictly with economic issues. These 
remarks suggest that the federal government would even target 
social programs in order to make an unruly province, Quebec for 
example, toe the line. That door has been opened, and that is why 
it seems legitimate to impute motives. Given the lack of 
openness of this government, we are justified in imputing 
motives.
<P>
	There was an official reaction, and I want to quote paragraphs 
3 and 4 of a letter Daniel Paillé, the Quebec Minister of Industry, 
Commerce, Science and Technology, sent to his Canadian 
counterpart, on May 10, 1995: ``The government of Quebec 
thinks it is unacceptable, pursuant to a Canada-wide agreement 
where the federal government enters into a partnership with the 
other parties to an agreement and where the scope of action 
given to the various partners is well defined by chapter 17 of the 
agreement, that the federal government found it important to 
give itself such extended powers as those mentioned in clause 9 
of the implementing bill. Therefore, the government of Quebec 
is opposed to this provision, which gives the federal government 
very extended powers that go beyond what is needed to 
implement the retaliatory measures provided for in chapter 17 of 
the agreement''.
<P>
	I think that is quite clear. We have to imagine what all this 
would mean in the normal course of events. Although a number 
of examples were given earlier, we could give some more in 
order to really show all the significance of the issue being 
underhandedly addressed here. For example, any province at 
fault could be denied  federal subsidies. If Quebec, for instance, 
were to be found at fault in some hypothetical situation, Hydro 
Quebec could be prevented from selling its electricity to another 
province.
<P>
	Natural gas shipments to a province at fault could be banned. 
This is a very serious issue. In terms of work force mobility, it 
could mean that workers from one province could be prevented 
from working in another province recognized as the party at 
fault in a dispute between these two provinces. These are powers 
the federal government is assuming, because nowhere in the 
agreement is it mentioned that Ottawa has to introduce such a 
bill.
<P>
	This may not have been the government's intention, but if this 
bill is adopted in its present form, the federal government will 
be able to take such measures under clause 9, and that is what 
makes the situation so serious. Finally, we have reservations 
regarding the origin of clause 9. I was shocked when it was first 
drawn to my attention.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	In fact, clause 9 is essentially identical to section 21 of 
NAFTA except for certain references to the fact that the latter is 
an international agreement. What the government did in clause 9 
is to replace the word ``country'' that is found in section 21 by 
the word ``province''. As far as I am concerned, there is no 
better example of a lazy or careless government.
<P>
	It seems too easy to copy almost word for word such an 
important document because the problems are different and the 
relationships that exist between sovereign countries are not 
similar to the ones that can exist between a central government 
and its provincial counterparts. I find it rather astounding that 
the government would take the liberty of just changing the word 
``country'' for the word ``province'' while taking the 
opportunity to give itself enormous powers.
<P>
	Perhaps there are visionaries in the Langevin Block-which 
is not impossible-who saw that there will soon be a need for an 
international treaty between the Government of Canada and the 
Government of Quebec and who thought that it would be better 
to save some time, money and energy and recognize 
immediately, in a rather subtle way, that Quebec would be party 
to an international agreement because the day is coming when 
Quebecers will have to deal officially at the international level 
with Canada as well as with the United States and other 
countries. This goes with the Bloc Quebecois's recent 
suggestion that there must be an economic association, that the 
closest ties must be maintained and that we must be good 
neighbours.
<P>
	In closing, I think that clause 9 must be amended so as to 
reflect the spirit of the agreement and to limit the federal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12924"> 12924 </A></B>
<P>
government's intervention as an injured party, otherwise Bill 
C-88 is likely to create problems instead of solving them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to debate Bill C-88, the 
implementing legislation for the supposed internal trade 
agreement within Canada.
<P>
	Of all of the bills that have come through the House in the past 
months this one is perhaps of more importance than many 
others. As my hon. colleague who spoke mentioned, it seems to 
have slipped through with very little interest on the part of the 
House and Canadians at large.
<P>
	In my comments today I would like to spend a few minutes 
talking about what the trade barriers cost us as individuals. Also 
I am going to spend a good deal of time talking about the 
relationship between Quebec and the rest of the country. This is 
really what it boils down to. When our friends from Quebec talk 
about a relationship with the rest of the country, post separation, 
they are really talking about how they would keep all the 
benefits that we have together in this northern part of North 
America without shooting each other in the foot.
<P>
	This has to be of paramount importance to the people of 
Quebec. They would not be very happy if they found themselves 
in an independent country, bankrupt and no one to trade with. 
Nor would the rest of Canadians find themselves in a very happy 
situation. I want to spend a few moments if I may to record 
exactly how important this trade is between Canada 
interprovincially, Canada nationally.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	I am indebted for much of what I am going to say to the Fraser 
Institute and in particular-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Liberals opposite go into a state of shock 
when I mention the Fraser Institute. Also, by good fortune, the 
Canadian and Quebec Chambers of Commerce have just sent 
information to all members in the House. I will be quoting from 
both of those sources during the course of my comments.
<P>
	A few of the Liberals opposite might recall that when the free 
trade agreement was implemented they were violently opposed 
to it. Am I remembering this correctly? Was that just a 
suspicion?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Yes, yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Yes, it is correct. I hear members opposite 
saying: ``Yes, I can remember we were against the free trade 
agreement. We were violently against the free trade 
agreement''. One of the reasons members opposite were against 
the free trade agreement at that time was that they were afraid 
we were going to get beat up by the Americans because we had 
fairly inefficient industries across the country.
<P>
	For the longest time particularly the west suffered and were 
righteously aggrieved by the fact that the resource producing 
areas of the country, the west, the north and the east were 
subsidizing central Canada. We were exporting raw materials to 
central Canada and buying manufactured goods from central 
Canada at a sometimes severe tariff.
<P>
	It cost us a lot of money to be Canadians. A lot of people, 
particularly in Ontario and Quebec, saw the free trade 
agreement as a vehicle whereby these barriers were reduced and 
came down. Canada found itself in a situation where it had to 
compete.
<P>
	The free trade agreement was not so terrifying for other 
regions of the country. I can recall during the great free trade 
debate-I am sure members in the House can recall-we had 
high interest rates. Remember that? We had a high dollar. 
Remember that? We were going to go into a free trade agreement 
with one of the toughest trading nations in the world and we 
wonder why we got the stuffing kicked out of us. We had to be 
brain dead to have these interprovincial trade barriers all across 
the country, a high dollar, high interest rates and getting into a 
free trade agreement with the United States.
<P>
	It was kind of like the Monty Python movie where the knight 
gets his arm cut off, his other arm cut off, puts his sword in his 
mouth, gets his legs cut off and says: ``Come on, fight like a 
man''. That was Canada after the free trade agreement. We were 
sitting there with a sword in our mouth saying: ``Fight fair. Fight 
fair''. We have a free trade agreement with the United States, but 
do we have a free trade agreement within Canada? No, we do 
not.
<P>
	When the federal government sat down at a table to negotiate 
a free trade agreement, as we did with Mexico and the United 
States, we had three players around the table and all of the 
minions that made the deal work. Can members imagine what it 
must have been like when we had the federal government and 10 
provinces sitting around the table trying to negotiate a free trade 
agreement?
<P>
	The provinces varied. British Columbia had demands about 
an inch thick saying: ``This is what we want. This is what we 
want to protect''. The province of Alberta's demands were on 
one sheet of paper which said: ``There should not be any barriers 
to trade. There should not be any barriers to the movement and 
the transportation of capital, of ideas and of people.
<P>
	Ontario which had the most to lose in a free trade agreement in 
Canada because it controls the bulk of the trade was one of the 
most accommodating provinces at the debate. It was prepared in 
the national interest to have its internal trade barriers come 
down for the common good.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12925"> 12925 </A></B>
<P>
	The reason that I am speaking against this legislation is not 
that it is not a step in the right direction.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	The federal government in its role as the leader has the 
fiduciary responsibility when it comes to dealing with the 
economic affairs of the nation to take charge and say we need 
competitive industries in Canada. How can we possibly compete 
internationally if we are not first competitive at home?
<P>
	How can we as a nation deal competitively with other nations 
if we do not first take down all of the barriers in Canada so we 
have free movement of trade, people, capital and ideas to 
become as efficient as we can before we start trading elsewhere? 
That is why it is so important to have all of these internal trade 
barriers done away with.
<P>
	I will use as an example some of the daily problems that come 
up when we have trade barriers or distorting subsidies within the 
country. We know Quebec has been working very hard at 
developing export and increasing the export potential of 
industries based in Quebec. It has been fairly successful. I do not 
know the exact the numbers but Quebec has had a substantial 
increase in recent years of exports by Quebec based industries.
<P>
	Let us say the Quebec government gives company A a subsidy 
in order to export outside the country but company A is 
manufacturing a product which is also manufactured in Ontario 
or British Columbia or Nova Scotia and they do not have 
subsidy. What happens when they both start to compete for same 
domestic customer? The company that has the $200,000 
government tax funded subsidy wins and the company that does 
not have a subsidy loses because its costs are higher. That does 
absolutely nothing to enhance the competitiveness of our 
industries. All it does is reward industries that are perhaps 
failing, that are perhaps not as competitive as others at the 
expense of those businesses that can stand on their own.
<P>
	That is one of the reasons governments should not be picking 
winners and losers in the marketplace, creating subsidies so one 
company in one province has a competitive advantage over 
another company in another province. All it does is move a job 
from A to B.
<P>
	A while ago in the automobile industry a company in 
Brampton received a huge grant from the federal government to 
build a plant in Quebec. The people in Quebec would want it. 
The company would end up manufacturing the same number of 
cars. It would close the plant in Ontario, open a plant in Quebec, 
lay off 200 people in Ontario, hire 50 people in Quebec. It would 
cost the country 150 jobs in one province plus the infrastructure 
investment to build the plant in the second province.
<P>
	If we as legislators, as a Parliament, are prepared to throw this 
money around, can we blame industry for saying it wants a piece 
of it? If we ourselves in business and we are competing against 
another business with the advantage of a government grant or 
subsidy, in order to stay in business we have to get our hands in 
the trough as well.
<P>
	That is why we need to break down the barriers to capital. We 
need to break down the mobility barriers and we absolutely have 
to stop taking tax money into the government and picking 
winners and losers in the marketplace.
<P>
	When we talk about interprovincial trade, historically if we 
look at what has gone on in Canada, where did the Bank of Nova 
Scotia start? Rhetorically I ask, did it have its head office in 
Toronto or Montreal? It was in Halifax. What happened in the 
trading arrangements or what happened in Canada that all of a 
sudden somehow the Bank of Nova Scotia's head office moves 
to Toronto? We have distorted interprovincial trade so that it has 
protected industries across the country.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	The traditional trade at the time the Bank of Nova Scotia was 
incorporated was not east-west but north-south, just as the 
trading blocks all across the country traditionally have been. We 
artificially make them east and west. However, is it focuses all 
the financial resource and the competitive resource where most 
of the people are.
<P>
	The same thing may happen in Canada today. We will 
continue to have this migration of wealth into the resource. 
When I say the resource rich I am talking about the vote rich 
parts of Canada, in downtown Toronto and Montreal, at the 
expense of the rest of the country unless we have this free 
mobility and free trade within all provinces.
<P>
	I will put a few facts on record concerning trade between 
Quebec and the rest of the country. This is of particular 
importance because our friends from the Bloc, representing a 
good number of people in Quebec, are trying to put forth the 
premise that Quebec would be better off not attached to the rest 
of the country and the rest of the country would be better off not 
attached to Quebec.
<P>
	We would survive. Those of us who live in the west would 
survive better than others but it would hurt all of us. Most of all, 
it would hurt the people who live in Quebec. We should not be so 
naive as to suggest for a moment that a separate Quebec would 
enjoy all or any of the privileges it enjoys today. It is certainly a 
long stretch to imagine the rest of the country would tell Quebec 
to go its way and we will continue to pretend nothing has 
happened and it is business as usual.
<P>
	The premier of Quebec and other leaders in Quebec can say 
whatever they want to but it is important for the people in 
Quebec to know those leaders do not set the stage or make the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12926"> 12926 </A></B>
<P>
rules for the rest of the country. The  rest of the country will 
bring an entirely and completely different perspective to that 
table.
<P>
	I will quote from a pamphlet prepared by the Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce, la Chambre de commerce du Québec, 
``Interprovincial Trade: Engine of Economic Growth'', 
prepared in May: ``This report also points to the fact that these 
strong, commercial and personal relationships bind us together 
and reinforce our strength as a trading nation. Strategic and 
dynamic partnerships are often formed among Canadian 
companies and entrepreneurs to win in international markets in 
the new global environment.
<P>
	``Our message is clear and simple. Together we prosper. 
Together we are the vehicle for job creation for the next 
generation in this country, and our interprovincial trading 
relationships are the engine of that growth. Together we must 
continue to build on these existing relationships which only 
enhance our competitive position, internationally improve our 
ability to create jobs and confirm our status as the best country 
in the world''.
<P>
	What is this trade to Quebec? The pamphlet further says that 
while all provinces are dependent on interprovincial trade, 
Quebec is much more economically dependent on trade with the 
other provinces than the other provinces are with Quebec. 
Quebec exported more to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in 
1989 than to any country in Europe, including France. It sold as 
much to Ontario as it did to the United States. The rest of the 
provinces exported more to Quebec than to the European union 
and Japan combined.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	Four hundred and seventy thousand jobs in Quebec were 
directly and indirectly attributable to interprovincial exports in 
1989. It is not only the Montreal based enterprises that export 
goods and services to markets in other provinces. Manufacturers 
in other regions such as Estrie, Mauricie, Bois-Francs and 
Abitibi-Témiscamingue are also highly dependent on sales to 
other parts of Canada.
<P>
	Quebec was the only province other than Ontario that 
registered a surplus in interprovincial trade, helping to offset 
partially its trade imbalance, trade deficit with the rest of the 
world.
<P>
	Ontario is Quebec's most important trading partner within 
Canada. Quebec ran a deficit in its trade with Ontario. Quebec's 
surplus in trade with other provinces came from the more distant 
provinces, suggesting the importance for Quebec of access to 
those regions.
<P>
	This is perhaps the most important part of Bill C-88 and what 
we are talking about today. It really speaks to the whole nature 
of our union, what it is all about. We do not all have to speak the 
same language. It is not even necessary for us to be able to 
understand each other's first language. It is important for all of 
us to understand that when we reach into our pocket and pull out 
a $5 bill or $1 bill or perhaps even a $2 coin and exchange it, we  
are speaking the same language. Trade has no language. The 
nature of our country is that if there is commercial discourse in 
commercial trade and if we keep the lines and avenues and rivers 
of trade open between all parts of Canada, particularly between 
Quebec and the rest of the country, everything else is bound to 
follow.
<P>
	As a nation we are talking about maintaining trade links with 
other parts of the world. If we trade with other countries we 
learn about other countries. We must ensure trade between 
provinces so that we will learn from each other. It is difficult to 
have a bad relationship with someone with whom we have a 
good trading relationship. If we have a commercial relationship 
which benefits both parties, we will be far more reticent to do or 
say anything that would imperil that relationship.
<P>
	I am happy to have had an opportunity to put a few thoughts on 
record in this debate. I am sorry the government did not use the 
opportunity to be far more forceful in ensuring the many barriers 
that still exist are torn down.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just 
listened to the Reform member's speech, about which I would 
simply like to raise a few small points.
<P>
	He said that if Quebec were to declare its sovereignty, the rest 
of Canada would most certainly refuse to trade with it and to 
maintain current business relationships. I can only wonder if 
they are merely sabre rattling or if there is something more 
behind this. Can the frustration of western Canada still be so 
near to the boiling point? I do not know.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	But when I imagine an independent or sovereign Quebec, I 
can only wonder whether you will refuse to sell us the beef we 
are accustomed to buying from you. After sovereignty, would 
you refuse to sell us beer made by Ontario breweries? Would you 
force us to buy our cars from the United States or France? Even 
the cold war with eastern block countries did not prevent 
members of the Reform Party, westerners, from selling 
thousands of tonnes of grain to Russia yearly, despite conflicts 
in ideology, to say the least.
<P>
	I would like to ask them on what basis they would decide to 
cease selling to us-because Quebec attained sovereignty, took 
full possession of its means and its tools? I think that they would 
only be shooting themselves in the foot and scoring in their own 
nets. At any rate, that is my opinion and I would ask him to 
answer me. Is this anything more than sabre rattling?
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="12927"> 12927 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I left the impression that the 
rest of the country would not trade with Quebec, I certainly did 
not mean to do that. The point I wanted to make was how 
important trade is among all the provinces of Canada, including 
Quebec, and how vitally important trade is to the province of 
Quebec, probably more so than other provinces in the country, 
because Quebec has a resource very much built on trade and 
export.
<P>
	What I did say was that the people of Quebec should not be 
misled into thinking that it would be automatic that things would 
go on as before. If the people of Quebec think for one minute 
that they would be able to exist behind trade barriers that would 
not be the case.
<P>
	I would certainly hope, and I agree with my hon. colleague, 
that we would not do anything to shoot each other in the foot. 
That would not do any good. It would be a hard nosed 
commercial relationship. It would mean that instead of having 
our market, our critical mass would be 25 per cent lower. We 
would not have the same economies of scale. It would be far 
more difficult for Quebec in an international world market to be 
a world scale producer, because Quebec could not depend upon 
having the Canadian domestic market to enable it to be an 
international producer. It would hurt everybody, and it would 
hurt Quebec perhaps more than the rest of the country.
<P>
	I would not suggest for a moment that we would do anything 
to shoot ourselves or Quebec in the foot.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would also like to respond to comments by the member for 
Edmonton Southwest and I will have an opportunity to do so 
during the debate on Bill C-88. However, I must first provide a 
few details on the bill.
<P>
	Often, when we are discussing bills in the House, people tune 
us in on television or come in to the House not knowing what the 
discussion is about. This is why I would first like to provide a 
few details about Bill C-88 itself. This government bill is aimed 
at promoting freer trade between Canada's provinces. It puts a 
number of administrative measures into effect to permit freer 
trade as of July 1, 1995, that is, in barely a month or two.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	A whole series of measures are involved, as are a number of 
laws governing, for example, transportation, public liability, 
communications and other matters. Therefore, first and 
foremost, this bill, puts into place the measures that will lead to 
freer trade in Canada.
<P>
	When we speak of liberalizing trade, we mean that, in 
principle, people, capital and goods should move as freely as 
possible and that uniform standards and rules will be established 
so that one province cannot prevent the free movement of goods, 
capital and people.
<P>
	The most striking example is, of course, the limits on the 
movement and production of beer in Canada. Each province was 
required, so to speak, to produce a certain volume of beer, which 
could not be exported from one province to another. Quebec 
could not export its production to Ontario and vice versa. 
Marketing will now be freer, and not only for alcoholic 
beverages, but also for such sectors as farm products, food, 
communications, transportation, energy and, of course, 
manpower.
<P>
	This bill from all appearances improves the trading system in 
Canada. I should point out that, as regards the liberalization of 
trade in Canada, Quebec has always been in favour of freer 
trade. It strongly supported free trade with the United States. We 
believe in unrestricted competition. In Quebec, we believe in the 
ability to compete on the open market.
<P>
	However, this bill contains a few flaws, important flaws, such 
as the fact that a panel can be set up if disputes arise. Problems 
may occur. Disputes may have to be settled. In such cases, this 
bill provides for the creation of a panel to review disputes. 
Should one province accuse another of not playing by the rules, 
the mandate of such a panel would be to review the situation and 
recommend retaliatory measures on behalf of the injured party, 
the one that would have been somehow wronged.
<P>
	This panel would have no power to enforce. It would only 
have the authority to review the problem and recommend 
retaliatory measures where required. And here we come to the 
troubling part, since, in the end, retaliatory measures will rest in 
the hands of the federal government.
<P>
	Not only will the members of this panel and of the committee 
that will oversee the enforcement of this piece of legislation be 
appointed by order in council without being ratified by the 
House of Commons-which is a flaw one must point out-but 
once again, through this bill, the federal government is seizing 
additional powers, the authority to enforce the panel's 
decisions, and even to intervene when it, the federal 
government, is not involved.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Indeed, the wording of clause 19-or more precisely article 
1710, but mainly clause 19-leaves room for interpretation, in 
such a way that if there is a dispute between two provinces, and 
the federal government is not directly involved, it can intervene. 
It can exercise its power of judgment so that one province is 
favourably judged, even favoured over another.
<P>
	In fact, the federal government is taking on a lot of power, too 
much power, in our view, the power to intervene in disputes 
between provinces, if need be. These are powers it has assumed, 
without being asked to. The federal government is assuming the 
power to intervene in disputes between provinces. We think that 
this is in fact an abuse of power. Why would the federal  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12928"> 12928 </A></B>
<P>
government interfere in interprovincial disputes in which it is 
not involved?
<P>
	This is not the first time this government has tabled a bill in an 
attempt to give itself additional powers. As you probably know, 
it tried to give itself additional powers through Bill C-52, for 
example, which would allow the government to compete with 
engineering and architectural firms in Canada, and Bill C-91, 
which would change the mandate of the Federal Business 
Development Bank. Again, the federal government gives itself 
new powers that would allow it to centralize operations and 
intervene in the country's development, thereby putting some 
provinces at a disadvantage compared to others.
<P>
	In the case of Bill C-52, for example, it is obvious that the 
powers the federal government tried to give itself could be used 
against Quebec in particular, since we know that engineering 
and architectural firms are concentrated in Quebec. In the case 
of Bill C-91 regarding the Federal Business Development Bank, 
we can ask ourselves if the government is once again giving 
itself additional powers and trying to compete with very 
successful Quebec institutions such as the credit unions and the 
FTQ and CNTU solidarity funds, which are very effective in 
developing small and medium size businesses.
<P>
	We also know that small and medium size businesses have 
experienced significant growth in Quebec over the years. That 
was one of the reasons why Quebec supported free trade with the 
U.S. Industry and trade in Quebec are locally based. Quebecers 
have worked to set up their own businesses and establish 
themselves in Quebec. It is something that should be pointed out 
to those who do not know Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	The difference is visible for instance between Quebec and 
Ontario. As we know, Ontario benefited from American 
investments and most major business concerns established in 
Ontario were American companies' subsidiaries. In fact, that is 
one of the reasons why so many jobs were lost in Ontario after 
the free trade agreement with the U.S. was signed. American 
companies established in Ontario simply packed up and moved 
back to the U.S. They can trade with Ontario from the other side 
of the border. But many jobs were lost because of this in Ontario, 
where there are more people on UI and welfare today than just 
about anywhere else in Canada.
<P>
	While we, in Quebec, were hit quite strongly, and we can say 
that the federal government did not do much to help us, we 
nonetheless are blessed with a strong small and medium size 
business sector which is still developing in many areas. In Bill 
C-88, as in Bill C-91 and Bill C-52, the federal government is 
abusing its authority. It gives itself powers that it did not have 
before, which could have the effect of putting Quebec at a 
disadvantage in rulings on trade between Quebec and the other 
provinces.
<P>
	Finally, this is the main reason prompting us to propose to the 
government an amendment providing that the federal 
government be required to rule only when it is directly involved, 
instead of any time it feels like stepping in to tip the scales in 
favour of one province at the expense of another.
<P>
	As I said at the very beginning on my remarks, Quebec has 
always been for free movement and the freest trade possible, 
because this is in our interest in Quebec, since our economy is 
solidly grounded. Much remains to be done, but we are 
nonetheless building on solid ground, relying on small and 
medium size business firmly rooted in Quebec. Much remains to 
be done to strengthen it.
<P>
	Were it not for this abuse of authority on the part of the federal 
government, interprovincial trade liberalization would be great 
for the rest of Canada as well as for Quebec. Again, Quebec is in 
favour of this kind of liberalization. For example, Quebec 
imports from Ontario alone goods and services totalling 
$25.852 billion per year, while its exports to this province total 
$22 billion. That is almost $30 billion in trade just between 
Ontario and Quebec.
<P>
	In fact, trading between Quebec and all Canadian provinces is 
quite substantial. In Alberta, Quebec sells $2.8 billion in goods 
and services and buys $3.25 billion in petroleum, natural gas 
and the like. In the central region, we buy wheat. I think that 
these trade relations will be maintained after sovereignty is 
achieved. We are working at making Quebec realize that it will 
be to its advantage, in the medium and long term, to opt for 
sovereignty, take charge and be in control of its economy and its 
future.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Once Quebec has achieved sovereignty, existing trade 
between the provinces will most likely be maintained. There is 
no reason to believe that it will be reduced. It would be 
disadvantageous to the other provinces, including Ontario and 
even Alberta, to refuse to sell their products to Quebec, and vice 
versa. It would not make economic sense. In fact, economic 
sense dictates that current trade be maintained.
<P>
	We live in a world where trade liberalization is increasingly 
more prevalent. For example, GATT was set up precisely to 
liberalize trade between all the countries of this world. Some 
agreements and regulations were implemented under GATT, and 
they will also be maintained once Quebec becomes a sovereign 
nation.
<P>
	The same is true as regards free trade agreements with the 
United States. There is no reason to believe that these 
agreements will not be maintained and that trade will not 
continue. It is only those who seek to instill some unfounded 
doubt or fear who say: ``We will cut or block trade between 
Quebec and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12929"> 12929 </A></B>
<P>
other provinces''. This is nonsense. It goes against economic 
sense. It goes against the common sense which governs existing 
treaties, including GATT and the free trade agreement.
<P>
	Bill C-88 does includes many provisions which make it 
appealing to the Bloc. As I said earlier, Quebec has always been 
in favour of liberalizing trade between provinces and countries, 
and it always will be, because this is its forte. We can compete 
with others. We supported free trade because Quebec has the 
economic, cultural and social confidence required to face its 
North American competition.
<P>
	It is for these reasons that Quebec will be in an even better 
position once it achieves sovereignty, and that is also true for the 
other provinces. Indeed, English Canada will also benefit. I 
think it will get along better with Quebec, and it might even 
manage to reduce the power of the federal government, which is 
not necessarily concerned with the interests of the individuals or 
provinces. It is concerned with its own interest. And the federal 
interest here in this Parliament is not the same as that of the 
provinces.
<P>
	This is why we oppose Bill C-88 which is another example of 
abuse on the part of the federal government, which seeks to gain 
additional powers, to centralize, and possibly interfere in 
interprovincial trade so as to favour the interests of one province 
at the expense of another. This is one of the reasons why we will 
oppose Bill C-88.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to reply to the various points raised by my colleague 
across the way.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I believe he substantially misrepresents the clause about 
which he obviously has some qualms. I believe it is clause 9 of 
the bill.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that while the current minister of 
restructuring of the Quebec government was president of the 
Quebec Manufacturers' Association he totally supported the 
elimination of interprovincial trade barriers. Yet when the 
agreement was signed at the time when Mr. Parizeau was 
premier he dismissed the agreement as laughable because the 
dispute resolution mechanism did not have new devices for 
sanctions or retaliation.
<P>
	We now hear the Bloc Québécois member saying that the 
provisions for sanctions are far too strong and are a grab for 
power by the federal government and would act as a 
disadvantage to the provinces.
<P>
	Let me begin by saying that this bill is the result of a long 
process that in my view demonstrates admirably-

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The deputy whip for the government 
has the floor on debate.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe I was in the process of 
saying that the procedure by which this bill comes before us and 
by which the internal trade agreement that gave rise to it was 
reached was a demonstration of how federalism can work for all 
partners. It was a totally co-operative process, involving the 
provinces, the territories, the federal government, and the 
private sector, which had the unanimous agreement of all 
parties.
<P>
	On behalf of the Minister of Industry, I appreciate this 
opportunity speak on Bill C-88. This is one more step in a 
process that has been under way in Canada for the better part of a 
decade to create a new internal trade regime. Our objective is to 
reduce barriers to interprovincial trade and remove restrictions 
on the movement of people and capital within the domestic 
marketplace.
<P>
	Passage by Parliament of Bill C-88 will be a necessary step to 
implement the agreement on internal trade that was signed last 
year by every province, the territories, and the federal 
government.
<P>
	At the invitation of the Prime Minister, first ministers met in 
Ottawa last July to formally accept and sign the agreement that 
the committee of ministers of internal trade had finalized at the 
end of June. With this accord we were committed to have the 
appropriate legislative and regulatory changes in place so that 
the agreement could be legally implemented. In this sense, 
putting this legislation before the House is meeting an 
obligation to provincial and territorial governments that we 
incurred when we signed the agreement in June 1994.

	This was an important step in the quest to create an integrated 
domestic market in Canada. This seems to have been a pattern 
in the development of our nation. As we go back through history 
to the voyageur and the Hudson's Bay Company, we see that 
trade is what has opened up the vast expanse of this northern 
half of the North American continent. As we thought to link 
ourselves together with the national railway and later with the 
national highway and national airline, trade has been one of the 
driving forces both for the development of the links among us 
as a people and for the development of the prosperity the 
country has enjoyed.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	However, in the 128 years since Confederation, we have also 
seen a hodge-podge of protectionist measures and trade 
conventions develop which have inhibited interprovincial trade 
and restricted the flow of goods, capital and talent between and 
among provinces. These measures range from outright 
restrictions to bidding on government contracts to a patchwork 
of regulations and incompatible standards.
<P>
	The government has felt strong and repeated pressure from 
the private sector to deal with the problems associated with 
internal barriers to trade and conflicting regulations on cross 
border flows of people and of capital.
<P>
	We have received representations from the Canadian 
Manufacturers' Association, the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce, the Business Council on National Issues, the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the Canadian 
Bankers Association and the Canadian Construction 
Association. The list is long and the problems are deeply felt and 
broadly experienced.
<P>
	Such barriers put Canadian businesses at a competitive 
disadvantage by restricting the size of their available 
marketplace by shrinking the domestic market for Canadian 
businesses in a time of increasing global competition and more 
open markets in other parts of the world. This can have the 
negative result of putting Canadian businesses at a disadvantage 
to international competitors even in our own market.
<P>
	In addition, there is an economic cost related to marketplace 
inefficiency. The Canadian Manufacturers' Association has 
estimated that barriers to trade cost Canadians about $7 billion 
annually in direct job and income loss. However, let us consider 
the other side of the story which is equally telling.
<P>
	A Canadian Chamber of Commerce report released on May 17 
highlighted the importance of international trade and 
investment as powerful generators of economic growth and job 
creation throughout Canada. The study indicates that Canadian 
interprovincial trade was worth $147 billion; almost 21 per cent 
of GDP in 1993. It estimates that 1.9 million jobs are directly or 
indirectly dependent on internal trade within Canada. The report 
shows that the provinces and territories constitute one of the 
most economically interdependent regions of the  world and that 
interestingly, Quebec is the province most dependent on internal 
trade, the province that benefits most from internal trade and has 
the most to gain from improvements in internal trade.
<P>
	The study attributes 470,000 Quebec jobs, 20 per cent of the 
province's GDP directly and indirectly to internal trade and 
values the province's trade with the rest of Canada at $64 
billion. With a trade surplus of $1.1 billion with the rest of 
Canada, Quebec exported more to Ontario than it did to the 
United States, more to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick than to 
any European country.
<P>
	The report confirms that businesses across Canada have been 
able to take advantage of the political and economic links 
created by the federal structure to forge a large national market 
that has worked to the benefit of all Canadians.
<P>
	In years past when external trade barriers protected 
economies like ours from international competition, the 
economic cost of internal trade barriers were tolerated and 
maybe tolerable. When Canadian industry was sheltered from 
international competition by tariff barriers of 10 per cent or even 
20 per cent, the economic cost of internal barriers were not so 
obvious. However, a marketplace sheltered from international 
competition is no longer the reality. Barriers and tariffs are 
down. The market is global and the competition is fierce. We 
will not, we cannot be successful in an open global market if we 
operate in a closed market at home. We need to adapt to the 
realities of trade in today's global economy.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-88 and the agreements it implements is an important 
aspect of the process. It is part of the more fundamental process 
of economic renewal that the government is following toward its 
strategic objectives for economic growth and job creation.
<P>
	Last December the Minister of Industry introduced in the 
House the government's plan for building a more innovative 
economy. We outlined our intentions for improving the 
economic climate of Canada in four ways: to build a positive 
entrepreneurial climate and to help small businesses grow; to 
expand markets for jobs and growth through trade; to create an 
efficient and modern infrastructure; and to make technology 
work for Canada.
<P>
	These are areas in which the government can have the greatest 
impact on job creation. While Bill C-88 will support all of these 
objectives, it has special relevance for the objective of 
expanding trade. To grow and prosper business needs an 
efficient and open marketplace, an environment which 
encourages innovation and expansion free of unnecessary 
barriers.
<P>
	With the agreement on internal trade and now with this bill we 
have the elements to establish a new internal trade regime, one 
which will allow us to make the most of our interprovincial 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12931"> 12931 </A></B>
<P>
domestic market by encouraging innovation and expansion and 
by removing unnecessary barriers.
<P>
	The Canadian economy is in a period of transition. 
Fundamental changes are taking place because of the 
globalization of trade and the rapid pace of technological 
change. The competitive advantage in today's world depends 
less on location and natural resources and more on innovation, 
the ability to respond to changing market conditions and to 
achieve economies of scale.
<P>
	As we continue the transition from a resource based economy 
to one where innovation, knowledge and flexibility are the 
underpinnings of competitive advantage, we need to ensure that 
the domestic trading environment will accommodate and 
expedite the necessary changes. Bill C-88 will provide a 
supportive environment for the economic transition process that 
we are now experiencing.
<P>
	The legislation before the House is the result of a long process 
of negotiation and consultation which has involved many 
Canadians; Canadians with many different perspectives: 
ministers of the federal government, ministers of all the 
provincial and territorial governments, officials of all of these 
governments and representatives of the private sector.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that political parties of all stripes have 
co-operated in the negotiations leading to this agreement. They 
have different perspectives and different priorities, but a shared 
belief that a more open trading environment will be good for 
Canada and good for Canadians.
<P>
	A striking feature of the process leading to the bill has been 
the high degree of co-operation and good will that has been 
demonstrated on all sides. Those Canadians who have been 
involved in the process understand the compelling need to open 
up our internal markets and to ensure that the Canadian 
marketplace works to the advantage of all Canadians.
<P>
	Over the last two years the negotiations and background work 
were under the guiding hand of Mr. Arthur Morrow, a well 
known Canadian businessperson, who acted as chair of the 
committee of chief negotiators and worked tirelessly to keep the 
process moving toward its objective and in producing the 
agreement that ministers signed last year. The work leading up 
to the bill was exhaustive and thorough, and it will be ongoing. It 
is our duty to keep the process moving.
<P>
	The process began in June 1988 when federal and provincial 
agriculture ministers compiled a list of barriers to internal trade 
in agriculture and food products. While the focus of this group 
was relatively narrow, the process had begun. Governments 
were now dealing with the problems of internal trade barriers in 
an organized way. Federal-provincial discussions continued and 
the focus widened. Ministers began to consider the need for a 
dispute resolution mechanism as part of more comprehensive 
trading arrangements between provinces and territories.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	In December 1989 a memorandum of understanding on 
internal trade in agricultural products was signed by seven of the 
provinces. The process was beginning to move. Negotiators 
continued to meet. Agreement was reached and memoranda of 
understanding were signed on a number of individual issues 
such as transportation and government procurement, a major 
economic factor in our economy.
<P>
	By December 1992 the committee of ministers of internal 
trade at the time recommended the process be accelerated and 
that all parties commit to the goal of reaching a broad and 
comprehensive internal trade agreement by June 1994.
<P>
	Agreement was reached on three specific principles: that 
governments treat people, goods, services and capital equally 
regardless of where they originate in Canada; that governments 
reconcile standards and regulations to provide for the free 
movement of people, goods, services and capital within Canada 
and that governments ensure their administrative policies 
operate to provide for that free movement of people, goods, 
services and capital within Canada.
<P>
	An intensive series of meetings was held during the period of 
January to June last year. These culminated in ministers 
agreeing to the text of the internal trade agreement at the end of 
June. Finally, in July 1994 the Prime Minister and all other first 
ministers affirmed their acceptance of the agreement with a 
formal signing on July 18.
<P>
	Last year's agreement on internal trade was a major step in a 
long process. It has demonstrated that all governments can work 
together to achieve a common objective that will benefit all 
Canadians.
<P>
	The agreement on internal trade sets out general rules that 
prohibit any new barriers to trade and eliminate old ones in 10 
specific sectors or issue areas. Unfortunately there is no time 
left to read them all. However, it is fair to say that while this bill 
does not solve all the interprovincial trade problems that have 
built up since Confederation it has moved us a considerable way 
along that track. It is an ongoing process. For instance, in the 
energy sector a separate set of negotiations is under way toward 
a similar deadline this year.
<P>
	With this legislation we are ensuring the framework is in 
place and we are confirming our belief that the fundamental 
principles of free trade will work within Canada. Trade 
agreements deepen and broaden with use and experience and 
this one will too. Bill C-88 will provide the foundation of 
moving toward a domestic trading environment that will allow 
for the free flow finally of goods, services, people and capital 
within Canada.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	The Prime Minister and other ministers, including first 
ministers, have been actively involved in broadening the 
marketplace for Canadian goods and services in export markets 
and the Team Canada approach has been highly successful in 
doing that. We must bring the same spirit to improving the 
domestic market for our businesses and workers. Bill C-88 is 
an important step in that direction, which is why we brought 
it to Parliament and support it.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The House will now proceed to the 
consideration of a motion to adjourn the House for the purpose 
of discussing an important matter requiring urgent 
consideration, namely the current situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
