					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, members of the Canadian Committee for
					 Antarctic Research and the Canadian Antarctic Research Network continue to
					 contribute to the science and well-being of Antarctica. Our satellite Radarsat
					 provides information on the flow of Antarctic ice. We have an exchange program
					 involving Arctic and Antarctic scientists. Canadians are studying the Antarctic
					 Ocean.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year 100 high school students went on a field trip
					 to Antarctica and reported widely on their experiences. Yet Canada is still not
					 a full member of the Antarctic treaty. We have not even ratified the treaty's
					 environment protocol.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us listen to our young people in this regard. Most
					 of the world's fresh water is in Antarctica. As a nation with exceptional cold
					 climate science expertise we can help preserve that resource and gain valuable
					 scientific expertise at the same time. Canada should become a full member of
					 the Antarctic treaty.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I admire and support our Canadian men and
					 women in uniform. When the opportunity to join the crew of a CC-130 Hercules on
					 a transport mission to the Arctic presented itself it was a dream come
					 true.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Canadian Forces Parliamentary Program I
					 travelled to Canadian Forces Station Alert, Canada's northernmost permanent
					 installation at the tip of Ellesmere Island in Nunavut. While en route to CFS
					 Alert I became part of the crew of 429 Squadron out of 8 Wing CFB
					 Trenton.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always called for a well trained and well
					 equipped military. My time on board a 35 year old Hercules with over 40,000
					 flying hours has reinforced that support. The dedicated crew of Captain Rick
					 Harper, Major Norm Patterson, Captain Michel Goulet, Captain Jennifer Kooren,
					 Sergeant Steve Stewart, Master Corporal Kel Brown and Master Corporal Mike
					 MacNeil all performed wonderfully with their aging equipment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of today's war on terrorism our men and women
					 in uniform must have better equipment to work with.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Burlington Arts Centre
					 on its expansion and reopening last Sunday. The centre first opened in June
					 1978 and accommodated specialized areas of study including hand weaving,
					 spinning, woodcrafting and ceramics. The arts centre has grown and launched
					 fabulous exhibits like Fragile Embrace which received over $100,000 from the
					 millennium fund.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the arts centre has tailored programs to fit
					 the special needs of the Burlington Association for the Intellectually

					 producers and forest landowners. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of American Consumers for Affordable Homes
					 wrote to President Bush yesterday and asked him to intervene in a preliminary
					 decision to impose countervailing duties of 19.3% on lumber imports from
					 Canada. They are appealing to Bush on the basis that the tariff is negatively
					 impacting the housing sector and other lumber dependent industries that provide
					 seven million jobs in the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dispute has also caused 15,000 forestry workers to
					 be laid off in British Columbia alone, including many in my riding of
					 Nanaimo--Cowichan. Federal government bonding guarantees will help put some
					 people back to work. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deadline to apply for an exemption to the U.S.
					 tariff has recently passed. Now we discover that the Liberal government
					 neglected its duty to apply for a blanket exemption for Canadian companies.
					 This is the kind of neglect and inaction the government has displayed from the
					 beginning on the issue. The 2,000 laid off workers in my riding want to know
					 why the government has put them out of a job.</p>

					 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that by November 1 there will be 5.5

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy for us in Canada to see the situation as

					 Canada and around the world. The information is available at
					 www.yorku.ca/iwrp/afghanistan.htm. </p>

					 not realize that the grains and oilseeds sector could lose up to $2 billion
					 this year because of the devastating drought conditions.</p>

					 do.</p>

					 federal government, 69% of Canadians believe that the government should do
					 whatever it takes, even if it means paying more taxes to ensure the survival of

	Mr. Speaker, Afghanistan is faced with an enormous
					 social and economic crisis. In recognition of the pressure put on the
					 government of Pakistan to try to accommodate the increased number of refugees
					 and its co-operation in the coalition against terrorism, the Government of
					 Canada has agreed to convert the $447 million loan owed to CIDA into social
					 programs, which will be about $16 million a year. This means that there will be
					 $16 million a year used in Pakistan to assist in the area of social
					 programs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be working with the government of Pakistan and
					 my colleagues to ensure that the money goes to the people. As well, the lifting
					 of sanctions will allow me to reopen official assistance to
					 Pakistan.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nortel has just laid off another 20,000 people, many of
					 them in this country. That means almost 70,000 Canadians have been laid off
					 since last spring, including people in the high tech industry, the auto
					 industry, the airline industry, and in agriculture and other manufacturing and
					 service jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the minister's strategy concerning jobs? How
					 much more damage to the economy will it take before he brings down a budget?
					 When he presents that budget to the House, can he tell us whether or not jobs

	Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that jobs are the number

					 in place a plan that would bring the unemployment rate down from 11.5% to where
					 it is now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that jobs continue to be the number one
					 priority. That is why we proceeded to clean up the balance sheets, which is why
					 we have enabled the Bank of Canada to bring down interest rates, which is why
					 we have cut taxes, which is why we have invested in research and development,
					 and which is why we will continue on that path.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, 70,000 people in this country are out of

					 rates are plummeting. The bank rate is now at a 29 year low. Despite that,
					 millions of Canadians are paying an interest rate of almost 18% on their credit
					 cards and they are not in a position to renegotiate that charge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister is saying that people should spend
					 some money. Will the Minister of Finance instruct the banks in Canada to get
					 their credit card rates in line with the falling bank rate? Will he ask the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same principle applies to the courts. They must be
					 able to exercise their mandate of interpreting laws without being subjected to
					 undue political pressure. That is one of the purposes of this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is judicial independence? To begin with, it must
					 not be confused with judicial impartiality. Impartiality is different from
					 independence in that the impartiality has to do with arriving at decisions
					 which are neutral, without prejudice, based solely on the facts presented at
					 trial. Impartiality means that the trial judge will not hand down a ruling
					 based on subjective impressions, but solely on the facts and the testimony
					 presented in court.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While impartiality is exercised vis-à-vis the
					 defendant, judicial independence is exercised vis-à-vis the executive and
					 legislative arms of the government. Judicial independence is necessary so that
					 pressure from the government does not interfere, or appear to interfere, with
					 court rulings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a reasonable observer be able to conclude that
					 pressure has been brought to bear, that would be enough for there to be the
					 appearance of interference in judicial independence. The same observer could
					 thus conclude that judicial impartiality has been tainted through government
					 pressure, whether or not such is the case. That is why it is important to
					 ensure that the body which provides administrative services to courts under
					 federal jurisdiction leaves the judicial body free of any form of
					 interference.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many rulings have reached this conclusion. In Tobiass v
					 Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, and Dueck v Minister of Citizenship
					 and Immigration, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the appearance of
					 judicial independence must not be tainted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the court held that judicial independence
					 has an institutional aspect and a personal aspect. The supreme court emphasized
					 that the judiciary should not only remain independent in fact, but that it
					 should be seen to remain independent. Once again, the key test is what a
					 reasonable observer would perceive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This objective test means that any reasonable person
					 must be able to conclude that judges are free to hand down decisions without
					 any possibility of interference from the government or from other judges. That
					 is what is important in this bill and what should be important in all the
					 government's bills: protection against government interference.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the preface to the Canadian Judicial Council annual
					 report for 1996, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Antonio Lamer wrote that
					 “the quality of their future depends on the existence of a judiciary system
					 based on honesty, impartiality and independence”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honesty and impartiality are only possible when there
					 is independence. Independence is the basic element which keeps our judiciary
					 free of vice and interference.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some years now, the bench has been calling for an
					 administrative body to support the judiciary system, rather than the opposite.
					 For some years now, the judiciary has been stressing that independence is
					 possible only if there is an absolute appearance of impartiality and honesty.
					 There must be a clear separation between the bench and government pressures. An
					 organizational format would have to be put in place to truly separate the
					 administrative and the decision making aspects. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judicial independence requires the depoliticization of
					 the judiciary and must clearly demonstrate that there can be no pernicious
					 interference by government. Once again, the reasonable person criterion must be
					 applied.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the international congress of the Canadian Council
					 of Administrative Tribunals, held in Quebec City this past June, Justice Claire
					 L'Heureux-Dubé confirmed the need for judicial independence and emancipation of
					 the courts from political power. This is evidence that this bill is more than
					 essential. </p>


	<A NAME="T1515"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1515)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justice L'Heureux-Dubé made it clear that there must be
					 an increased perception of independence, and each judge must be protected from
					 undue pressures. These are fundamental principles that must be not just
					 respecte, but also reinforced by the creation of an independent administrative
					 structure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This principle is international. At the same congress,
					 an American, Judge Edwin L. Felter Jr., President of the National Conference of
					 Administrative Law Judges, said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Judiciary independence is not for the
						  good of the judges, but for the good of the public, who expect judges to be
						  fair and impartial, and to reach their decisions without
						  constraint.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We confer a power of interpretation upon our judges. We
					 must respect that power and therefore must provide them with the necessary
					 tools to achieve those objectives. I repeat, there must be no interference of
					 any kind in this decision making process which must be based on the facts.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only obligation judges have toward government is to
					 carry out their duties in a highly professional manner in keeping with their
					 mandate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a judge to act in a highly professional manner, he
					 must not be distracted from his mandate, which is to interpret the law
					 according to the facts with which he is presented. To that end, the judiciary
					 must also be freed up from any administrative and budgetary tasks. Any
					 financial control over the judiciary might lend the appearance that there was
					 interference. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated earlier, we have given judges the power to
					 interpret, and it is up to us, as parliamentarians, to provide them with the
					 tools required to carry out this difficult task. An administrative body must
					 therefore free judges from any restrictions and provide them with both the
					 functional and institutional freedom needed to accomplish what they are
					 appointed to do: hand down enlightened rulings without any
					 interference.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the objectives of this bill is to enhance
					 accountability for the use of public moneys. Once again, the notion of
					 transparency is essential to the public's perception of our judicial
					 system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criterion of accountability assures us that judges
					 will appear more independent. The fact that it is the chief administrator who
					 will be held accountable distances the judges from any apparent source of
					 influence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the implementation of elements that
					 strengthen the fundamental principles of judicial independence is seen as
					 desirable and necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the courts and the
					 entire judicial system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything that helps ensure judges' freedom in ruling is
					 desirable and necessary. Anything which helps eliminate interference or the
					 appearance of interference is not only desirable, but essential and paramount.
					 The government has no right to interfere here or elsewhere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must provide the judicial system with the necessary
					 tools to ensure the fair and democratic protection of our rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I can add at this point is that the only problem
					 there may be with this bill is with the appointment of the chief administrator.
					 I believe that it would be better if it were an elected position and the
					 criteria could be established by parliament.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I have just a brief comment on Bill C-30,
					 formerly Bill C-40. It is a bill, as members will know, to establish a body to
					 provide administrative services to the Federal Court of Appeal, the Federal
					 Court, the Court Martial Appeal Court and the Tax Court of Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal goal of the legislation, as I understand
					 it, is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the administration of
					 these courts while at the same time preserving the appropriate balance between
					 judicial independence and financial accountability.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that pursuant to a seminal case on
					 judicial independence known as Valente v The Queen, the Supreme Court of Canada
					 itself has indicated that the proposed structure satisfies in its mind the
					 constitutional test for institutional independence, because this would
					 certainly be one of the concerns people might have about the
					 legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation follows again, as I understand it, upon
					 the recommendation of a former auditor general who had recommended a complete
					 merger of the Federal Court and the Tax Court of Canada as a means to address
					 the administrative inefficiencies he identified but the government decided not
					 to go this far. In my judgment it was probably right in not listening totally
					 to the recommendations of the auditor general.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might say in this context that I sometimes find, as I
					 have said in the past, that the auditor general goes beyond what is required
					 and goes much farther down the road in policy making and policy recommendation
					 than I feel the auditor general ought to. I find it is often the case that the
					 auditor general's office not only identifies inefficiencies or problems but
					 then goes on to make recommendations, almost like an independent policy
					 think-tank. I have had correspondence with previous auditors general on this
					 but I do not want to grind that particular political axe this
					 afternoon.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I want to say is that although the bill is lengthy
					 in terms of how much paper it consumes, the idea is pretty simple. The sooner
					 we get this to committee and deal with it the better.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-54701"></A><a HREF="#Int-54704"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-54699"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian
					 Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I noted the comments of the member for
					 Winnipeg--Transcona in reference to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in
					 Valente v The Queen and, of course, the more recent decision that some of my
					 constituents referred to, when I was in provincial politics,as the case of the
					 judges paying the judges, that is,the establishment of an independent
					 constitutional authority that would require not simply government, be it order
					 in council or parliament, paying judges but actually judges making sure that
					 judges get paid. That was the classification that my constituents put that case
					 into. That case as well talked about institutional independence of the courts.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I generally support the bill, my concern is that
					 as we move to the institutional independence of the courts, including
					 administrative independence, how do we ensure accountability? We, as members of
					 parliament, and the Minister of Finance are accountable to the taxpayers for
					 the decisions that we make in respect of the running of a department. Whether
					 there are defence issues or health issues, ultimately we are
					 accountable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is if we simply hand over administrative
					 independence to the courts. I realize the bill does not quite go that far but
					 we are clearly going down that road and we have to tackle the issue. Who will
					 then call the courts to account for misspent money or inefficiencies?
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We read in the auditor general's report that there are
					 many unused courts now. The reference was that in the federal court system
					 around 35% to 40% of the courts are being used. Therefore on any given day over
					 60% of our courtrooms are unused. One can only think of all the expenses
					 involved in unused courtrooms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, for example, from my provincial experience and
					 my involvement in the justice system, that courts were open one hour a day and
					 then shut and the judge gone; then other courts were backed up because that
					 court had too many cases.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real issue is not that we do not want independence
					 for the court so that justice is done in particular cases, but if we simply
					 hand over money to the courts to run the courts, how do we ensure that
					 accountability?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the member has any issues or comments
					 that he could make in that respect.</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, the member for Provencher raises a good
					 question. If I recall correctly, it is a question that he, in a former
					 incarnation, had to deal with, or at least the government that he was part of
					 had to deal with. I recall, and I hope correctly, the controversy in Manitoba
					 when there was a decision by the provincial government of the day, I believe it
					 was the Conservative government, with respect to the remuneration of judges,
					 and there was a case which followed from that having to do with the
					 independence of the judiciary. I believe that is the case to which the member
					 is referring.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a genuinely tough question and I do not pretend
					 to have the answers. Do we create an administrative and categorical enclave in
					 which there is no accountability in the name of judicial independence? Having
					 done that in the past to some extent, what claim can government or the larger
					 society make on courts if we feel that they are being underused or the money is
					 not being spent wisely? How do we do that without being open to the charges
					 that the Manitoba government was open to at the time and which led to that
					 court case?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps having the bill go to the justice committee
					 might be an opportunity to hear some witnesses on this very difficult question,
					 not so much by way of seeking amendment to this particular bill, although that
					 might flow from it, but it certainly might be an occasion, not for lengthy
					 hearings or anything, to hear some evidence on this very difficult question. I
					 agree with the hon. member that in fact it is a difficult question.</p>

					 (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC): </b>

	Madam Speaker, Bill C-30 is a fairly large and
					 cumbersome bill. It is one that deals with a number of technical changes that
					 touch on the establishment of a body to provide administrative services to the
					 Federal Court, the Court Martial Appeal Court and the Tax Court of Canada. The
					 bill essentially deals with amendments to the Federal Court Act, the Tax Court
					 of Canada Act and the Judges Act and consequential amendments that flow from
					 them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill, although procedural and voluminous, is one
					 that is important. It is one that has to occur to attempt to streamline a very
					 complex system that is already in place. It is an attempt to consolidate the
					 current administrative services of the Federal Court of Canada, the Court
					 Martial Appeal Court and the Tax Court of Canada into a single administrative
					 service.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation comes about as a result of a number of
					 triggering mechanisms, including, as mentioned previously, the auditor
					 general's steady, guiding hand in influencing this action from occurring as
					 well as the court case of Valente v The Queen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attempt here is obviously to strike the age old
					 balance of judicial independence and achieving a certain level of service. The
					 Progressive Conservative/Democratic Representative coalition supports the
					 legislation. It is one that requires a great deal of attention to detail and
					 perhaps, most appropriately, that will occur at the justice committee.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous two speakers have alluded to the fact that
					 there will be an opportunity at committee to delve into the details because
					 time and time again we are reminded that the devil is often in the details. The
					 justice department has, on many occasions, been renowned for bringing in
					 legislation that has this large pith and substance to it. When one takes the
					 time to examine it, there are often nuggets of change that are quite
					 substantial and that sometimes get lost in the forest and do not appear so
					 readily when one looks at a bill of this size at first glance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the other amendments that will come about as a
					 consequence deal with federal statutes, such as the Judges Act, the Access to
					 Information Act, Canada Elections Act, Corrections and Conditional Release Act,
					 Employment Insurance Act, Extradition Act, Immigration Act, Income Tax Act,
					 defence and privacy, to name but a few. One can quickly glean that the bill has
					 incredible reach. It touches on a number of existing statutes. The changes
					 themselves, although administrative in nature, are quite
					 substantial.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court shall consist of at least two divisions: the
					 Federal Court of Appeal and the Federal Court trial division. These changes
					 that deal with the way in which the courts currently conduct themselves will
					 have a significant impact.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend from Provencher and my friend from
					 Winnipeg--Transcona talked about judicial independence and the salaries that
					 are tied to it. The debate about judges having the capacity to set their own
					 rates of pay is a debate that has been very interesting and often emotionally
					 driven. To add controversy to that, legislation passed last spring will now tie
					 in any future changes to the salary structure of members of parliament. Our
					 salaries will be impacted by the rate of pay that judges receive. That can lead
					 to an entire debate in and of itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice it to say that the true intent behind giving
					 judges a salary and setting their salary separate from the political process is
					 to avoid any real or perceived interference from outside sources, be they
					 political or, in a more nefarious way, I would argue, although some might
					 suggest that the political influence can be just as nefarious, organized crime.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been ample evidence that organized crime is
					 on the rise. It has reared its ugly head in many cities and towns throughout
					 the country.</p>


	<A NAME="T1535"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1535)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is presenting itself time and again in a very
					 aggressive way as we saw recently in the city of Halifax where the Hell's
					 Angels opened a storefront operation, advertising in bright fluorescent lights
					 their presence in the city.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was legislation before the House in recent months
					 that attempted to aid police in the difficult task of combating organized
					 crime. There is a lot more to do in that regard. The resources, the training
					 and the sophistication used by organized crime elements have to be motivation
					 enough for us to step up every effort to give our law enforcement agents every
					 bit of help in terms of resource support and legislative support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-30 is very much in its purpose the pith and
					 substance to keep the judiciary separate from that type of influence. Organized
					 crime is not beyond attempting to influence the decisions of judges. It is not
					 beyond any sort of act that is intended to destabilize or to bring the
					 administration of justice into disrepute. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen bold new efforts and aggressive acts on
					 the part of organized crime. One could even make the leap to say that terrorism
					 is in and of itself a more sophisticated and often a more philosophically
					 driven form of organized crime. The results are staggering.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still reeling from the effects of September 11.
					 The seriousness is there to underline the necessity of giving judges complete
					 impartiality. That is a very difficult task indeed. Their financial
					 compensation and salaries are often a way in which interference and influence
					 can be exerted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition supports the legislation. We feel that it
					 is necessary to bring about the changes, particularly in the area of the Judges
					 Act where in recent years growing concerns were brought to bear about the
					 increased elements of interference and influence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salaries for judges in the Federal Court are now tied
					 to a schedule. No one would suggest for a minute that they are undercompensated
					 when one compares those salaries to others working in the private sector. If we
					 are to attract the best and the brightest and those individuals most capable of
					 administrating and administering law in the country, those salaries must be
					 commensurate with the ability. That has to be the number one priority in terms
					 of the selection of judges and ensuring that we get the best people on the
					 bench.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other sections of the act to which I have referred
					 that impact the Elections Act and Corrections and Conditional Release Act deal
					 with changes that are meant to streamline and bring about greater efficiency in
					 the administration of those acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Extradition Act deals with a clause wherein the
					 Federal Court and the court of appeal in the province in which the committal of
					 a person was ordered have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine
					 applications for judicial review under the act made in respect of a decision of
					 the minister pursuant to section 40. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a change where the court of appeal may grant
					 relief under a section of the act on the grounds that a trial division or a
					 Federal Court of Canada also grants relief.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these interconnected and related sections of the
					 numerous acts are covered under Bill C-30. It is one that took a great deal of
					 time and effort to prepare. We are looking forward to having an equal
					 opportunity at the justice committee to review the work of the justice
					 department. I am sure we can present and advance the very best legislation
					 possible.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would he agree with Alex Macdonald, either the
					 solicitor general or the attorney general for the province of B.C. who is now
					 retired? He wrote an exposé of what happened in the Canadian justice system. At
					 the beginning of his book he makes a very strong indictment against the justice
					 system. He goes so far as to say that Canada does not have a justice system; it
					 has a legal system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He describes how one court is loaded with all kinds of
					 cases. There is such a backlog that they cannot get the physical time in court
					 even if the judge and court space were available. Yet there is an empty court
					 right next door where nothing is happening. Cases cannot be expedited simply
					 because of a lack of space. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the hon. member feel that this legislation might
					 actually help to speed up the justice system so that cases can be heard before
					 juveniles become adults? </p>

	Madam Speaker, I have not had the pleasure of reading
					 Mr. Macdonald's book. It is something I should do. He makes the point that
					 there is a pressing need in the country to have sufficient judges and
					 courtrooms as well as physical space to hear cases. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of backlogs, whether they be in the justice
					 system for adults or juveniles, is a huge problem. When I worked as a crown
					 attorney we encountered that difficulty many times, particularly as it
					 pertained to charges that proceeded by indictment and resulted in jury trials.
					 The backlog often resulted in a waiting period of two years. In the life of a
					 young person two years severely undermines the ability to bring about the
					 requisite deterrence and rehabilitative efforts. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have concerns about the system as it currently
					 operates. There is an effort in the bill to streamline and to ensure that
					 judges are appointed in a timely fashion, to paraphrase the Minister of Justice
					 and her favourite characterization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe that there is a huge problem looming
					 with respect to the youth criminal justice act. We could be building new
					 courtroom facilities and appointing judges. Yet there is a bill currently in
					 the other place that is more complicated than the Income Tax Act. It is so
					 convoluted, cumbersome, unmanageable and unenforceable that it will be an
					 administrative nightmare. The local bar associations around the country are
					 licking their lips in anticipation of that legislation passing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand the government through the bill is
					 attempting to streamline justice. On the other hand the justice department has
					 produced Bill C-7 in an attempt to replace the Young Offenders Act, which will
					 gum up the system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member is exactly right. We will have young
					 people who will be ready to collect their pensions before they will have made
					 it through the youth justice system. It is rather incongruous that the justice
					 department can work at such cross purposes at times and in essence leave the
					 justice system cross threaded to the detriment of Canadians.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I appreciated the comments made by the
					 member of the coalition. I am pleased to participate in the discussion
					 regarding Bill C-30, the courts administration service act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would consolidate the administrative services
					 of the Federal Court of Canada, the Court Martial Appeal Court and the Tax
					 Court of Canada into a single courts administration service. It would create
					 the position of chief administrator of the courts administrative service. The
					 bill would also create a separate federal court of appeal and change the status
					 of the tax court to that of a superior court.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-30 is the government's response to the 1997
					 report of the auditor general entitled “Report on the Federal Court of Canada
					 and the Tax Court of Canada”. The report reviewed the possible regionalization
					 and or merger of the Federal Court's trial division and the Tax Court of Canada
					 as well as the consolidation of their administrative support services. The
					 report also presented the results of an audit of the registry services of the
					 two courts. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Winnipeg--Transcona indicated that he
					 had some concerns about the auditor general moving into what he classified as a
					 policy initiative. I welcome that kind of initiative by a public servant. It
					 gives members of the House a clearly laid out plan and suggestion. Ultimately
					 it would always be up to members of the House to determine whether or not we
					 would accept that policy recommendation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-30 enacts only the report's recommendation to
					 consolidate the administrative services of the two courts, although it may be
					 viewed by some as a first step toward an eventual total merger.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arguments in favour of the proposed consolidation
					 of the administrative services in Bill C-30 appear to be reasonable and sound
					 calculations. The main concern articulated by the auditor general was that
					 significant improvements were needed in the area of court registry cost
					 effectiveness. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the existing problems cited were poor planning of
					 facilities, lack of information technology and the fact that the supply of
					 courtrooms exceeded the combined needs of both the federal court and the tax
					 court. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the excess of courtrooms available, the
					 auditor general simply noted what most members of the bar have been stating for
					 years. His affirmation of this in the report was an important step which we can
					 now use to proceed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report examined the physical facilities of both
					 courts to determine whether they were being planned or used in an effective
					 manner. The conclusion of the auditor general was that the two courts had an
					 oversupply of courtrooms and that the actual use of courtrooms was low. The
					 Federal Court's rate of use of its own courtrooms was about 21% based on data
					 from 1993 to 1995. </p>


	<A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other users account for about 16% of overall use and
					 total use amounts to only 36% of total availability. The tax court's use of its
					 own courtrooms is slightly higher at 35% to 38% and total use ranges between
					 37% and 41%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were any kind of a private business that needed
					 to account to shareholders for efficiencies, our shareholders would have this
					 board of directors out on its ears. We are in fact accountable but not just to
					 shareholders. We are accountable to the voters of Canada. This kind of glaring
					 problem staring us in the face demands action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again it illustrates the concern that I voiced earlier.
					 I have no problem with the consolidation of courtrooms and administrators and
					 the like to improve efficiencies. My concern, which I see as an apparently
					 inevitable road that we will go down, arises as we move toward the independent
					 administration of the courts by judges. As the members responsible for taxpayer
					 dollars, how do we ask judges to account if we turn this over to
					 them?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the rate of use now, I think most judges
					 would say we would not have much trouble trying to beat that record. Therefore,
					 we as parliamentarians, and specifically the Liberal government, have done
					 nothing to encourage efficiency in that respect. That may be a good reason for
					 saying that the government has done nothing to encourage efficiency and that
					 the courts should do it. I have a better plan which involves this side of the
					 House sitting in the government benches, but that will have to wait for a
					 number of years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general's report claims that consolidation
					 of courtrooms and registry offices could yield major savings, perhaps $1
					 million just in leasing expenses. The auditor general further estimates that
					 millions of dollars of possible savings could be gained if all recommended
					 changes within the report were implemented.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a brief look at the report's specific
					 recommendations to consolidate the administrative services to the Federal Court
					 of Canada, Trial Division and the Tax Court of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report recommends the consolidation of corporate
					 services for the court registries, estimating the savings at $600,000 per year.
					 The report states that consolidation could greatly facilitate improved planning
					 and use of resources, as well as increase the opportunity to plan for federal
					 judicial centres that would meet the needs of the courts, federal boards and
					 tribunals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course many of the issues reviewed in the auditor
					 general's report are not new to the two courts being considered. Many of the
					 recommendations of the auditor general have been previously endorsed by the
					 courts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of a government wide series of program reviews
					 in 1994, the Federal Court undertook a review of its activities. The Federal
					 Court's program review recommended that the government consider consolidation
					 of judicial responsibilities presently held by different courts and different
					 tribunals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Court's program review suggested that the
					 government also explore amalgamation of the Federal Court with the tax court
					 and opportunities where by responsibilities of boards and commissions could be
					 dealt with more appropriately, by a trial court for example.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax court also recommended to the government a
					 possible consolidation of corporate services among the Supreme Court of Canada,
					 the Federal Court of Canada and the Tax Court of Canada, as well as
					 quasi-judicial commissions, boards and tribunals.</p>


	<A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1600)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They believe a consolidation could eliminate
					 duplication of work and harmonize policies and procedures in areas such as
					 personnel, finance, security, administration and information
					 technology.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the bill only proposes to consolidate the
					 administrative services of the two courts, a move which would not face much
					 opposition from each court, I would suggest, as I stated earlier, it may be
					 viewed by some as the first step toward a total merger of the courts.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While consolidation of the administrative services of
					 the courts as outlined in the bill is a reasonable solution to the many
					 problems articulated by the auditor general, a total merger of the courts is a
					 far more contentious issue. The tax court and legal counsel appearing before
					 that court are known to be strongly opposed to a merger. Those employed by the
					 tax court believe that the efficiency of the court would be lost in a merger
					 and maintain that the hearing of tax cases requires a specialized
					 court.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax court indeed has highly specialized judges and
					 it is seen as efficient and effective by the lawyers who appear before
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax court also maintains that most of the
					 significant problems in registry services are related to the Federal Court and
					 not the tax court. It argues that there would be increased delays in hearing
					 tax cases if the tax court merged with the Federal Court. Furthermore, the
					 judges of the tax court joined the court with the understanding that they would
					 deal primarily with tax matters. They may view a merger that requires them to
					 deal with other matters as a breach of that understanding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax counsel have stated that at a minimum judges
					 experienced in tax law are needed to hear cases and that if the courts are
					 merged a separate tax division should be established. I do not think that is a
					 radical suggestion. We have done that with other superior courts in the area of
					 provincial superior courts. For example, we would have a general court of
					 justice and then a specialized family law division. I do not see as being a
					 negative thing. Indeed, I think we could respect that specialization and yet
					 still have the flexibility of ensuring that the courts and the courtrooms are
					 used more effectively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, many of the counsel also maintain that tax
					 court judges are already working at full capacity, so in their case they argue
					 productivity is not an issue as has been suggested by some may be the case in
					 the Federal Court.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently the administrative services of the various
					 courts are independent of each other. The bill creates the position of a chief
					 administrator who would have the rank and status of a deputy head of a
					 department, creating another layer of government, and that is a
					 concern.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the chief justice of the tax court, when
					 he reviewed the auditor general's report, did not agree with all of the
					 calculations that indicated the need for increased cost effectiveness of the
					 court nor with the methods used to determine possible advantages of a
					 merger.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are my comments. I am prepared to move ahead on
					 the bill, but there is still a lot of work that needs to be done.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I appreciate the erudite analysis of
					 Bill C-30 that my hon. colleague from Provencher just gave us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given his experience as attorney general and, in his
					 previous life, as a practitioner and a member of the bar, would he agree with
					 the comments of Alex Macdonald, the former attorney general of British
					 Columbia, regarding the prodigal law in the justice system in Canada? He said
					 that the law states that the amount of time it takes to bring a case to its
					 culmination depends directly on the amount of money and the amount of time
					 available to service the case. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general showed us that roughly less than
					 50% of the courts actually were occupied by judges and lawyers hearing cases.
					 There is a tremendous inefficiency here. It must have taken a lot of ingenuity
					 on the part of the judges and lawyers to bring it up to 50% because clearly
					 their interest would be to make sure they have access to the space and that it
					 would be free and independent as it possibly could be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general has provided us with a tremendous
					 insight here. He was able to unearth something that apparently was clear to
					 everyone, yet at the same time these people had a vested interest to make sure
					 they did not find that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the member comment on the prodigal law and on the
					 vested interest that individuals have in making sure that the space is
					 available in the public sector that they want but may not need?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-54754"></A><a HREF="#Int-54757"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-54751"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Vic Toews:
				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, with respect to the concept of the
					 prodigal laws where cases and time expand dependent upon the amount of money
					 available to serve the cases, that is clearly true. Litigation is a very
					 expensive business. One has to have the money in order to fuel that fire.
					 Depending upon the goodwill or indeed the lack of goodwill of some litigants,
					 we can see time being eaten away by the courts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all fairness, many trial judges that I appeared in
					 front of recognized the problem. They tried to do things about it. They did not
					 like abuse of the court system. They did not like counsel wasting time.
					 However, there was always a fear by the trial judges that, if they cut short
					 frivolous arguments they would be overturned on appeal because they did not
					 give the lawyer or individual a fair hearing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have found that judges have been more than tolerant
					 of the comments, the length of comments and the time they take, not because
					 they do not recognize the problem at the trial level but because of their fear
					 of being overturned by a court of appeal which may not have that hands-on day
					 to day experience and not see the problem creeping up. It is a serious
					 problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was serving as a provincial justice minister, we
					 tried to do a number of things to increase the efficiency and the use of the
					 courts. It was extremely difficult to get the facts and the figures. The clerks
					 who answered to a deputy minister and who answered to me kept all the records
					 of the use of the courts but were prohibited by the judges from providing that
					 information to me. Eventually after a long protracted battle I got some of
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It essentially demonstrated that even in our provincial
					 judges' courts, which are considered the workhorses of the court system, the
					 day to day courts where 90% of the cases are heard, that three to three and a
					 half hours a day was the average. That indicated to me that there was something
					 wrong but I could not quite put my finger on it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a tremendous concern that as we move toward the
					 independence of the administrators of the court the very small ability that
					 elected officials now have to demand some type of accountability will disappear
					 completely. That is my concern.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share some of his concerns but I would not
					 necessarily fault trial court judges in that respect. Generally speaking they
					 do a very good job of trying to move matters ahead.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, we have an interesting bill before us.
					 It is probably one of the simplest and most incontrovertible bills we have seen
					 for a long time. It rationalizes what would appear to be a logical thing to do:
					 to organize these courts under one umbrella and one chief administrator. It
					 makes eminent good sense. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a business person and an administrator in a previous
					 life I think it makes jolly good sense. It is about time someone did something
					 like this. The auditor general said it would be a good thing to do and it is.
					 On the face of it that part makes excellent sense. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of our listeners and viewers this
					 afternoon I will indicate exactly which four courts would be rationalized under
					 one administrative body. They are the Federal Court of Canada, the Federal
					 Court of Appeal, the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada and the Tax Court of
					 Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know there is entrepreneurial bureaucracy in
					 the world. There are entrepreneurial bureaucrats whose function seems to be to
					 increase the number of people under their administration. The salary structure
					 is put together in such a way that the more people one administers the greater
					 one's pay, and of course the greater the responsibility and the more the work
					 expands.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have created a super administrative body whose chief
					 administrator has one of the most auspicious jobs in the world. The
					 administrator's job is to tell judges they cannot use a particular room on a
					 certain day. That is a tremendous power. The chief administrator can tell
					 judges, who for all intents and purposes are superior, where they can go to
					 practise their art. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am overstating the case. I am not really serious but
					 I am sure that kind of thing will happen. The independence that my colleague
					 mentioned is a real issue. The way the government states the case in terms of
					 the purposes of the bill is significant. I will read from the bill. It
					 states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the significant part. Its purpose is also
					 to:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three issues are at stake here: independence,
					 accountability, and not only independence for the justices but independence
					 from the Government of Canada. Is it not interesting that the judiciary should
					 be placed in a position where there is independence from the Government of
					 Canada? I am not entirely sure how a judge would interpret this. In the final
					 analysis the courts are set up by legislation which is a function of the
					 Government of Canada. We do it here. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one sense we want judges to be independent when they
					 interpret laws. In their interpretations judges should take into account the
					 intent of the Parliament of Canada when it passed the laws. That is what they
					 should do. I want judges to be independent and not influenced by the political
					 vagaries of the day a law was passed. However I want them to know what the
					 intent of the law was.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Canadian constitution and the bill of rights
					 were passed certain clear indications were made by the Parliament of Canada.
					 The Supreme Court of Canada later read into those provisions certain clauses,
					 interpretations and definitions that were never intended by the House of
					 Commons.</p>


	<A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1615)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means there is independence not only in terms of
					 interpreting the law but in the sense of judges telling parliament what they
					 think it should have done. A power exists in Canada today that ought not to be
					 there as far as judges are concerned. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One might ask whether I am taking this too far. I do
					 not think so. There is evidence that this has happened. We need to be careful
					 in considering this type of legislation which seems so innocuous on the
					 surface. When it is working its way through the system we should examine what
					 its end result could be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that the auditor general not only
					 recommended a body that would tie together the administrative services of the
					 courts under one umbrella, he also suggested some courts ought to be
					 amalgamated. My hon. colleague said there was opposition to
					 amalgamation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talked earlier about bureaucratic entrepreneurship.
					 One of the laws of bureaucratic entrepreneurship is that no one shall ever take
					 away one's authority or reduce the number of people over whom one has
					 supervisory responsibility. That is anathema to being a bureaucrat. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I suggesting bureaucrats are bad people? Heavens no,
					 I am not. They are wonderful people. They help us a lot. It would be terrible
					 if bureaucrats were not extremely jealous about their positions. They had
					 better be, or what are they doing there? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want bureaucrats to be truthful and honest. In
					 discussing his experience in the provincial legislature the hon. member
					 indicated that it was difficult to find out from the people he was responsible
					 for what was happening with the utilization of space they were paying for.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not blame these people for making it difficult,
					 but there is something wrong with the system when it is that difficult to get
					 at the truth. We need to recognize that as a society. We need to recognize it
					 in the House of Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will move away from Bill C-30 for a couple of minutes
					 to talk about its timing. Canadians are neighbours of the United States of
					 America. Twenty-two days ago we witnessed a horrible event. Terrorists killed
					 innocent people. Yet here we are today being asked by the government and the
					 House to consider legislation to rationalize the administrative services of our
					 courts rather than legislation to deal with terrorism. I question the timing.
					 How could this be more important than the September 11 tragedy?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need in our society today is a commitment to
					 honesty, truth and the recognition that terrorism does not arise out of
					 poverty. Terrorism does not arise out of the fact that someone did not get his
					 way. Terrorism arises from a heart that wants to kill or destroy, for whatever
					 reason. There is evil in the world. That is what gives rise to terrorism. The
					 best laws in the world will not prevent evil. All they can hope to do is push
					 it back a bit so it does not become the force it could become.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member from the coalition indicated the
					 establishment in Halifax of the Hell's Angels. The group had a storefront
					 advertising the fact that they were there. We would not call them terrorists at
					 this point; however, what goes on in the hearts of people who are organized for
					 the specific purpose of defying the law?</p>

					 grow marijuana? The judge slaps them on the wrist with a $5,000 fine. They
					 laugh at the judge and say it is an expensive business licence, and they carry
					 on doing business. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It used to be that law enforcement officers and the
					 judges who found these people guilty could confiscate the material they used to
					 grow the marijuana, or whatever the criminal offence was. They cannot do so any
					 more.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened to us? What has happened to our
					 school systems? The system does not seem to care any more whether students
					 cheat on an examination. Yes, we make noise and tell students they shall not
					 cheat, but the kids go home and say that everyone is doing it. What is wrong
					 when students feel they cannot perform too well because they will be frowned
					 upon up on? They do not make their best effort.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to move ahead with truth, honesty and integrity
					 so we can do the things that will build our society and make us strong. That is
					 the strongest instrument against terrorism we could possibly devise.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that mean we should not have good legislation
					 against terrorism? Of course we should. However we should also challenge
					 parents, school teachers, MPs and every leader of the community to instill into
					 the hearts and minds of people that it is important to pass good laws, obey
					 those laws and make sure our kids do the same. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to be sure Bill C-30 achieves its purpose of
					 giving independence to the administrative body. That is what we need to go for.
					 However it will depend on judges who have the right heart. It will depend on
					 administrators who have the right heart. The intent of Bill C-30 will need to
					 be observed by the judges who are asked to interpret and apply it.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I got the feeling from the member's
					 speech that he had two major concerns. First, while consolidation of the
					 various court administrations might make things more efficient and less costly,
					 the bureaucratic aspect to all this and the fact that the jobs will probably be
					 preserved means we might only be transferring costs to another area of
					 government without cutting them at all. Is that one of the member's
					 concerns?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, while perhaps making the administration of the
					 courts more efficient the act would do nothing to improve the judgments coming
					 out of them. The member used as an example the current terrorist threat and a
					 recent court ruling that has made it virtually impossible to deport terrorists.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It brought to mind a case from North Vancouver. I
					 received a fax a moment ago from one of my constituents. Mr. Alastair Ritchie
					 called to remind me about the case of a man who was forging passports in North
					 Vancouver. We wanted to see the man deported but he still lives there. I just
					 remembered the case. The man was convicted in North Vancouver three years ago
					 of forging passports and the judge gave him a six month suspended
					 sentence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ask ourselves what on earth goes through the
					 mind of a judge who would do that. I criticized the judge openly. The hon.
					 member talked about accountability. I criticized the judge openly. The judge
					 called me and said we should have lunch because he wanted to talk with me about
					 what happens in courts and so on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to lunch together and he tried to justify
					 giving a six month suspended sentence to someone who forges passports. I said
					 to him in the end that he had become jaded and insensitive and was no longer in
					 touch with the values of the community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the hon. member get the sense, as I do, that the
					 bill would not change court judgments? Does he feel the government should be
					 tabling meaningful legislation that gets on top of the problems instead of
					 twiddling around the edges as it usually does with administrative
					 matters?</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, my colleague from North Vancouver
					 understood my speech very well. He understood exactly what I was trying to
					 say.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that the claim is made that the
					 savings from bringing them under one umbrella would be somewhere in the
					 neighbourhood of $600,000 to $1 million. That may or may not be true. There is
					 absolutely nothing to show that would happen. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Alex Macdonald uses the prodigal law in the
					 context of the legal system, that prodigal law also applies in administrative
					 matters where the activity in a particular office expands to cover the time
					 available to the individuals sitting there. Sometimes when asked how much time
					 people spend in the office, they will say six hours. The question is about what
					 they achieved. The important aspect is not how long they were there but rather
					 what they achieved. It is one of the issues that is very critical.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to emphasize is that we need to
					 recognize that the intent of legislation is every bit as important, maybe more
					 important, than what the legislation actually says word for word. Too often
					 legal expertise is very good at pulling out the tiny little issue, and one word
					 will slit a particular meaning of a section in an act. Sometimes people will be
					 declared innocent or acquitted on one tiny technicality. Sometimes a
					 technicality is critical because it does reveal the intent but sometimes it
					 does not. It is critical that we recognize that sort of thing and deal directly
					 with the level and degree of punishment involved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are questions of intent. They are also questions
					 of values that operate in our society. It is very important. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to use this opportunity to refer to something
					 else. In terms of terrorism, a committee of 10 senior cabinet ministers has
					 been created. They are to look after the domestic security of Canadians. That
					 sounds very good. The head of the committee is the Minister of Foreign
					 Affairs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really interesting because in the government
					 cabinet there is a solicitor general. He has CSIS and the RCMP under his
					 jurisdiction. CSIS is supposed to provide intelligence about what is happening,
					 particularly in regard to terrorism and other threats. The RCMP does that as
					 well.</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Transport, Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, it gives me pleasure to have the
					 opportunity to speak about the establishment of the Transportation Appeal
					 Tribunal of Canada. We are going through a period characterized by great
					 insecurity in the field of transportation and this affects not only the
					 Department of Transport but almost all departments. Clearly there is no simple
					 solution to a complex problem. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this spirit, I wish to pay tribute to the excellent
					 work done by our colleague, the Canadian Minister of Transport, who has played
					 a very important role in co-ordinating the activities of various departments.
					 From the very first day of the crisis, when terrorism invaded all the countries
					 of the world, he showed great wisdom in implementing concrete measures, which
					 will not be in place forever but which were very important in the short
					 term.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have frequently heard certain members of the
					 opposition criticizing some of these measures. They would have liked to see a
					 simple response to something as complex as terrorism. Nonetheless, the minister
					 has moved forward, implementing measures which will help, in the very near
					 future, we hope, to put the airline industry back on its fee, and which will
					 have an impact on all economic activities and all aspects of our economic and
					 social life.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be pointed out that in spite of the
					 grievances of some opposition members, there are many who would find it a
					 lonely place if they were members of other western parliaments. I think that
					 Canada and the Canadian parliament have been models of consultation and
					 information since the beginning of the crisis. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had tens of hours of debate, the Prime Minister
					 has been present at almost every oral question period and the Minister of
					 Transport has been present at all of them. He was also here throughout the
					 emergency debate that we had on Monday evening to discuss the air
					 transportation issue. I should also mention the availability of all the
					 committee members. Not many parliaments in the western world have been so open
					 to a largely public discussion on the enormous challenge that faces us in the
					 area of security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to support Bill C-34, an act to establish
					 the Transportation Appeal Tribunal of Canada and to make consequential
					 amendments to other acts. This bill is another illustration of the federal
					 government's commitment to reform the legislation on national transportation
					 and to improve safety and security in the national transportation system.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to have the safest possible transportation
					 system, it is very important that Transport Canada officials have a broad set
					 of effective powers to ensure compliance and enforce regulations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When serious offences are committed, we rely on
					 criminal proceedings and penalties. We will continue to deal with these types
					 of offences through the use of enforcement powers and criminal penalties.
					 However, because of certain acts governing transportation in Canada, the
					 department has had to rely on criminal proceedings to deal with minor
					 offences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criminal proceedings can be very costly and in some
					 cases they can drag on for years. Moreover, the vast majority of offences under
					 the various federal transportation laws are not of a criminal nature. There is
					 a huge discrepancy between the offence and the criminal penalty that may be
					 imposed. For these two reasons, there has been in recent years a marked
					 tendency to decriminalize federal transportation laws and implement an
					 administrative process instead of resorting to criminal proceedings, except for
					 serious offences. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative measures can take various forms:
					 licences, certificates and permits may be suspended or revoked; compliance
					 transactions may be concluded; pecuniary penalties may be imposed; and orders
					 can be issued.</p>


	<A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1635)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current federal legislation on transport, as well as
					 that proposed, contains examples of these administrative powers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point that is as important as the
					 matter of administrative powers and that is the need for individuals and
					 businesses that have been taken to court to have recourse to an independent
					 entity able to review the way Transport Canada is using its powers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as aviation is concerned, individuals and
					 companies against which administrative measures have been applied under the
					 Aeronautics Act have recourse to the civil aviation tribunal. There is no
					 similar tribunal for the maritime or rail sector. In those sector, the
					 examination processes, if there are any, take place typically within the
					 department.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of Bill C-34 and of the creation of the
					 transportation appeal tribunal of Canada is to enable the maritime and rail
					 sectors to have the same effective right to recourse as the civil aviation
					 sector does with the civil aviation tribunal with respect to administrative
					 decisions by Transport Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil aviation tribunal was created in 1986 to
					 examine cases of infractions of the licensing or other regulations by companies
					 or individuals under the Aeronautics Act. The tribunal is completely
					 independent of Transport Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than 15 years, the civil aviation tribunal has
					 been providing admirable service to the aviation industry and the department.
					 In the course of a typical year the CAT holds about 100 hearings as well as
					 settling some 100 other cases without involving the entire hearing
					 process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new transportation appeal tribunal of Canada would
					 replace the civil aviation Ttibunal as well as encompassing the marine and rail
					 modes. The three major circuits would therefore be integrated. Cases would be
					 heard relating not only to the Aeronautics Act but also to the Canada Shipping
					 Act, the Canada Transportation Act, the Marine Transportation Safety Act and
					 the Railway Safety Act. Thanks to the creation of a multimodal tribunal, the
					 aviation, maritime and rail sectors would all have similar rights of recourse
					 in connection with administrative decisions by Transport Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tribunal would adopt many of the specific
					 characteristics that have made the civil aviation tribunal so effective.
					 Members of the transportation appeal tribunal should possess expertise in the
					 specific transport field. For example, cases relating to the maritime shipping
					 sector would be heard by tribunal members with knowledge of that sector, and
					 the same for the rail sector. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this approach all the cases would be heard by
					 people who have the necessary technical and operational background to
					 understand the evidence, determine if all the regulations and security
					 standards were complied wit, and identify the impact on security of failing to
					 comply with regulations or of engaging in dangerous practices. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process the tribunal would adopt would be informal,
					 inexpensive and quick, because the tribunal would be an administrative body as
					 opposed to a court of justice. It would not be subject to some of the costs,
					 restrictions and other matters associated with criminal procedures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operators or individuals could represent themselves
					 instead of hiring a lawyer, but the parties would be free to do so if they wish
					 to. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tribunal would examine all the cases in two
					 stages. First, a review hearing would be held by a single member of the
					 tribunal. After having heard the two parties and taking into consideration all
					 the evidence adduced, the member would make a determination. The individual
					 against whom the measures would be taken could appeal to an appeal panel, which
					 would usually consist of three of the members of the tribunal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases the department could also appeal the
					 determination made by the member and the decision of the tribunal would be
					 final. Moreover, the appeal could not be taken to the courts if it was based on
					 the same facts as those examined by the tribunal.</p>


	<A NAME="T1640"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1640)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers of the transportation appeal tribunal of
					 Canada would depend on the nature of the cases it hears. Should the penalty be
					 essentially punitive, the tribunal's decision would take precedence over that
					 of the department. A good example would be the levying of a monetary penalty by
					 the department based on the breach of a regulation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After considering the evidence provided by the parties,
					 the tribunal would be authorized to make a final, mandatory decision as to
					 whether or not there actually was an offence committed and, if so, what the
					 appropriate penalty should be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, when measures are more concerned with
					 qualifications for holding a licence, a certificate or other documents, and
					 other matters of safety and security, the tribunal could, as a general rule,
					 merely confirm the department's decision or refer it back to the department for
					 review.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the bill is not to water down the
					 Department of Transport's basic responsibilities for safety and security under
					 various statutes. As I have already said, the transportation appeal tribunal of
					 Canada would operate in essentially the same manner as the civil aviation
					 tribunal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certain that the transportation appeal tribunal of
					 Canada, as proposed in Bill C-34 would provide the department and the air, rail
					 and marine sectors with a process for reviewing enforcement measures that is
					 fair, rapid and cost effective. The tribunal would promote greater compliance
					 with federal statutes governing transportation and would enhance safety and
					 security in the national transportation system.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is certainly a good idea, but given the
					 circumstances in which Canada finds itself one has to ask the question: Why
					 now? Why are we dealing with this now? Given all the other issues that are at
					 stake in the aviation and the transport industries in general, why are we
					 dealing with this issue now? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation was tabled on September 26, 15 days
					 after the terrorist attack. On the transportation side, the government could
					 have chosen to table any legislation it wanted to. It could have tabled
					 literally anything. The members of all the opposition parties have said that
					 they would be open to any legislation that advances the ball in terms of
					 airport security, airline security and now, given the reality of Air Canada and
					 Canada 3000, the concerns we have with the layoffs and so on. We would be
					 willing to consider any legislation that deals with the health and financial
					 stability of the airline industry as a whole.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, what does the government table? It tables the
					 transportation appeal tribunal of Canada act. Do not get me wrong, it is decent
					 legislation. In fact, the official opposition will support the legislation.
					 However we have to ask where are the priorities of the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate impact on the airline sector of the
					 September 11 attack has been a serious lack of consumer confidence. Bookings
					 are way down. Air Canada reports that bookings are down anywhere between 30%
					 and 35%. There is a serious loss in consumer confidence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People still have very serious safety concerns. I
					 raised the issue in the House that Transport Canada, through its own internal
					 studies and tests, tried to smuggle mock knives, guns and bombs past airport
					 security. Transport Canada knows statistically that over the past year one in
					 five attempts to smuggle replica guns, knives and bombs past airport security
					 has been a success, or a failure, I guess, as the average Canadian would look
					 at it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have serious concerns about that. We have
					 serious concerns about a gentleman flying from Yellowknife to Vancouver who
					 managed to smuggle two submachine guns and several boxes of ammunition onto an
					 airplane and onto the ground. The gentleman was drunk. He threw two submachine
					 guns and a few boxes of ammunition into a duffle bag. He was not attempting to
					 smuggle. He was not a MacGyver in a unique attempt to get things past security.
					 He just threw this stuff in a duffle bag and walked onto the plane drunk.
					 Airport security is failing in the country and it is having a dramatic impact
					 on consumer confidence in flying, but the government is not doing anything
					 about it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official opposition has repeatedly called in the
					 House for the institution of air marshals. The institution of air marshals
					 would be a dramatic and positive step in terms of airport security. The United
					 States has been doing it on international flights for over 30 years. Air
					 marshals are plainclothes police who are specifically trained to deal with
					 security concerns on planes while they are in flight. As a deterrent, they are
					 put cyclically on different flights so terrorists do not know which flights
					 they are on and which ones they are not on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government were to institute that post-September
					 11 it would do two things. First, it would add another level of security in the
					 air. That is important. It is important given the realities we are facing; as
					 the Prime Minister, the president of the United States, NATO, article 5, and
					 the House have said, we are facing a war against terrorism, against people who
					 do horrendous things like hijack planes and fly them into buildings. Once they
					 are on those planes they use them as missiles and guide them in a kamikaze
					 mission to murder innocent people. There is no other way to stop them but in
					 the air with armed air marshals. This would provide another important level of
					 air security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this would also do, and this goes under the issue
					 of consumer confidence, is boost consumer confidence in a dramatic way. The
					 government has failed to do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been calls for financial support for the
					 airline sector. Again the government has not really said or done anything. The
					 transport minister yesterday announced $160 million for Canada's air carriers
					 for the out of pocket costs they incurred on September 11, and again the
					 official opposition supports that, but he announced it across the hall. He
					 announced it in a press conference. </p>


	<A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1650)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not show due respect to this place by announcing
					 it here where we could have had an open debate to find out exactly how the $160
					 million was arrived at and how it was meted out to the different air carriers.
					 Every party in the House has said that it will support the idea of paying for
					 the out of pocket costs incurred by the air industry. If the minister had
					 announced that in the House rather than at a press conference he would have had
					 political parties supporting it; that would have been a vote of confidence for
					 the airline industry that the government did not seize upon. The government is
					 failing in that sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States congress has approved over $15
					 billion for the air industry. I am not calling for us to give $15 billion to
					 the air industry or 10% thereof, but the U.S. has put concrete legislative
					 proposals on the table, good or bad, in the long term interest or not, and we
					 are dealing with the transportation appeal tribunal of Canada act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada has asked for $3 billion to $4 billion in
					 bailouts. The government has not ruled it out. The official opposition sure
					 has. We could currently buy every single share of Air Canada stock in the stock
					 market, I am told, for in the neighbourhood of $695 million to $711
					 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada has publicly said that it wants $3 billion
					 to $4 billion but its net worth, if one were to purchase every single share of
					 its stock, is in the neighbourhood of $700 million. Somehow that does not add
					 up yet the government has not ruled that out as an option. In fact it has not
					 put any numbers at all on the table for us to discuss and to deal with. It has
					 not brought a single thing before the transport committee for us to deal with
					 and sink our teeth into so that we can contribute to a positive alternative
					 solution to the situation we are facing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transport minister needs to reassure the public
					 that the government is doing something. Bill C-34 does not reassure the public
					 that the government is doing something because of the September 11 attack. The
					 fact that we are debating Bill C-34 right now is an indication that the
					 government is totally out of step within the realities of the world
					 post-September.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have been the transport critic for the official
					 opposition or since I have been a member of parliament, I have not had a single
					 call to my office asking me when Bill C-34 would be tabled nor have I had
					 people telling me that they are really curious about the transportation appeal
					 tribunal act or that as I am their member of parliament they really want me to
					 expand the civil aviation tribunal so could I please deal with that. That is a
					 really important issue right now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrorist attacks and the status of Air Canada with
					 9,000 to 12,000 people laid off can be put aside. We talk about a tribunal act.
					 Nobody is calling for that. We have to wonder: To whom is the government
					 listening? What leadership role is it fulfilling by doing this? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the government needs to address safety concerns
					 for a whole host of reasons, like boosting consumer confidence and providing
					 more security for flying Canadians. It also needs to ensure long term
					 competition in the air industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted that the transport minister in an interview
					 yesterday said that we may need to have a thorough restructuring. He said this
					 at the same press conference where he announced the $160 million for the
					 airline industry. He said that we may have to restructure the entire airline
					 industry again, not that the restructuring that was done 24 months ago was bad,
					 but it may need to be restructured again. However, we should not ask him if the
					 last one was a success or not, but we may have to restructure again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the sorts of things that we need to be
					 dealing with, the restructuring of the airlines, airport security and airline
					 security. The situation with Canada 3000 may be more volatile in the short term
					 than that of Air Canada. The transport minister is just not showing
					 leadership.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should compare what Canada's transport minister, the
					 finance minister and the Prime Minister are doing with what the United States
					 is doing. In Chicago on Thursday of last week President Bush did three things.
					 First, he called up the national guard and placed guardsmen at inspection
					 stations in airports. They are still there. He said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--we
						  will work with the governors to provide security measures--visible security
						  measures--so the traveling public will know that we are serious about airline
						  safety in America.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing he did was dramatically increase the
					 number of air marshals on planes. He said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>When Americans fly, there need to be
						  more highly-skilled and fully-equipped officers of law flying alongside
						  them.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third thing he did was give $500 million in new
					 funding for aircraft security, the physical infrastructure of planes. He gave
					 grants to airlines for enhanced cockpit protection. He will work with the
					 pilots and airlines to fortify doors and provide stronger locks so pilots will
					 always be in command of the airplane and no one can get into the
					 cockpit.</p>


	<A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1655)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again this goes back to what I said before, about the
					 transport minister announcing $160 million, but across the street. He announced
					 that the government would be closing cockpit doors and that it would be
					 mandated now on every flight. Fine. That is good and we support that. It is a
					 solid step in the right direction. Good show. However, again he announced it
					 outside the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will applaud the minister when he announces an
					 initiative, a bold initiative, any initiative, a meagre initiative, but that
					 will be the day when he actually does it in the House. When he does he will
					 earn our applause. However he has not done it yet and he is abdicating his
					 responsibility to make parliament the decision maker in terms of the long term
					 interest of our airline industry, in terms of security and in terms of
					 competition. Parliament should decide it, not just the transport minister. The
					 transport minister can propose it. That is the duty and obligation of the
					 transport minister and of the executive of the government, but parliament as a
					 whole should be deciding these issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative to what the United States has done, the
					 government's response has been utterly and completely lacklustre. Air Canada,
					 as I have said, has announced that it will lay off 5,000 people in addition to
					 the 4,000 already announced. The numbers may be as high at 12,000 when all is
					 said and done. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have called on the transport minister, and I will do
					 it again, to do four concrete things. I call on him to reconvene the transport
					 committee, which happened on Monday, but to give us a set agenda to address the
					 security and financial issues the air industry is facing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was happy to learn this afternoon that the transport
					 minister announced he will be appearing before the transport committee
					 tomorrow. I hope he comes with better answers and solutions than he came to the
					 House with when we had our take note debate on the airline industry as a whole.
					 He came to the House and said literally nothing. He said that everything was
					 fine. He did not mention any specific numbers with regard to Air Canada. He did
					 not share with the House the specific financial crunch that Air Canada is
					 facing. He did not tell the House exactly what Air Canada has asked him for in
					 private, which he could share with the House so that opposition members could
					 consider those numbers and consider how we might approach these things. He did
					 not say anything. I hope that when he comes before the committee tomorrow he
					 actually has something concrete to contribute.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing the transport minister should do is
					 ask Robert Milton of Air Canada and the heads of all of Canada's national and
					 regional air carriers to appear before the transport committee immediately, for
					 the committee to hear arguments for and against any potential financial
					 support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third thing he needs to do is institute air
					 marshals today, as I said, to boost consumer confidence in the airline industry
					 and to offer another layer of air travel security. We have to think of this not
					 only in the context of boosting consumer confidence and within the context of
					 giving another layer of security in the air but also to the extent that
					 specifically, if there is ever a financial bailout beyond the $160 million, the
					 lion's share of that money will go to Air Canada, principally because it has a
					 dominant share of the domestic air travel in this country with the customers it
					 flies. It will take the lion's share of that money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that reality and the fact that Air Canada is the
					 only real Canadian based competitor that competes internationally, Air Canada
					 will be competing against American carriers that now have air marshals. In the
					 United States as a whole there are over 12,000 people who are now being trained
					 and assigned as air marshals. Air Canada will be competing on the international
					 stage with Lufthansa, United, American Airlines, Continental and a host of
					 other air carriers that will all have air marshals on planes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future when people fly the questions they will
					 ask will not simply be about what the in cabin amenities will be, how long the
					 flight will be, how much leg room they will have, what movies will be shown and
					 whether a hot or cold meal will be served. They will also be asking serious
					 questions about the security of the airplanes. They will ask about cockpit
					 doors. They will ask about air marshals. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the United States having air marshals, the
					 transport minister said in the House that he is ruling out the idea of air
					 marshals altogether as an extreme and radical proposition. He is just ruling it
					 out right away. What he has done is cement himself into a position that will
					 force Air Canada into a situation where it has a competitive disadvantage with
					 other international carriers in trying to bring more people on board. That is a
					 big mistake, not only in the security sense, not only in the sense of not
					 boosting consumer confidence but in the sense that he is putting Canadian
					 carriers at a competitive disadvantage by ruling out the idea of air marshals.
					 That is a big mistake.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth thing I would ask the transport minister to
					 do is ask all of Canada's air carriers to submit a full list of their direct
					 out of pocket expenses incurred during the days that Canada's airports were
					 shut down so that consideration can be given to compensation for those costs.
					 We are told that the transport minister has those numbers and therefore acted
					 to give $160 million. We support the giving of the out of pocket costs, but it
					 is very difficult to say whether or not we support the precise figure of $160
					 million when the transport minister has not tabled the exact figures before the
					 House.</p>


	<A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1700)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The out of pocket costs incurred by the airline
					 industry on September 11 are legitimate costs. The skies were closed, not
					 because of any market forces but because of a government mandate. Therefore it
					 is entirely reasonable for the government to compensate the airlines for the
					 closing of the skies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assume those airlines gave the transport minister an
					 itemized list of what all their expenses were but he has not shared them with
					 the House. That is irresponsible. Given the fact that we have not had a budget
					 in 18 months and we may not have a budget for another 18 months as we have not
					 had a firm commitment on that front, the House needs to send a signal by voting
					 on specific measures. I would be proud to vote in favour of giving $160 million
					 to the airline industry, given that the appropriate accounting has been done
					 for those expenses. That would be a signal from the House that we will support
					 the airline industry for the tough times it experienced on September
					 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically on Bill C-34, the transportation appeal
					 tribunal act, on the face of it the idea of a transportation tribunal is a good
					 one. It is clear that some bright person looked at the civil aviation tribunal
					 which so efficiently deals with the suspension of a pilot's licence and with
					 airworthiness certificates, and said "I bet this would work in shipping and I
					 bet this would work in rail as well". It has been expanded and we support
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a good idea. Anything that lets minor disputes be
					 settled outside the court system, specifically when the decisions are made by
					 people with some expertise in the area in question, is a positive step. To have
					 some injection of some common sense into disputes makes a lot of sense and we
					 support it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the transport committee really needs to be
					 brought into a broader discussion, as I have said before, not only on this
					 legislation but on other pieces of legislation. Canadians think that the
					 transport committee should be plugged in so that we can make travel safer on
					 airplanes, highways, rail and in seaway navigation. They want us to encourage
					 competition, service to communities and affordable prices. Right now Canadians
					 want airline competition among healthy airlines. They want safer skies, better
					 airport security, stronger cockpit doors and air marshals. They want the same
					 standards the United States has.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us have a level playing field. We always talk about
					 a level playing field in terms of trade and in a lot of areas. Let us talk
					 about a level playing field in terms of aviation as well.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-54778"></A><a HREF="#Int-54780"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-54774"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b>

	The transport committee needs to deal with a lot of
					 things and it is not. We have some extraordinarily experienced parliamentarians
					 on the committee. I think of the member for South Surrey--White Rock--Langley
					 who used to be the transport critic for the official opposition. I think of the
					 NDP member for Churchill, an outstanding member of parliament who has done a
					 lot of hard work on committee. I think of the member for Toronto--Danforth and
					 the member for Winnipeg South. There are a lot of very good, highly competent,
					 very experienced people in the transport committee who are really ready and
					 anxious to do a lot of good work, to help contribute. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transport minister has not plugged in the
					 committee. He has not given us any guidance or pushed us forward. He has not
					 tabled any meaningful legislation. What on earth are we doing talking about
					 Bill C-34, a tribunal act, when at this very moment we could be talking about
					 airport security and the question of whether or not we should re-nationalize
					 airport security?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could be talking about the guiding principles of a
					 possible bailout for the airline industry and whether or not it is appropriate.
					 We could be talking about air marshals. We could be talking about mandating
					 that older planes still in service have reinforced cockpit doors with the
					 newest technology such as the Kevlar coming out of Boeing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the sort of legislation we could be dealing
					 with, but we are not being shown that leadership. We are being shown
					 legislation, well meaning, decent legislation that would cut down on
					 bureaucracy and would increase efficiency and inject some common sense into
					 things, but on the radar screen of Canadians in terms of the legislation they
					 want to see and the priorities they have for the transport committee, the
					 transport minister and the transport industry of the country, the legislation
					 is way wide of the mark. Canadians deserve better. They deserve better
					 leadership. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one piece of advice for the transport minister.
					 I have told him this in private and I have told him that I will say it
					 publicly. I will do so now. The best thing parliament can do on a cross-party
					 basis for the airline industry as a whole in this time of crisis is to stand
					 shoulder to shoulder with the U.S. and announce the kinds of things that
					 President Bush did in Chicago on Thursday of last week.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Bush went to Chicago and stood on a podium in
					 front of 1,200 airline employees, the people who check the bags, the in-cabin
					 flight crews, pilots, security guards, everyone. He stood in front of 1,200 of
					 them with the transportation secretary at one shoulder, with the governor of
					 Illinois at the other shoulder, with a couple of senators on his flank and
					 members of congress and the state assembly on the other flank. He stood on that
					 big stage with a big American flag and he said his government would put air
					 marshals on planes, mandate the reinforcement and renovation of cockpit doors,
					 beef up security on the ground with the latest technologies and retrain
					 everyone on the ground. "Fly the friendly skies" he said. He said there was no
					 reason why Americans should not fly in their country. He said America will not
					 be afraid, Americans will not allow the terrorists to alter their way of life,
					 they will soldier forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Bush did it. He made a big public statement.
					 However the transport minister said in the debate on Monday night that he does
					 not want to make big public statements. I know that he is not a shy man. He is
					 a good guy, but he needs to make big public pronouncements. That is precisely
					 what is called for. He says he does not want to make big public pronouncements
					 because he does not want to send some kind of signal. Most people I talk to do
					 not understand the signal he is trying to avoid.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transport minister says he wants to make little
					 announcements such as the announcement that he made across the street in a
					 press conference. He wants to make announcements in scrums. He wants to make
					 announcements as he is running down the hall and avoiding reporters. He does
					 not want to stand up and make big public announcements, but that is exactly
					 what is called for, a big public announcement, a big vote of confidence and a
					 big boost to the airline industry, to say to Canadians that we are taking
					 action, that we will not let the terrorists alter our way of life. That
					 announcement would say to people that they are safe in the skies, the
					 government is behind them, the airlines are safe and the Government of Canada
					 will not fail them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the minister did that and put in the measures we are
					 talking about, the kinds of measures I have outlined in my talk, if he put
					 those things on the table, the official opposition would be proud to stand
					 behind him if he initiated those things, because that is progress and growth
					 and a step in the right direction. I am sure the other opposition members would
					 be as well. We reconvened the transport committee on Monday and had a meeting
					 yesterday. Right off the top, across all party lines, we all said that the big
					 thing we want to talk about when the transport minister comes to committee
					 tomorrow is the issue of airline security. We are all concerned about this,
					 just as all Canadians are concerned about it. </p>


	<A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than substantive legislation and a substantive
					 signal from the transport minister that he will get behind this, encourage,
					 push and mandate new security measures, what do we get? We get Bill C-34, the
					 transportation appeal tribunal of Canada act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an abdication of leadership. This is an
					 abdication of responsibility on the part of the transport minister. We need to
					 be showing leadership, putting real solutions forward and seizing the moment,
					 carpe diem, so we can encourage more people to fly and have a better
					 transportation industry. Bill C-34 does not accomplish that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a real disappointment to have to say as a
					 Canadian, not even as a parliamentarian, that the government is sleepwalking
					 through what may be the largest crisis in our transportation industry with the
					 layoffs at Air Canada and sagging consumer confidence. The government is
					 sleepwalking through this entire episode and abdicating its responsibility to
					 show leadership and put substantive reforms on the table that will make our
					 industry better.</p>

					 (Argenteuil--Papineau--Mirabel, BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate
					 on Bill C-34. I should note that the parliamentary secretary, who in his
					 introduction deemed it appropriate to congratulate the minister for his
					 availability and his quick reaction, seemed uncomfortable with the fact that
					 the first debate we have on transportation is on a bill to establish the
					 transportation appeal tribunal of Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill has nothing to do with the great debates of
					 the last few weeks. Since the events of September 11, transportation has been
					 in the forefront of all our discussions in the House. Take note debates were
					 held, special committees were created and the first piece of legislation
					 dealing with transportation to be tabled in the House is aimed at establishing
					 an appeal tribunal. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, the parliamentary secretary seemed
					 uncomfortable, and I will take this opportunity to respond to some of the
					 comments he made. He talked about the availability of the Minister of
					 Transport. The parliamentary secretary said that the Prime Minister was always
					 available, as well as the Minister of Transport. I should certainly hope so.
					 The least we can expect from the Minister of Transport is for him to be here in
					 the House to answer our questions and the least we can expect from the Prime
					 Minister is for him to do whatever he can to be with members of all parties as
					 often as possible to deal with such a serious situation as the terrorist
					 attacks of September 11 against the United States.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Transport was indeed available Monday
					 when we had the emergency debate. All day that day, the propaganda machine of
					 the Liberal government was hard at work on the radio and on television,
					 delivering the message that there would be a great debate that night on the
					 situation facing airlines in Canada following the sad events of September
					 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody was looking forward to the minister's
					 statement. True, he was here, but he did not have to be here to make the
					 statement he made. We learned nothing new about what the government intends to
					 do, what the airlines were asking or what the government's financial capability
					 is to deal with the terrible events of September 11 and all the
					 consequences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is worth mentioning. Monday night, 13,602 jobs
					 were lost throughout Canada. I said in this House that we did not want to be
					 doomsayers, we just wanted to prevent further job losses, but Boeing has since,
					 just two days ago, announced more layoffs in Canada and the United States.
					 Messier-Dowty, the landing gear specialist supplying Boeing and other
					 airliners, has now put on hold the $70 million capital investment project
					 previously announced as part of its expansion plan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is undeniably getting worse. Granted, the
					 minister and the Prime Minister are availabl, but I wonder if they are also
					 available when it comes to addressing these problems. They are available to
					 discuss the issues, to use the propaganda machine, to be on television and on
					 the radio to reassure everyone that they are dealing with the issues, but they
					 should also be available to address the problems. I must say that is not what
					 we have seen so far.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am trying to stay calm, because the situation is
					 getting worse and it will get even worse. It is unfortunate, but it is having a
					 domino effect. It is the same thing all over the world, not only in Canada. We
					 have to stop reacting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the Minister of Transport and the
					 Liberal government is that they are always reacting. These are difficult times,
					 when action is really required, not reaction. That is what they did. The
					 government intervened quickly in reaction to terrible situations. However, when
					 the events are examined and security assessed, clearly the message was already
					 there in the Ressam case. The United States gave Canada strong warning, saying
					 “Look at the problem of terrorism in Canada. You should tighten your borders
					 and your security”. Nothing was done. </p>


	<A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1715)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was surprised to hear employees of all the airlines,
					 who came to meet me as transport critic, mention the Ressam case; they told me
					 the airlines had not been asked to take any additional security measures. I
					 assume that no additional measures were required of the others involved in
					 security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, despite what it knew, the government
					 continued to follow its economic policy and announced a budget. It was
					 mentioned earlier that there had not been a budget in 18 months. There was an
					 economic update. The government tightened the belt, it is true. Canadians were
					 asked to tighten their belts. Belts had to be tightened, but Canadians and
					 Quebecers still had to be given the security they expected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belts were tightened, but the government did not invest
					 in security. It is no longer involved in it. Security has been handed over to
					 private companies according to the lowest bidder. We can see what that means.
					 Security measures have been relaxed over the past 10 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In airports we get our boarding cards from electronic
					 machines. There are no more personnel. Security experts all tell us that the
					 first intervention in security matters is the instinct of the people who have
					 worked in the field for years. I mean the employees behind the counter in
					 airports who, instinctively and because of their training, are able to
					 recognize security problems first.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees, human beings have been replaced by machines.
					 Since September 11, there have been days when these machines were not used and
					 other days when they were put back in use.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always a reaction somewhere. This is what must
					 stop. The government, the Liberal Party, must stop thinking that it has all the
					 solutions. It is true that things are going well for the Liberals. They are
					 doing well in the polls, but at some point the political propaganda must stop
					 and the government must give the public what it expects. Right now, people want
					 to make sure that what occurred on September 11 never happens again.
					 </p>


	<A NAME="T1720"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1720)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we cannot ever guarantee anything in our
					 societies, because they are liberal societies. The challenge for us consists in
					 protecting liberalism in our societies while imposing as few constraints as
					 possible, but we must have the required personnel at the borders, at airports
					 and everywhere. We must be able to provide adequate training, but all this
					 costs money. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government must stop saying that it acts quickly
					 when a catastrophe occurs. Sure, the Minister of Transport acted very quickly
					 after the catastroph, but today we are asking him to be proactive and to invest
					 so that such catastrophes do not happen again. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old adage says that an ounce of prevention is worth
					 a pound of cure. Since September 11, the Minister of Transport has been trying
					 to find a cure. The grim reality is that he never focused on prevention. The
					 Liberal government decided to win the election by saving as much money as
					 possible, but it did so in areas where it should not have, despite repeated
					 warnings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Ressam case in 2000, Canada was told to
					 tighten security. It continued to save money, to make use of the private sector
					 and, above all, to give contracts to the lowest bidder. It is not anybody's
					 fault. No one can blame the employees who are there and who have not received
					 the proper training. The only reason is that the government is trying to save
					 money. It chose not to invest in our security. That is why we are faced with
					 this grim reality today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand why the parliamentary secretary is
					 uncomfortable with Bill C-34, which establishes the transportation appeal
					 tribunal of Canada. The current situation does not call for the establishment
					 of appeal tribunals. It is a serious situation that must be dealt with in terms
					 of security and in terms of economic intervention. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We certainly hope to see the kind of quick reaction
					 that the member was talking about on the part of the government. So far the
					 government's reaction has been purely political. Every week it has made a small
					 announcement, but not in the House, not in front of members who were elected by
					 their fellow citizens to discuss these things. The government does not make
					 these announcements in front of parliamentarians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every week, in what will probably be an orchestrated
					 performance with a good communication plan, the government will try to lull the
					 good people of Quebec and Canada into thinking that it is looking after their
					 affairs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government had actually done this we would not
					 be looking at the situations we are today. If the government were to take rapid
					 action, if it were to step in quickly, it could try to prevent the domino
					 effect in the airline and aviation industries and in international tourism.
					 That is what is required and it must be done soon.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now all it will do is stand by while everything
					 falls apart. It will let everything fall apart and will then take stock of the
					 damage and slowly but surely decide to put up a few million dollars every week
					 to show the public that it is looking after them and that it is capable of
					 sorting out their problems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not what is needed. What is needed is a real
					 solution. What is needed is a real plan and it is time that the government told
					 us what that plan is. It is not the time for the government to come to this
					 House with a bill like Bill C-34, on which we are agreed. I say this up front.
					 There will not be any long debates about Bill C-34 and the creation of the
					 appeal tribunal, which should have been set up years ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years now the Bloc Quebecois has been calling for
					 the integration of these four tribunals that were subject to the Aeronautics
					 Act, the Shipping Act, the Marine Transportation Security Act and the Railways
					 Safety Act. This is what this bill is all about and we are happy about it.
					 However, it should have been done during the last parliament, and even a year
					 ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time last year the government once again called
					 an early election, which took all Canadians and opposition parties by surprise.
					 It rushed the election. The government's goal was, of course, to win the
					 election and as we can see it managed to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, however, Canadians and Quebecers are not
					 feeling totally safe with a Liberal government at the helm. More and more, they
					 approach the opposition parties to speak for them. The workers who lose their
					 jobs come to the opposition parties to have their voices heard in this
					 House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly what we are trying to do and what we
					 have been trying to do since September 11. We are trying to speak on behalf of
					 those families who are going through some rough times because of their
					 employment situation, but again, nobody in the House is listening to us. With
					 legislation such as Bill C-34 the government is saying “See how we are trying
					 to deal with the transportation issues”. </p>


	<A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1725)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are having serious discussions with various unions
					 about the proposed changes to the Employment Insurance Act and the way to deal
					 with all those job losses. Why is it always the little people and not the
					 managers who are affected by the layoffs? Why is it always the young workers,
					 those who have less seniority, who lose their jobs?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not arrange with the companies for major early
					 retirement programs, which are expensive but are a one time thing? The money is
					 paid out only once. It would be possible in the airline industry, with the help
					 of the unions, to use attrition in the industry as a whole to benefit the young
					 people who are the last to arriv, but the first hit by any draconian cuts, such
					 as those that result from major events like those of September 11. The
					 employees did not ask for this but they are being hit with it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, employees who have lost their jobs may find
					 it all very well for the minister to say on Monday “Look, security has finally
					 been improved since September 11, flight decks will be better protected”. There
					 are 13,600 of them who have lost their jobs. Some will lose their jobs with
					 Boeing in Canada. Some will lose a job or not get the one they were in line for
					 at Messier-Dowty. This will happen with other companies too. All these people
					 are entitled to say to the Minister of Transport “Why did you not think of this
					 before”?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the Minister of Transport not think before of
					 tightening flight deck security? That is today's harsh reality. The government
					 reacted. It was quick, yes indeed. It found the solution, but why did it not
					 think of it before? There are other airlines around the world with flight deck
					 security measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a question we all must ask ourselves. We will
					 have the opportunity to do so in the transport committee. My colleague in the
					 Canadian Alliance said this earlier. This committee began deliberations this
					 week. Believe it or not, air transportation was not even on the agenda of the
					 government representatives sitting on the transport committee. Air
					 transportation problems were not on the agenda. It was the agenda from the
					 committee's previous deliberations, as if September 11 had never occurred. That
					 was the harsh reality. That is the harsh reality. Why is this so? Because
					 government members on this committee think their excellent minister is
					 available, acts quickly, and will react swiftly if there is a
					 problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will repeat that an ounce of prevention is worth a
					 pound of cure. We should try to involve all those concerned, in all parties. In
					 a crisis such as this one there is no room for politics or propaganda, but this
					 is all the Liberal Party has been doing since September 11. Once more the
					 public is being lulled by announcements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday night's debate is a good example. It was
					 announced on all radio and television networks that there was going to be a
					 great debate that evening on the future of the airline industry in Canada. What
					 did the minister have to say? He was very glad he had successfully addressed
					 the issue of cockpit safety. He enumerated all the things he had done since day
					 one of the crisis, but strictly nothing has been done concerning a financial
					 assistance plan for the airline industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day after the debate the Minister of Transport
					 announced the investment of $160 million. That was just to cover the losses of
					 September 11 to 16, when all of the airlines were grounded because of these
					 tragic events. They experienced losses because their employees were stranded
					 and so on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister helped out with those losses and must be
					 thanked for that, but since then, since the airspace shutdown from September 11
					 to 16, 13,602 jobs have been lost. There will be even more job losses at
					 Boeing. Messier-Dowty will not be able to carry out its $70 million capital
					 investment plan announced last June. There will be other
					 repercussions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same goes for international tourism, which has
					 experienced huge losses in Quebec City and no doubt in most of Canada's tourist
					 centres. What the Liberal government is doing with its propaganda policy is to
					 watch and wait until everything comes tumbling down, then take note of the
					 damage and see what it will be capable of investing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Minister of Finance said that the estimated
					 surplus is not as great as expected; we are heading for an economic recession.
					 He would not dare to use that term, of course. We will have a third or fourth
					 quarter that may not be as good as forecast.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously that is the way to get out of the situation
					 without spending money and avoiding a deficit above all. No opposition party in
					 the House, the Bloc Quebecois included, has called for the government to aim
					 for a deficit. It is estimated, as we speak, that there will be a $13 billion
					 surplus this year and that is with the worst case scenarios for the third and
					 fourth quarters. That is reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do the Minister of Transport and all Liberal
					 members of the House not decide to demand the true picture of Canada's economic
					 situation from the Minister of Finance so they can pass it on to the
					 public?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the government should meet with
					 representatives of the airline, aviation and international tourism industries
					 and those involved in tourism in general who are having such a terrible time.
					 It should sit down with them and say “We are going to help you out”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not what we feel. I realize that the
					 parliamentary secretary was not comfortable when he presented Bill C-34,
					 because the message really is that the government, the minister and the Prime
					 Minister are available and quick to take action but only once the damage has
					 been assessed. This is what is hard to accept for opposition members. The
					 government will once again wait until the airline, aviation and international
					 tourism industries collapse; it will wait until the house of cards comes
					 tumbling down and then look at the whole situation and take quick
					 action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, this is hard to accept. As we speak,
					 workers, both men and women, have lost their jobs. There will be others,
					 particularly in Quebec, where the aviation and aerospace industries are
					 concentrated, but also across Canada, because Boeing has investments right
					 across the country. Large numbers of jobs are disappearing in this sector.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for international tourism, it is not just Quebec
					 that is affected. Our province attracts a significant proportion of
					 international tourists, but there are cities in all regions of Canada that are
					 centres for tourism and these cities are definitely feeling the effects of the
					 September 11 events. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If government members in this House think that things
					 are going well for international tourism, they should visit the tourist
					 attractions in their ridings. They will realize that we are going through a
					 serious crisis that will have major consequences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the parliamentary secretary will tell his
					 minister “Dear Minister, your availability and your quickness to react would be
					 more useful before everything collapses, as opposed to after”. This is the
					 message that the Bloc Quebecois wants to give to the House, and this is the
					 view that it will promote in the coming weeks. </p>

				motion. </p>


	<A NAME="Int-54787"></A><a HREF="#Int-54790"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-54832"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jean-Yves Roy (Matapédia--Matane,
					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure and pride that I
					 rise today in this House to speak to Motion No. 241 brought forward by my
					 colleague, the hon. member for Verchères--Les-Patriotes, which reads as
					 follows: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That a humble Address be presented to
						  Her Excellency praying that she will intercede with Her Majesty to cause the
						  British Crown to present an official apology to the Acadian people for the
						  wrongs done to them in its name between 1755 and 1763.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot has happened since we first started the debate on
					 this issue, on March 27, 2001. After dispelling doubts about his Acadian
					 origins, the hon. member for Verchères--Les-Patriotes travelled to Acadia on
					 three occasions to submit his proposal to the Acadian people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His first visit, in May, took him to New Brunswick. His
					 second, in June, took him to Prince Edward Island for the annual general
					 meeting of the Société nationale des Acadiens. His latest one, in August,
					 coincided with the celebration of national Acadian day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During these visits, my colleague made some important
					 contacts and broadened the support for his proposal within the Acadian
					 community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first to support Motion No. 241 brought
					 forward by my hon. colleague was a lawyer from Louisiana, Warren Perrin, who
					 has been fighting for more than 10 years to have the wrongs done to the Acadian
					 people during the deportation between 1755 and 1763 recognized.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A descendant of exiled Acadians, Warren Perrin has
					 become an unswerving defender of the rights of the francophones known today as
					 the Cajun and of the Acadian culture in Louisiana. Since 1990, Mr. Perrin has
					 tirelessly organized a petition to cause the British crown to apologize for the
					 deportation of the Acadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the support of hundreds of individuals and
					 associations as well as history and international law experts, he has received
					 the support of the legislatures of Maine and Louisiana. Democrat Senator John
					 Breaux even intends to raise the issue before the American congress.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it bizarre that the Parliament of Canada, to
					 which our Acadian fellow countrymen elect representatives, is choosing to sit
					 on the sidelines, legislatively speaking, on this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 2, 2001, the Société nationale des Acadiens
					 held a general assembly where it reconsidered its initial position and
					 unanimously supported Motion No. 241. The Société nationale des Acadiens has
					 great influence, credibility and a whole network of contacts in the maritimes
					 and throughout the world and it represents the Acadian community of Atlantic
					 Canada and elsewhere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opinion of the members of the Société nationale
					 des Acadiens, this motion gives the Acadian people the opportunity to have the
					 wrongs done to their ancestors, as well as the concrete impacts that are still
					 felt today, officially recognized.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To its credit, the Société nationale des Acadiens
					 wanted to take this issue outside of the parliamentary framework. To legitimize
					 its position, on August 16, 2001, it set up an advisory committee led by
					 Maurice Basque, an historian and the director of the Centre d'études acadiennes
					 of the Université de Moncton. The main purpose of the committee was to consider
					 the historical, legislative and social issues surrounding Motion No.
					 241.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated in its report, the committee heard from
					 about 140 individuals, associations, municipalities and Acadian organizations
					 from Canada, the United States and France. After analyzing all the proposals,
					 the advisory committee came out with a number of recommendations, including the
					 two following:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That the Société nationale des
						  Acadiens pursue its representations to cause the British crown to officially
						  recognize the historical wrongs done during the deportation of the
						  Acadians.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That the motion be sponsored by all
						  Acadian members of the House of Commons, regardless of political
						  stripe.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third recommendation concerns the mustering of
					 Acadian forces to consolidate their promotional and developmental efforts in
					 order to catch up economically, socially and culturally. The final opinion is
					 that the Société nationale des Acadiens should continue to support the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an article in the September 26, 2001 issue of <i>La
					 Voix Acadienne</i>, journalist Annie Racine lists some of the organizations
					 supporting the action by the member for Verchères--Les-Patriotes:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--Motion M-241 has the support of the Société des Acadiennes et
						  des Acadiens du Nouveau-Brunswick, of the Société nationale des Acadiens, of
						  the Association des juristes francophones and of the Association francophone
						  des municipalités du Nouveau-Brunswick.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should mention that this last association represents
					 40 municipalities in the province of New Brunswick and nearly 100,000
					 Acadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a growing consensus around the motion
					 in the Acadian population, as Hector J. Cormier, an editorial writer, indicated
					 in <i>Le Moniteur Acadien</i> on September 27, 2001, and I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--Acadians are justified in demanding apologies for the wrongs
						  done to their people in the deportation. It would put an end to unconscionable
						  treatment, to centuries-long suffering and to a collective fear it will take
						  long to dispel. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrongs done by a group of individuals can have
					 repercussions over a lifetime, lasting decades. At some point someone has to
					 recognize the errors made and wounds must be healed to enable people to live in
					 the present, work for the future and stop feeling obliged to look back to the
					 pain of the past.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Philippe Ricard's article in <i>L'Acadie
					 Nouvelle</i> on September 20, 2001, “--Liberal members have to stop being
					 afraid of the “machinations” of the Bloc members. Because, if the motion were
					 defeated, Acadia and Acadians would slip further behind”. The wound would
					 remain unhealed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former member for West Nova, Conservative Mark
					 Muise, said in a speech in the House on November 30, 1999:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>It took several centuries for
						  Acadians to recover from this tragedy. Some would argue that we are still
						  suffering. Historians do not all agree about this deportation. Was it a war
						  against the Acadians or an ethnic cleansing operation? This, I guess, depends
						  on the viewpoint of the historian. Nevertheless, no one can deny that this
						  tragedy happened and that the measures taken by Great Britain had serious
						  consequences.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion itself does not call for compensation and
					 does not invite descendants of those who were deported to return to occupy
					 their land. It is simply aimed at obtaining an apology for the pain and
					 suffering inflicted upon the Acadian people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Verchères--Les-Patriotes is saying to
					 anyone who is willing to listen that if necessary he will have his motion
					 sponsored by a member of another political party in the House and he is even
					 willing to accept amendments to his motion, in keeping with the proposals
					 contained in the report from the Societé nationale des Acadiens. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above all, this is not the motion of one member or one
					 political party but of the Acadian people. This initiative by the member for
					 Verchères--Les-Patriotes goes beyond the partisan considerations that usually
					 prevail in this House. It is part of the preparation for the 3rd Congrès
					 mondial acadien and the celebration of the 400th anniversary of the founding of
					 Acadia, which will take place in 2004. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above all, however, we think that the 250th anniversary
					 of the deportation of Acadians, which will be commemorated all over the world
					 in 2005 by the Acadian diaspora, among others, would be a most appropriate time
					 for such an apology.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary process is such that it will be a
					 long time before the House can vote on this motion. Let us use this time to
					 ensure that this issue is not affected by partisan considerations. Nobody would
					 gain anything should this motion be defeated. However, many people would lose a
					 lot, and they are not necessarily the ones that the opponents of this motion
					 want to punish by voting against it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What message would we be sending to the world should
					 that happen? That the Canadian parliamentary system is unable to disregard the
					 origin of an initiative when making a decision.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most importantly, what message would we be sending to
					 the Acadian people? That the deportation is an event that is not worth
					 recognizing here in parliament? That this issue is not important enough for the
					 elected representatives of the people to show some openness and maturity in
					 dealing with it? That parliamentarians could not reach the type of consensus
					 that we witnessed with regard to many other often less significant issues? In
					 any case, everybody comes out a loser. </p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is with regret that I will be voting
					 against Motion No. 241. My reasons for doing so are twofold.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I feel that this motion is based on a faulty
					 premise, that being that guilt can be collective and can be passed on from one
					 generation to the next.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, despite the good intentions of those who
					 drafted it, the motion seems to attribute ultimate responsibility for the
					 expulsion of the Acadians to the crown, which is not an accurate reading of the
					 events of 1755. A more historically accurate reading would lay blame with the
					 colonial governors of New England and the pioneers they represented.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin with the historical argument and come back
					 later to the philosophical one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the facts surrounding the deportation of the
					 Acadians are unchallenged. In 1755, the colonial authorities began a process of
					 uprooting and deporting that part of the Acadian population which had settled
					 on British lands, beginning with the centre of the Acadian colony along the
					 east shore of the Bay of Fundy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nova Scotia's Governor Lawrence, and Governor Shirley,
					 commander in chief of the British forces in New England, began by seizing
					 colonists' firearms to prevent them from using force to resist. Then they took
					 a large number of adult males hostage in order to guarantee the docility of
					 their families at the time of deportation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years that followed, approximately
					 three-quarters of the total Acadian population, or 13,000 people, were
					 deported. Some of these people were sent to New England, others to Louisian,
					 and still others were returned to France.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we know with certainty the degree of suffering
					 caused by the deportations between 1755 and 1763, it is much more difficult to
					 pin down historical responsibility for them. One thing is certain and that is
					 that governors Lawrence and Shirley were at the heart of the decision making
					 and must bear ultimate responsibility, but nothing proves that they acted with
					 the approval of the parliament of Westminster.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the most commonly accepted version of
					 events, Lawrence acted with the authorization of the local council in Nova
					 Scotia, and parliament and King George did not take part in the planning of the
					 deportations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, Roger Paradis, a professor of history at
					 the University of Maine, has uncovered documentary evidence suggesting that the
					 authorities in London were involved. He cites a bill, sent to London in 1758 by
					 Governor Lawrence, listing the expenditures incurred for the deportation. He
					 has also revealed the existence of a circular sent by Lawrence to governors of
					 the New England colonies, which presumes that these governors were, at the very
					 least, aware of the events taking place in Acadia.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what strikes me is that even in this
					 revisionist interpretation of history, the colonial authorities in Acadia and
					 New England take on the primary responsibility for the acts committed while the
					 crown only has a secondary responsibility. Moreover, it is obvious that the
					 first ones to benefit from the military security that was increased as a result
					 of ethnic cleansing in Acadia were the New England pioneers and specifically
					 those living in the portion of the colony of Massachusetts then known as the
					 “District of Maine”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I emphasize that I will not support the notion of a
					 collective or hereditary guilt, but even if I did support it, I think that the
					 first collective excuses that should be conveyed to the Acadian people should
					 come from the government of Maine. </p>


	<A NAME="T1745"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1745)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore interesting to know that on April 13,
					 1994, the Maine legislative assembly passed a resolution regarding the
					 deportation of the Acadians. It was carefully drafted in such a way that the
					 blame is laid exclusively on the British, and it never hints at the fact that
					 Maine, a sovereign state, or its predecessor, the English colony of
					 Massachusetts Bay, could have been involved in any way. I think that the best
					 we can say about this statement is that it comes from a serious
					 misinterpretation of history. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the motion before us today is based on
					 the same mistake. The motion calls on the crown to “present an official apology
					 to the Acadian people for the wrongs done to them in its name”. However, the
					 fact that the deportation was ordered in the name of the British crown does not
					 mean that the crown itself was the primary culprit, even in 1755. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, history is full of outrageous acts committed
					 in the name of various religions or in the name of the people of one territory
					 or another, while the authority named had very little to do, if anything, with
					 the harm that was done in its name. A more historically accurate motion could
					 demand official apologies from the legislative assemblies of each of the New
					 England states for the harm done in their interests and with their
					 complicity.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should be clear about the fact that I would oppose
					 this too. I would do so because I do not accept the notion that an institution
					 can maintain a heritage of collective guilt which is imposed upon successive
					 generations of those who become members of that institution or who fall under
					 its protection. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that some participants in the debate
					 over this motion and in similar debates that have occurred in the past have
					 contemplated two quite different concepts. The first concept is the
					 expectation, which I regard as legitimate, that all participants in the public
					 life of a civilized society should adopt a moral attitude toward the past. A
					 moral attitude involves recognizing and embracing those past actions that are
					 regarded as good and just and rejecting those that are regarded as unjust or
					 monstrous.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concept is the idea that guilt for a past
					 injustice can be passed on, institutionally and collectively, in precisely the
					 same way that the residual effects of that wrong continue to have some impact
					 on the descendants of those who suffered the initial wrong. This is simply
					 untrue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adoption of a moral attitude by an actor in
					 political life allows us, as potential voters or as potential political allies,
					 to assess how that individual might act in the future should he or she be a
					 decision maker in some similar future circumstance. Such a calculation is
					 necessary in a system of representative democracy because it is always
					 conceivable that one can win an election in a time of peace and then find that
					 his or her mandate extends into a period of unexpected turmoil or war. After
					 the events of September 11, I think we can see the utility of such
					 expectations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, an attitude of collective guilt or
					 responsibility, or worse yet, of expecting others to assume a mantle of guilt
					 or responsibility for acts in which they themselves did not take part, strikes
					 me as being of no utility at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A debate similar to the one taking place today took
					 place in this House 17 years ago on Pierre Trudeau's last day as prime
					 minister. He was asked by Brian Mulroney in question period to issue an apology
					 for the wartime internment of Canadians of Japanese descent. Trudeau's response
					 reveals a subtle grasp to the distinction that I am attempting of draw here
					 today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>I do not see how I can apologize for
						  some historic event to which we...were not a party. We can regret that it
						  happened. But why...say that an apology is much better than an expression of
						  regret?</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>I do not think that it is the purpose
						  of a government to right the past. It cannot re-write history. It is our
						  purpose to be just in our time--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not excuse us from a responsibility to adopt
					 a moral attitude of condemnation toward this great wrong any more than we can
					 adopt an attitude of moral neutrality toward the monstrous evils of more recent
					 times. As moral actors, we need to recognize the existence of these past
					 wrongs, to identify them to our fellow citizens and to do all that we can to
					 ensure that no modern version of this wrong can occur.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, let us vote against this motion in its
					 present form, but let us vote for it if it is reintroduced in the House in a
					 form that allows us to express, without apology, our sorrow over this past
					 wrong and if it allows us, without condemning others, to indicate our
					 determination that no such wrong will ever in the future be tolerated on
					 Canadian soil.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very interested in speaking today to
					 Motion No. 241 by the member for Verchères--Les-Patriotes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Bloc Quebecois colleague would like the British
					 crown to offer apologies for the deportation of the Acadians in 1755, which in
					 Acadia is still called the “Grand Dérangement”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acadian people suffered terribly in this period of
					 our history. The government tried to get rid of the Acadians by deporting them
					 and dividing them to better assimilate them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acadian people are still here, ever more vibrant
					 thanks to their artists, writers, actors and even politicians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all recognize that our country's history includes
					 some darker and more painful events. Unfortunately, the “Grand Dérangement” is
					 one such event.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we sincerely believe that we cannot live in
					 the past, but must continue to build this country, as have past generations of
					 Acadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that we should not live in the past, but I
					 do not think we should forget our history either. We have to draw from its
					 strengths and from its weaknesses. I have also said that we must keep on
					 building this country, building our Canada. We here in the House all know that
					 it is not a goal that is shared by the member for Verchères--Les-Patriotes or
					 the other members of his party. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Verchères--Les-Patriotes considers
					 himself to be the advocate for the Acadian people; at least that is what he
					 wants us to believe by bringing this motion forward in the House. When he spoke
					 in the House on March 27, my colleague, the member for Madawaska--Restigouche,
					 referred to the logic of the Bloc Quebecois, explaining that the member for
					 Verchères--Les-Patriotes' sudden interest for the fate of Acadians and of
					 francophones outside of Quebec was surprising. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the main thing. It is this logic that we have
					 to question. In fact, the real question is quite simple. We have to ask
					 ourselves why. Why this sudden interest from the Bloc for the Acadians? What
					 motivates this interest?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know the main goal that the party of the member
					 for Verchères--Les-Patriotes is pursuing. He and his colleagues in the Bloc
					 have but one goal, the destruction of this country. Unlike the other members of
					 this House, they are not here to work toward making Canada a better and safer
					 place to live. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the Bloc Quebecois suddenly so interested in the
					 plight of Acadians and francophones outside Quebec? We all know that according
					 to the Bloc Quebecois logic there are those who are saved, who live in Quebec,
					 and those who are lost, who live outside the promised land.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Madawaska--Restigouche already said
					 that Acadians helped build this country. They worked hard to protect their
					 culture and their identity. They do not need the help of the Bloc Quebecois.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acadians founded schools, colleges, universities,
					 theatres, newspapers and publishing houses. They achieved extraordinary
					 cultural success in areas such as theatre, cinema, visual arts, music and
					 literature. They gave the world writers, poets, artists, musicians and singers.
					 They developed an impressive network of businesses and created jobs.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They helped make Canada what it is today. They did not
					 wait to be taken by the hand and have decisions made for them. Instead of doing
					 what is being proposed by the Bloc Quebecois, I think we should focus on
					 celebrating and recognizing the enormous contribution of the Acadian people to
					 this great country that is Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion No. 241 proposed by the member for
					 Verchères--Les-Patriotes hides the true intentions of its sponsor and his
					 party. For that reason, we cannot support it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude with a quote that truly reflects the
					 position of the Bloc Quebecois. Here is what the Bloc member for
					 Rimouski--Neigette-et-la Mitis said on September 30, 1997: </p>

						  faulted for preferring to be a Quebecer to being a French Canadian. As a French

	Mr. Speaker, it gives me great privilege to rise in the
					 House to debate Motion No. 241 on behalf of the Acadian residents of West
					 Chezzetcook and Grand Desert in Nova Scotia.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a sin and a shame that the member for
					 Tobique--Mactaquac whom I respect very much would play politics with this
					 serious and compassionate motion. The member for Lanark--Carleton is trying to
					 rewrite history. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suspect that probably not one person from his
					 caucus has ever gone to Grand Pré and read the 300 names on the stone in the
					 church in Grand Pré which is in Wolfville, Nova Scotia. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one of the most beautiful sites in all of Canada.
					 It is a place of remembrance. It is a sort of Holy Grail for all Acadians to
					 visit when they come to Nova Scotia. They come from around the world to Grand
					 Pré to worship and pray for those people who were expelled in 1755. It is a sin
					 that these people would play politics on a motion of this regard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All we are asking is that the House of Commons send a
					 message to the Queen through parliament to request an apology. It does not say
					 when. Nor does it have to be tomorrow. We are only asking that it be given
					 careful consideration. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen is making a visit to Canada in 2002. The
					 Acadian festival is happening in Nova Scotia in 2004 and there is another
					 festival in 2005. The Queen has a lot of time in which to decide. We owe it to
					 the crown to allow it time to mull this over and give it careful consideration.
					 We should not play politics with the motion. It is a sin that we get caught up
					 in this. It is no wonder that many minorities in the country, including
					 Acadians, give up on parliament so easily. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Acadian association supports the motion. It is
					 really misleading for the minister responsible for official languages, for whom
					 I have great respect, to say there is no support coming from the Acadian group.
					 It is simply not true, as every association supports the motion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that Acadians are asking for is the correction of
					 an historic wrong. The Pope apologized to the Jewish nation for the expulsion
					 of Jews during the war. Canadian churches apologized for the residential
					 schools. Mr. Mulroney, a former prime minister, stood in the House and
					 apologized for Japanese internments during the war. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an era of compassion and forgiveness we should be
					 able to apologize on behalf of the Queen, when she comes to Canada or through
					 other means that she may decide, for the expulsion of Acadians in 1755.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For anyone to assume that the king at the time was
					 unaware of the actions in the colonies is simply nonsense. That kind of talk
					 originates from the south end of a northbound cow. It is simply unacceptable.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say how proud we all were in Nova Scotia when
					 the Governor General of Canada, Roméo LeBlanc, a very proud and distinguished
					 gentleman, became the first Acadian to reach the highest post in our land. I am
					 also very proud to see his son sitting in parliament today. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Democratic Party also had a first. In 1997 the
					 first two Acadians ever elected to the House of Commons under the New
					 Democratic banner were the hon. member for Acadie--Bathurst, our party whip,
					 and a previous member who jumped ship, Angela Vautour. They were two Acadians
					 who were very proud to run in New Brunswick under the Acadian banner.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very proud to have had them in our caucus. We
					 are very proud of our whip for the job that he does. He brings the passion and
					 the caring of the Acadian community to our caucus and to the House of Commons
					 on a daily basis. It is a voice that I am sure the House of Commons will hear
					 for many years to come.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also remarkable that the Minister of State for
					 the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, who is from West Nova, does not
					 support the motion. When one goes through West Nova one can see the pride and
					 the outstanding ability of the Acadian people. Their flag, language and culture
					 are everywhere.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two communities I represent, West Chezzetcook
					 and Grand Desert, the people are very proud to be Acadian and very proud to be
					 part of Nova Scotia and part of the greater country of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is remarkable that the minister for ACOA would not
					 want to support this motion when ACOA just gave $4 million to the Grand Pré
					 site. The government gave $4 million in tax dollars in order to build up the
					 site, to make it better, to improve the historical aspect of Grand Pré. On the
					 one hand he gives the money to support them and on the other hand, in a
					 hypocritical sense, he turns around and will not support the motion. It is
					 absolutely incredible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what I recommend to everyone in the House. If
					 members really want a taste and a feel of what Acadian culture is all about
					 they should visit Grand Pré, Nova Scotia. They will not be disappointed. Then
					 members can take a trip to the Acadian villages throughout all of Nova Scotia,
					 New Brunswick, parts of P.E.I. and to everywhere else Acadians reside.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to the Acadians from 1755 to 1763 was a
					 sin. Thousands of people were ejected from their land. These were hard working
					 people who wanted nothing to do with war. All they wanted to do was farm their
					 land, look after their children and live in peace. They were not allowed to
					 because they refused to swear an oath to the king. Because of that they were
					 told either they were with us or against us. At that time they were kicked
					 out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members can imagine that happening. All those families
					 suffered greatly from it. Families were separated. I know of one family, that
					 of Joe Jacquard of Wedgeport, Nova Scotia. He told me the story of his
					 great-great-grandfather hiding in the woods at that time to get away from the
					 English.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Acadians there have the oral histories of
					 what happened to their families. The names of those original families are in
					 the church in Grand Pré. I recommend that everyone have a look at it,
					 especially the member for Lanark--Carleton. His was a disgraceful display. I
					 respect the man having his opinion in the House of Commons, but to try to
					 rewrite history and say that we do not have any responsibility in today's
					 society for something that happened is simply nonsense. I stand in the House
					 and I refute the hon. member's speech because it is simply wrong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many things have happened because of this event. My
					 wife is from Longueuil, Quebec and my daughter is in full French immersion, and
					 what the Acadian people have brought to my family is absolutely fabulous. I
					 know I am not very good at the English language, let alone the French language,
					 but I cannot thank the Acadian population of my province enough for what they
					 have done, not only for our communities but for our way of life and the
					 diversity of our culture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately we have been talking about the diversity of
					 cultures in Canada with our Arab and Muslim people. We should not forget that
					 the Acadians themselves gave us a diversity of culture that was fabulous, that
					 was fantastic. We are indebted to those people. Every single one of them
					 through their associations is asking for this motion to be passed. I again
					 encourage the House to carefully reflect upon the motion, damn well keep
					 politics out of it and just reflect on what we should do to make an historic
					 wrong right. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Acadians are asking for is the ability to have
					 an apology from the Queen and to allow the Queen to do it herself. Allow the
					 House to be mature enough to have the debate, move it in a positive sense and
					 allow Her Majesty to make that decision. We should not do it, and there should
					 be no sleazy politics about it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I cannot thank you enough for the
					 opportunity to speak to this today on behalf of all the Acadians of West
					 Chezzetcook and Grand Desert and anywhere in my riding, and especially on
					 behalf of my colleague, the MLA Kevin Deveaux, himself an Acadian and an
					 elected official to the assembly in the Province House in Nova Scotia, and many
					 others. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stand in the House to support Motion No. 241 and
					 also to support our great colleague from Acadie--Bathurst. I cannot say his
					 name, but he is our whip as well.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure I rise this
					 evening to speak to the motion of our colleague, the member for
					 Verchères--Les-Patriotes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion No. 241 got people talking and it still has
					 people talking. Some groups and some members are not comfortable with the idea
					 of this motion and they are both right and wrong, depending on the perspective.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition has a tradition of free votes in the case
					 of private members' bills. Right now it is interesting to hear what members of
					 the Bloc, of the New Democratic Party and of all other parties have to
					 say.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important point is the fact that things were
					 properly done; frankly, that increases the credibility of the whole process.
					 The Société nationale des Acadiens asked that the historical context be taken
					 into consideration and in my opinion that was well done. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will remember that in the beginning we were afraid
					 of the nasty separatists. Even in the coalition, which did not exist then, we
					 thought these people were nasty separatists and therefore they certainly had a
					 hidden agenda. Maybe the member for Verchères--Les-Patriotes does have a hidden
					 agenda. It could be, but that is his problem. Nevertheless we must take the
					 motion as it is and raise our hats to the Bloc member who went to Acadia to
					 meet the people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had doubts about the motion's intellectual
					 honesty, not the member's intellectual honesty, but the motion's intellectual
					 honesty, I think the Acadian people have done remarkable work. This relieves me
					 of a certain weight of justification.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must examine the motion as it stands. We can twist
					 our history a little bit to determine who was responsible. It could be that
					 responsible government as we know it today did not exist then, but I will
					 remind the member of the Canadian Alliance who has just spoken that the
					 empire's responsibility was everywhere. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one says that we are not attacking anyone, the
					 motion is not attacking anyone. We are not asking the Queen, the crown. Here
					 again, it was done properly. We are not talking about an individual. We are
					 talking about an historical event and the consequences of the deportation of
					 the Acadians. The consequences did not last only a few years. They are still
					 felt today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us imagine 10,000, 12,000 or 14,000 Acadians, men,
					 women and children, living in a territory that is now part of Canada. Things
					 have changed over the last 10 or 15 years, but we know what francophones could
					 do as to the number of children in a family. At that time, families had a lot
					 of children. That would have changed everything and there would have been more
					 francophones in the Atlantic provinces. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me say that the Acadian people
					 have met incredible challenges; all they were a minority that faced the
					 deportation and experienced serious problems afterwards, both with the British
					 crown and the Canadian government, and had to struggle for decades. Hats off to
					 them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have learned a lot. I even read a bit about the
					 history of the deportation to get to know the context a little better. For my
					 part, I will support the motion. I will ask for an admission and I will say “I
					 am sorry, this does not mean that you are a bad person today”. We can
					 acknowledge historic events. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is particularly important to amend this motion
					 because some see it as being negative with regard to the monarchy. It is not
					 that at all. This could be done in the context of celebrations, for example
					 during the third congrès mondial acadien, or the 250th anniversary or the 400th
					 anniversary of the arrival of Acadians in America. We could do that. It could
					 be positive. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor general could, as part of the
					 celebrations, read a nice speech and say “We recognize our faults. Having said
					 that, we will work together and we will see to it that the Acadian people keep
					 on developing and prospering in this country”. That is all. The motion involves
					 no money. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I praise the work done by the member
					 for Verchères--Les-Patriotes. More than that, I would say that he is open to
					 changes, or rather to improvements. However, those across the way are slamming
					 the door shut. </p>


	<A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1810)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say to my colleagues opposite “Do not
					 send the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to Acadia too often, because it
					 is the whole federal government that will lose its credibility”. Because the
					 motion comes from a Bloc member, it is not good? Because a motion comes from an
					 Alliance member, a NDP member or a coalition member, it is not good? We must
					 take the time, we are adults, to look at what the motion is all
					 about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, it is not because one is a nasty separatist
					 that people should denigrate everything one does. On the contrary. I believe
					 that in the last decade we have learned a lot about respect for parliamentary
					 traditions thanks to members of the Bloc Quebecois and other parties,
					 especially the Bloc. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crown has apologized on several occasions. A number
					 of people mentioned the Boer War in South Africa and the Maori in New Zealand.
					 These situations did not result in a collective uprising. It is an apology. One
					 recognizes an historical fact and says “I apologize”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognizing this historical fact, one moves toward a
					 much more positive action. No one is being asked to kneel down and apologize
					 for what was done. It is simply an historical fact and life goes on. We know
					 there was even a request not long after the deportation of the Acadians, in
					 1763, made to the crown. With everything that had just happened, this was fresh
					 in their memory. Members will understand that the timing was perhaps not very
					 good, but there were still some efforts made. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1988, some efforts were also made from the other
					 side of the border, by an American. This even went all the way to the office of
					 the then prime minister, Mrs. Thatcher, but nothing came of it. But considering
					 what is coming, this could be done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not at all uncomfortable with this. Supporting
					 this motion does not make me an anti-monarchist, nor am I pointing a finger at
					 anyone. I would especially like the government members who are Acadian to give
					 this matter some thought.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us recall that there were two ridings that were
					 Conservative ridings and will certainly become Conservative ridings again after
					 the next election, namely 
					 Tobique--Mactaquac and 
					 West Nova. I am quite
					 disappointed that the two Acadian members representing these ridings do not
					 support the motion. We know that in September 2000, prior to the last election
					 campaign, 
					 West Nova MP Mark Muise
					 was in favour of the motion. I am sure that Gilles Bernier, the former member
					 for 
					 Tobique--Mactaquac,
					 would also have supported the motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must stand up and be counted. This is not an attack
					 against any group or person or against the crown, but quite simply an
					 acknowledgment. Even my former colleague, Angela Vautour, would have supported
					 this motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking the members opposite to keep an open mind.
					 The party line is one thing, but for Acadian members, what they feel in their
					 hearts may be more important at this stage. The reason Acadians managed to
					 survive and prosper in the face of all difficulties is that they had their
					 hearts in the right place. I hope our Acadian colleagues in this House will be
					 guided by the same sentiments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not trying to rewrite history, obviously. This
					 is not about pointing a finger, nor is it about asking for money in reparation.
					 This is not at all the case. Governments since 1867 have also made mistakes and
					 it is well for apologies to be forthcoming. There have been a great many wrongs
					 since 1867 toward the Ffrst nations of Canada. These need to be acknowledged
					 and apologies made. The Acadian people experienced something was absolutely
					 horrible and managed to survive despite everything. Recognizing this fact by
					 supporting this motion is a positive step.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would once again like to congratulate the member for 
					 Verchères--Les-Patriotes
					 on the tremendous work he has done. Clearly he has a reputation such that
					 people are wary of everything he does. In this case, he has recognized an
					 historic event suffered by a people and he come up with a positive gesture for
					 the future.</p>

					 Breton, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank you for this
					 opportunity to respond to the member for 
					 Verchères--Les-Patriotes
					 and to his motion asking the Governor General to intercede with Her Majesty,
					 the Queen of England, to present an official apology to the Acadian people for
					 wrongs done in its name between 1755 and 1763. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's history, like that of all countries, has
					 skeletons in its closet of which we are not proud. These are events that took
					 place sometimes hundreds of years ago, such as in the case of the Acadian
					 deportation. History can sometimes be cruel, however, Canada's history does not
					 include only injustices. It is a history which for the most part is one of
					 progress and growth. Today we must look to the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's Acadian community is not one but many
					 communities spread throughout the Atlantic provinces. In New Brunswick,
					 Acadians are concentrated in the southeast, the northeast and the northwest,
					 with groups in Fredericton and Saint John.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Nova Scotia there are dynamic communities in
					 Baie-Sainte-Marie on the southwestern coast and in my own constituency of 
					 Bras d'Or--Cape Breton.
					 Both Île-Madame and the Chéticamp region are beautiful communities, proud and
					 progressive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Prince Edward Island Acadians are in the region of
					 Évangéline. In Newfoundland they are found near Cape St. Georges and in
					 Saint-Jean and in Labrador City. They are also situated at Îles-de-la-Madeleine
					 in the Gaspé, in the Montreal region and in western Canada. All these
					 communities, no matter how big or small, are testament to the vitality of
					 Canada's people and our two official languages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes extraordinary courage and strength to develop
					 a community which lives in a minority situation. The members of the Acadian
					 communities have founded schools, colleges and universities. They have
					 established theatres, newspapers and publishing houses. They have made
					 outstanding strides in culture, theatre, cinema, visual arts and music as well
					 as in literature. They have blessed the world with writers, poets, artists,
					 dancers, musicians and singers. They have established an impressive network of
					 businesses and created jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acadians of Canada are part of what makes Canada
					 able to be successful and prosper. The Government of Canada recognizes this
					 dynamic and vital contribution to Canadian society. They count among the seven
					 million people in Canada who speak, sing, write, work and live in French. These
					 francophones are proof of the vitality and extraordinary determination to grow
					 and expand on a continent with an anglophone majority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The English and French languages and the people who
					 speak them have shaped Canada and helped define its identity. Canada's
					 linguistic duality has its origins in the very nature of our country. It is
					 hard to look at Canada today without seeing the importance of these two
					 languages and their communities within Canadian society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official languages support programs of the
					 Department of Canadian Heritage are designed to provide opportunities for
					 Canadians to fully appreciate and profit from our rich linguistic heritage. The
					 Government of Canada believes that the great majority of Canadians share these
					 goals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few would doubt the importance of education to any
					 community. Through the support for minority language education, the Department
					 of Canadian Heritage works toward the full participation of both language
					 groups in all aspects of Canadian life.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These programs not only further the vital cultural
					 contribution of the English and French speaking minority communities, but also
					 promote access to the economic mainstream. For instance, progress in the area
					 of French language minority education has had a prominent role in lowering
					 illiteracy and school dropout rates and increasing post-secondary
					 attendance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty years ago the quality and availability of French
					 language minority education was not only a national disgrace but also a
					 significant barrier to the development and survival of francophone communities
					 throughout Canada. We set out to change this. In the process, schools were
					 built where none had existed. Community centres were built where none had
					 existed. Colleges were built where none had existed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have worked with the provinces and with francophone
					 and Acadian parents from one end of the country to the other. The economic
					 value of quality public education in their language for the 1.6 million
					 Canadians who are part of official language minority communities cannot be
					 underestimated.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Canadians have a stake in minority language
					 education programs. In their absence, as the bilingualism and bicultural
					 commission pointed out, these Canadians would not be able to make their
					 potential contribution to society. The Department of Canadian Heritage, in
					 particular the official languages support programs branch, has concluded a
					 series of agreements which greatly benefit the Acadian and francophone
					 populations of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaboration between both levels of government within
					 the framework of the official languages and education program allows more than
					 150,000 young people from official minority language communities to study in
					 their language in 700 elementary and secondary schools in all regions of the
					 country, and 18.5% of these schools are situated in the Atlantic
					 provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official languages and education program
					 contributes to the financing of a network of 19 francophone colleges and
					 universities outside Quebec, many of which are located in the Atlantic
					 provinces and which serve the Acadian population. It is also through these
					 programs that 2.7 million young Canadians are learning a second official
					 language, including more than 318,000 in immersion classes, thus greatly
					 increasing the number of Canadians with an appreciation for the French language
					 and culture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I will not go into details about all the good
					 work that is being done, I would like to outline some of the noteworthy
					 accomplishments which have been achieved in minority education and which have
					 directly benefited the Acadian communities over the past few years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Nova Scotia, major roles in French education are
					 played by Collège de l'Acadie, to which I will speak in more detail, and
					 Université Sainte-Anne, which has been funded for many years by the federal
					 government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Created in 1988, Collège de l'Acadie is now a key
					 institution within the francophone and Acadian communities. Having two in my
					 own constituency, I certainly can speak to the role they play.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The considerable distances that separate the different
					 Acadian regions of the province could have posed problems with respect to the
					 service delivery but, undiscouraged, the Acadians adjusted and established
					 training centres attached to Collège de l'Acadie throughout the territory.
					 There are now seven and there is no doubt that these training centres
					 contribute directly to the economic expansion and development of the Acadian
					 communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The college and its training centres have state of the
					 art technological tools such as video conferencing and teleconferencing,
					 offering superior distance education programs. On the eve of a new focus on
					 knowledge and communications, a French language distance education capacity is
					 certainly a sign of prosperity for francophones and Acadians in
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in Nova Scotia, federal funds have supported the
					 construction and expansion of the Carrefour du Grand Havre school and community
					 centre in Dartmouth. The opening of the Étoile school and community centre in
					 my neighbouring constituency of Sydney--Victoria was equally an occasion to
					 celebrate a victory for the francophone population in the greater Sydney area.
					 Along with offering quality education in French, it is a centre where the
					 Acadian community can gather together as well as a place to promote the Acadian
					 culture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In New Brunswick, the federal government also has
					 widely and consistently supported the development of well established
					 institutions, such as the University of Moncton. It, like any other educational
					 institution, plays an important role as an engine of social, economic and
					 cultural development for the Acadian communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Created in 1963, the University of Moncton is the
					 second largest university in New Brunswick and the biggest French language
					 Canadian university outside of Quebec. It has three campuses: Moncton in the
					 southeast, Edmundston in the northwest, and Shippagan in the northeast. There
					 is no question that the University of Moncton contributes directly to the
					 vitality and dynamism of the francophone and Acadian communities of
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in New Brunswick, federal funds have helped in the
					 construction of three school community centres at Fredericton, Miramichi and
					 Saint John, as well as funding for four community colleges. In Prince Edward
					 Island another community centre has been established. Newfoundland's Acadians
					 can soon be celebrating the signing of an agreement with the federal government
					 for francophone school management. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government also supports the Acadian
					 associations that bring Acadian institutions and organizations
					 together.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These associations work hard for the Acadian cause and
					 have over the years brought about many positive changes. There is no doubt the
					 Acadian deportation is an event that ranks among the great tragedies of history
					 in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fact and the effects of it should never be
					 forgotten or diminished in our memories. Historic and commemorative venues,
					 such as Grand Pré, have been established so that Canadians will always remember
					 this part of our history.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, now, at the beginning of October, I have
					 just lost another illusion of mine, but not to worry, I will keep on
					 smiling.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to take part today in the passionate
					 debate on Motion No. 241 tabled by my hon. colleague, the member for
					 Verchères—Les-Patriotes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am even more pleased to speak to this issue because a
					 lot of people have taken the time to express their views on this motion, which
					 has become very significant because of the importance it has for many of our
					 citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two points I want to make here. Because of
					 the great number of comments that have been made, I cannot guess as to the
					 political stripe of all the people who made them. But given the law of
					 averages, I would find it very surprising and even unthinkable that all these
					 people share my political opinions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, each and every one of them supported this
					 motion unconditionally, as if it were the most natural thing to do in the
					 world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people watching this may ask why I am making these
					 two points. It seems that this issue has become the focus of the debate on the
					 motion, although it should not even be addressed during our
					 discussions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, there was an unfortunate misunderstanding
					 during the weeks following the tabling of this motion. Some people have
					 suggested that my hon. colleague from Verchères—Les-Patriotes was playing petty
					 politics by putting forward Motion No. 241, while others showed more respect
					 and simply stated that they would wait to find out the position of the Acadian
					 community on this issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that this misunderstanding is behind us, the
					 situation has cleared up. The hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes has
					 publicly demonstrated that there was absolutely no partisanship behind his
					 tabling of Motion No. 241. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the consultation process in which Acadians
					 took part ended yesterday with the tabling of the report of the advisory
					 committee set up by the Société nationale des Acadiens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I understand that this issue will unfold
					 in the next hour of debate. You can count on my being here. </p>

					 Rock—Langley, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, since I first stood in the House two weeks
					 ago today to ask the Minister of Transport about the problems facing Canada's
					 airlines, a number of things have happened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answering my question, the minister said that
					 neither the Bush administration nor the American congress had decided on any
					 measure to help the U.S. airline industry. Yet two days later both the U.S.
					 house of representatives and the senate passed identical legislation to assist
					 the American airline industry. The president signed the legislation into law
					 the following day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrast that with the response of the government which
					 only yesterday announced its compensation package to Canada's airlines for the
					 direct losses they incurred as a result of the closure of Canada's airspace. It
					 took the government an additional week and a half to address the obvious, which
					 is that Canada should compensate the airlines for these losses. That was a
					 no-brainer. Canadians support that. There was overwhelming support from every
					 party in the House for that concept.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the American legislation went further than
					 direct compensation. It was also designed to offset the loss of passenger
					 revenue between September 11 and December 21, 2001. Whether one agrees with
					 that kind of an action or not, the result is that American air carriers flying
					 transborder routes in direct competition with Canadian airlines will be
					 subsidized while the Canadian air carriers that compete with American air
					 carriers will not. What does the government do about that discrepancy?
					 Nothing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to security, the Americans have again acted
					 quickly. The U.S. government has taken control of airport security. It has
					 reintroduced the use of air marshals and has developed tough new policies. What
					 has the Government of Canada done? It told Canadian pilots to lock the cockpit
					 door and keep it closed. That is just one more example of the government
					 reacting with too little too late.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree that we cannot always compare ourselves
					 to the Americans, in this instance we cannot afford not to reach a certain
					 level of security or to be any less diligent in providing security for Canadian
					 travellers or any travellers on Canadian airlines. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does the government do now? I will agree that
					 there are no easy fixes. It will not be easy for the government to resolve the
					 issues that are before the airline industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one thing, not all the airlines in Canada are in
					 the same shape. It is well documented. When the market closed today, Air
					 Canada's shares were listed at $2.48, down from a 12 month high of $17.50 last
					 November and a pre-September 11 value of $6. WestJet's shares, on the other
					 hand, at today's close, were at $19, down from its 12 month high but up from
					 its pre-September 11 value of $17. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear that not all Canadian airlines are in
					 the same shape. The only way the government can help Air Canada to resolve its
					 problems is to eliminate the 15% limit on domestic ownership of Air Canada's
					 shares. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the government prepared to eliminate the 15%
					 ownership restriction and allow the private sector to save Air
					 Canada?</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Transport, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and congratulate her
					 on her interest in a matter of extreme importance and timeliness. Transport
					 Canada acknowledges that the implementation of enhanced security measures is
					 putting enormous pressure on airports and air carriers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shutting down of airports for a number of days
					 obviously led to marked decreases in revenue. I would, however, point out that
					 the government's contribution of $160 million is connected to the closing down
					 of air space for a number of days, which obviously had significant impact on
					 the carriers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an arrangement that compensates airlines for
					 the Government of Canada's decision to close down Canadian air space. It
					 provides airlines and operators of specialized air services with the funds they
					 have been so anxiously awaiting, which will enable them to recover from the
					 abrupt interruption of their activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An examination of the financial data was carried out
					 with executives directly involved in this sector. The Air Transport Association
					 was also involved in assessing the costs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who will be directly concerned and will benefit
					 from that allocation of funds are obviously air carriers and service
					 operators.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this compensation package, Transport Canada and
					 the federal government continue to monitor the situation very closely. Our main
					 concern is of course the security and safety of the travelling
					 public.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, this is an important opportunity during
					 what we commonly call the late show to discuss harbour bottoms. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has not only made a conscious decision
					 through Transport Canada and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to divest
					 itself of wharves and wharf infrastructure, but now it has gone a step further
					 and fully intends to divest itself of the very bottoms of the harbours. That is
					 extremely problematic for the South Shore of Nova Scotia, which is a very
					 important player in the fishing industry. A number of wharves have been
					 divested already. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member: </b>Digby was divested.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gerald Keddy: </b>My colleague mentioned Digby
					 wharf.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a real concern on behalf of the mayors, the
					 MLAs in the provincial legislature and the provincial government that the
					 federal government is divesting itself of harbour bottoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raised a question in the House regarding the actual
					 selling of the harbour bottoms because that is exactly what is going to happen.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In several of these harbours, in particular the harbour
					 of Bridgewater, which goes several kilometres up the LaHave River, and the
					 harbour of Shelbourne, which is several kilometres long, if the government
					 actually sold the bottoms of those harbours to a private individual, then what
					 would happen to them? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would be responsible for any environmental
					 assessment or environmental cleanup? Would that person own all the rights to
					 the harbour? Could we set lobster gear on the bottom of the harbour? Could we
					 set nets on the harbour? Would the person put the navigational aids in that
					 harbour? Would he or she be responsible for the moorings not only for the
					 commercial fishery but for the recreational boaters? Would he or she be
					 responsible for harbours in front of the yacht clubs and sheltered coves where
					 recreational boaters would be?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 8, as a supplementary to my question, my
					 colleague from St. John's West asked the Minister of the Environment whether or
					 not this was perhaps some attempt to avoid the responsibility for environmental
					 cleanup in ports such as Liverpool or Lunenburg which have been shipbuilding
					 centres for hundreds of years. There are perhaps things in the mud that are
					 secure there, lead and other toxic chemicals or substances, that would be the
					 responsibility of the federal government. As long as that bottom is not
					 disturbed, that bottom is perfectly safe. If that bottom were disturbed, would
					 there be a problem?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are way too many unanswered questions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that the mayors of the towns on the
					 South Shore, the wardens of the municipalities, the municipal councillors, the
					 MLAs and the provincial government are all against the federal government
					 divesting itself of the harbour bottoms. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is inconceivable that the federal government would
					 want to sell the harbour bottoms. It should maintain authority over them. If an
					 individual wants to build a wharf or wants to put moorings in for recreational
					 boating or for a commercial fishery venture, then he or she could go to the
					 federal government and get the appropriate permits. However, the federal
					 government absolutely must maintain control and ownership of what is under the
					 salt water.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to point out that in 1995 the
					 government put in place the national marine policy, which has allowed for the
					 commercialization of the operations of the St. Lawrence Seaway, the creation of
					 19 Canada port authorities and the divestiture of many public harbours under
					 which came the divestiture of the harbour bottoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The divestiture of harbour bottoms is part of the
					 national marine policy. Transport Canada owns 43 of them. Obviously they were
					 first offered to federal departments and then to the various provinces.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Nova Scotia, negotiations started up with top
					 officials. Transport Canada manages 15 harbour bottoms in Nova Scotia.
					 Discussions are going on and these are things that must not be done hastily.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously there are also benefits related to harbour
					 dues, since in Nova Scotia alone there might be potential savings of
					 $900,000.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a harbour bottom is divested, it is important to
					 remember that the federal government will continue to enforce federal laws,
					 including the Canada Shipping Act and the Navigable Waters Protection
					 Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, and I want to reassure my hon. colleague,
					 absolutely no final decision has been made with regard to the divestiture of
					 Transport Canada harbour bottoms.</p>

<td><small>Is the minister going to give serious
						  consideration to the recommendations contained in this report, and will she
						  commit to making significant changes to the employment insurance program, to at
						  last correct the errors of the past?</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am talking about the errors of the past because they
					 hurt people. It is beyond me that we have an employment insurance plan
					 subsidized by workers when the government has accumulated a $40 billion surplus
					 in the EI fund. Workers and newcomers on the labour market are discriminated
					 against because they have to work 910 hours before qualifying for
					 benefits.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, with all the layoffs we hear about across the
					 country, people who work in seasonal industries will not be able to qualify for
					 EI. It is most unfortunate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of Canadian workers, I sincerely hope that
					 the federal Minister of Human Resources Development will carefully examine the
					 report tabled in parliament by hon. members from all parties, Liberals, members
					 from the Alliance, the Bloc and the New Democratic Party, as well as
					 Conservatives. They unanimously asked the minister to bring in amendments that
					 would be effective immediately, amendments that are needed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example it is recommended to go from 910 hours
					 worked to 700 hours. I do not necessarily agree with this recommendation but
					 this is what is recommended, and I am satisfied with that. It makes more sense
					 because more people would qualify.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister already recognized that even 700 hours was
					 too long for parental leave; she reduced that to 600 hours.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regions like ours, and our region is not the only
					 one, the situation is the same all over the country, there are seasonal jobs.
					 It is not because of the workers. The situation is controlled by employers and
					 local economy. These people can no longer qualify for EI. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can say that 85% of those who should qualify for
					 employment insurance do so. However, that is not the problem here. The problem
					 is that nobody has access to the employment insurance program any more. We are
					 not talking about people who are no longer eligible; we are not talking about
					 people who worked for eight, ten or even fifteen or twenty weeks, for example
					 in the tourism industry. We are not talking about these people who no longer
					 qualify for EI. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the number of layoffs announced, it is high time
					 the minister proposed a plan to change the employment insurance program for the
					 good of all workers in our country. I am sure they would be pleased and they
					 would greatly appreciate such a gesture on the part of the minister, if ever
					 she or the federal government decided to make those changes. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why, over the last few years, we made changes

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most recently under Bill C-2, the bill on employment

					 time or those who receive special benefits.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Bill C-2 parents coming back to work after taking

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year we assess the impact of the plan on Canadians

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary is the one who answered,
					 and I see that he has been asked to answer again today. I will let him give his
					 answer, but what he was saying was that the Minister of Industry had met with
					 the officials but agreed with the decision made by Investissement Québec to
					 reject Davie's request. He therefore said that he agreed and answered that the
					 federal government would not do anything. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that shipbuilding, under the
					 constitution as it stands, is first and foremost a federal responsibility.
					 People from Davie Industries approached Investissement Québec because they were
					 fed up with nothing happening on the federal side. Yet, the Minister of
					 Industry did present a plan of action in June, the week after the House
					 rose.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Week in and week out, day in and day out, we are told
					 that soon there will be announcements of funding. Meanwhile, not only in Lévis
					 but elsewhere in Canada shipyards are closing. We are losing a whole
					 infrastructure that was important to us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I hope the government and the parliamentary
					 secretary, who has former shipyard workers living in his riding and who long
					 chaired his regional caucus and is aware of the situation, given that the
					 matter is up for discussion at Treasury Board and in cabinet in the coming
					 weeks, will seize the opportunity I am offering them today to announce that the
					 government will do something to help Davie Industries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I warn him that I will not be very happy if he says, as
					 usual, that they can do nothing for shipbuilding.</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Industry, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for giving me this
					 opportunity to talk about government assistance to Davie Industries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government sympathizes with the workers and the
					 management of Davie Industries, whose future is uncertain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous factors are at the root of the difficulties of
					 that industry, including a lack of investment and innovation, and also foreign
					 trade practices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in light of these difficulties that the
					 government took some measures to implement a new shipbuilding policy. In
					 October 2000, the Minister of Industry established a new partnership project on
					 shipbuilding. The project was co-chaired by officials representing the owners
					 and the union. The partnership held broad consultations across Canada and it
					 submitted its report to the minister in March. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to this report, the minister adopted a new
					 policy framework with over 20 realistic and affordable measures, including: a
					 new competitive financing mechanism for foreign and domestic buyers of Canadian
					 built vessels; improved export financing through the Export Development
					 Corporation; increased benefits for the Canadian industry from the development
					 of offshore oil and natural gas; access by the shipbuilding and industrial
					 marine industries to Technology Partnerships Canada for the development of
					 innovating technologies; and the creation of a new energy and marine branch at
					 Industry Canada for the effective implementation of the department's policy
					 framework.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We worked very hard to develop a shipbuilding and
					 marine industries policy that is competitive and efficient. We will help the
					 industry, including Davie Industries, to take advantage of all the
					 opportunities that it is entitled to under the new policy.</p>
