	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères) </B>moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should officially 
recognize the historical contribution of the Patriotes of Lower Canada and the 
Reformers of Upper Canada to the establishment of a system of responsible 
democratic government in Canada and in Quebec, as did the government of 
Quebec in 1982, by proclaiming by order a National Patriots' Day.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, in the Canadian history course I 
took when I was in my fourth year at high school, we had to write 
a paper on the theme, ``Louis-Joseph Papineau: Traitor or 
Hero''? This provocative theme eloquently illustrated the 
equivocal perception and the historical ambiguity that 
surrounded, and still surround, Louis-Joseph Papineau and the 
thousands of men and women who answered to the name of 
``Patriote'' and ``Reformer''.
<P>
	The dramatic events known as the Rebellion of 1837-38 have 
often been depicted in textbooks and tourist pamphlets as the 
feat of a band of criminals-what today we would call 
terrorists-who challenged the established order.
<P>
	The aim of the motion I have just respectfully submitted for 
the consideration of this House today is to rectify this perception 
and to achieve, at long last, recognition of the historic 
contribution of the Patriotes of Lower Canada and the 
Reformers of Upper Canada to the establishment of truly 
responsible and truly democratic government in Canada and in 
Quebec.
<P>
	It is important to make clear that the motion does not request a 
pardon for the Patriotes: they were pardoned by Queen Victoria 
in 1849. I think it is high time the federal government 
recognized that the Rebellion was part of a historic current of 
social and political unrest that affected not just the colonies but 
their motherlands, starting in the 18th century and stretching 
into the first half of the 19th.
<P>
	The rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada were not the work 
of a restricted segment of the population. Merchants, 
manufacturers, professionals, farmers, colonists, all shared the 
goal of freeing themselves economically and politically from 
Great Britain's colonial grip.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	The Patriotes in Lower Canada and the Reformers in Upper 
Canada were fighting essentially for civil and political rights, 
for the establishment of truly democratic and responsible 
institutions, and for a certain degree of national emancipation. 
How can it be that the role of the Patriotes has been denigrated 
for so long? Everyone knows that our perception of history 
evolves according to the values and ideologies prevalent in a 
particular society, and according to ambient social and political 
interaction. The best example of this phenomenon is certainly 
the French Revolution, whose main protagonists came to be 
viewed over time as visionaries, then as pariahs, and finally as 
heroes. The Revolution has been described as the best thing that 
ever happened to France and even to mankind and as a bloody 
period in history that should have been avoided.
<P>
	I contend that the time has come for the federal government to 
make up for lost time and recognize the undeniable contribution 
to history made by the Patriotes and the Reformers. Previous 
Canadian governments should be ashamed and embarrassed that 
the Bloc Quebecois had to be elected before this issue was raised 
in this House.
<P>
	Some citizens' groups, primarily from Quebec and Ontario, 
have been working hard for a number of years to ensure that the 
Patriotes in Lower Canada and the Reformers in Upper Canada 
receive their due recognition and find their place in Canada's 
history. The ultimately violent nature of this political movement 
must never obscure the inestimable importance of the 
democratic institutions and representatives that were 
bequeathed to us.
<P>
	What we must in fact remember are the basic ideas for which 
the Patriotes fought. Basically, these people were fighting for 
three goals. The first was the recognition of the people of Lower 
and Upper Canada as nations capable of taking control of their 
own future. Even then, the Patriotes showed their 
openmindedness and that sense of nationalism that did not rest 
on ethnicity but rather on their strong sense of belonging to the 
area. I submit as evidence the wording of a Patriote resolution  
adopted in Saint-Marc on May 15, 1837 and which reads as 
follows: ``-(the delegates) adhere and will adhere under this 
agreement 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5546"> 5546 </A></B>
<P>
to the following principles: equality of citizens, regardless of 
origin, language or religion''.
<P>
	The second goal was the establishment of truly democratic 
institutions. Specifically, they demanded the establishment of 
the principle of ministerial responsibility or, in other terms, the 
creation of an executive formed primarily of representatives in 
the House of Assembly and responsible to it-that is, 
accountable to the people rather than to the British crown. At the 
meeting mentioned earlier, one of the resolutions passed 
required delegates to adhere to the principles of an elected 
legislative council, an executive responsible to the people, and 
finally legislative control over all public moneys from any 
source.
<P>
	The third goal concerned, to a large extent, the civil, political 
and economic liberties that many peoples of the world were 
beginning to adopt.
<P>
	In addition to being clearly set out in the hundreds of 
resolutions passed by the various Patriote assemblies, these 
three main goals were also mentioned in assembly proceedings, 
statements, newspaper articles, speeches in public and in the 
House, petitions to the British Crown and throughout the 
literature of the movement published at the time. For many long 
years before they took up arms, the Patriotes peacefully 
defended their civil rights. The pen and the word were the 
Patriotes' main weapons, before they turned to pitchforks and 
shotguns. When they saw that their speeches in parliament, their 
demonstrations in the streets and the articles they published in 
newspapers were powerless to reorient the governor's autocratic 
and arbitrary power and that he preferred to further limit their 
rights, some Patriotes finally decided that they had no choice but 
to take up arms against Britain's authority.
<P>
	Some people might wonder whether it is relevant to debate 
and vote on such a motion today in this House. In answer to their 
protests, I say that citizens who are interested in history and 
justice, descendants and friends of Patriotes and Reformers, 
have been striving for many years to ensure that parliaments 
recognize, finally and officially, the very source of their 
existence.
<P>
	Besides these aspirations that have been held by certain 
segments of the population, historical arguments can also be 
raised to justify passing the motion before the House today.
<P>
	The Patriotes and the Reformers, before some of them 
decided that peaceful means would not be adequate to the task, 
were what we would call today model citizens who were 
involved in community life; they worked toward establishing a 
government that was responsible for its acts, and promoted 
self-determination and representative elections.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	But our interpretation of history is often quite unreliable; our 
collective memory seems to retain only what suits it. It must be 
remembered that some persons who are now described as 
Canadian heroes were closely linked to the patriot movement. 
We have only to think of George-Étienne Cartier, a lawyer but 
also an active politician and later a father of the Canadian 
Confederation and Prime Minister from 1857 to 1858. We can 
also think of Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, an ardent supporter 
of the Patriote cause, imprisoned without having taken part in 
the violence and later Premier from 1848 to 1851.
<P>
	We can also think of Louis-Joseph Papineau, an MP for 25 
years, a politician and above all a free speaker, admired by his 
peers and by the public; or of William Lyon Mackenzie, an MP 
from Upper Canada, expelled from the Upper Canada Assembly 
for libel and then re-elected five times, who chose arms as a last 
resort. Finally, we can think of Robert Baldwin, who shared the 
democratic ideals that Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine believed in, 
so much so that these two men became the leaders of the reform 
parties in Upper and Lower Canada respectively.
<P>
	Paying tribute to these persons who ensured that we may live 
in this democratic system of which we are so proud means, 
among other things, not denying a part of their lives or the 
strength of their convictions just because it suits us to do so. The 
motion tabled today is part of a lengthy historic evolution. In 
fact, it is one more step toward the recognition of the historic 
contribution of the Patriotes, which has been laborious and full 
of unexpected twists.
<P>
	In February 1849, the Amnesty Act signed by Queen Victoria 
granted royal pardon to those involved in the skirmishes of 1837 
and 1838. That Act paved the way for reparation for losses borne 
by the people of Lower Canada during looting by British troops. 
We note that a similar act had been proclaimed in Upper Canada 
four years earlier, in 1845. This royal pardon made waves in 
loyalist circles, resulting in the fire in the Parliament buildings 
at Montreal in April 1849.
<P>
	A number of years were to pass before a monument to the 
glory of the Patriotes was unveiled in 1926 by Lieutenant 
Governor Narcisse Pérodeau, in front of the former Prison du 
pied-du-courant in Montreal, where 12 Patriotes, including 
Joseph Narcisse Cardinal, MP for La Prairie, had been hanged 
nearly a century earlier.
<P>
	One hundred years after the events, in 1938, the Government 
of Canada seemed disposed to promote the cause of the 
Patriotes. An imposing arch to their memory was built at 
Niagara and unveiled by Prime Minister William Lyon 
Mackenzie King. This arch bore a plaque on which were 
engraved the names of the 32 martyrs of 1837-38, both French 
speaking and English speaking. Unfortunately this arch was 
destroyed in 1967, the year of the centennial of the Canadian 
Confederation, and all  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5547"> 5547 </A></B>
<P>
indications are that the then Ontario government seemed to find 
this weighty souvenir too much of a burden. It was only in 1984 
that the ruins of this arch were displayed to the public.
<P>
	In 1982, the Quebec government decided to move ahead with 
the process of recognizing the historic contribution made by the 
Patriotes. Referring to the ideal of liberty, Premier René 
Lévesque paid tribute to the Patriotes in these terms: ``The 
Patriotes of the 19th century expressed that ideal in their own 
way, with the means they felt they had to use. No one can doubt 
the honesty of their approach, whatever judgment one may pass 
on what has been termed the Rebellion. And we must remember 
that we owe them a debt for having laid the groundwork here for 
the advent of responsible government, genuinely popular 
government''. It is from this perspective that the National 
Assembly voted for the introduction of a Journée nationale des 
Patriotes, which since then has been marked each year on the 
Sunday closest to November 23.
<P>
	In 1987, the bishops of Quebec reacted as well, lifting the 
previous religious sanctions against the Patriotes who had fallen 
in battle during the uprisings of 1837 and 1838. At the same 
time, the bishops recognized that the social and political 
background of the time had influenced the decision that had 
been made by the religious authorities. As a result, religious 
burial of the rebels' remains was finally allowed.
<P>
	At the federal level, unfortunately, there have been stumbling 
blocks in the way of slow progress toward regaining 
respectability for the Patriotes. In 1988, Canada Post, claiming 
to have lost a file, categorically refused to issue a stamp paying 
tribute to the Patriotes. This refusal was all the more surprising 
and incomprehensible since in 1971 Canada Post had issued a 
stamp to the memory of Patriote and reformer Louis-Joseph 
Papineau.
<P>
	I would also regret it if I did not stress one event, one of the 
oddest and most indicative of the ambivalence of successive 
federal governments.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	In 1970, the Right Hon. Pierre Elliot Trudeau, then Prime 
Minister of Canada, took part in the unveiling, in Australia, of a 
monument to the memory of the 58 Patriotes from Lower 
Canada, exiled and imprisoned there for two years and then 
freed conditionally before most of them decided to return home.
<P>
	On this plaque can be read, in both of Canada's official 
languages, the following words: ``-in commemoration of the 
130th anniversary of the Canadian exiles' landing in Australia 
and the sacrifices made by many Canadians and Australians for 
the advent of independent, equal and free countries within the 
Commonwealth''.
<P>
	We also note that a monument in honour of the 92 Reformers 
from Upper Canada, who had been exiled to Tasmania, was also 
unveiled by a Canadian official that same year. It would seem 
that the Australians have a keener sense of history that did the 
governments of Canada of those times. This absence of official 
recognition by successive governments and Parliaments of 
Canada is all the more odd since we find numerous references to 
the Patriotes enshrined in the very walls of the building in which 
Canadian democracy is exercised.
<P>
	Indeed, sculptures of George-Étienne Cartier, 
Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine and Robert Baldwin can be found 
at the entrance to the House. Cartier is also one of the persons in 
the famous painting entitled ``The Fathers of Confederation''. 
What is more, in the northeast corner of the grounds of the 
Parliament Buildings is a statute of Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine 
and Robert Baldwin. We note in passing that coins stuck in 
honour of the Patriotes were legal tender in this country in the 
19th century.
<P>
	While it is very disappointing to see that, until now, 
successive governments of Canada have not deigned to 
recognize the historic role played by the Patriotes and 
Reformers, we can still be glad that they have shown more 
diligence in other cases. One particularly interesting precedent 
reminds us to challenge the implacable verdicts of history. I 
refer, of course, to the resolution of May 29, 1992, passed 
unanimously in this House, recognizing Louis Riel as one of the 
founders of Manitoba and of the Canadian Confederation.
<P>
	From that point on, no one could challenge Riel's contribution 
to the historic development of Canada. Although Riel 
participated in violent uprisings and was hanged in 1885 for 
high treason, the House recognized the value and the historic 
role played by that former MP, who had reached the conclusion 
that change could only come by force of arms. Joe Clark said, 
referring to Riel: ``We must rely on the positive aspects of our 
experience rather than the negative ones''.
<P>
	The historic vacuum or, more precisely, the historic 
ambiguity that has persisted since pardon was extended to the 
Patriotes in 1849 and the Reformers in 1844 must be remedied. 
Until now, federal governments and Parliaments have been 
particularly silent on this issue. The vote that will end the debate 
beginning now on this motion will clarify formally the position 
of Canada's Parliament on this issue. By means of this vote, the 
House will have an opportunity to say whether it prefers 
unctuous endorsement of the decision made over 160 years ago 
or whether it is time, in light of the findings of the Durham 
report, the creation of the Canadian federation, and the 
introduction of responsible government, to take a fresh look at 
this period in our history.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5548"> 5548 </A></B>
<P>
	For me, and for the people of the constituency of Verchères, 
this motion is especially meaningful. Indeed, I have the honour 
of representing the constituency that was, in large part, the 
theatre of the events we are discussing today.
<P>
	According to popular history, first of all, most of the 92 
resolutions adopted by the House in 1834 were written during 
meetings held in the LeNoblet-Duplessis house in Contrecoeur, 
and probably at Mr. Masse's inn in Saint-Denis, now the Maison 
nationale des Patriotes.
<P>
	In 1837, several assemblies to protest the Russells resolutions 
took place in Saint-Charles, Verchères, Saint-Marc, 
Boucherville and Varennes. The famous assembly of the six 
constituencies, in which Papineau participated, took place in 
Saint-Charles on October 23 and 24, 1837, bringing together 
6,000 persons, including 12 MPs and one legislative advisor.
<P>
	On the eve of the wave of arrests decided on by Governor 
Gosford, Papineau and 30 other Patriote leaders decided to take 
refuge in Saint-Denis.
<P>
	That is also the reason the first battles between the Patriotes 
and British troops took place there. On the morning of 
November 23, the British army, 500 strong, was stopped by 250 
Patriotes at Saint-Denis. In the afternoon, 200 more Patriotes 
arrived from the west bank of the Richelieu-from 
Saint-Antoine, Verchères and Contrecoeur-led by none other 
than George-Étienne Cartier, future father of the Canadian 
Confederation. Twelve Patriotes died during the encounter, 
including the member for Vaudreuil, Ovide Perreault. The 
British troops retreated, conceding victory.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Two days later, following a series of mistakes, the Patriotes 
were brutally squashed in Saint-Charles and lost 35 men. The 
village itself was looted and burned down. More than 30 
Patriotes were taken back to Montreal as prisoners.
<P>
	That same year, on December 4, a huge meeting of delegates 
from all constituencies was due to be held in Saint-Charles to 
form an «assembly», such as the one held in Philadelphia in 
1776, to solemnly proclaim Lower Canada's independence. As 
the story goes, on December 2 or 3, the British troops were back 
in the area and plundered and set fire once more to the town of 
Saint-Denis.
<P>
	Each year, Saint-Denis and Saint-Charles host the most 
important event held in honour of the Patriotes. That is also 
where the Quebec government has established a national 
Patriotes museum, in Mr. Masse's old inn. Finally, it is where 
the greatest number of monuments honouring the Patriotes are 
to be found.
<P>
	Route 133 between Sorel and Iberville, along the eastern 
shore of the Richelieu River, has also been known, since 1979, 
as Patriotes Road.
<P>
	But beyond monuments and with historical hindsight, the 
goals of the Patriotes and the Reformers are easier to discern. It 
cannot be concluded from these events that they simply rebelled 
against the Establishment. The Patriote movement was far from 
a spontaneous blaze ignited by a handful of individuals. It was 
indeed the logical outcome of a long process characterized by a 
strong rallying of the people.
<P>
	The Canadian Parliament must look at this period of our 
history with new eyes. It must put into perspective, according to 
our society's present values, the significance of the 1837 and 
1838 events. Thanks to these rebellions, we have inherited a 
system of responsible government and democratic institutions 
and traditions admired the world over.
<P>
	If the national liberation movement started by the Patriotes 
and inherited by the present sovereignty movement has not yet 
come to its logical conclusion, the same cannot be said of our 
civil and political rights and of our democratic and 
representative institutions. Yet, democracy is a fragile treasure 
to be cherished and protected, namely by honouring the memory 
of these heroes and promoters.
<P>
	This House is the heir to and the embodiment of the ideals 
fought for by the Patriotes and the Reformers. It is therefore up 
to this House to give them, today, the legitimate recognition 
history has always denied them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for presenting this 
motion and welcome the opportunity to give my views on the 
question of establishing a new national holiday.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since the early seventies, this House has been asked several 
times to consider proposals for the creation of a new national 
holiday. The date most often suggested is the third Monday in 
February since there is a long period without a national holiday 
between New Year's Day and Easter Sunday. It is argued that a 
holiday in this long winter period would do a great deal of good 
to Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Proposals for the name of the new day have been wide 
ranging. Some have suggested the celebration of common 
elements of our heritage. Examples include proposals for a 
heritage day, a communities day or a multicultural day. Others, 
like my hon. friend, have proposed that the contributions of 
specific Canadians be celebrated. Examples here include 
Macdonald-Cartier day, Baldwin-LaFontaine day, prime 
minister day and national heroes day.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5549"> 5549 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The proposal to create a Baldwin-Lafontaine Day is surely of 
great interest to my learned friend since it would mark the 
contribution of Robert Baldwin and Louis Lafontaine to the 
establishment of responsible government.
<P>
	My colleague will surely not want to overlook the richness 
and originality of the contribution made by the first champion of 
responsible government in Canada, the great Nova Scotian 
Joseph Howe. Howe was the one who established the first form 
of responsible government in the colonies which were to 
become the great country that is Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	While I agree that Canadians should celebrate the 
achievements of those who contributed to the establishment of a 
system of responsible government, I have two difficulties with 
the proposals of my hon. friend. First, I do not believe that we 
should narrowly focus on the contributions of individuals he 
refers to as patriots. Second, I do not believe we need a formal 
national holiday to celebrate responsible government.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	On the first point, I have already pointed out that the proposal 
of the hon. member for Verchères ignores the contribution of the 
father of responsible government in Canada, Joseph Howe. It 
was his courage in facing the executive branch of government in 
Nova Scotia that led the executive branch for the first time in 
Canada to be fully responsible to the elected members of the 
House in 1848.
<P>
	As Howe stated: ``This achievement came without a blow 
struck or a pane of glass broken''. Many Nova Scotians already 
celebrate his achievement each year. All Canadians should take 
pride in his critical contributions''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, thousands of Canadians have played a role in the 
process which led to the establishment of responsible 
government. They came from all regions of Canada and they 
contributed in various ways to the establishment of a more 
genuine democracy.
<P>
	Real responsible government was not achieved merely by 
adopting a model in which the executive branch is accountable 
to the legislative branch. Women did not have the right to vote in 
Canada until relatively recently. The efforts of Nellie McClung 
and others resulted in Manitoba being the first province which 
gave the franchise to women in 1916. Only on May 24 1918 did 
all the women in Canada acquire the right to vote in a federal 
election.
<P>
	Thérèse Casgrain played a major role in the fight to obtain for 
women the right to vote in provincial elections in Quebec, which 
was granted to them only in 1940.
<P>
	If we want to celebrate the establishment of democracy and 
responsible government, we must also recognize the 
contribution of great Canadians like Nellie McClung and 
Thérèse Casgrain.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our First Nations people were denied the right to participate 
until much more recently. For example, status Indians were not 
granted the right to vote in federal elections until 1960. I suggest 
that if we were to celebrate responsible government we should 
celebrate the breadth of contributions by the many Canadians 
who made true responsible government possible.
<P>
	My second point is that I do not believe that Canada should 
declare a new national holiday at this time. There are a number 
of reasons for my position.
<P>
	First, the federal government only has about 10 per cent of the 
Canadian workforce under its legislative control. Thus the 
creation of a national holiday would only directly affect the 
employees of the civil service, the banks and the crown 
corporations. I ask hon. members if most Canadians would not 
be annoyed rather than celebratory if they had to work while our 
banks, government offices and post offices were closed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Madam Speaker, I think the hon. Liberal 
member is straying from the debate since he is not speaking to 
the motion for the creation of a national holiday.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> That is a matter for 
debate. Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bertrand:</B> Madam Speaker, if we want the new holiday to 
have a truly national dimension, all provinces and territories 
should adopt it.
<P>
	Moreover, considering our economic difficulties, I believe it 
is important for members to think of the cost of creating a new 
holiday.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To shut down the Canadian economy for one more day out of 
the current working year would according to some 
commentators cost the economy-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Madam Speaker, as mover of this motion, I 
must remind the hon. member for Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle 
that the motion is not at all aimed at-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry but this is 
again a matter for debate. Resuming debate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5550"> 5550 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bertrand:</B> -approximately .4 per cent of the gross 
national product. This represents close to $3 billion. Is the hon. 
member for Verchères prepared to accept that magnitude of 
burden on the economy?
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	As our economy has started to emerge from the depths of a 
devastating recession, can we afford to introduce a measure that 
risks reducing overall productivity and GNP while increasing 
the need for overtime work?
<P>
	In our increasingly globalized economy can we afford to 
introduce another statutory holiday when our competitors are 
not doing the same? Surely the hon. member for Verchères 
recognizes that Canadian industry must strive to remain 
competitive and that the addition of a new national holiday 
would add a significant cost to doing business.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Thirdly, if we create a new national holiday, will the hon. 
member from Verchères not want the government to create 
programs to celebrate it? Where will we find the additional 
funds for that purpose?
<P>
	I am not opposed to the idea of underlining the contribution of 
historical figures to the establishment of responsible 
government. Quite the contrary. Canada Day already gives all 
Canadians the opportunity to stop a minute and think about the 
greatness of their country and the contribution made by every 
citizen.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Further, Canadian citizens have privately organized 
celebrations of a number of aspects of their heritage. Many 
Canadians have been celebrating Heritage Day for years on the 
third Monday in February. While not benefiting from a full day 
off, they have used the occasion to reflect on the cultural, 
architectural and social heritage as well as the political 
contributions of our citizens. May I suggest that those members 
interested in the celebration of responsible government use their 
position to organize private celebrations of our democratic 
heritage.
<P>
	Our Canada Day programs provide Canadians with the focus 
for a national celebration each year. Should Canadians wish to 
additionally celebrate our democratic heritage on another day, I 
would suggest that this be organized at the local level providing 
considerable flexibility for Canadians to tailor their 
celebrations to their particular community.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Schools could also organize historical re-creations of the 
debates which surrounded the advent of responsible 
government. They could ask local historical societies or 
heritage conservation groups to help them. None of these 
activities would require the creation of a new national holiday. 
The initiative would come from citizens wanting to promote and 
celebrate the tradition of democracy  which they have inherited 
as they do for the celebrations surrounding Heritage Day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
<P>
	I bring to your attention citation 459 in Beauchesne's 
<I>parliamentary Rules</I> concerning the relevance of the arguments 
brought forward by my colleague from 
Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle. Obviously, my colleague has 
completely misread the motion before this House since the 
reference to Quebec's National Patriots' Day serves only to 
indicate that the government of Quebec has already formally 
recognized the historical contribution of the Patriotes and the 
Reformers to the establishment of responsible government in 
Canada and in Quebec.
<P>
	Our aim is simply to give the Canadian government the 
opportunity of choosing the way it wants to recognize this 
historical contribution. The aim of this motion is merely to get 
the Canadian government to recognize this contribution.
<P>
	I think this debate has been seriously sidetracked.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I merely wished to 
remind the Member that, first, the motion is entitled National 
Patriots' Day.
<P>
	Second, citation 459 of Beauchesne which he mentioned says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Relevance is not easy to define. In borderline cases, the Member should be 
given the benefit of the doubt, although the Speaker has frequently admonished 
Members who have strayed in debate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	I would also like to remind the member that, were the rule of 
relevance strictly applied, this House would have serious 
problems.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to bring to your 
attention-and I think it is important to do so now-that I did 
not suggest the title National Patriots' Day. It was made up by 
the people working on <I>Hansard</I>, I think, or by the private 
members' business office, who interpreted the motion to have 
this meaning. I insist on repeating in the House, if I may, that 
this is-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member. If he finds the title given to his motion 
unacceptable, he can go to the Clerk of the House of Commons 
who will help him change it, if necessary.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate very much the opportunity to speak to this motion. It 
is very important that Canadians remember their history and that 
from time to time there be occasions for considering what has 
gone before.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5551"> 5551 </A></B>
<P>
	The motion the hon. member for Verchères has put forward is 
a controversial one. He is talking about issues which have never 
really been settled in history. Canadians will have to make 
individual judgments about the appropriateness of recognizing 
that some people are considered to be great patriots and others 
are considered to be traitors, as he himself mentioned. That is 
one of the major reasons I cannot support this particular motion.
<P>
	Although I think it is entirely appropriate for the Government 
of Quebec or local municipalities to make a decision about this, 
it is wrong for Parliament as a whole to make a judgment about 
an event in history that is still controversial in the minds of 
many Canadians.
<P>
	I also want to echo the remarks of the member from across the 
way who talked about the narrowness in scope of this motion and 
how it does not recognize that a lot of people have made 
significant contributions to responsible government in this 
country. I will talk about that in just a moment.
<P>
	Finally, I speak against it because we do have a day when we 
can consider what has gone on in the past and the people who 
have made great contributions to this country. That is Canada 
Day. The different efforts made over the years to bring 
responsible government about culminated in Confederation on 
July 1, 1867. Each year on July 1 we can pay tribute in our own 
ways and remember these people.
<P>
	It was just about a year ago to the day when Reformers came 
to Ottawa. At that point it was as candidates because we knew an 
election was coming. Our leader took a bunch of us around, 
about 100 or 150 of us. We were here to check out the House of 
Commons, choose our seats and that kind of thing. We talked 
about the big job ahead of us.
<P>
	I remember extremely well how our leader, the hon. member 
for Calgary Southwest, showed us the statues of Baldwin and 
Lafontaine. He pointed out the tremendous contributions these 
gentlemen had made in bringing about responsible government 
in Canada. I for one appreciate very much the efforts of those 
gentlemen.
<P>
	Even the constitution of the Reform Party pays tribute to 
many great reformers who have contributed and have helped 
develop the government and the system throughout Canada's 
history to where it is today. However it would be a mistake to set 
aside a specific day devoted to the memory of particular people 
who have made contributions, particularly ones whose legacies 
are controversial.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	It is accurate to say the patriots had some legitimate concerns, 
there is no question of that. However, we would be doing a 
disservice to the idea that we can have free debate and achieve 
things through peaceful means by implying that we give 
credibility to the idea that the end justifies the means, that 
somehow we are giving our tacit approval for the violence which 
took place during the revolts of 1837 and 1838. Many people 
were killed  during those uprisings. We would certainly not want 
to suggest that is the proper way to bring about change.
<P>
	As the member across the way pointed out, in the 1840s and 
1850s Joseph Howe fought for responsible government in Nova 
Scotia. He was one of the people responsible for bringing about 
responsible government. He did that without having to resort to 
violence. That is a good lesson.
<P>
	This motion is too narrow in scope. It does not recognize the 
contributions of gentlemen like Joseph Howe and others who 
came after Confederation. I want to talk about them for a 
moment. I mentioned Joseph Howe. I mentioned Robert 
Baldwin and Louis Lafontaine. There are others who came after 
them. There are some of the populist movements which took 
place during the 1920s.
<P>
	The Progressives came into this place in 1921, 64 of them. In 
fact the first Progressive ever elected to the House of Commons 
was from my constituency of Medicine Hat in a byelection, a 
coincidence I am sure. In 1921 it was that group of Progressives 
which brought with them the first woman ever elected to the 
House of Commons, Agnes Macphail. Those Progressives 
deserve to be recognized as well.
<P>
	In the 1930s a couple of groups sprang up. The CCF sprang up 
in 1932. The founding convention was actually held in Calgary. 
For years it had been preceded by labour groups. However it was 
a populist movement. Populism has become an important 
movement in Canadian politics as evidenced by this Parliament.
<P>
	In 1935 the Alberta Social Credit movement got under way. 
William Aberhart played a critical role. The gentleman who 
followed him in that movement was Ernest Manning, the father 
of the present leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	In 1921 the Alberta wing of the Progressives was headed up 
by Henry Wise Wood. There were two wings of the Progressives, 
the Manitoba wing and the Alberta wing. The Alberta wing 
believed very strongly that MPs had to be accountable to their 
constituents. That was a novel idea at the time and I would 
suggest in many quarters of this place it still is today. I hope it is 
something that will continue to evolve. Hopefully at some point 
in the not too distant future we will have truly accountable MPs 
who will be required to do the bidding of their constituents.
<P>
	Finally I wish to speak on the appropriateness of setting aside 
yet another day to recognize history. There is Heritage Day, as 
someone referred to and we can use that day to think back on our 
history. However, Canada Day recognizes all the history in the 
development of this country. That means many things. It 
recognizes the social and historical developments and the 
contribu-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5552"> 5552 </A></B>
<P>
tions our troops made during the various wars. Of course there is 
also Remembrance Day.
<P>
	We can reflect on our history on Canada Day, which is a 
national holiday. It is entirely appropriate. It is good that Canada 
Day does not necessarily specify who we should be recognizing. 
Canadians can make those judgments themselves.
<P>
	In conclusion although I appreciate the intentions of the hon. 
member, our party will not be supporting this motion.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Madam Speaker, right 
away, before giving my speech, I would like to inform you that 
we on this side of the House find it deplorable that Reformers 
and Liberals are trying so hard and so sincerely to change the 
nature of the debate. Rather than opposing the motion for the 
sake of opposing it, taking exception and arguing against the 
merits of the motion, they are trying not to talk about it, they are 
talking about other issues, and are beating about the bush.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that we are not trying to establish 
a National Patriots' Day as we have in Quebec. Yes, we celebrate 
that in Quebec, but this is not what we are after here. We are 
asking the Canadian government to recognize the role of 
Patriotes and Reformers in Canada.
<P>
	An NDP member proposed that hockey be recognized as the 
national sport of Canada, as well as lacrosse. What more does 
that involve? What national day is hockey day? That is not the 
issue. So we would appreciate it if people would oppose the 
motion, not just the winds around the motion.
<P>
	That being said, I will begin my speech. The motion tabled, 
and I am talking about the motion that was tabled and not 
something else, is of very great significance for us in the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
	It is essential to recognize that Patriotes and Reformers 
played an important part in the birth of a true democracy in 
Canada. In fact, we must, this House must recognize the 
significant role that these people played in the history of Quebec 
and Canada and their undeniable contribution to our current 
political structure.
<P>
	The motion tabled in this House by my hon. colleague from 
Verchères is, therefore, of prime importance. I repeat, we are not 
trying to set up a National Patriots' Day. They did it in Quebec, 
but there in Quebec they are ahead of their time, not you. The 
name of the Patriotes must be cleared so that they can take their 
rightful place in history.
<P>
	It is also true, however, that the means they used to reach their 
ends may seem to us, to some of us, drastic, but a closer look at 
the situation shows that their demands were legitimate, not their 
actions.
<P>
	I think it would be a good idea, and I feel this even more 
strongly now, having listened to the two previous debates, to 
present an historical overview of the circumstances surrounding 
the rebellions of 1837-38. It would be my pleasure to do so, 
perhaps people will learn something. We should say, quickly, 
that over a period of a little more than a hundred years, from 
1760 to 1867, the constitutional status of British North America 
changed five times. There was the Royal Proclamation in 1760, 
the Quebec Act 14 years later, then there was the Constitutional 
Act of 1791, the Act of Union in 1840 and finally the British 
North America Act in 1867. Five changes in a little over 100 
years. But for 125 years we have not dared to touch this 
sacrosanct piece of paper on which the Constitution is written, 
with the exception of the 1982 mistake.
<P>
	We will deal specifically with three of these documents. The 
Quebec Act of 1774, when England-we must also point out that 
these rules are always imposed from outside, and it is always 
from the outside that rules are imposed on francophones. This is 
what is known as colonial status. This is what we want to leave 
behind.
<P>
	With the Quebec Act, England realized that the assimilation 
of Francophones in Canada was, to all intents and purposes, 
futile.
<P>
	In order to ensure that the province ``of Quebec'', as it was 
called then, did not move toward the hand held out by the future 
United States south of its borders, the Crown offered what might 
be called a gift to the province ``of Quebec'' that re-established 
some of their rights, abolished the oath of allegiance, and 
recognized a French lifestyle in this British territory in North 
America.
<P>
	After the United States gained its independence, a number of 
people loyal to the crown, the Loyalists, came to find refuge in 
this part of the British colony that is today called Canada. They 
asked their motherland, England, to allow them to have rights 
and exercise them in a land of their own.
<P>
	Granting their request, England imposed the Constitutional 
Act of 1791 that divided the area in two-Upper Canada for the 
majority of Loyalists, and Lower Canada, Quebec, for the 
French speaking majority.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, in 1791, England recognized the distinct status of 
the French fact in North America, which our neighbours today 
cannot understand.
<P>
	The Constitution Act introduced two new principles into the 
Canadian political system: parliamentarism and the representa-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5553"> 5553 </A></B>
<P>
tive system. For the first time, the inhabitants of the area were 
able to elect their representatives who would meet in 
Parliament.
<P>
	The birth of democracy was, however, very quickly marred by 
mistakes. The people suddenly realised that the legislative 
assembly elected by the people had no authority over the two 
councils appointed by London. The legislative council and the 
executive council were composed of a majority of merchants 
and professionals who lived in the territory and were appointed 
by the British crown, which thereby maintained control over 
decisions concerning the French-speaking population.
<P>
	The Loyalists in Upper Canada, now known as Ontario, 
experienced the same anti-democratic stalemate as the 
francophones. And William Lyon Mackenzie and his party of 
Reformers also rebelled against this state of affairs-they were 
not, of course, the Reformers we have today, but the Reformers 
of the time.
<P>
	In Lower Canada, the Patriotes and Papineau opposed this 
injustice. An important point to note here is that francophones 
were in the majority at that time throughout all of Upper and 
Lower Canada.
<P>
	These two political movements attempted peacefully to 
denounce the constitutional impasse. The Patriotes presented a 
list of 92 resolutions-weaknesses to be corrected in the 
Canadian political system. The answer soon arrived-Lord 
Russell refused to agree to the demands made by Papineau and 
his party.
<P>
	There were then only two roads open to the leader of the 
Patriotes: submission or revolt.
<P>
	Since 1834, the economic, social and cultural context had 
been seething. Economically, difficult access to land made it 
more and more difficult to settle numerous families. Socially, 
the English-speaking elite controlled almost everything, and 
particularly jobs. In connection with culture, the Legislative 
Council refused to respond to the need for an education system 
as requested by Lower Canada, a little like the situation in 
Ontario today, in Kingston, for those who are not aware of the 
issue.
<P>
	Political instability, economic instability, social and cultural 
instability were all perfect ingredients for the pot to boil over in 
Lower Canada and Upper Canada.
<P>
	The Patriotes, then, wanted to exercise real power over the 
decisions affecting the future of the people living in Lower 
Canada. One of their principal demands was ministerial 
responsibility, which involved having an executive council 
comprised of members of the legislative assembly-elected 
officials who made decisions and were responsible to the public 
for their actions.
<P>
	London's refusal had regrettable consequences-we must 
point that out-and they were called the Rebellion of 1838-38. I 
will willingly spare you the details of the Rebellion, as they 
were described earlier, and go on immediately to the situation 
analysis carried out by Lord Durham.
<P>
	After studying the situation in Upper and Lower Canada, and 
noting that francophones were in the minority at that point, Lord 
Durham, no fool he, proposed the union of Upper and Lower 
Canada, that would then be called ``United Canada'', with an 
English-speaking majority. Remember that because of this 
union Lower Canada's debt increased by a factor of 16 to pay for 
Upper Canada's infrastructures.
<P>
	After an eight-year adaptation period, in 1848, London 
recognized the second recommendation in the Durham 
report-ministerial responsibility. Remember that date: 
1848-the birth of true democracy.
<P>
	We can, without fear of contradiction, state that Mackenzie's 
Reformers and the Patriotes were the initiators of what is known 
today as responsible government.
<P>
	These men, who were killed in combat, hanged or exiled, 
made it possible for us today to work in one of the most 
democratic political systems in the world, and they deserve 
recognition from the Canadian government for their enormous 
contribution to our political institutions.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Quebec has done this already by proclaiming November 22 as 
Patriot's Day. Pierre Elliott Trudeau himself did it. In 1970, on 
the sly in Australia, he inaugurated a monument to the Patriotes. 
It is now up to us to clear their name for the collective memory 
of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs):</B> Madam Speaker, it is with great 
pleasure that I rise today to address the House on Motion No. 
257 to establish a National Patriots' Day.
<P>
	While I agree with my hon. colleague from Verchères that it is 
important to celebrate the individuals who have helped to 
establish our system of responsible government, I have several 
difficulties with his proposal. The first is the lack of 
inclusiveness of the proposal. Another is the duplication of what 
already exists. The third is the peculiar interpretation of the 
development of responsible government in Canada.
<P>
	In the first place, as my colleague pointed out earlier, there is 
the possibility of additional cost.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We do not need a new national holiday to highlight these 
achievements. Canada Day provides us with an opportunity to 
celebrate the contribution of many Canadians to the 
establishment of our democratic system of government.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5554"> 5554 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Thousands of Canadians currently celebrate Heritage Day in 
February and Canada Day in July. They organize events that 
draw the attention of Canadians to the cultural diversity of this 
great country and to the patriots of our past. They celebrate its 
past, present and future.
<P>
	I find the motion most peculiar in that it links responsible 
government directly to the actions of the reformers and les 
patriotes of 1837. It is a linkage that Papineau himself would not 
have accepted. If we recall our history lessons it was the Durham 
report, which followed responsible government, that was the 
direct result of the 1837 rebellions. The Durham report called 
for responsible government and the union of the Canadas. 
Papineau opposed both.
<P>
	The Durham report indicated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I entertain no doubt of the national character which must be given to Lower 
Canada. It must be that of the British Empire, that of the great race which must, in 
the lapse of no long period of time be predominant over the whole North 
American continent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was Durham's hope. His hope was assimilation but it was 
fortunately not to be. That it did not occur was the result of the 
moderate reformers. The Liberal Party was the original and true 
reform party, and it was the work of Lafontaine and Baldwin. 
Professor Careless has said:

<BLOCKQUOTE>The idea of responsible government was taken up in the 1830s in British 
North America by loyal admirers of the British model, who sought both to 
remedy discontent with unyielding local oligarchies and to keep the provinces 
securely, though freely, within the Empire. Radicals such as William Lyon 
Mackenzie and Louis-Joseph Papineau preferred American elective patterns, 
but Joseph Howe in Nova Scotia and Robert Baldwin in Upper Canada showed 
far better comprehension-better even than Lord Durham-since they realized 
that an organized party system was vital. Howe in Nova Scotia, and Baldwin and 
Louis Lafontaine in the Province of Canada, built up strong, moderate reform 
parties to gain responsible government, and by 1848 saw it fully operating, 
accepted by a Liberal, imperial Britain.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Indeed it was Howe of Nova Scotia who first achieved 
responsible government. Let us never forget that responsible 
government was not fully democratic. Should we not honour 
those other great Canadians such as Nellie McClung and 
Thérèse Casgrain who fought for the franchise for women in the 
first four decades of this century?
<P>
	I do not disagree with my hon. colleague that we have national 
patriots. I accept that Papineau and Mackenzie were patriots. 
Mackenzie was the grandfather of the founder of one of the great 
prime ministers of this great party that I represent.
<P>
	I agree that Baldwin and Lafontaine merit special recognition. 
They worked together to achieve responsible government in a 
remarkable demonstration of tolerance shown by Canadians of 
that day.
<P>
	In 1841 Lafontaine lost his seat in an election of that year and 
Baldwin found one for him in the heart of  Upper Canada, 
Canada West, in Newmarket, Ontario. Two years later Baldwin 
lost his seat and Lafontaine had him elected in the constituency 
of Rimouski which was 99 per cent francophone. I suggest to my 
hon. colleague we may switch some day in the same fashion. 
That was the spirit of the times and the spirit of the toleration 
and co-operation that created this great country.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	There have always been those who had doubts about this 
country and its future. Joseph Howe, it must be admitted, 
doubted that Confederation would work. He opposed it in 1867 
and called it botheration not Confederation. Within a few years 
he became caught up in the vision of a great nation from sea to 
sea. So did Wilfrid Laurier, who had opposed Confederation in 
1867, and so did W. S. Fielding of Nova Scotia who opposed 
Confederation in the 1880s in a campaign for premier that he led 
for the Liberal Party. Ten years later Fielding was in Ottawa as a 
part of Laurier's cabinet.
<P>
	Is it not possible that 10 years hence the hon. member for 
Verchères and indeed the Leader of the Opposition himself, who 
has shown such a willingness to change his political views in the 
past, might together with all of us on this side celebrate Canada 
Day and Heritage Day in Ottawa?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity address the House 
about 
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5555"> 5555 </A></B>
<P>
not only Bill C-30, but also about the broader context of this 
vital amendment to the Department of Labour Act.
<P>
	It is important that Canadians understand the long term goals 
which frame the government's response to the challenges 
presented by the breakdown of the traditional fishery. They need 
to understand our efforts to meet these challenges with 
meaningful, co-ordinated programs that acknowledge the 
inevitability of change and recognize the urgent need to 
establish a more diversified, relevant economic base for the 
Atlantic region.
<P>
	We also recognize that the human dynamics of this tragic 
situation calls for a response that is fair and flexible, 
particularly as it applies to those hardest hit and least able to 
adjust to the change.
<P>
	Certainly no group of individuals has been more affected by 
the decline of the groundfish industry than older fishers and fish 
plant workers. These are people who have spent their working 
lives, who have made their living in the fishery and who in many 
cases now find their chances for re-employment not very 
encouraging.
<P>
	That is why the Atlantic groundfish strategy includes a fish 
plant older worker adjustment program. It is why an amendment 
to the Department of Labour Act, Bill C-30, is needed to include 
eligible workers who will reach 55 within their period of 
eligibility under the strategy.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	The Atlantic groundfish strategy was designed in consultation 
with provinces, unions, businesses, industry and of course the 
communities and individuals who have been affected by the 
situation in Atlantic Canada, those individuals whose livelihood 
has been affected by the dependence that they had on a 
diminishing resource in that area of Canada.
<P>
	In developing the comprehensive strategy, all aspects of 
change were considered, which is why programs that target the 
circumstances faced by specific groups such as older workers, 
are included as part of this wide adjustment strategy.
<P>
	We have introduced a very comprehensive avant garde way of 
looking at the problem. We are using a modernized, restructured 
approach toward addressing the issue of change in Atlantic 
Canada. Fundamental in this discussion is the fact that we as a 
government, as a people, must understand that the only constant 
in today's society is change.
<P>
	It requires new, more innovative ways to deal with the 
challenges facing the people in Canada. The changing 
dynamics, the changing configuration of the Canadian economy, 
particularly in Atlantic Canada, necessitate a new approach, a 
new way of enhancing our labour market strategy, of finding 
new ways to deal with structural unemployment, new ways of 
dealing with the lives, by providing opportunities, by providing 
the tools, by giving Canadians a tool kit to deal with the type of 
change that in many ways has devastated a resource, namely the 
fishery.
<P>
	How we deal with that as a government, how we respond to the 
changing dynamics of Atlantic Canada's economy, is 
fundamental to the success not only of our region but also of our 
nation. It goes above and beyond that industry. It speaks to the 
fact that we as Canadians must abandon old ways, must realize 
and accept that change is here, that the economy simply does not 
function the way it used to.
<P>
	Therefore this crisis in Atlantic Canada has in many ways 
challenged the traditional approach of dealing with changes in 
our economy. As we looked and analysed and reviewed and in 
some ways invented new ways of dealing with this issues, 
foremost in our minds as always when we are dealing with 
public policy, when we are dealing with the livelihood and lives 
of young and old in a region like Atlantic Canada was that we as 
a government have a responsibility to provide opportunities for 
our people.
<P>
	In turn, the responsibility of the people of Atlantic Canada 
affected by this program is to make the most out of those 
opportunities provided by the Government of Canada in 
partnership with all the key stakeholders in the Atlantic Canada 
community. It is not a question of just giving income support for 
the sake of income support. We are dealing with changing the 
dynamics in an economy that requires innovative ways of 
dealing with the problem of diminishing resources, namely the 
fishery.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	We need a variety of ways of dealing with the issue at hand 
and to give the people affected by the diminishing resources a 
variety of tools. The government, always in full partnership with 
the communities, the businesses and the individuals, has created 
a series of programs to help with the transition that is necessary 
in the Atlantic region.
<P>
	Among others, we have initiatives such as the career planning 
and employment counselling. These services will help us to 
assess individual employment possibilities, set goals, develop a 
personal agenda for the individual Canadian who is looking to 
improve his or her chances in an economy that is forever 
changing.
<P>
	We are also offering a self-employment assistance program. 
It is a program that will basically kickstart new business outside 
the fishery. In essence it will give hope and opportunity to 
Canadians in Atlantic Canada to engage in entrepreneurship 
training.
<P>
	Through this process of extensive, wide-ranging 
consultation, everyone involved was brought into the 
consultation process. As a government we felt fundamentally 
that any program which we initiated must have the full support 
and co-operation of the people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5556"> 5556 </A></B>
<P>
	We have to bring it back to the community level. We have to 
engage people at the community level. It is for this reason that 
one of the initiatives speaks to a communities opportunity pool, 
allowing individuals to develop and contribute to community 
based projects and initiatives where they live.
<P>
	We are also cognizant of the fact that we live in a changing 
world where the environment and sustainable economic growth 
are extremely important to the lives of Canadians regardless of 
which region they are from. It is for this reason that we 
introduced, as part of the package, green projects that connect 
the environment and the community with the view to improve 
the skills and long term employment opportunities for those 
people who choose to participate in this initiative.
<P>
	Fundamental to this program is also mobility assistance, to 
provide relocation support for those who wish to find work 
outside their community and of course portable wage subsidies 
to allow employers outside the fishery to hire people and 
provide on the job training.
<P>
	It is extremely important to note that where these initiatives 
are concerned we have built safeguards that will ensure there is 
no abuse of the programs and services offered.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	We must remember that while TAGS is an active support 
measure, the fish plant older worker adjustment program is 
more in line with the traditional way of giving support to people. 
It will provide income support to older workers who have 
worked all their lives and, may I add, worked very hard. This 
program is an investment in their dignity and in their 
self-worth.
<P>
	I believe it is essential to reiterate the Atlantic groundfish 
strategy. One of the key features of this strategy is that it is built 
on mutual responsibility. That is a very important principle. As 
such, it represents a significant change from the traditional way 
of giving income support provided by the previous groundfish 
programs that ended on May 15, 1994. Of course I am referring 
to NCARP and AGAP.
<P>
	No one is obliged to participate in the strategy. Anyone can 
opt out for an alternative. That is their personal choice.
<P>
	In addition to active income support, the strategy is a 
departure from the traditional, ineffective at times, ways of the 
past. At no time under this strategy program will participants be 
trained for jobs that do not exist. They will work at jobs that 
need to be done or trained for employment that will give them a 
chance at a future job.
<P>
	In short, what is fundamental to note about this program is 
that TAGS is the opposite of a cynical, short lived, make work 
program. Those types of programs are part of the history books.
<P>
	As a nation in financial, social and economic terms we simply 
cannot afford to go on in the same manner in which we have for 
decades. Conditions are simply not the same.
<P>
	Other measures to encourage and assist workers include 
continued employment counselling, literacy programs and 
general education upgrading, all with the objective of 
connecting people to the emerging reality of a diversified 
economy, of giving people the skills and opportunities required 
to meet the challenges of this century, to meet the challenges of 
a nation in a global economy that is changing at a very fast pace.
<P>
	When we say that people must continue to upgrade, when we 
say that most jobs by the year 2010 will require over 16 years of 
education, when we say that the future really belongs to the 
learners, the people who are willing to upgrade their skills, the 
people who are willing to take risks and challenges, the people 
who are willing to take the time to acquire the new economy 
skills that are required, those individuals are going to be the 
winners of the new economic system, those people who are 
willing to challenge future trends.
<P>
	That is a message not only for the Atlantic fish workers and 
plant workers we are talking about today, but that is the 
challenge for all Canadians regardless of where they come from.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	Atlantic Canadians are faced with diminishing resources on 
one hand and a changing economy on the other. This program we 
are speaking about today speaks to the challenges they are 
facing, adding to the effectiveness of the strategy that will be 
implemented in a context of wider commitments to eliminate 
duplication, overlap and to support development efforts in a 
co-ordinated manner. This means we must bring government 
departments together and toward this end the initiatives of the 
Atlantic groundfish strategy will complement the functions of 
regional economic development agencies such as ACOA and 
FORD-Q.
<P>
	Even within government we have to accept change and even 
within government we must adapt to the realities of the new 
economy.
<P>
	As members are aware, FORD-Q is focusing on economic 
diversification for eastern Quebec and the north shore. This 
initiative has as its clientele fishers and communities affected 
by the crisis, small and medium sized businesses, entrepreneurs, 
new business start-ups and non profit organizations such as 
Alliance des pêcheurs du Québec. FORD-Q serves an umbrella 
function, facilitating local and regional initiatives in concert 
with the Quebec government.
<P>
	ACOA will place a similar emphasis on community economic 
development in finding innovative ways to enhance the 
potential of the communities, of the people, of the labour force; 
their potential within an Atlantic Canada context.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5557"> 5557 </A></B>
<P>
	While we acknowledge that hardship will be felt in each of the 
hundreds of communities affected by the fishery adjustment it is 
necessary to recognize the potential of communities to develop 
new economic structures. Therefore ACOA is encouraging 
communities to group together, to take a regional approach to 
alternative industry development.
<P>
	How well we are dealing with the crisis. Our approach as a 
government, our approach as communities, as a nation, should 
be not simply to view this as a crisis but it must also be to view 
this as an opportunity to bring about positive change in this 
particular area.
<P>
	When we look at the way government is going to deliver the 
programs we will make sure that in terms of delivering 
effective, relevant economic development programs every 
effort must be made to ensure the harmonization of all existing 
and anticipated initiatives. That is fundamental to the success of 
this program. We must remember that government in 
co-operation with community, unions, business leaders, the 
people, the various communities, must act in concert, together, 
toward a common vision as we move forward.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	It is critical then that the Atlantic groundfish strategy 
reinforces the community development thrust of FORD-Q and 
ACOA. Because we owe that to the people of the area, to the 
taxpayers of Canada, nothing less than the most efficient, 
effective and user friendly initiatives that can be designed 
should be delivered; initiatives that are at once pragmatic, 
compassionate, developed through consultation, initiatives such 
as fish plant older worker adjustment program.
<P>
	This program in a very practical way recognizes the long term 
contribution of older workers with many years of attachment to 
the groundfish industry. This change will help these men and 
women maintain their dignity. It will reduce the impact of 
communities when it comes to dealing with the damaging 
consequences of significant job losses.
<P>
	Bill C-30 as such represents an important component of 
delivering a truly effective, relevant adjustment package for 
older workers between the ages of 50 and 64. The programs of 
the Atlantic groundfish strategy, including the fish plant older 
worker adjustment program, are each designed to meet the 
specific needs, to serve as a catalyst for community economic 
growth and individual adjustment in the face of unprecedented 
change and disruption.
<P>
	Bill C-30 is just one response under the strategy to the 
realities of change but it is an essential response to those 
Atlantic Canadians who have given so much for so long and who 
now during this crisis, yet opportunity, during this time when 
they are challenged by unprecedented conditions in the fishery 
industry really need our support.
<P>
	It is for this reason that when we were drafting this legislation 
we took into consideration the various components. We took 
into consideration the fishery industry. We took into 
consideration the attachment that these people have to that 
industry, the economic conditions, the past economic practices 
and structures of Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	We feel that through this legislation we are not only 
addressing a crisis but we are giving people the necessary tools 
to upgrade their skills, to put their experience into action in 
community opportunity pools, to provide them with tools like 
self-employment assistance and portable wage subsidies. We 
are doing all this because we understand fundamentally that 
what is occurring in Atlantic Canada today requires an 
intelligent, pragmatic, rational response.
<P>
	It requires an innovative, flexible system that can give the 
opportunity to people in Atlantic Canada to react to a new 
situation, a new economic system and new challenges that 
obviously they did not face before.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the role of the Government of Canada in 
partnership with all the rest of the stakeholders in the various 
communities, individual fishermen and plant workers, unions 
and business is to provide opportunity to the people of Atlantic 
Canada. I am 150 per cent sure that in the same responsible 
manner in which the Government of Canada provided those 
opportunities the people of Atlantic Canada will respond to 
those challenges, to those opportunities, by making the most out 
of it.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased today to speak to the measures 
introduced by the government in this bill. I think more than 
anything this bill demonstrates the difference between the 
Liberal principles and Reform principles.
<P>
	It clearly demonstrates an old way of thinking about 
government and a new common sense way of thinking that 
Reformers are hearing from Canadians across this country. 
Maritimers and Newfoundlanders are just now beginning to hear 
from Reformers. I hope they are listening today.
<P>
	Bill C-30 is one small component of the government's 
Atlantic groundfish strategy called TAGS in bureaucratic 
language. TAGS was announced in April by the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans and the Minister of Human Resources 
Development as the Liberal government's $1.9 billion response 
to the continuing human tragedy unfolding in Atlantic Canada. 
It resulted from the virtual disappearance of Atlantic cod from 
our eastern fisheries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5558"> 5558 </A></B>
<P>
	TAGS took effect on May 16 and replaces two Conservative 
government programs, the northern cod adjustment and 
recovery program and the Atlantic goundfish adjustment 
program.
<P>
	The Atlantic groundfish strategy is a five year program which 
will provide a range of options for an estimated 30,000 
groundfish fishermen and plant workers. It has several 
components which I would like to review at this time.
<P>
	First, there is financial support here of between $200 and 
$382 per week. Second, it provides for training programs 
including literacy training, adult basic education, university 
study programs, leadership training, career guidance training 
and entrepreneurial training.
<P>
	Another aspect of it is that participants will take part in 
employment projects called green projects which will be 
designed to preserve and enhance the environment and designed 
to provide fishermen and plant workers with new skills and job 
experience.
<P>
	Another thing that TAGS will do is provide an employment 
bonus to participants who find and accept work outside the 
fishery. It will also provide an affordable wage subsidy which 
will be paid to employers outside the fishery sector to hire 
fishermen and plant workers in permanent, full time 
employment and provide on the job training.
<P>
	Another thing is that this program will provide employment 
counselling, mobility and relocation assistance to those workers 
who want to move to find work. Program participants will also 
have access to self-employment assistance to help them create 
their own jobs. All of these can be very positive measures.
<P>
	Finally, we come to the Atlantic groundfish strategy which 
will provide an older worker adjustment program or an early 
retirement package for fish plant workers between the ages of 50 
and 65 who do not want to participate in any of these other 
programs. This is the reason for Bill C-30. That is why the 
government introduced it and that is the reason we are here 
today.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	First, I commend the government for the Atlantic groundfish 
strategy. Reformers believe that it is an improvement over the 
programs that it replaces. It requires participants to participate 
in training and upgrading programs, work on community 
projects and a range of labour adjustment options and incentives 
to get fishermen and plant workers back to work.
<P>
	I think many of the measures were designed to provide 
participants with a number of choices to fit their particular 
circumstances and needs. I also think the programs were 
designed to save the government money in the long run by trying 
to get these participants back to work. I commend the 
government for the thought that went into these programs. There 
seems to have been some real innovative thinking based on the 
premise that what we have done in the past has not worked.
<P>
	I believe the program design indicates a legitimate desire on 
behalf of the government to try and use these programs to avoid 
or break up the dependency cycle which often accompanies 
government programs of this nature.
<P>
	I look forward to finding out how they actually work, to see if 
any of these measures have application in the rest of Canada 
particularly as they relate to the larger task of reforming our 
social programs currently under review in the Department of 
Human Resources Development.
<P>
	So much for the compliments. Let us get to Bill C-30, the 
plant older worker adjustment program. The innovative thinking 
seems to have stopped at this point. Bill C-30 will amend the 
Department of Labour Act to allow the Minister of Human 
Resources Development to enter into federal-provincial 
agreements and provide for an early retirement package of up to 
$1,000 per month for approximately 1,200 fish plant workers 
between the ages of 50 and 65. This is estimated to cost between 
$53 million and $67 million. The total cost of the program is to 
be shared by the federal and provincial governments on a 70 per 
cent 30 per cent basis respectively.
<P>
	The government will purchase annuities for older fish plant 
workers, the amount to be calculated on the basis of 70 per cent 
of their UI benefits, up to a monthly maximum of $1,000.
<P>
	While this guaranteed income is currently only available to 
fish plant workers, government officials advise that a similar 
package is now being designed for fishermen. As we can see the 
measure is going to be expanded.
<P>
	It seems every time we target a new program for a certain 
group it creates inequities and others say ``Me too'', so we 
create another program. It has a snowballing effect. We get into 
the mess we are in now and it is costing us millions and billions 
of dollars.
<P>
	Government officials explained the rationale for this new 
program. They said that some fish plant workers will not want to 
participate in the other program options offered by the 
government. They said that providing up to $1,000 per month to 
these older workers would in fact save the government money. 
Benefits under the Atlantic groundfish strategy will range from 
a minimum of $867 per month to a maximum of $1,655 per 
month.
<P>
	Unfortunate, Reformers believe the government has not 
thought this final measure out very well. Under TAGS the 
30,000 unemployed fishermen and plant workers will be 
required to participate in a wide range of measures designed to 
get them back to work, that is if they are under 50 years of age. 
However, the fish plant older worker adjustment program and 
any subsequent early retirement package designed for fishermen 
are designed with the view that these workers are no longer 
employable. Age 50 and you are no longer employable, no 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5559"> 5559 </A></B>
<P>
longer capable of being a productive employee, a  human 
resource that is no longer needed to revitalize the economy of 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Reformers believe that these early retirement packages 
should not be an option that we consider for workers in the prime 
of their life. Workers between the ages of 50 and 65 have 
accumulated a lifetime of knowledge and experience that should 
not be lost by putting them out to pasture. For half of their adult 
life they will be on some kind of a pension. Can we in good 
conscience make this kind of a move? All workers should be 
asked to participate in the other innovative options provided in 
the Atlantic groundfish strategy.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Let us think about what we are doing here. If we are going to 
put these valuable workers out to pasture, and I am not saying we 
should, the federal government already pays for a program to do 
just that. It is called social assistance.
<P>
	If the government has given up on these workers and if the 
workers want to give up on themselves and go on welfare, that is 
the option that is available to them. Not only is it available it is 
cheaper than the 70:30 cost sharing proposed in this bill.
<P>
	The Canada assistance plan provides financial support 
through the provinces on a 50:50 cost sharing arrangement, plus 
the bureaucracy is already in place in each of the provinces. 
There is no need to set up another bureaucracy to establish yet 
another glorified welfare program administered by the feds.
<P>
	This duplication of effort is reason enough for Reformers not 
to support this bill. We came to Ottawa to eliminate duplication 
of effort and to save money. That is why we cannot go along with 
this.
<P>
	Here is a program that is a complete duplication of effort 
between the federal and provincial bureaucracies and it costs the 
federal government even more money. Reformers say: ``How 
about taking all the money spent in the administration of this 
earlier retirement program and put it in the hands of fishermen 
and fish plant workers to help them get back to work?''
<P>
	All the other programs put forward in the Atlantic groundfish 
strategy have been designed to get fishermen and fish plant 
workers back to work, but the fish plant older worker adjustment 
program is designed to do the exact opposite. This early 
retirement package will act as a disincentive to re-enter the 
workforce, a disincentive to retrain, a disincentive to start a 
small business and a disincentive to move to find work. This is 
another reason why Reformers do not support Bill C-30.
<P>
	Reformers do not have such a defeatist attitude that they give 
up on 1,200 workers before even trying to get them back in the 
labour force.
<P>
	Another reason not to support this bill is the discriminatory 
aspects of it. This bill is discriminatory in three ways. First of all 
it is discriminatory on the basis of age. It is discriminatory on 
the basis of industry. It is discriminatory on the basis of region. 
This bill discriminates on the basis of age by providing benefits 
for older fish plant workers between the ages of 50 and 65. What 
about worker who is 49 and in the same situation as the 50 year 
older worker? Could he not challenge his ineligibility because it 
discriminates on the basis of age?
<P>
	This early retirement program also discriminates against 
older workers facing similar hardship but not working in that 
particular industry or some of those fish plants.
<P>
	What about those older workers who work in other service 
companies who are indirectly dependent on the fish plants and 
the fisheries? They were thrown out of work. What about the 
older workers who have been laid off in thousands of small 
industries and businesses in hundreds of communities in 
Atlantic Canada because of the fisheries crisis? Could these 
older workers not challenge this program because it 
discriminates against them on the basis of industry?
<P>
	The fish plant older worker adjustment program also 
discriminates because it is targeted only to the Atlantic 
provinces. What about older workers in the rest of Canada who 
read about the special treatment of older workers in the Atlantic 
region? Could older workers in the rest of Canada who are also 
in serious financial straits not challenge this program because it 
is not available to them?
<P>
	The Reform Party believes in true equality and is opposed to 
the discriminatory aspects of this bill, the fish plant older 
worker adjustment program. In fact Reformers are opposed to 
all older worker adjustment programs implemented by the 
government over the last number of years. The Reform Party 
principles would have programs apply to all laid off workers 
equally regardless of age, place of residence, industry and 
targeted to those most in need. Let us not forget that key point: 
target the programs to those most in need.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Finally, the Reform Party is opposed to the bill because of its 
defeatist approach to the east coast fishery. Neither Bill C-30 
nor the Atlantic groundfish strategy describes how these 
programs relate to the total restructuring of the Atlantic 
fisheries so that it is sustainable once the recovery has taken 
place.
<P>
	Reformers believe that the east coast fishery can be 
revitalized by fundamentally restructuring the industry so that it 
is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5560"> 5560 </A></B>
<P>
market driven and competitively structured with individual 
harvesting rights which will lead to economically viable vessels 
and processing units.
<P>
	In closing I would like to say that we have here a classic case, 
a clear demonstration of the calamity caused by government 
intervention. For over 300 years the east coast fishery has 
thrived. In the last 50 years the government got too involved in 
managing the fishery and look at it today. What a mess.
<P>
	Thirty thousand people who used to be gainfully employed 
and paying taxes are now dependent on a $1.9 billion make work 
project. I find it ironic that throughout the whole of the 50 years 
of government intervention the only job security has been for 
the tinkering, meddling bureaucrats and politicians. Those are 
the ones who have been assured of a job. This program is another 
make work project for them.
<P>
	Every time the government introduces a new program it 
seems to create more work for bureaucrats. If it is anything like 
agriculture there is one bureaucrat now for every 5.7 farmers 
who make a living off the land. That is unsustainable. That 
cannot work. We have to look at how much government we have 
and find ways to downsize.
<P>
	This is where the Reform Party is strongly opposed to the 
direction the government is taking. Even in this the east coast 
fisheries darkest hour the bureaucrats and politicians are finding 
ways to employ even more bureaucrats. I am sure most people in 
Atlantic Canada appreciate the money, the support and the 
programs. I cannot help but wonder what kind of fishery we 
would have had if the bureaucrats and politicians had not stuck 
their noses in where they were not needed and let the people of 
Atlantic Canada run their industry, make the choices that needed 
to be made and not have it run from Ottawa.
<P>
	What kind of fishery would we have had if we had put our 
faith in Atlantic Canadians, if we had depended on their 
ingenuity, their hard work, their creativity, their productivity 
and their competitive instincts? What kind of east coast fishery 
would we have had if we had relied on free markets, free 
enterprise and the entrepreneurial talent of Atlantic Canadians?
<P>
	The free market and free enterprise system could not have 
done worse than what the government has done in this case. 
Reformers believe that the bureaucrats and politicians have had 
their chance. They have messed things up big time. I believe it is 
time to give easterners a chance to prove themselves. Let us use 
this fisheries crisis to rethink the way we have been doing 
business. Let us give Atlantic Canadians the freedom they need 
to restructure the east coast fishery the way they think it needs to 
be done, not the way some experts in Ottawa think it needs to be 
done.
<P>
	Instead of more government let us demand less government. 
Instead of higher taxes let us demand lower taxes. Reformers 
would rather see the future of the east coast fishery in the hands 
of Atlantic Canadians than in the hands of government 
bureaucrats. Reformers trust Atlantic Canadians to make 
decisions that are in the best interests of the fishery, their 
families, their communities,  their provinces and Atlantic 
Canada. We trust those people.
<P>
	Finally, if Atlantic Canadians are given this freedom they will 
revitalize the east coast fishery. It will be good for the entire 
Canadian economy.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Reformers look forward to working with Atlantic Canadians 
in the years ahead to transform all four Atlantic provinces from 
have not provinces to have provinces. The Reform's approach is 
very different from that of the Liberals with regard to this 
strategy.
<P>
	I would like to make one more comment as I close. 
Meaningful work enhances the quality of life. We are telling 
these people through this older worker fish plant adjustment 
program to go. They are 50 years old, in the prime of life, and 
will be given a cheque every month. This is unacceptable. We 
cannot go along with it.
<P>
	The basic philosophy of the Reform Party is very different 
from that of the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak at the end of this session on Bill C-30, the purpose of 
which is to allow workers in the fishing industry to take early 
retirement, at age 50. We want to say from the outset that the 
Bloc québécois will support this government initiative, for the 
following reasons.
<P>
	When you come from a maritime region made up of very 
small communities, you see that there is no economic diversity 
at present. What is a 50-year old man or woman who is asked to 
go back to school supposed to do? Many of us realize that going 
back to school is very hard. The most painful thing for these 
workers we are discussing today is that going back to school for 
a period of two or three or five years, and then rejoining the 
labour force, is still pretty dicey. The point is not that these 
persons will be unable to work-I would be the first to hire 
them-but we must be realistic and work with the present 
economic conditions in the regions of Canada. The jobs are not 
there.
<P>
	If I take my constituency as an example, the unemployment 
rate is 27 per cent. I have already said so, but at the end of this 
session I may take the liberty of sending that message again to 
the government side. An unemployment rate of 27 per cent, an 
activity rate of 42 per cent, means that four persons out of 10 
who are old enough to work are looking for a job or are working. 
And that means there are six persons out of 10 who are not 
working.
<P>
	In my constituency, the unemployment rate is 27 per cent. If I 
try to draw a parallel with the rate in Quebec, that province as a 
whole has an activity rate of 62 per cent; there is a 20-point 
spread. If, in order to compare the constituency of Gaspé with 
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5561"> 5561 </A></B>
<P>
the province of Quebec, I add that 20 per cent to the 
unemployment rate for Gaspé, I get 47 per cent, or nearly 50 per 
cent.
<P>
	These figures can be found in many maritime communities. 
That is what has forced me to have discussions with my 
colleagues and reach the following conclusion: I, too, would 
like to be able to say, like the members of the Reform Party, that 
it is against my principles to hand out money, but we must face 
the facts: jobs are scarce.
<P>
	For the enlightenment of the Reform Party, I will raise two 
points. Mr. Félix Leclerc, speaking about the unemployed and 
about paying people not to work, said, ``It would kill them''.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Yes, in our Quebec culture, we, too, have self-righteous 
people telling us that everyone old enough to work should pitch 
in. But the situation, this year and for the next few years, is not 
conducive to that philosophy.
<P>
	The other small point I would like to make to my Reform 
colleagues is that I was a little surprised-but pleasantly 
surprised-to see that they would allow fisheries management 
by Maritimers themselves. I think the heart of the problem lies 
there.
<P>
	I think that, if the people of the Maritime provinces had been 
responsible for managing or allocating their resource, we would 
not have the same problem we have today. I can say from having 
worked on the standing committee on fisheries that the 
witnesses we heard reflected that thinking. People want a part in 
decisions. They are the ones who experience the day to day 
problems, and very often there are local solutions to a local 
problem. Ottawa is a long way from Gaspé. Ottawa is a very long 
way from Newfoundland. How far? Six hours by plane from 
Newfoundland, and four and a half hours from my constituency. 
And it is even longer by car: remember that people in fishing 
communities cannot afford airfare.
<P>
	If management were given back to the regions, things would 
be very different. But before people take sides on that idea, I 
would just like to say that it will not lead to any big 
constitutional squabbles about whether most fish stocks in the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Atlantic come under individual 
quotas. The Government of Canada-since everyone is still 
Canadian for the moment-has already given responsibility for 
some of those quotas to the fishermen.
<P>
	I know that there are members of this House who do not share 
my opinion, but I want to pursue this idea to its conclusion 
nonetheless.
<P>
	I was saying, then, that in the Gulf of St. Lawrence 80 per cent 
of stocks come under individual quotas. Based on that fact, the 
remaining 20 per cent of fish stocks are allocated to inshore 
fishermen. If we had listened to the inshore fishermen long ago, 
we would not have had the problems we now have, because the 
inshore fishermen were the first ones who could not catch their 
share of Canada's quota. It may have been five years since they 
were last able to catch their share.
<P>
	Using these figures, it may be easy to divide up the remaining 
quotas, on paper, for the time when the fishery reopens, 
provided we do not get greedy try to take more than our share. 
That is a suggestion I have for the government, that each fishing 
quota be further divided into individual quotas. After that, if all 
members here agree, we could whisper this suggestion loudly in 
the ear of the Minister of Fisheries.
<P>
	Later, and this is the most difficult thing to manage, the total 
allowable catches will have to be determined jointly by the 
provinces and Ottawa or, if Quebec becomes sovereign, by 
Quebec and Ottawa within NAFO. These organizations need not 
be reinvented since they already exist. We would simply use the 
tools available.
<P>
	We have not yet reached the sovereignty stage, however. I 
therefore suggest that Ottawa work in co-operation with the 
provinces to define the total allowable catch.
<P>
	You would thus have Newfoundlanders stating theirs views 
concerning their own coasts, views that might be different from 
those along the gulf. Take, for example, the Gaspé area, which 
lies at the very end of the Gulf and where most of the fish caught 
are migratory. These fish will swim along the coast of 
Newfoundland before coming to Gaspé. The same goes for the 
southern part of the gulf. From Cape Breton, the fish will go up 
the coast to Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick before 
ending up off the Gaspé coast.
<P>
	We have to act jointly so that everyone will understand the 
migratory movements of these fish. I find it extremely 
important that this point was raised by Reform members.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	I have already expressed this view on other occasions. I know 
that the Premier of Newfoundland and I disagree sharply as well 
on the future of Quebec and Canada. However, I believe the 
Newfoundland premier's position is not that far off from the one 
I took during the election campaign. It is a position my Reform 
colleagues are now beginning to agree with. The Premier of 
Newfoundland spoke of setting up a committee in the province 
to set TACs and to divide up resources.
<P>
	Where I disagree with him, however, is on the contention that 
a province should be allowed to set its own quotas, because 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5562"> 5562 </A></B>
<P>
provinces share the same waters. When our TAC percentage is 
set before we sit down at the table, all that is left for us to do is to 
manage the  resource properly. Provincial officials then go home 
and issue the licences needed to meet their quota, because each 
province has its own fleet. The provinces finance the fleets as 
well as the processing plants. This connection is very important.
<P>
	Why am I speaking about this today in relation to Bill C-30 
which provides for early retirement at 50 years of age? I always 
believed that wisdom would come with age. It galls me to have 
to support this measure but I want history to remember this so 
that these fishery workers will not have to pay twice for the 
administrative mistakes of the federal government.
<P>
	Other points could also be mentioned. My colleagues raised a 
number of them at second reading. I would, however, like to 
emphasize one thing again at this time, namely that 
administrative rules should not prevent those taking early 
retirement from benefiting from economic initiatives. In time, 
some of the early retirees may decide they want to embark on a 
second career and they should not be prevented from doing so. 
Once they are back up to speed, they will be filing tax returns 
and the state will come out even on the deal, as they say. At this 
point in time, however, it is important that this bill be passed so 
as to ensure that these individuals, whether they live in Quebec, 
New Brunswick or Newfoundland, have food to put on the table.
<P>
	Another concern of mine was-I asked questions to certain 
senior officials last week and put the question to the minister; 
perhaps we can get an official answer-will fishermen also be 
eligible under the same act? I have here a document which says 
that in the spirit of the existing legislation and the spirit of the 
fisheries recovery legislation-I do not remember the exact 
phraseology-fishermen would indeed become eligible for this 
pre-retirement plan when they turn 50. But I have not received a 
clear and firm answer on that. Yet, as one of our colleagues from 
the Reform Party pointed out at second reading, the Auditor 
General of Canada stated in his report that the government has to 
put a specific motion to the House before it can introduce such 
bills or authorize such public expenditures.
<P>
	I have, on the one hand, the advice of the auditor general and, 
on the other hand, that of senior officials. First, I would like to 
comment on the bill as it now reads and second, I would like the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans to administer its own 
pre-retirement program for fishermen.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	I wanted to look at the next problem from this perspective. 
Much remains to be done. As far as the industry rationalization 
boards are concerned, some steps were taken but they have not 
been set up yet and we do not know what their membership will 
be. Why bring this up? Because establishing pre-retirement 
programs for fishermen will require extensive discussions with 
the provinces. As I said earlier, fishing boats were subsidized by 
the provinces.
<P>
	How can we reconcile on the one hand, Ottawa giving 
fishermen a pre-retirement allowance and on the other hand, the 
province refusing to forgive the debt on boats? That would not 
make any sense. Again, how much of the $1.9 billion the 
minister has made available will be spent on pre-retirement 
programs? I do not want to see one single dollar of this money go 
to waste. I hope that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans will 
come to an agreement with his provincial counterparts on this 
subject.
<P>
	Failing which I would suggest that the resource envelope 
allocated to this measure be handed over to the province so that 
it can make appropriate arrangements. These are the general 
points I wanted to raise. Much was said about the high costs 
associated with this pre-retirement program and with the loss of 
expertise, but we did not hear much at all from the government, 
about ideas for the fisheries of the future.
<P>
	Let us hear about it. This represents a $1.9 billion investment. 
I want to be sure we do not end up no further ahead after 
spending this kind of money. When he presented his program, 
the minister gave us the impression that we would have a better 
idea of the situation after six weeks of consultations. I do not 
have the date handy, but these six weeks must be almost up. We 
are coming to the end of the parliamentary session. Should I 
conclude that there will not be any new developments on these 
issues before the fall?
<P>
	I think it would have been a good sign for the minister to issue 
guidelines before the end of the parliamentary session, in order 
to guide industry and continue discussions during the summer. If 
we wait until the fall, we should decide quickly what to do with 
fishermen. The minister's program deals with community and 
environmental projects-the expression ``green projects'' is 
used-but I want to remind you that it is difficult to work on the 
environment in late October. We should make plans right away 
to ensure that something will be put forward this summer.
<P>
	Future involves other things as well. What industrial structure 
do we want to set up? Quebec and Canada were discovered 
because of our resources, namely fish or cod to be more precise. 
We exploited this resource in a traditional fashion. The first 
effective way to preserve fish was to salt and dry it. We still do 
it, but it has become a special product. There are other species of 
fish. When freezers arrived on the scene, as I mentioned, we 
produced frozen cod blocks, but there are still other species we 
have not exploited.
<P>
	The current market trend is fresh fish. It is therefore necessary 
to handle smaller volumes of fish but consumers are willing to 
pay a little more in return.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5563"> 5563 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	My wish is that, during moratorium years, we could establish 
a system to try to optimize catches for each species-we would, 
of course, only keep mature fish to avoid depleting other stocks 
and repeating the mistakes we may have made with cod-in 
order to commercialize these species.
<P>
	That is something we heard a lot of under the former 
Conservative government. Why did it not work? Because tools 
were missing and it was too marginal, we were told. But now, 
regarding the few cod stocks still open in Canadian zones, I can 
tell you that dogfish catches may be as large if not larger than 
current cod catches in the other zones that remain open.
<P>
	The missing tool is a hopper on the wharf, so that fishermen 
can converge on a site. This hopper will allow us to concentrate 
on certain species, so that there will be enough to make people 
take notice. I call them ``unloading areas''. There are some in 
Europe. Of course, in certain places, it also led to a 
concentration of ships.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the coastal villages around these landing sites 
are not closed, except that the fish is landed somewhere and the 
nearby plant, which wants to have the product, can process it. 
For this, the fish must be kept cold. But we can do all that now, 
since we have skilled workers who are especially eager to work 
because working is also an honour.
<P>
	People now collecting a cheque at home would really like to 
do something constructive and know that the dry period they are 
going through will end. There must be light at the end of the 
tunnel. They do not have any now. Something important to have 
would be landing areas.
<P>
	In addition to that is what I proposed, a provincial hub for 
marketing these resources. There is a way to do that as well. 
These are things that must be done. Some supporting figures-I 
see some hon. members from Nova Scotia watching us-a 
manager of a Nova Scotia company told me once: ``Yvan, 20 per 
cent of the fresh fish we land account for 40 per cent of our 
profits.''
<P>
	It is easy to extrapolate from that. I realize that it takes a 
certain volume, but I would really like this idea to be used. 
Maybe the government opposite can change it a little, because if 
the suggestion comes from an opposition member, sometimes it 
is not considered good, but I would remind them that I did not 
hesitate to support Bill C-30, as I did not hesitate to support the 
bill on overfishing. So, as a demonstration of good faith, I think 
that the Bloc is here to promote sound management, but not to 
hide its political orientation.
<P>
	But when we look at disorders and problems such as we see 
here today, I think that I can set aside my partisanship for the 
sake of good fishery management. I wanted to add a few words 
on how workers could benefit from this aid.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to be sure that every worker in the fishing industry is 
well represented under this new agreement. I hope they will 
have union representation and some provincial agreements 
because I want to be sure that workers will not be less 
themselves in front of the big machine of Ottawa. That is what I 
want to add on that.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In closing, I want to make a wish: I hope that these industry 
workers will meet the challenge now. May they now be assured 
of subsistence through a financial allowance for early 
retirement and may they get down to work to earn a little extra 
for making ends meet. I would ask them to work with their 
communities and call on everyone to do his bit so that in five 
years, there will be something else, always keeping in mind that 
the fisheries might recover, but analyzing what can be done 
about it now.
<P>
	I would like to leave you with these remarks, Madam Speaker, 
and remind you that the Bloc Quebecois will support Bill C-30 
and hope that the government will consider past federal 
mismanagement and what people in the provinces and the 
maritime communities are saying so that we never have to relive 
what we are going through.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to participate this morning in the 
debate, at third reading, of Bill C-30, and I am also pleased to 
see that the hon. member for Gaspé gave his party's support to 
this very important legislation for the workers of the Atlantic 
fishing industry.
<P>
	I listened with great interest to the comments and suggestions 
made by the hon. member to rebuild an industry which is so vital 
to many communities on the East coast. I find the hon. member's 
approach to be very interesting and fruitful in many respects. 
Our government thinks that the time has come to rebuild this 
industry and, in fact, this is the objective of the adjustment 
program announced on May 15 by the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans and the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
The purpose of that initiative is to help displaced workers and 
those who have been left without jobs following the crisis in that 
industry. The program is aimed at giving individuals and 
communities a chance to rebuild their lives, and to rebuild that 
industry on a more solid foundation than in the past.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-30 is part of the government's strategy for helping the 
workers that have been laid off and unemployed by the crisis in 
the Atlantic fishery to adjust to the situation. We have to 
consider the horrendously difficult circumstance in which many 
fish plant workers find themselves, particularly older fish plant 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5564"> 5564 </A></B>
<P>
workers.  Through absolutely no fault of their own, many older 
workers are out of a job and their prospects are slim to none for 
getting another one. This is the problem that Bill C-30 
addresses. Canadians want us to show compassion for these 
individuals. We are showing compassion. We are bring in 
positive measures to address this unprecedented crisis. The 
government is approaching this problem through a component 
of the Atlantic groundfish strategy which will involve income 
support for older workers. It is a program that will be negotiated, 
financed and implemented with the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	However there are some workers who cannot be helped under 
the current legislation. I am referring to those workers who are 
under the age of 55, who were at least 50 years of age on May 15 
of this year and who are eligible to participate in the Atlantic 
groundfish strategy. They do not qualify for older worker 
adjustment assistance under current legislation. That is the 
reason why Bill C-30 is so important, it addresses their plight.
<P>
	Hon. members have given valuable input to this legislation. 
Last week Bill C-30 was studied by the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development. The committee gave careful 
consideration to the issues raised by hon. members opposite. For 
the benefit of the House I would like to address some of those 
concerns.
<P>
	There is always justifiable apprehension that with a new 
program, tax dollars earned through the sweat of Canadian 
workers are going to end up in the pockets of people who do not 
qualify for the program. I can assure my hon. colleagues that 
will not happen with this program. To be eligible for benefits 
first an individual must be determined eligible under TAGS; the 
individual must be a fish plant worker or a trawler person; he or 
she must have a long term attachment to the groundfish 
industry; the person has to be out of a job because of a permanent 
reduction of the workforce at the fish plant and that permanent 
reduction has to be the result of a decline in fish stocks.
<P>
	So that this is absolutely clear, the only people we are talking 
about here are older fish plant workers, including trawler 
persons. All told we estimate that involves about 1,200 men and 
women. Of that number about 700 will have reached the age of 
55 during their entitlement period under TAGS by May 16 of this 
year when the Atlantic groundfish strategy came into effect.
<P>
	We estimate there will be an additional 500 workers who 
would reach the age of 55 during their entitlement under TAGS. 
It is those 500 dedicated men and women that the passage of Bill 
C-30 is designed to help.
<P>
	Some members have said that if we are going to help older 
workers who happen to be out of a job because of fish plants 
closing, then should we not also help older workers who have 
lost their jobs because of restructuring in other industries? That 
analogy does not hold here. The groundfish industry is not just 
one of many industries in  Atlantic Canada, it is its lifeblood, 
and in those communities which are dependent on the fishery 
there really is no alternative source of employment for older 
workers.
<P>
	The demise of this industry will lead to the demise of entire 
communities unless we help these hard working men and women 
deal with the crisis. Simply put, there are few options available 
to older workers in this situation.
<P>
	Yet there is a legitimate question about the ramifications of 
the decline in the groundfish industry for the rest of the Atlantic 
economy. I am sure that hon. members realize that these 
adjustments do not take place in a vacuum. There is a domino 
effect that spreads throughout the entire Atlantic seaboard. In 
Newfoundland alone there are some 1,300 communities affected 
by the groundfish industry. Of that number, 800 depend solely 
on economic activity from groundfish. The government would 
be remiss not to take this into account. We are taking it into 
account.
<P>
	Hon. members will recall that the budget provided $800 
million for the strategic initiatives program. Projects under this 
program will be funded on a 50:50 basis with the provinces and 
territories. They will explore innovative approaches to training 
and getting people back to work. In Atlantic Canada the program 
will complement TAGS by helping men and women who are not 
directly employed by the fishery.
<P>
	Since the major downturn in the fishery has taken place in 
Newfoundland, that province will be the first to receive 
assistance under the strategic initiatives program.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	Last Thursday the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, along with the minister of fisheries of the 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador and ministers from 
the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador announced 
funding of $20 million for projects in Newfoundland under the 
strategic initiatives program.
<P>
	I realize that this debate on Bill C-30 is not the place for 
details of strategic initiatives but I can tell the House that these 
projects will provide financial incentive to encourage students 
to stay in school. They will help recent graduates to find jobs 
and they will encourage entrepreneurship outside the fishery.
<P>
	The funds will also provide employment and training 
opportunities for unemployed and underemployed individuals 
on social assistance or at risk of moving on to social assistance. 
It is a partnership, co-operation among all levels of 
government, the private sector and community organizations to 
ensure that programs such as TAGS and the strategic initiatives 
address the 
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5565"> 5565 </A></B>
<P>
entire economic picture in a way that will help to revitalize the 
Atlantic economy.
<P>
	Some hon. members have expressed concern that this income 
assistance program will duplicate the general social assistance 
programs. Let me assure them that this is not so. This is a 
program that addresses specific individuals who meet specific 
criteria within a specific age group. General social assistance 
programs apply to all citizens and have very different criteria.
<P>
	As well, this program will not be a disincentive to seek work 
because it is only one part of a broad range of options under 
TAGS to help fish plant workers adjust to these drastic changes 
taking place in their lives. Older workers will be able to 
participate in the other components under TAGS such as green 
projects, self-employment assistance, and community 
opportunity pools and others.
<P>
	At a federal level TAGS is a joint initiative of human resource 
development and fisheries and oceans. The two departments are 
working closely together to implement this program for the 
benefit of the greatest number of workers affected by the demise 
of the groundfish industry. Fisheries and oceans is currently 
consulting with its partners to develop a similar income support 
program for fishers who would qualify.
<P>
	An hon. member inquired when the program will start and 
how long it will last. TAGS came into effect May 16 and eligible 
workers are entitled to labour adjustment measures and income 
assistance for a period between two to five years, depending 
upon their attachment to the groundfish industry.
<P>
	The provisions made available under Bill C-30 to assist older 
workers will provide a dignified exit to those unemployed fish 
plant workers in my riding and elsewhere in Atlantic Canada 
who, having reached the age of 50, know full well that there are 
no reasonable opportunities for employment in their 
communities for them and the only alternative course once their 
unemployment insurance expires would have been social 
assistance. This program gives those workers a form of early 
retirement.
<P>
	In the meantime it will allow the industry to be rebuilt with 
the younger people who are coming behind them. At the same 
time it will provide them with an opportunity to have a dignified 
exit and to be able to deal with the consequences of this crisis 
without the additional burden of loss of income and the need in 
some cases to leave their communities where all of their assets 
are located.
<P>
	In closing I encourage hon. members to consider the 
tremendous hardships being faced by these older fish plant 
workers and to support Bill C-30 so that the government can 
give them the assistance they very much deserve during this 
severe crisis in their lives.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> Madam Speaker, at second 
reading of this bill the member opposite who followed me said 
that he was surprised that there was not unanimous consent for 
the bill. At the time I was not surprised at his comment because 
it seemed to me that the government solution for dealing with 
this crisis has simply been to throw more money at the problem. 
It has not dealt with the core of the problem which is fewer 
opportunities or lack of opportunities and alternate employment 
in eastern Canada. That really is the core of the problem.
<P>
	The solution that the government has proposed simply creates 
a dependency rather than independence among people in eastern 
Canada. It destroys families rather than saving them. It does not 
address the needs of Atlantic Canadians in so far as it is a 
band-aid for a gaping wound. What is needed in Atlantic Canada 
are jobs, jobs, jobs. Economic diversification is the only way to 
answer that need.
<P>
	The government solution it seems has been to create a need 
for early retirement. That early retirement package has many 
things wrong with it. It is destructive to the social fabric. We are 
saying to unemployed workers in eastern Canada: ``Here is $750 
or $1,000 a month. Take the money, go away and don't bother 
us''. It is saying that you as the breadwinner for your family will 
not be able to provide so the government will provide. The 
children who are left at home view their father or their mother, 
the wage earner, simply as someone who goes to the post office 
once a month to pick up the cheque, not as someone who is 
contributing. That is not helpful to the family and it is not 
helpful to us as a nation to create that sort of dependency in one 
region of the country.
<P>
	Another problem that the government does not seem to be 
able to face is the problem that it must in fact encourage 
development in Atlantic Canada. I find very curious for example 
the spending of millions of dollars to keep the port of Montreal 
open year round in an attempt to make it a year-round port when 
in fact we have year-round ports in eastern Canada in Halifax 
and Saint John which could do very well with the business.
<P>
	We have rail lines that are withering in eastern Canada 
because there is a lack of use, yet those rail lines and the 
employment that goes with them could be part of the resurgence 
of the economy of eastern Canada. Somehow we got it mixed up 
and think that we have to spend this money to keep one port open 
while at least two others die. All that does is add to the cost, adds 
to the tax burden and makes it much more difficult for 
businessmen across this nation to stay in business.
<P>
	At second reading I raised the issue of a need for clear 
legislative authority for all parts of the TAGS program. I 
appreciate that the auditor general and the public accounts 
committee have already given some consideration to those parts 
of TAGS coming under the  authority of the Department of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5566"> 5566 </A></B>
<P>
Human Resources Development. Bill C-30 responds to one of 
the recommendations of the Auditor General in his last report to 
Parliament when he considered the previous Atlantic groundfish 
strategy:
<P>
	``The government implemented a program for which in our 
view no clear satisfactory authority had existed. At no time did 
it go to Parliament to seek proper substantive authority for its 
actions. Parliament was thereby denied the proper opportunity 
to review and debate the government's proposed program as part 
of the normal legislative process, to decide on its objectives and 
to approve expenditures to achieve those objectives''.
<P>
	The auditor general wisely went on to caution that if action 
were not taken the same thing might happen with a successor 
program: ``The government should present to Parliament 
legislation that will provide the proper authority for this 
program and any future program of a similar nature''.
<P>
	The minister of human resources is to be congratulated for the 
introduction of Bill C-30 as was recommended by the auditor 
general, but where is the rest of the TAGS legislation? Bill C-30 
is a minor bit of housekeeping legislation. It does not give the 
opportunity to debate the program's objectives.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	Again on third reading I ask the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans to lay before Parliament a bill to provide legislative 
authority for those parts of TAGS that DFO is delivering. DFO 
will be attempting to retire fishermen, their licences and to 
create industrial renewal boards.
<P>
	This part of the TAGS program or what some call Tobin's 
Atlantic groundfish strategy is without legislative authority. I 
call on the government to bring in the remainder of the required 
legislative authority.
<P>
	We are told that the minister intends to use the Atlantic 
Fisheries Restructuring Act as his authority. The Auditor 
General has already ruled that the Atlantic Groundfish 
Restructuring Act is not adequate legislative authority. That act, 
the Auditor General noted, was passed in the mid-1980s to 
permit the then Liberal fisheries ministers to implement the 
Kirby commission's recommendations.
<P>
	It is worth remembering that the Kirby report and the Atlantic 
Fisheries Restructuring Act were founded on the expectation of 
a doubling of the groundfish harvest. The Kirby report saw the 
problem of the fishery as one of finding ways to market the 
growing supply of fish, the oversupply and not the lack of fish.
<P>
	The Tobin strategy expects to reduce the capacity by 50 per 
cent. The underlying assumptions of TAGS and the Atlantic 
Fisheries Restructuring Act are incompatible. The Kirby report 
said that one of the bright spots in the fishery was: ``The outlook 
for the harvest is that by 1987 the cod catch should be more than  
triple the 1976 harvest. The total groundfish catch will have 
more than doubled''.
<P>
	The act expanded the catch potential and the fish were caught. 
Now there are none. Liberal governments and their bureaucratic 
advisers somehow have changed very little in the intervening 
years. Let us be done with any talk of using the Atlantic 
Fisheries Restructuring Act to deliver any part of TAGS.
<P>
	Again, I call on the government to bring into this House a 
comprehensive bill that would outline its objectives and that 
would give it the necessary authority to carry out the needed 
changes to the Atlantic groundfish fishery.
<P>
	Earlier this month when the public accounts committee was 
again considering the auditor general's report on the previous 
Atlantic groundfish strategy, the chair of the fisheries 
committee, sitting as a member of the public accounts 
committee, allowed that the previous Parliament and in 
particular the Liberal opposition had acquiesced and never 
demanded legislation.
<P>
	He equated the failure of the opposition Liberals to speak up 
as a kind of parliamentary approval by the opposition of what 
the government of the day was doing. He said: ``I was a member 
of the opposition when this program came in and I do not recall 
anybody on my side saying that they have usurped the authority 
of Parliament. We did not raise those alarms. The reality is that 
by our lack of action, we agreed''.
<P>
	It seems the Liberals, whether in government or in opposition, 
have the same respect for the need of parliamentary legislative 
authority for these Atlantic groundfish strategies, a need that the 
Auditor General has already addressed. Let it not be said in 
some future Parliament that no one in the opposition in this 
Parliament failed to request legislation.
<P>
	Dwindling stocks caused in part by a failure to manage the 
fishery created the need for TAGS, turning a blind eye to and 
even promoting overfishing by Canadians within the 200 mile 
limit and by foreigners outside it. It is sadly appropriate that the 
overfishing that followed the Kirby report and the Atlantic 
Fisheries Restructuring Act must be addressed by another set of 
Liberal ministers.
<P>
	Today's Liberal ministers are better at shooting missiles over 
the horizon at so-called pirate boats from third world nations 
than maintaining effective surveillance and enforcement 
programs within our 200-mile limit.
<P>
	When the government is spending some $2 billion on TAGS 
due to this failure to manage and protect the fish stock we have 
the minister of fisheries and the chairman of the fisheries 
committee rallying to protect recent government misadventures 
with the fisheries observer program in the Scotia-Fundy region.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5567"> 5567 </A></B>
<P>
	In the letting of the observer contract earlier this year for the 
Scotia-Fundy region, fisheries officials in Halifax did not even 
follow the basic rules of tendering. The tender requirements 
were manipulated to give the contract to a company that had no 
experience with foreign vessels in the offshore.
<P>
	The winning company has been allowed to use observers 
without the necessary experience on certification, all that the 
tender documents required. There has already been overfishing 
as a result. There have been published reports in sector 3-O of 
vessels without observers that were catching undersized fish and 
dumping the unwanted fish at sea.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	There have been problems with the Cuban vessels in the silver 
hake fishery, vessels that by law must have certified observers. 
The Cubans have fished in Canadian waters this year without 
experienced observers on board as a result of the new contract.
<P>
	This makes a mockery of what TAGS is all about. Again, I 
pick up on the words of the chairman of the fisheries committee 
recently when he was at public accounts: ``This opposition 
member does not intend to acquiesce to the demands of 
government on the observer contract''. A mistake was made and 
I call on the government in the name of fisheries protection to 
act. The fisheries committee has studied the letting of the 
observer contract and has undertaken to prepare a report for the 
minister outlining the inadequacies in the letting of that contract 
and the problems caused as a result.
<P>
	The report prepared by the fisheries committee and given to 
me last Wednesday by the committee clerk speaks volumes in 
the priority this government places on fisheries protection. The 
report rather than censuring officials for the letting of the 
contract called on the government to make the observers into 
public servants.
<P>
	The fundamental problem given in testimony before the 
committee was a seriously flawed tendering process. Rather 
than dealing with this flawed tendering process and the contract 
brought into existence, the chairman's report unfortunately 
states that members of Parliament were obliged to accept the 
opposed view that everything was completely above board and 
goes on to state: ``we appear to have little choice but to accept 
this interpretation at least in the narrow legalistic sense''.
<P>
	Nowhere were the flaws of the tendering processed outlined. 
The committee never did receive the legal opinion it requested 
from the minister even though the minister made an undertaking 
to give it to committee.
<P>
	Why would the chairman state that DFO's testimony was 
plagued by confusing and contradictory statements and that they 
were not convincing, yet find the committee had little choice but 
to accept the contract as awarded?
<P>
	Two of the bidders acted on the best information available on 
past practice and on the tender documents. Unfortunately the 
requirements for certified and experienced observers were not 
followed in the award of the contract nor were the time line 
requirements for the submission of lists of qualified observers.
<P>
	If the winning bidder does not have to follow the basic 
requirements of the request for proposal in bid set up dates from 
DSS the award of the contract is fundamentally flawed. Not 
surprisingly, we have inexperienced observers now at sea as a 
result of this contract award.
<P>
	The report does not address the real problems. The 
requirements of the request for proposal and bid set up dates 
were not followed. They were intentionally ignored so as to 
break the observers union. The company most likely to continue 
to engage in unionized observers was treated the most harshly in 
the tender evaluation. The president and general manager of the 
winning company has refused to meet with the president of the 
observers union. In a published letter he states: ``We see no use 
in meeting with you at this time. Simply put Mr. Siddall, I do not 
trust you and you are too late. I will not stand idly by as the 
Minister of Fisheries and his officials engage in thinly disguised 
union busting actions against a small independent union''. I will 
not as a member of the fisheries committee participate in the 
whitewash of this action.
<P>
	The chairman's recommendations reflect either an attempt to 
cover up the problem or a failure to understand it. One bid set up 
date placed in evidence before the committee indicated when the 
list of 30 certified observers was to be submitted DFO chose a 
later date. The department did not require the winning bidder to 
submit the list of 30 names to beat the basic certification and 
experience required in the tender documents.
<P>
	Testimony before a committee of DFO officials 
acknowledged that a substantial number from the list by Biorex 
had to be retested before they could be certified in any region. 
The reasoning behind the requirement to submit a list of 30 
certified and experienced observers by April 5 was to have the 
winning bidder use the bulk of existing Scotia-Fundy certified 
observers, thereby guaranteeing continuity and experience in 
the program. When these basic requirements were ignored the 
process largely broke down. We ended up with the bulk of the 
observers not having the requisite experience and certification.
<P>
	The tender process, the Scotia-Fundy observer program and 
the government's ability to protect our fish stocks were 
compromised. The strength of the observer program is in the 
knowledge and experience of its members. A recent fisheries 
journal article on the American observer program makes the 
same finding:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>About half of the first time observers never repeat a trip- Much of the data collected 
by first time observers is error ridden  and takes weeks to correct on their return. Some 
of it is unusable. But as observers gain experience they evolve into professional field 
technicians who know fish and the way around a deck.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5568"> 5568 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	I would ask that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans take 
swift action to ensure that experienced observers are at sea in the 
Scotia-Fundy, observers who are employed by a contractor who 
has received the contract by following the rules, the rules that 
everyone else was required to play by.
<P>
	I am concerned for not only the Scotia-Fundy observers, the 
fundamental element in the observer program, experienced 
observers who have been tossed aside because they happen to 
belong to a small, independent union, but also for the observer 
program itself, which is Canada's first line of defence against 
foreign overfishing and probably the cheapest and most accurate 
source of abundant, scientific data available.
<P>
	I would recommend the minister strengthen enforcement and 
enhance coverage levels to effectively conserve fish stocks so 
we may never need another TAGS program. In speaking to 
second reading of this bill, I noted that we on this side of the 
House envision an east coast fishery that is viable, 
self-sufficient and sustainable.
<P>
	We believe that the fishery can and should be a cornerstone of 
a more diversified economy in Atlantic Canada. We are 
confident that Atlantic Canadians can compete in a world 
economy. The government would have Atlantic Canadians 
living dependent on government handouts in a constant state of 
instability.
<P>
	It is a desire of reform members to encourage the 
implementation of a comprehensive program of change which 
would see the people of Atlantic Canada not only working but 
working in an environment that is both profitable and satisfying.
<P>
	I wish that we had seen the last of this type of program, the 
type of program we are debating today. Unfortunately I fear for 
the worst. I think we all want to see a more prosperous Atlantic 
Canada. If the government would introduce a comprehensive 
bill which would deal with the restructuring of the economy of 
Atlantic Canada rather than the band-aid solution it has 
provided to date, we would all do better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to talk about the government's response to 
one of the most important challenges facing the Canadian 
government at the present time. I am referring specifically to the 
unemployment crisis in eastern Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-30 is an attempt to deal with this crisis. In every 
respect this piece of legislation falls terribly short of this goal. 
At the present time there are 192,000 unemployed in the four 
eastern provinces.
<P>
	Provincial unemployment rates range from 13 per cent to 21 
per cent. Obviously measures should be introduced to ensure the 
long term viability of the most economically depressed regions 
of Canada. The question remains why does the government 
continue to pursue this course of action?
<P>
	It was mismanagement of fishery resources by past 
governments which resulted in the economic crisis that Atlantic 
Canadians are paying for today. Many of the people affected by 
this crisis have worked at plants for their entire careers. They 
were capable enough to hold these jobs.
<P>
	Now, thanks to government short sightedness and poor 
management, they have seen their source of income all but 
disappear. However, the solution proposed by Bill C-30 is in my 
opinion just as short sighted and poorly managed. This program 
proposes to reduce the technical level of unemployment in 
Atlantic Canada, not by strengthening the economy or 
promoting job creation but by encouraging people to drop out of 
the workforce.
<P>
	Is this the government's agenda for reducing unemployment? 
The Reform Party would prefer to see a vigorous plan for the 
revitalization of Atlantic Canada. Perhaps this is what we should 
be debating here today. An interesting aspect of this program is 
the way in which it will be administered.
<P>
	The government plans to purchase annuities for each of the 
affected individuals. As most members present will know, an 
annuity is created when you invest in an asset which will provide 
you with a future stream of earnings. In this case the government 
asset will be in the form of a bond.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Like most Canadians the Reform Party prefers to consider the 
individual as the asset. An individual invests in himself through 
training, whether it be formal schooling, on the job training or 
years of experience. The return comes in the form of a stream of 
pay cheques from a job, not government handouts. In addition, 
when we invest in ourselves we gain a sense of achievement and 
self-worth. We gain it from earning the money that we receive 
and converting our effort into tangible goods and services for 
ourselves and for our families.
<P>
	This program provides neither a sense of achievement nor the 
satisfaction of accomplishment for those it is supposed to help. 
The long term impact of this decision is to create a cycle of 
dependency for the very recipients it is supposed to help. The 
workers being targeted by this program are in a period of their 
lives when planning for their retirement is most crucial. The 
recipients are to be between the ages of 50 and 65. At this age the 
children of many of these parents are leaving home, relieving 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5569"> 5569 </A></B>
<P>
their parents of financial obligations. Individuals in this age 
bracket are typically earning the highest income of their lives.
<P>
	The obvious impact of higher earnings combined with reduced expenses is increased savings. People between the ages of 50 and 65 contribute to RRSPs and pay down their mortgages. In addition, higher income earners pay higher Canada pension plan rates whic
<P>
	According to the most recent taxation statistics available, 
Canadians between the ages of 50 and 64 contribute $23.49 more 
than the average tax filer to CPP; $113.25 more to registered 
pension plans and $571.06 more to RRSPs. What this means is 
that Canadians between the ages of 50 and 65 contribute over 
$700 more per year toward their retirement, or 54 per cent more 
than the average taxpayer.
<P>
	By removing these able bodied individuals from the 
workforce the government is sentencing these Canadians to a 
subsistence living made up of this annuity and welfare for the 
next few years. This will offer these Canadians only a 
subsistence living in their post-65 retirement years, comprised 
of guaranteed income supplement and old age security program 
payments. These people are going to be tomorrow's poor seniors 
and the government is doing nothing which would prevent this.
<P>
	We have to ask what can be done to bring about economic 
prosperity for regionally depressed areas of Atlantic Canada. 
There are numerous measures the government could take to 
achieve this. One such measure is a plan for real deficit 
reduction and tax relief for Canadians. Eliminate marginal or 
useless government spending. Put money back into the hands of 
Canadians by not taking it out of their hands in the first place.
<P>
	In many of the poorer provinces we have seen how a 
government downturn leads to more government spending and 
then to increased taxation which saps income from the very 
people it was intended to assist.
<P>
	A second measure would be improving the access of Atlantic 
Canada to the lucrative eastern U.S. market. Canada's economy 
has always been dependent on trade, and the areas of Canada 
which have flourished economically have done so as the result 
of strong links to our trading partners.
<P>
	A third measure would be a plan for proper management of 
Atlantic Canada's resources. This would not only include better 
management of Canada's fishery but better management of 
human resources. This would ensure that 15 years from now we 
are not telling another generation of Canadians that its skills are 
obsolete.
<P>
	I am not advocating increased government intervention. On 
the contrary. It was government bureaucracy that was 
responsible for much of this problem in the first place and 
government money is not going to bring back fishery jobs.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	However, the government can encourage young Canadians to 
choose their career paths wisely, assist people in identifying 
emerging industries in Canada and can help to ensure that 
Atlantic Canada is prepared to take advantage of future 
opportunities.
<P>
	In conclusion, I will not be opposing this bill because it 
provides laid off fisheries workers with a subsistence living 
when their unemployment insurance expires. Who could wish to 
add to the hardship they are already experiencing? Certainly not 
I and certainly not my Reform colleagues.
<P>
	However, I will oppose this bill because it fails to provide a 
path to the long term economic recovery of Atlantic Canada. 
Bill C-30 fails to provide financial independence to the fish 
plant workers who have devoted their careers to a traditional 
industry and wish to continue to earn a living. What these 
Canadians need is a tool to earn that living.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I listened to the comments 
of the hon. member from the Reform Party today. If he had spent 
very much time along those fishing coasts of Newfoundland and 
Labrador, along the shores of Cape Breton Island and throughout 
Nova Scotia he would see and perhaps have a little more 
empathy for the dire straits these people find themselves in.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member at this time if he so opposes this 
bill what suggestions might he have to solve this immediate 
crisis and to have some impact as we take direction for the long 
term future of these people who have known nothing but the 
history of the sea, fishing, for over 200 years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Madam Speaker, the difficulty with this bill is 
it comes in the midst of a lot of nothing. We have had years of the 
government ignoring the difficulties that the fisheries on the 
east coast have been experiencing. There is no insight into this 
bill at all about the long term solution. This is another band-aid 
being applied, a band-aid which will simply forestall the long 
term planning that is required.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Madam Speaker, listening to 
my hon. friend, it is a bit like saying that since we do not have a 
cure for cancer we will not take any steps to bring you some 
peace of mind and some effort to resolve your problems in the 
short run.
<P>
	While I will be the first to say that this legislation is not the 
long term solution to the economic plight faced by those people 
living in Atlantic Canada and on the short end of the stick 
regarding the collapse of the cod fishery, to say that we should 
do nothing, to say that we should simply turn our backs on these 
people and let them fend for themselves at this point is not a 
Canadian way to respond. Canadians by definition are people 
with compassion who go out of their way to assist their citizens 
in troubled times in other parts of the country.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5570"> 5570 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The Canadian way is not to drive people 
into the poor house.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> My friends in the Reform Party say that since this is 
not a perfect solution and it does not have the long term 
implications economically for Atlantic Canada we are going to 
cut these tens of thousands of people adrift and simply turn our 
backs on these people who have lost their livelihoods. That is 
highly irresponsible.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Bring in a bill that brings long term as well 
as short term.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> My hon. friend from the Reform Party says bring in 
a bill that brings long term. The point is what do you do to those 
tens of thousands of men and women who today are facing a 
hopeless situation economically because of the collapse of the 
cod fishery? Through no fault of their own they find themselves 
in this position. The Reform Party says cut them loose, turn your 
backs on these people and ignore their plight. I say that is not the 
right step to take. That is not the appropriate-

resuming debate after the question period.

government to consider a dedicated fuel tax as one way to cover 
the federal share of upgrading critical parts of our national 
highway system.
<P>
	A safe and efficient highway is key to our national economic 
health and international competitiveness. The absence of such a 
system is deterring our economic growth, our competitiveness 
and our recovery from the recession.
<P>
	Starting construction now will create more jobs, enhancing 
employment opportunities created by the launch of our 
international infrastructure program. It would also provide a 
very real and long term benefit to Canada's highway 
infrastructure. Upgrading the national highway system would 
also lead to considerable financial savings to various sectors of 
our economy.
<P>
	Finally a commitment by the government to upgrade Canada's 
highway system would demonstrate a determination by both 
national and provincial governments to work for the benefit of 
Canadians from all regions and sectors.

	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, as you 
will remember, during the last election campaign, the Prime 
Minister often said that he wanted to put an end to Conservative 
cronyism in the federal administration. In fact, this is one of the 
promises made in the red book.
<P>
	Yet, the daily <I>Le Droit</I> says that a review of 25 order in council 
appointments for high level and top jobs within the federal 
administration since last fall shows that only three francophones 
were appointed. The majority of those positions are held by 
Ontarians.
<P>
	The Liberals have indeed fulfilled one of their promises: They 
have replaced Conservative cronyism with a new Liberal 
version.
<P>
	I want to remind the Prime Minister that order in council 
appointments should reflect the structure of the Canadian 
population as a whole, and not just favour members and friends 
of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	In the Canada that he envisions, more and more room will be 
made for one group and less and less for another.

Mr. Speaker, both the Minister of Justice and the Solicitor

system is working well and requires only minor changes.
<P>
	Members of the government and the media have referred to a 
recent Statistics Canada poll that indicated the level of crime 
had not increased over the past five years. However nobody in 
the government or in the media seems horrified that the poll also 
showed that one out of every four Canadians is a victim of crime 
every year.
<P>
	It is because of this fact that so many Canadians are afraid to 
walk the streets. It is because of this fact that so many Canadians 
have their homes and cars wired with alarms. It is because of this 
fact that our insurance rates and deductibles are going up every 
year.
<P>
	If the criminal justice system is indeed working, why are there 
so many examples of it having gone wrong? Unfortunately flaws 
in the criminal justice system are all too often fatal flaws.

	Having worked with injured workers in Ontario for many

injuries. The sad reality is that every 12 working hours of the

864,000 workers were injured; and more than 19 million

it is also an economic waste. When we add up the direct and

wasted annually.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Saturday's <I>Globe and Mail</I> reported that the Minister 
of Finance asked his colleagues to accept new spending cuts in 
order to counteract the effect of rising interest rates. It seems 
that at a meeting on the weekend, the cabinet was split on the 
minister's proposal, with a number of ministers preferring to 
wait and see before making additional spending cuts.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance intend to table a supplementary 
budget in the fall to reduce government spending by at least $3 
billion, in order to counteract rising interest rates and keep the 
deficit down to $37.2 billion as announced in his budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, the cabinet is not split. 
We had a very useful meeting on the weekend. I have regular 
meetings with my colleagues to discuss ways to make 
government more effective, and I think we are seeing the results 
of those meetings.
<P>
	As I said in this House last week and the week before, we do 
not intend to bring down a minibudget in the fall. As we said in 
the budget, we intend to present our economic forecasts in order 
to have a basis for consultation on the budget to be tabled next 
February.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am inclined to conclude from what I read in the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I> and from the minister's reply that his proposal for 
additional spending cuts was defeated by his Cabinet.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister more specifically whether he 
would admit that he is primarily responsible for rising interest 
rates and whether he realizes that these increases are a direct 
<P>
result of the severe judgment passed by a financial community 
that is dissatisfied with the spending cuts in his last budget.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are several 
reasons for the increase in interest rates. First of all, this is an 
international phenomenon. We are seeing this not only in 
Canada but elsewhere as well. Of course, Canada's level of debt 
does not help either.
<P>
	However, if we look at the past two or three weeks, clearly the 
rise in interest rates is due mainly to the irresponsible 
statements made by Jacques Parizeau and the Leader of the 
Opposition.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Instead 
of taking political cheap shots, I would urge the Minister of 
Finance, through you, Mr. Speaker, to behave more responsibly, 
and more specifically, I would ask him to answer the following 
question: If, as the minister claims, political uncertainty has 
caused the rise in interest rates we are experiencing today, then 
why does this increase not affect securities issued by the 
Government of Quebec and Hydro Quebec, and why does it 
affect securities issued by the federal government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, probably because 
Quebec has been spoiled by a Liberal government for nine years, 
and not Canada.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Anyone who has any doubt as to the irresponsibility and effect 
of the statements by the Leader of the Official Opposition and 
the leader of the opposition in Quebec, only has to look to the 
statements of people from Nomura Securities from Japan, from 
the United States and from Germany. They indicate those 
statements are putting not only the political but the economic 
structure of this country in doubt.
<P>
	We are going into a very difficult time. I ask the Leader of the 
Official Opposition and through him his colleague in Quebec to 
understand that hundreds of thousands of Canadian jobs are put 
at stake every time they make an irresponsible statement.

a 360 degree turn on its position on the GST is the party to which 
the hon. member opposite belongs. His leader campaigned in 
favour of the GST. However when he read the public opinion 
polls, he turned around and campaigned against it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, 360 degrees 
puts us back where we started.
<P>
	It is obvious the Liberal government plans to introduce the 
son of GST, an allegedly new tax with a new name that will be 
called the value added tax. I predict that if this becomes 
government policy, very soon Canadians will be calling it the 
very awful tax, just as they do in Great Britain. If the biggest 
change to the GST is just its name, this is a betrayal of Liberal 
campaign promises.
<P>
	Would the Deputy Prime Minister admit that she has created a 
political hot potato because she has not been clear with the 
Canadian taxpayers and is now trying to double talk her way out 
of an election promise?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the only party that has been 
double talking the Canadian taxpayers is the party opposite.
<P>
	The Liberal Party campaigned on a promise of getting rid of 
the GST. From the very moment the Prime Minister made that 
promise, he told the Canadian people very honestly that when 
the GST was abolished it would have to be replaced by 
something. The report we are going to read this afternoon will 
underline the contents of various options which will be 
examined by cabinet and by the Prime Minister.
<P>
	I can say one thing. There is one person in this House who 
fully intends to live up to every promise he made. He is the 
Prime Minister of Canada.

Ottawa makes overpays native band councils by over $1.2 
billion every year. This money is paid to over 70,000 apparently 
non-existent natives and represents nearly one quarter of the

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I read the article in <I>La Presse</I>. It is 
a very respected paper, but a very speculative article. It was 
based on a 1991 Statistics Canada examination. Even in that 
article it will be noted that Statistics Canada was unable to get 
reports from 78 First Nations.
<P>
	In 1993 a corporate management group was put together with 
the bottom line of better fiscal regimes, a better basis for this 
type of interplay between ministries. There have been 
difficulties.
<P>
	As my friend knows, in the last eight or nine years there has 
been a tremendous population explosion. The birth rate on 
reserves is twice that of the non-aboriginal birth rate. With 
respect to the C-31 returnees, when we passed the legislation 
the speculation was that perhaps there would be a 10 per cent 
increase on reserve. In fact, it is almost 40 per cent.
<P>
	Not all these things are done strictly on numbers. It is more an 
art form than a science. When we build a road, put in a health 
service or look at a school, we are looking to the future. If a band 
has 250 when it should have 300, or 350 when it should have 
300, we are still going to go with the project. We look at the 
project more than the numbers.
<P>
	I want to assure the hon. member this government is not in the 
business of giving money to non-existent, non-aboriginal 
people.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the

regimes.
<P>
	As part of self-government negotiations we are looking at 
those things. There may be more freedom as far as jurisdiction is 
concerned but there has to be more strict fiscal regimes, 
improved fiscal responsibility and a better database 
synchronizing the collection of the data so that it comes in at one 
time. This will ensure there are stricter regimes, not only for 
aboriginal people but for the employees at DIAND who are 
doing the analysis. I agree with him. It is there. It is being 
studied. There will be work plans out that my friend can examine 
because the First Nations will be examining them over the next

immigrants who commit crimes are few and far between.
<P>
	This is no comfort to the family of Constable Todd Baylis of 
the Toronto police department who was gunned down last week 
by an immigrant who had been ordered deported in March 1991.
<P>
	Can the minister tell the House how it is that after having been 
ordered out of the country and after having an appeal denied, 
this 10-time repeat criminal could still be in Canada to commit 
the terrible crime for which he is now charged?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the minister of 
immigration and all members of the House, I want to express our 
real sympathy for the very tragic circumstances and give all our 
condolences to the family of Constable Baylis who was 
tragically killed on the weekend.
<P>
	As the House knows, the minister of immigration has just 
introduced new immigration legislation which is designed 
specifically to provide for more effective tools of enforcement. I 
am told by him that his department was successful in both 
getting a deportation order and also having any recourse to 
appeal dismissed.
<P>
	However, the hon. member should recognize that in many 
cases and in particular this case the Canadian government has 
difficulty in obtaining travel documents from other countries to 
which the deportee has been assigned. As a result the minister of 
immigration is now seriously investigating this case to ensure 
that these kinds of practices do not continue.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, we do 
appreciate the concern on the government side but this just 
continues to happen week after week after week. We bring in 
examples of this.
<P>
	I believe these particular reforms would have had no effect in 
this case. Clinton Gayle was ordered deported but that order, 
like thousands more, was not carried out.
<P>
	Under this minister, staff on the front lines have been cut and 
as a result only 40 per cent of deportation orders are being 
carried out. There are now only 30 officers responsible for the 
deportation of 40,000 illegal immigrants in Toronto.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that his alleged deportation reforms 
are virtually useless because of his cuts to enforcement and will 
he accept accountability for this latest, needless tragedy.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would if I might be allowed to 
repeat one important fact in this case. The government did 
obtain a deportation order. However, in  order to have 
deportation orders 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5577"> 5577 </A></B>
<P>
carried out we must rely on the co-operation of both the country 
of origin and also air lines.
<P>
	Apparently in this case the co-operation was not forthcoming. 
That is why we are carrying out an investigation. The new 
enforcement rules built into the new legislation can be of some 
substantial assistance.
<P>
	In the specific question of the hon. member, it is not true that 
the effect of this case was as a result of any cutbacks in 
enforcement. The restructuring has been going on to reduce the 
amount of money assigned to administration. It has no impact 
whatsoever on field staff who are the key players in this kind of 
operation.
<P>
	We are trying to cut back on the administrative bureaucratic 
side so resources can be freed up for more effective 
enforcement.

<P>
	Last Thursday, as part of a concerted effort, nearly 1,000

Resources Development urging him to: ``maintain the regular 
component of the job development program as long as no other 
alternative has been put in place''.
<P>
	Does the minister intend to follow up this pressing demand 
from the signatory organizations, given the essential role these 
front-line organizations play in their relations with the less 
fortunate, and in particular people who have no jobs and no 
income?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

representations from these organizations because certainly I 
agree with the hon. member that they play a very important role 
in helping to combat unemployment.
<P>
	However I would like to point out to the hon. member, as I 
have in the past, that we have been looking at alternatives. One 
of the most important reallocations, redirections, we have been 
making is to target specifically the problem of youth 
unemployment.
<P>
	We all recognize the great tragedy that takes place when 
young people are unable to get the resources they need to be 
properly trained, to have access to the workplace, to make that 
transition between school and work.
<P>
	Yes, we are making some reallocations but because of the very 
deep and serious plight of young people, it is a very worthy 
objective. We will certainly meet with these groups to discuss 
how they can assist in helping us to meet that objective.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the

the other hand, as they say, that cuts in programs to develop job 
skills readiness jeopardize the very existence of essential

$800 million of funds specifically for the province of Quebec. 
That is an increase over last year. There have been no cutbacks. 
We have increased the funds and we are devoting a substantial 
proportion of federal expenditures.

<P>
introducing last week a bill  that included literally 100 
amendments to the Criminal Code to improve and modernize it.

	The hon. member raises the question of capital punishment. 
We ran for election last year on a very specific platform in 
justice matters. This government, instead of looking at polls as 
suggested by the hon. member, is concentrating on fulfilling 
those commitments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, the former 
government that refused to listen to the people is now sitting 
with two people in behind us. I suggest that he should be 
listening to the people.
<P>
	My supplementary question is this. In light of the shooting 
death of Toronto police constable, Todd Baylis, and in view of 
the consistent public demand for the return of capital 
punishment, would the minister be willing to support a binding 
referendum on capital punishment, tying it in with the next 
federal election to eliminate the cost?
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

of all we were elected last year on a platform which did not 
include the restoration of capital punishment.
<P>
	As recently as seven years ago the House debated capital 
punishment at length and on a free vote decided it should not be 
restored. That is the first observation.
<P>
	Second, the hon. member speaks of consistency. I would ask 
him to be consistent. He has referred to the tragic case of last 
Thursday in which a police officer was shot to death. 
Preliminary indications are that the weapon used in that murder 
was a hand gun that was stolen from someone who owned it 
lawfully and had it registered. Now if that is not further 
indication of the need for gun control, I would like to hear what 
is.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

<P>

<P>
	The indications as I said earlier at least preliminary are that 
the handgun was initially purchased by a person with lawful 
intent who registered it according to the law, had it in a 
residence from which it was stolen.
<P>
	I invite the hon. member to observe with me the logical 
connection between the presence of that handgun in a 
community from which it was taken by someone with criminal 
intent and the fact that it wound up allegedly being used in the 
commission of a murderous crime. The connection is quite 
obvious.

question is for the Minister of Transport. The status of French at 
airports has not improved much since Quebec aviation workers 
waged their famous fight and managed 20 years ago to obtain the 
right to communicate in French in Quebec airspace. Let us take, 
for example, a Transport Canada order on air navigation which 
barely tolerates the use of French at Canadian airports.
<P>
	Since the ability to speak in both official languages is at the 
heart of the Canadian duality, how can the minister justify 
banning the use of French in air traffic operations in Canada, 
except in Quebec, while closing Quebec City's terminal control 
unit, one of only two French-language air control centres in 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
if my hon. colleague wanted to be frank with the House of

Quebec airspace are served in the pilot's language of choice. 
However, when airplanes are flying at an altitude of more than 
29,000 feet, there may be, at a certain point, a lack of 
communications in French.
<P>
	In general, these airplanes are flying to destinations outside 
Quebec where they will have to operate in English on arrival. It 
is the Department of Transport's fiduciary and primary 
responsibility to ensure the safety of the people using Canada's 
transportation system, and if the hon. member wants to fight for 
bilingualism, I would ask him not to do so on the backs of the 
people who use Canada's transportation system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond

not in a position to offer services in French in some regions of 
New Brunswick and Quebec, namely the North Shore and the

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	The operation of the juvenile justice system's results as seen 
by average Canadians seems overly protective of young 
offenders. The Young Offenders Act has extensive rules of 
non-disclosure, secrecy and the destruction of records.
<P>
	Will the minister explain to Canadians why there is a need for 
this inequity between the juvenile system and the adult system, 
for surely justice must be seen to be done as well as done?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member will know 
that the juvenile justice system in Canada was developed 
through many years and was provided for in a statute in 1984 
which had the support of all parties in this House when the 
Young Offenders Act was enacted.
<P>
	The underlying principle is that the distinctions to which the 
hon. member has referred are appropriate when we are dealing 
with youth who have their lives in front of them, who are 
particularly appropriate for rehabilitation efforts.
<P>
	At the same time, as we undertook to do last year when we 
campaigned for office, we have now introduced in Bill C-37 
proposals for specific amendments to strengthen that statute, to 
deal with 16 and 17 year olds who commit the crimes of most 
serious violence in a particular way that will presume they are to 
be tried in adult court, to share the information with school 
boards, principals of schools and members of the community 
when there are young offenders who are accused or suspected of 
crimes that might endanger the public safety, and make a variety 
of other changes including increasing the maximum sentence 
for murder.
<P>
	This government with those proposed changes in my 
respectful view has proposed to strengthen the Young Offenders 
Act while preserving the main elements of juvenile justice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, could this minister cite any cases in which there has 
been harm which has given rise to the necessity of the secrecy 
provisions of the Young Offenders Act, for in contrast on 
occasions I have mentioned in this House where there has been 
death as a direct result of the misguided Liberal idealism?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact is that a relative 
handful of crimes each year for which there are convictions in 
youth courts involve serious crimes of violence or homicides. 
The vast majority of crime among young people is non-violent, 
either property related or crimes of theft.
<P>
	The provisions to which the hon. member refers are intended 
to ensure that when young people make a mistake of that 
character, yes they are punished and yes they have learned a 
lesson, but they are not through the publication of their names in 
the media stigmatized for life, prevented from completing their 
education or from gaining employment. Surely that is in the 
public interest in this country.

question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
and he surely does not have a prepared response because I did 
not give him the question in advance.
<P>
	The industrial base of the Sorel-Tracy region has been 
collapsing for the past ten years, and dramatic plant closures 
have become everyday occurrences. After MIL Tracy, Tioxide 
and Beloit came the news recently that Soreltex was closing. 
The pressing needs resulting from these many shutdowns drove 
the Sorel Employment Centre in April to ask the department for 
an additional $2.2 million to offset the demand generated by 
these mass layoffs.

	Given the urgency of this situation, can the minister pledge to 
allocate these funds immediately from the $400 million which 
he has earmarked for launching new programs?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic

member was a member of the previous government at the time 
when the downsizing of that particular industrial operation took 
place. It would seem to me if there was any urgency with dealing 
with the problem it should have been dealt with at that time.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, such a pat 
answer-I was a member of the Conservative Party until 1990. I 
refer to a situation in the Sorel-Tracy region in 1994, and the 
only answer I get is an arrogant, typically Liberal response.
<P>
	I am asking you, Mr. Minister, if you are prepared to 
re-establish-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I would ask the hon. member to always 
address his remarks to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. Is the minister prepared 
to re-establish the specific program for mass layoffs, given that 
the funds required to meet these needs have been drawn from the 
general account for some time? Can the minister re-establish 
this mass layoff fund to meet the needs of the Sorel-Tracy 
region, for example?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I share the concern of the hon. 
member for the workers affected. The point I was trying to make 
is that good industrial labour policy is to establish proper 
programs at a time when companies begin to downsize, not when 
it reaches a crisis proportion.
<P>
	I think the hon. member as a full and active member of this 
House during the time of the previous government of which he 
was member should have ensured at that time that those 
measures were put in place.

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, last week the Prime 
Minister announced the appointment of an ethics counsellor. 
The ethics counsellor is merely a slight expansion of the 
assistant deputy registrar general's previous role; the same job, 
the same person, a new name.
<P>
	The lobby reforms changed tier one and tier two lobbyists into 
consultant and organization lobbyists; the same role, a new 
name.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister or the deputy really believe that 
these cosmetic changes will solve the problems of influence 
peddling in government decision making?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
level of understanding that was demonstrated by the member in 
his speech the other day perhaps is explained by the fact that he 
did not attend the briefing session that we offered Reform 
members on the bill.
<P>
	He should know that influence peddling is covered under the 
Criminal Code where it belongs and where it will stay with other 
criminal offences.
<P>
	With respect to both the role of the ethics counsellor and the 
introduction of the amendments to the Lobbyists Registration 
Act, we have met the promises that we made in the red book 
almost item by item. We did retain the distinction between tiers 
of lobbyists. We put this proposal to a House of Commons 
committee before second reading hopefully so that somebody on 
the other side as well as our own members will take the time to 
study it and make useful proposals. If he has something to offer 
let him offer it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to 
offer that. I would like to know right now whether this

Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Minister of International 
Trade.
<P>
	Over the past 25 years more than 1.5 billion disposable plastic 
lighters have been imported into Canada from the Orient. If laid 
end to end that is enough to circle the world three times. These 
cannot be recycled and Canadian taxpayers have to pay the cost 
of putting them into landfill sites.
<P>
	The Eddy Match subsidiary, Canadian Splint, is closing and 
56 people in the Pembroke area will be losing their jobs. No 
more wooden matches are made in Canada as a result of this 
unfair competition.

flooding of the Canadian market and the destruction of Canadian 
jobs and the environment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. It reflects 
his ongoing concern about environmental issues in our country, 
particularly the question of how best to dispose of unrecyclable 
materials, those materials which do not lend themselves readily 
to recycling.
<P>
	I want to salute the member for drawing to our attention this

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am now prepared to rule on the point of order 
raised by the hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley 
on Friday, June 17, 1994. It concerns the appointment of the hon. 
member for Yukon as an associate member of the Standing 
Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development 
during the committee's consideration of Bill C-33, the Yukon 
First Nation's land claim settlement act, and Bill C-34, an act 
respecting self-government for First Nations in the Yukon 
Territory.
<P>
	At this time I would also like to thank the hon. members for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Kamloops, Mississauga South, 
Roberval, and The Battlefords-Meadow Lake for their 
valuable contributions to this discussion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As was pointed out, Speakers have always been hesitant to 
interfere in the proceedings of committees of the House.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	However, as Speaker Fraser explained in a ruling on March 
26, 1990 at page 9756 of the <I>Debates</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Speaker has often informed the House that matters and procedural issues 
that arise in committee ought to be settled in committee unless the committee 
reports them first to the House. I have, however, said to the House that this 
practice was not an absolute one and that in very serious and special 
circumstances the Speaker may have to pronounce on a committee matter without 
the committee having reported to the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the matter now before us I must also conclude that this is 
serious enough to require the intervention of the Chair because it 
concerns a fundamental right which belongs to the House and 
not to a committee, namely the right to establish the 
membership of a committee. Furthermore, the committee has 
reported to the House on the said bills and the proceedings of the 
committee are now before the House.
<P>
	Let me now address the concerns raised by the hon. member 
for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.
<P>
	First, the hon. member, citing Standing Order 114(2)(<I>c</I>), 
argued that since the hon. member for Yukon was not an 
associate member of the committee she could not be appointed a 
substitute member. Second, the hon. member noted that he had 
raised objection to the acceptance of the member for Yukon as 
an associate member but that this objection had been dismissed 
by the chair of the committee. Third, the member argued that a 
breach of the standing orders had occurred and that the remedy 
to deal with this breach of the rules was not to be found inside 
the committee.
<P>
	Finally the hon. member requested that the Speaker take 
certain actions specifically. He asked that the reports of the 
committee concerning the legislation presented on Friday, June 
17, 1994 be ruled out of order and that the committee therefore 
be required to reconduct the clause by clause examination of the 
bills in question. Arguing that the chair of the committee had 
knowingly allowed the rules of the House to be broken, he also 
demanded that the current chair of the committee resign and that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5583"> 5583 </A></B>
<P>
another be chosen to preside over the re-examination of the 
bills.
<P>
	Having reviewed the interventions of all members on Friday 
as well as the minutes and transcripts of the committee 
proceedings, and also having consulted with the table, I am 
satisfied that the difficulties which arose in the committee were 
the product of an erroneous interpretation of Standing Order 
114. The advice given to the chair of the committee concerning 
the procedure for substitution of members was incorrect and 
unfortunately the actions taken by the chair were based on this 
advice. May I also add that in no way was the hon. member for 
Yukon at fault in this matter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	While it is a tradition of this House that committees are 
masters of their own proceedings, they cannot establish 
procedures which go beyond the powers conferred upon them by 
the House. For example, a committee must seek the permission 
of the House to travel as they themselves are not so empowered. 
Likewise, committees do not have the power to establish or 
change their membership. This power is retained by the House 
and, in the present situation, is spelled out explicitly in Standing 
Order 104(4) which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(4) The Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs shall also prepare lists 
of associate members for each Standing Committee and Standing Joint Committee 
referred to in this Standing Order, who shall be deemed to be members of that 
committee for the purposes of Standing Orders 108(1)(<I>b</I>) and 114(2)(<I>a</I>) and who 
shall be eligible to act as substitutes on that committee pursuant to the provisions of 
Standing Order 114(2)(<I>b</I>).</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Any report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs made pursuant to this standing order must be 
concurred in by the House for such an associate membership 
change to be effective. As no report appointing the hon. member 
for Yukon an associate member had been presented by the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs and thus 
no such report had been concurred in by the House, the hon. 
member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley was absolutely 
correct when he stated that the hon. member for Yukon did not 
meet the requirements as an associate member of the committee 
under the standing orders in order to function as a member of the 
committee.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Under the rules of the House, all members are free to 
participate in the proceedings of committees, within clearly 
stated parameters. As Standing Order 119 reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>119. Any Member of the House who is not a member of a standing, special or 
legislative committee may, unless the House or the committee concerned otherwise 
orders, take part in the public proceedings of the committee, but may not vote or 
move any motion, nor be part of any quorum.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As well, citation 766(1) of Beauchesne's sixth edition notes 
that members of the House who are not members of a committee 
may participate during the committee's examination of 
witnesses, but they do so usually at the discretion of the 
chairman and the committee.
<P>
	Several members noted in their remarks that it was not the 
presence or the participation of the hon. member for Yukon in 
the work of the committee that was in question. In fact several 
even noted that since she is the only representative in this House 
for Yukon her contribution was valuable. Rather, what was in 
question, as the hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley 
Valley noted was that in allowing the hon. member for Yukon to 
vote in the committee the standing orders of the House had been 
breached.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The problems presented by the proceedings in this committee 
have served to illuminate for us possible difficulties with the 
understanding of the new rules regarding associate 
memberships of committees and the methods for choosing 
substitutes, particularly, as in this instance, where the active 
participation of a certain member could be extremely beneficial 
to the work of both the committee and the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The members of the committee are to be commended for 
wishing to include the hon. member for Yukon in their 
deliberations on matters which directly affect her constituents. 
However, it is incumbent upon the members of all committees to 
ensure that proper procedures are followed. This said, I must 
concur with the hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley 
Valley that by allowing a member to vote who, under the rules of 
this House, did not legitimately have status as a committee 
member, the standing orders were indeed breached.
<P>
	I must therefore rule that any vote cast by the hon. member for 
Yukon in the committee proceedings on Bills C-33 and C-34 is 
void as she did not have the right to participate in any of the 
votes.
<P>
	The hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley has also 
argued that because the proceedings in the committee had been 
irregular, the report should be irreceivable. However, as the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell pointed out, none of 
the votes taken in the committee would have been altered by the 
vote of any single member. Having reviewed the minutes of the 
committee I must agree with this conclusion. Therefore, I do not 
find grounds on which to declare the reports out of order. Hence, 
the House can proceed with the report stage of these bills.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5584"> 5584 </A></B>
<P>
	I hope and I expect that all those involved with committees of the House will take note of my comments today and will make every effort to ensure that such an incident will not reoccur.

participation in the reserve force.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member 
for Saanich-Gulf Islands for seconding this bill.
<P>
	Canada is relying more on reservists to meet its military 
commitments and with the recent downsizing of the regular 
force the demand on reservists will undoubtedly increase.
<P>
	The auditor general in his 1992 report to this House found that 
reservists had a serious training deficit when compared with 
trades and ranks in the regular force. He put much of this down 
to the reservists being unavailable for training, often due to the 
demands of their jobs or difficulty in scheduling time off to 
coincide with the training exercises and courses offered. Many 
reservists use their annual vacations to attend exercises 
essential to developing their military skills. This is a great price 
for them to pay and for their families to have to forfeit a well 
deserved vacation to serve Canada.
<P>
	If we are to have an effective volunteer reserve force and if 
Canada is to be able to meet its international commitments we 
must take steps to ensure that reservists are able to get the 
training they need and the time required to get that training.
<P>
	This bill will enable reservists employed by the federal 
government to be given up to a two month leave of absence to 
attend reserve training and exercises. This bill in a small way 
seeks to ensure that the Government of Canada lead the way to 
demonstrate leadership by ensuring that the federal government 
provides leadership of all Canadian employers in facilitating the 
development and professionalism of the Canadian reserve force.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, we have decided to table amendments to 
Bill C-32 and I will briefly explain why. Then my colleagues 
will make additional comments.
<P>
	First, we must put Bill C-32, which is entitled an act to amend 
the Excise Tax Act, the Excise Act and the Income Tax Act, in its 
proper context. Originally, the purpose of this legislation was to 
implement the federal action plan on tobacco smuggling, as well 
as changes proposed to the tax structure by the government, this 
past January or February.
<P>
	However, clauses 2, 3 and 4 of that bill include measures 
which affect air transportation and result from the last federal 
budget. These clauses provide that, on flights with a ticket price 
of more than $500, the total tax amount, which is currently $40, 
will progressively increase to $50. However, for tickets costing 
$700 and more, the tax payable will now be $50.
<P>
	We feel that this is totally unacceptable, given that most 
remote areas were very affected by the deregulation in the air 
transportation sector. Considering the current cost of airline 
tickets to these regions, it seems totally unacceptable to
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5591"> 5591 </A></B>
<P>
increase the burden for consumers living in these regions as  
well as for taxpayers who are already making a very big 
contribution.
<P>
	This is why, through our amendments, we propose to bring 
that tax back to at least the previous levels. At the same time, we 
urge members of the transport and finance committees to review 
the situation and bring airfare to a more reasonable level as 
regards remote destinations.
<P>
	Here I do not mean the Quebec, Atlantic or western regions. I 
am referring to regions such as mine, Abitibi-Témiscamingue, 
Quebec's north shore and Gaspé regions and, in fact, most 
regions of Quebec and northern Ontario. Several Atlantic 
regions will also be adversely affected by the new tax. This 
measure went unnoticed in the last budget and is now hidden in 
Bill C-32.
<P>
	We propose these amendments so that the Department of 
Finance does not get $24 million more this year and $44 million 
more next year at the expense of taxpayers living in remote 
areas. Indeed, we think this is totally unacceptable. I do hope 
that the government will realize the impact of this bill and 
withdraw clauses 2, 3 and 4.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I just wanted to present the government's arguments, 
which I find quite rational in that they will reduce the tax burden 
on short-haul domestic and transborder flights.
<P>
	The present uniform tax of $10 will be reduced to $6. To 
increase the recovery of the cost of air transportation facilities 
and services, the maximum air transportation tax on domestic 
and transborder flights will be increased from $40 to $50.
<P>
	I think most people would agree that there is a substantial 
saving nonetheless for short flights.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	The drop from $10 to $6, however, is not enough. In order to 
recover as much as possible to pay for these facilities and 
services, it seems essential to look for money elsewhere. So we, 
the government, decided to focus our efforts there.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Those are really the only two comments I want to make. I want 
to point out for those who take shorter distance flights that the 
tax will be reduced from $10 to $6, which is an important 
reduction. At the same time for those who will be taking longer 
flights it will indeed be increased to try and recuperate as much 
as possible to pay for public installations and services that these 
people are using.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak on behalf of my constituents in the riding of Abitibi, 
and the residents of all remote ridings, concerning Bill C-32. 
This bill to amend the Excise Tax Act, the Excise Act and the 
Income Tax Act essentially contains amendments to taxes on 
tobacco products and, in sections 2, 3 and 4, amendments to the 
air transportation tax.
<P>
	It is particularly in reference to these airline ticket taxes that I 
would like to address the House for a few minutes, in order to 
show that the government has not achieved its objectives and 
that, in addition, regions outside the network of major 
population centres will be penalized.
<P>
	In order to judge this new rate structure, I will take a few 
minutes to compare the present and proposed tax rates. The 
present rate consists of a basic tax of $10-as the parliamentary 
secretary mentioned-on each ticket, plus 7 per cent of the price 
of the ticket, to a maximum of $40. The new structure would 
feature a basic tax of $6, plus 7 per cent on the price of the ticket, 
to a maximum of $50 for expensive tickets.
<P>
	To justify this new structure, the government cites the 
following objectives: first, to increase the amount of money 
recovered-which seems fair and legitimate-for air 
transportation facilities and services provided by Transport 
Canada; and second, to reduce the tax burden on short-haul 
flights to small localities. We, in remote areas of the country, are 
those small localities. We are directly affected, and we do not 
understand why the second objective could not be achieved.
<P>
	This new rate structure does not achieve the targeted 
objectives, in particular reducing the tax burden on flights to 
small localities-mostly to remote areas of the country. 
Obviously, the new rate structure will make it possible to collect 
much more money to cover Transport Canada's costs. As the 
member for Témiscamingue put it, $24 million more will be 
collected in the first year and $44 million more in subsequent 
years.
<P>
	This money will come primarily from the increase in the 
maximum tax from $40 to $50, notwithstanding the loss of 
revenue from having lowered the basic tax to $6 from $10. This 
meets the government's first objective to increase the recovery 
of the cost of facilities. Of course the government has another 
reason for introducing this new rate, and that is why we will 
focus mainly on the second objective, which is to reduce the tax 
burden on short-haul flights.
<P>
	However, this objective has not been met. In fact, air 
transportation to remote areas has been adversely affected since 
deregulation, since the full cost is now being borne by these 
areas. The price of a ticket to some destinations has gone up 
considerably in recent years. For instance, Montreal-Rimouski 
costs $552 plus tax. Ottawa-Montreal-Val-d'Or, a flight I take 
every week, costs me more than $550 plus tax.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5592"> 5592 </A></B>
<P>
	The reason is, of course, that there is less demand for these 
flights, and to make a profit, carriers have to raise their rates, as 
opposed to busier routes like Montreal-Toronto, where a regular 
ticket will cost around $400 for about the same distance. The 
new tax rate is based on the price and does not take traffic or 
distance into account. The government assumes there is a 
perfect correlation between price and distance, which is not the 
case. The price is based on two factors: distance and traffic.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	This means that the government is wrong if it thinks that 
charging less tax on cheap tickets will benefit air transportation 
to remote areas. This policy will tend to benefit short-haul, 
high-volume flights like Montreal-Toronto, used constantly by 
business people, and charter flights.
<P>
	Remote areas are already facing service cuts due to the 
present policy of privatizing air services. For the sake of 
fairness, people in the regions should be offered the same 
service as people in large urban centres. Regional air traffic 
control, firefighting services and weather forecasting will be 
mostly phased out or administered from the large urban centres.
<P>
	Air services are vital to people in the north, and here I am 
referring to the Cree and the Inuit for whom air transportation 
often provide their sole access to basic services such as food, 
health care and postal services. In many regions, especially in 
the North, tourism is the only way they can develop their 
economy and become independent in the future.
<P>
	With this new tax rate, travel will become even more 
expensive for foreign tourists, for the French and all the 
Europeans who come to see the vast expanses of our country, 
because of the already high cost of a regular ticket, which I 
mentioned earlier. This cost factor will prevent people in the 
North from developing their economy.
<P>
	Here are a few examples of fares for these regions. If you want 
to go from Montreal to Iqaluit, in the Inuit territory, you may 
have to pay between $800 and $1,100, even more if you want to 
go to La Grande 2 or Saluit, and this is only one way. The return 
fare would be $1,100 to $1,600. Certainly, all these flights 
would be subject to the maximum tax of $50.
<P>
	You could tell me that given the small number of flights it 
would not affect very many people. As I said, for Iqaluit there 
were 4,700 passengers in 1992, the last year for which data are 
available. By comparison, there were 86,900 passengers for 
Val-d'Or in 1992. For an area like Waskaganish, where air 
transport is the only thing available, 11,400 passengers. These 
people will have to pay increased fares.
<P>
	I would like to tell the parliamentary secretary that it might 
have been possible-he said that they favour short distances-to 
add $4 or $5 to the Montreal to Toronto fare, and the Department 
of Transport would have  collected as much money without 
penalizing people who depend on air transportation.
<P>
	I would like to conclude that for people in my riding or any 
remote riding in Canada, clauses 2, 3 and 4, which may look 
innocuous, will mean an extra $10 per trip on the average. If you 
add this to all the other difficulties in remote areas, it becomes 
very difficult to control the tools of development. The 
government is siphoning more and more.
<P>
	The motion presented by the Bloc Quebecois would delete 
clauses 2, 3 and 4 of Bill C-32, and maintain the status quo 
instead of hitting remote areas.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-32 contains a deliberate glitch involving clauses 2, 3, and 4, 
dealing with the increase in the air transportation fee schedule 
for remote areas. Once again, the Liberal government has 
decided to pick on people who can ill afford to pay, having had 
the guts to be true pioneers in remote and less populated areas.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	This comes after Bill C-17 and the attack on regions with a 
very high unemployment rate, such as my riding of 
Manicouagan, after the fishery adjustment program which, 
although it is very generous, does not take into account regional 
characteristics, especially regarding sports fishing which 
attracts a lot of tourists and is vitally important to us. And now, 
the Liberal government picks on these same people, striking at 
the key component of this region's economic development, 
namely air transportation.
<P>
	However, the objective, which is to lessen the tax burden on 
short-haul flights to small communities, has not been met. As a 
matter of fact, deregulation has had a negative impact on air 
transportation to remote areas. These areas have had to assume 
the entire cost of transportation, and fares to these destinations 
have significantly increased over the past few years. As an 
example, let me give you a few statistics which might help us 
draw some comparisons. These examples will help us better 
understand what the problem is with the transportation system 
on the North Shore.
<P>
	First, before getting to the statistics, let us review some basic 
geographical information. Let us talk about the east side of 
Manicouagan, a riding so huge it seems to me like a whole 
continent. To give you an idea, it is 46 per cent of the size of 
Ontario. The coast is 1,200 kilometres long. For comparison's 
sake, travelling 1,200 kilometres from Ottawa in a north-west 
direction will get you near Thunder Bay, and in a north-east 
direction to Sept-Îles. That is awesome. Out of these 1,200 
kilometres between Franklin and Blanc-Sablon, which is only a 
part of my riding, 500 kilometres are connected to the national 
highway system, hence to the Quebec system, but the other 700 
kilometres along the coast are not linked to the Quebec highway 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5593"> 5593 </A></B>
<P>
system. You might see some sections of roadway linking 
together a few villages along the coast,  but nothing connecting 
these villages to the Quebec system.
<P>
	I will divide my speech in two. I will start with the 
communities accessible by road and then deal with the 
communities which are not accessible by road. In a riding like 
Manicouagan, where regional economic development is 
concerned, air transportation is very important, because it 
usually facilitates the first contacts between an investor and the 
territory he or she wishes to develop. Once they have flown to 
the targeted area, investors look at the various facilities they and 
their employees could benefit from. Of course, air services are a 
big consideration when advantages and disadvantages are 
reviewed.
<P>
	That is why this issue cannot be treated lightly. For the people 
in my riding of Manicouagan, flying is not a luxury, it is a 
crucial service not only to ensure regional and economic 
development, but to maintain the quality of life they are entitled 
to as taxpayers. More that 85 per cent of small and medium sized 
communities are located within 150 kilometres of a major urban 
area.
<P>
	A major urban centre is a built-up area where you can find all 
the important health and government services. In Quebec, we 
are talking about Montreal, Quebec City, Chicoutimi, 
Trois-Rivières, Sherbrooke. So, in those areas where there is 
significant population density, they are not usually lacking for 
much of anything to meet the basic needs to achieve a decent 
standard of living in 1994.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	But what is the decent standard of living that the 
Manicouagan taxpayers have a right to expect in 1994? The bill 
talks about equity in relation to cost distribution. So, for 
analysis purposes, I did some brief calculations where equity 
must represent the same rate, must means that we should pay the 
same price for an air kilometre, no matter where.
<P>
	That gives us some really interesting data. For example, 
between Quebec City and Montreal, which is undoubtedly the 
busiest corridor, some percentage of variation could be 
acceptable. We could agree with that, but to go from simple to 
double, as I will show you, is an aberration. It is not only an 
exaggeration, but an aberration. For Quebec City-Montreal, 
we arrive at more or less $1.10 per air kilometre; for 
Sept-Îles-Natashquan-as people cannot get to that area by 
road, they must take a plane for emergencies or 
whatever-$1.34 per kilometre; for Sept-Îles-Blanc-Sablon, 
$1.82. We should not forget that the rate for Montreal-Quebec 
City is still $1.10. The equity must be somewhere. We will talk 
about Natasquan-Montreal, which is $2.29 per kilometre; that 
is more than double the rate. Another one which is more than 
double: Saint-Augustin-Montreal, $2.32; for 
Blanc-Sablon-Montreal, $2.40. This is an aberration. But, 
according to the minister, there is equity somewhere in there. It 
does not make any sense.
<P>
	Those people who are not linked to a road system, those living in communities that are not located within the road network of Quebec, have the same basic needs as those I mentioned earlier, but of course they also have particularities.
<P>
	Let us take for instance health clinics. Suppose we have an 
emergency where a child is involved, or any other person, and 
needs special care. Since these clinics cannot provide the 
treatments, a sanitary plane of the Government of Quebec will 
be used to take the patient to a centre, Quebec or Montreal, as 
required. However, people who accompany the patients have to 
disburse considerable amounts of money to go with them.
<P>
	Let us take Blanc-Sablon, for instance. A mother who is 
morally obligated to accompany her child to a Quebec hospital 
will have to pay almost $1,500 in transport, whereas if she 
resided in Baie-Saint-Paul, she would not have to bear such 
costs since that community is linked to the road system.
<P>
	Air transport is not a luxury in the riding of Manicouagan.
<P>
	That fact is mentioned in a resolution of the city council of 
Natashquan which I have here. The city council naturally sent a 
letter to the provincial minister and I would like to quote a few 
lines of that resolution which refer to the various preambles 
dealing with the specificity of those regions.
<P>
	``Given the geographic difficulties'', and this is not trivial, 
because the North Shore is not flat and you do not play golf 
every day in that area. ``Given the health and education 
problems linked to transportation'', teachers, doctors, people 
travelling to every corner of the North Shore go by plane 
because they have no other choice. Air travel is so outrageously 
expensive that the city council mentions it in its resolution. 
Although every city council could say the same thing but I 
mentioned only that of Natashquan.
<P>
	They also explain how this affects supplies. I would like to 
tell you a short story dealing with food commodities. Here, a 
T-bone steak is expensive, and a tomato is certainly a lot 
cheaper, but if you go to Natashquan or Chevery, like I did in 
February, a tomato costs almost more than a T-bone because to 
buy a tomato in February, it has to be shipped there practically 
by November, so imagine what it will cost in February if it is 
still good to eat. This is of course an extreme example, but we 
have to consider these regional differences. Air transportation is 
a major factor here. And that is part of the reason why we are 
rising in the House today.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5594"> 5594 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	When the government thinks that its policy to charge less tax 
on cheap tickets will benefit air transportation to remote areas, it 
is wrong. Its policy will benefit the short haul, high volume 
flights between Montreal and Toronto, for instance. These 
destinations will benefit, but at what price? The price will be 
paid by people in remote areas, as if they were not paying 
enough already.
<P>
	Montreal-Toronto flights have a high volume of business 
people, and business charter operations will benefit as well.
<P>
	Bill C-32 will merely increase the burden on the regions and 
further isolate remote areas. And this is a measure that has 
absolutely no connection with the other measures in this bill. It 
should not even be in Bill C-32. The government put this 
measure in to make things difficult for everyone. Summer is 
coming, and they want to sneak this through the House.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois believes that regional transportation 
services should benefit. The government had a chance to set up a 
rate system that would have benefited regional transportation. It 
was a wonderful opportunity for the Liberal government to 
prove, just for once, that it has the regions' best interests in 
mind. But of course, they failed to rise to the occasion.
<P>
	The regions have suffered enough as a result of deregulation. 
It is time to turn the situation around and let the burden of 
regional transportation costs be shared by remote regions and 
urban regions. That would be fair.
<P>
	In conclusion, today the regions are at a tremendous 
disadvantage as far as transportation costs are concerned, a fact 
that is adversely affecting their development and has made them 
second class citizens.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to rise and speak on this bill.
<P>
	I represent an area that has a large number of tobacco 
producers in it. They look quite favourably on this bill and what 
it will do to rationalize and give the industry which has been 
attacked over the years in a number of different areas more 
certainty on where it will go in the future.
<P>
	I want to talk about a particular part of the bill. I follow this 
issue quite a bit. One of the areas this bill deals with is how 
tobacco is processed and gives a definition of a processor and 
manufacturer.
<P>
	In section 182 on page 61 of the bill is a definition of tobacco 
manufacturing which states ``means any activity (other than 
farming) relating to the manufacture or processing in Canada of 
tobacco and tobacco products''. That could pertain to almost 
anything. It could pertain to people who make cartons or people 
<P>
who make the paint that goes on the cartons that we put the 
tobacco in.
<P>
	In fact there is one company in my area of 
Haldimand-Norfolk that is hit by this. It does not manufacture 
cigarettes. It had nothing to do with the smuggling situation. It is 
an independent group, not tied in with any of the big three. The 
intent of the legislation, other than to reduce taxes to deal with 
smuggling, was to hit back at the big three, those the 
government felt might have had, remotely, something to do with 
the smuggling that was going on cross border.
<P>
	This small independent company processes tobacco, meaning 
it buys from the tobacco board, threshes the tobacco, bundles it 
up and ships a good majority of it overseas to export markets. It 
had nothing to do with the problem but because of the way the 
legislation is written it is caught up in it.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Finance if he could look into the situation 
of these small companies and see what he can do to help 
alleviate the taxes. They have to compete internationally with 
other companies and I do not see why they should be caught up 
in this legislation.
<P>
	I believe the intent of the legislation is not to catch them, but 
unfortunately it will. Therefore I call on the government today 
to do something about it.
<P>
	Finally, I will conclude by saying that I support Bill C-32. It 
will do what it is intended to do; stop the smuggling.
<P>
	The 200 some odd smoke huts that were throughout 
Haldimand-Norfolk and on the Six Nations reserve are no 
longer there. Only a few of them are left. This bill has already 
done what it was intended to do. It has sent a strong message that 
we will not support this type of activity. It has done a lot for the 
communities, especially the Six Nations. A number of the elders 
have come to me to say thanks for bringing forward legislation 
like this. They feel that sort of activity should not happen on the 
Six Nations. They feel anything they can do to help us out in this 
regard they would gladly do.
<P>
	There are other parts of the the bill which I obviously do not 
support, such as the export tax, but I can say quite heartily that I 
and the producers in my area support this bill as a whole.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a few remarks to make in addition to what I said at the 
previous readings. These remarks are with regard to the 
amendments presented by the Bloc, the Official Opposition, on 
the air transportation tax.
<P>
	We will be opposing the bill because of the reduction in taxes 
on tobacco and so on. Basically we support the government in 
the other aspects of this omnibus bill. We support the 
government's changes to the air transportation tax. It is moving 
toward privatization, moving toward user pay, moving toward 
cost recovery so that this part of the industry does not have to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5595"> 5595 </A></B>
<P>
supported by government. That is why we oppose the  
amendments the Bloc is making because it will take away from 
the direction in which the government is moving.
<P>
	There is currently a flat fee of $10 plus 7 per cent to a 
maximum of $40 on all airline tickets purchased in Canada. 
These fees are part of the Excise Tax Act even though they 
appear to be closer in function to a user fee than actual taxes. All 
the revenue is directed toward the Department of Transport 
which routes the funds to the aviation component of their 
expenditures. This tax makes up most of the funding for aviation 
services provided to all Canadian airports whether they are 
public or private. These services include air traffic controllers, 
aviation control for take off and landing and air navigation 
costs.
<P>
	Current revenues from this tax of nearly $600 million do not 
fully cover the government cost of aviation which runs at about 
$870 million. Because of the implementations the government 
wants to make, this airport tax would come closer to meeting the 
actual costs of this by the airlines, then we would support that 
and therefore oppose the amendment.
<P>
	To reduce the tax burden on short haul, domestic and 
trans-border flights by decreasing the flat charge per ticket and 
increasing the maximum fee is one change that was to be made, 
along with a flat fee decreasing to $6 and the maximum 
increasing to $50. This is good.
<P>
	Last, the change would bring an additional $24 million in 
1994 and an additional $41 million in 1995. That is a positive 
move. The burden on the taxpayer would be reduced.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	In analysing this, this levy should not be part of a complicated 
tax system. The funds do not go into general revenue but are 
spent specifically on aviation. Therefore we should change this 
into a user fee on a full recovery basis.
<P>
	We support these changes toward this move to more fully 
recover the costs that are experienced in this area. However we 
also acknowledge the difficulties with giving any department 
both a monopoly on revenues and a monopoly on service 
delivery. Mechanisms must be in place to ensure cost effective 
delivery.
<P>
	Perhaps we should look closer at what the possibilities for 
privatization of these services are. We could probably even save 
the government more money if we looked at this whole area of 
privatization.
<P>
	We support this change. It makes the air transportation tax 
move toward a full cost recovery basis. Further moves in this 
direction should include changing the tax to a user fee 
administered by the Department of Transport. This would 
necessitate adequate competition in place to ensure cost 
effective delivery service.
<P>
	In summary, we are opposed to the amendments that the Bloc 
is making. We support the direction in which the government is 
going. It is not far enough but it is heading in the right direction. 
We would like to see it consider more privatization of this and 
more of a user fee cost recovery basis.

statutes without having to wait for particular statutes to be 
opened up for amendments of a more substantial nature.

studied by the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs 
and in the Senate by the Standing Committee on Legal and 
Constitutional Affairs.

	Both these committees, after studying the proposals, have 
come to the conclusion that they were not controversial and did 
not involve the spending of public funds. Also, they would not 
prejudicially affect the rights of persons and they would not 
create a new offence or subject a new class of persons to an 
existing offence.

	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Moments 
ago when the Chair asked for second reading of the bill I believe 
the bill was moved by the Minister of Health and seconded by a 
parliamentary secretary. Perhaps I could ask the House that the

<P>
seconder be changed to the government House leader to ensure 
that ministers have moved and seconded the bill.
<P>

General of Canada)</B> moved that the bill be concurred in.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> When shall the bill be read the third

<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the third time and passed.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to thank all 
members of the House for their co-operation in the passage of 
this bill. It has been done expeditiously and in the best interests 
has been debated fully.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Given 
the progress to date I think you might find unanimous consent to

with the various divisions on bills as agreed to on Friday and

<P>
	I might put on the record that the House leader for the Reform

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-37, an act to amend the Young Offenders Act and the Criminal 
Code, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to speak on Bill C-37 to amend the Young 
Offenders Act and the Criminal Code, and the amendment put 
forward by the Bloc. This bill has been introduced at this time 
only in response to the pressure exerted by certain radicals and a 
certain press thirsty for sensationalism which revels in fuelling 
the common perception that crime is on the increase among 
young people.
<P>
	Passed in 1984, the legislation has been amended twice, in 
1986 and 1992. Really, can the situation have already 
deteriorated to such a point that it now warrants introducing this 
bill?
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In his final report called ``Beyond the Red Book'', a workshop 
on recommendations for amendments to the Young Offenders 
Act, Mr. Doob of the University of Toronto said: ``We do not 
have a youth just crisis that requires immediate fundamental 
change in the Young Offenders Act. Members of the public, 
especially those in the media who purport to represent public 
opinion about crime, have for centuries expressed the view that 
youth crime is out of control. Youths commit a disproportionate 
amount of crime in society. They always have and always will. 
But changes in the Young Offenders act are not likely to have 
any measurable impact on crime''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In Quebec, a compromise has been struck between the 
principles of youth protection and societal protection.
<P>
	I would like to remind hon. members that a motion on this 
subject was adopted on May 5 last by the Quebec National 
Assembly. It read as follows: ``That this Assembly demand that 
any amendment to the federal Young Offenders Act respect 
Quebec's laws and policies with regard to youth protection''. 
The motion was unanimously endorsed by Quebec's two main 
political parties.
<P>
	In Quebec, youth protection workers help the young offender 
and his family discover the best options for reintegrating into 
society and the community. Of course, the system in place is by 
no means perfect, but at least it places equal emphasis on 
prevention programs and on rehabilitation and reintegration 
programs.
<P>
	The bill now before us does not provide this kind of balanced 
approach. On the contrary, the emphasis here is on repression in 
that the preferred option appears all too often to be referral to the 
courts, while no provision seems to be made for rehabilitation. 
With the passage of this bill, 16 and 17 year olds would have 
their cases proceed in adult court. For the purposes of the Young 
Offenders Act and the Criminal Code, the term ``young person'' 
now includes 10 to 16 year olds. Furthermore, depending on 
their age group, young persons will be treated differently by the 
courts.
<P>
	Although the legislation does not distinguish between 12 to 
15 year olds and 16 to 17 year olds, it is clear that as a result of 
these amendments, these two groups will be treated differently 
in the case of offences involving serious bodily harm. Some 
lawyers will argue that this flies in the face of section 15 of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which guarantees 
equal treatment to all under the law.
<P>
	While public safety demands that young offenders be 
sometimes kept in secure custody, rehabilitation should always 
be our overriding concern. Young persons who are in contact 
with other offenders are exposed to influences which fuel their 
delinquent behaviour.
<P>
	In an article published in <I>La Presse</I> on June 8, Mr. Trépanier, a 
criminologist and researcher at the Université de Montréal, 
reminded readers that: ``Quebec compares favourably with the 
rest of Canada. Quebec is the province where the number of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5603"> 5603 </A></B>
<P>
young people in drop-in and rehabilitation centres is the lowest, 
about half the Canadian average''.
<P>
	According to research done on crime rates in American states relying on punishment as a deterrent against crime, there is no significant difference as opposed to states having a different approach based on the fight against crime. In this regard, the Ame
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Getting back to the report ``Beyond the Red Book'': ``Few 
saw any serious problems with the act that could not have been 
remedied by proper and creative administration of the act. 
Repeatedly the view was expressed that the most serious 
problem in the Young Offenders Act was the way in which it was 
administrated in some provinces. Most cases involving violence 
that come under the control of the Young Offenders Act can be 
dealt with under the present legislation''.
<P>
	So much for the necessity of new legislation. What about 
increasing the severity of sentences?
<P>
<B>(1925 ) </B>
<P>
	In the same report Mr. Doob noted:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With adolescents, increasing the severity of dispositions has no real impact 
on offending behaviour; either for the youth before the court or other youths. 
That is, despite its apparent logic and appeal, increasing the severity of 
dispositions has neither specific nor general deterrent value-The data supports 
the conclusion that rehabilitation is more likely to be accomplished in 
non-custodial settings-It was suggested that if the federal and the provincial 
governments were serious about protecting the public, then the governments 
should invest money in prevention and in educating the public about youth 
crime. It is cheaper and more effective to prevent crime than to put kids in 
custody when they commit offences.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore, this bill is premature. We do not have a long 
enough experience, here in Canada, to assess the effects of the 
amendments introduced in 1992. I should remind members that, 
in 1992, the sentence for murder what extended to five years. 
However, such a sentence should also be imposed. At the present 
time, considering the lag time in the availability of statistics, we 
cannot determine the impact of this amendment. How can we 
justify what we are doing now? Why not wait for the results of 
the previous amendments before taking more repressive 
measures?
<P>
	Crime, lest we forget, is an extremely complex issue. 
Generally speaking, criminologists recognize that the causes of 
crime are many. Violence and crime are interconnected and it is 
therefore important to address the root cause of crime by 
impressing on young offenders at the earliest opportunity that 
they are responsible for their actions. Sanctions or penalties 
directly tied to the offence must be enforced. Automatic 
incarceration or isolation in secure custody have no 
rehabilitative value. The deterrent effect of these measures can 
even be called into question.
<P>
	Getting back to the question of public perception, last 
February, Jean Trépanier of the University of Montreal spoke at 
a symposium on crime and shared some statistics on the subject. 
According to Mr. Trépanier, only one in every six persons who 
commit an offence is a minor whereas the public's perception is 
vastly different. It is commonly believed that nearly 50 per cent 
of crimes are committed by young persons.
<P>
	The February 3, 1994 issue of <I>La Presse</I> reported that youth 
crime had even declined by 7.6 per cent in Quebec over the past 
15 years. The same is true for Montreal. The number of juvenile 
delinquents was reported at 10,145 in 1979, compared to 6,679 
in 1992. This represents a decrease of 34 per cent in 13 years.
<P>
	More recently in the June 8 edition of <I>La Presse</I>, Mr. 
Trépanier stated the following: ``According to Statistics 
Canada, the delinquency rate in Quebec per 100,000 residents is 
the second lowest in Canada after peace loving Prince Edward 
Island''.
<P>
	Over the past decade, the number of serious crimes such as 
murder, manslaughter and aggravated assault has either 
remained stable or declined.
<P>
	``The increase noted in the number of violent crimes is due to 
a large extent to a 127 per cent increase in minor assaults from 
1986 to 1991. According to national statistics on crime, a 
minority of young offenders are involved in crimes of a violent 
nature. In fact, only 13 percent of charges laid in 1991 were in 
connection with crimes of violence. However, nearly half of the 
charges laid against young offenders in 1991 involved first level 
assaults, which means that the offense was committed without 
the use of a weapon and that no bodily injury was inflicted upon 
the victim''.
<P>
	Tim Weiner from the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> reported in March 1991 
that ``one Canadian out of three is under the false impression 
that violence is as widespread in Canada, if not more, than in the 
United States.'' The fact of the matter is that a far greater 
number of violent crimes are committed in the United States 
than in Canada.
<P>
	The Americans have doubled their police forces and the size 
of private police forces has increased fourfold over the past 30 
years. Their inmate population has doubled over the past 10 
years to a record high of four per 1,000 residents, which is at 
least four times higher than anywhere else in the Western world. 
Yet, violent crime rates in the U.S. are three times higher than in 
other industrialized countries.
<P>
<B>(1930) </B>
<P>
	As for the transfer to adult court, the amendments to the 1992 
act clarified the applicable criteria to determine if a young 
offender must be transferred to adult court. Youth court must 
now take into account society's interest, in particular the 
public's protection and the teenager's reintegration into society, 
and determine if it is possible to reconcile these two objectives 
by keeping the teenager under its jurisdiction. If the court thinks 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5604"> 5604 </A></B>
<P>
that  it is impossible, society's protection prevails. The required 
mechanisms seem to be in place but the stakeholders refuse to 
use them.
<P>
	I now come back to the June 8 article in <I>La Presse</I>, which 
quotes Normand Bastien from the youth division of Montreal's 
community legal centre. He said: ``The real problems come 
from the fact that the average waiting periods before sentencing 
are too long-266 days on average in Valleyfield, 180 days in 
Montreal, 163 days in Joliette-and that only 29 per cent of 
problems are resolved''. So why this bill, since the current act 
already has adequate provisions to deal with young offenders?
<P>
	I repeat, a repressive law without rehabilitation measures and 
left to the discretion of various stakeholders will not bring the 
violence phenomenon under control. Current documentation 
does not support the argument that longer sentences act as a 
deterrent. As I said before, the American experience 
demonstrates the ineffectiveness of these coercive measures.
<P>
	To conclude on the transfer to adult court issue, it seems that 
the burden of proof will now rest with the young people 
themselves. Too bad for the presumption of innocence. All this 
is intended to silence some people who will never be satisfied. It 
makes light of the balance between deterrence and rehabilitation 
which has proven itself in Quebec. Above all, it encourages 
laxity in certain provinces.
<P>
	In the reading I have done on this bill, how does one explain 
some particularly troubling statistics concerning cases in youth 
court that resulted in a guilty verdict? In Quebec and the 
Maritime provinces, guilty verdicts were rendered in over 80 per 
cent of cases; in the Western provinces, barely 70 per cent; and 
in Ontario and Manitoba, 55 and 59 per cent. How come in 
Alberta, 34,372 people are accused and convicted out of a 
population of 1.2 million, compared to 16,000 in British 
Columbia? One province convicts half as many people as its 
neighbour. Are we not justified in thinking that we should pay 
more attention to the administration of justice instead of 
drafting new laws?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when the government introduced the Young Offenders Act and 
said that it intended to make some changes to the act it was very 
pleasing for me because if ever there was an act that needed 
modified it is the Young Offenders Act. However, that pleasure 
quickly faded when I found out that all the changes it really had 
in mind was just a little bit of tokenism.
<P>
	One of the major things we are concerned about of course is 
16 and 17 year olds and whether they are going to be treated as 
kids or whether they are going to be treated as adults when they 
commit crimes.
<P>
	The government has taken a little portion of this. It has said 
for 16 and 17 year olds it intends, most of the time at least, to 
raise them to adult court. The onus will be on them to show cause 
why they should not be tried in  adult court and why in fact they 
should be tried as young offenders.
<P>
	This raises two problems. One of the basic problems is if they 
are tried as adults while still being young offenders they are still 
treated differently than people who are regular adults being tried 
in that adult court.
<P>
	The second problem, and this is the larger one, is that we have 
a tremendous bureaucracy now. This bureaucracy is part of what 
drives the deficit and debt as high as it is and climbing 
continually.
<P>
<B>(1935 ) </B>
<P>
	What is going to happen is every time one of these young 
offenders is proposed to be raised to adult court we are going to 
have them appealing this and trying to fight it. What we are 
going to be faced with are trials to determine where the trial is 
going to be held, whether it is going to be in juvenile court or 
adult court. That is not doing anything to the legal system. That 
is not doing anything to resolve the problem of bureaucracy and 
it is certainly not doing anything to bring justice to this act.
<P>
	One of the things we think should happen is that the age 
should be dropped. Sixteen and seventeen-year olds should be 
tried as adults and should be classed as adults. We think the 
overall age should be dropped. If you have 10 and 11 year olds 
committing crimes there has to be some facility to deal with that 
other than saying that was not very nice and sending them home 
to their parents, especially when the government is also talking 
about changing the act so that even once they send them home to 
their parents the parents are powerless to do anything.
<P>
	Another thing the government is touching on, but again it is 
only tokenism, is identifying the criminal activities of young 
offenders. What we had proposed is that all crimes of 14 and 15 
year olds should be readily available through the media and for 
those 10 to 13 they should be made public if, in the judge's 
opinion, the need for the public to know and protect itself is 
greater than the need for confidentiality on the part of the 
offender.
<P>
	If you would consider a situation in which one of these young 
offenders may be exhibiting some form of violent behaviour and 
is released back to a classroom full of other children, should not 
the school authorities for one and the parents of the other 
children there know that there was a potential problem and take 
the necessary steps to ensure the safety of their own children?
<P>
	Another area that did not get touched on at all is the need to 
change the face of the way our correctional facilities work. What 
we need is a facility that bases its primary actions on education, 
skills training, community service and one other thing that the 
government seems loath to introduce, discipline. We do not have 
a structured type of system that is going to provide some type of 
education, some kind of knowledge so that they can become 
useful people instead of sitting in what often are considered 
country club resorts compared with what many law-abiding 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5605"> 5605 </A></B>
<P>
young people have on the outside. We  are doing absolutely 
nothing but making a mockery of our entire system.
<P>
	The final area where we believe there has to be some major 
change and something where the government did not even 
involve itself in tokenism on is the concept of parental 
responsibility. We believe that whenever there is a young 
offender and it can be shown that lack of parental control is a 
factor in the crime being committed then those parents must be 
responsible for identifying the victim for their losses.
<P>
	We will have some people arguing as to whether that is fair to 
the parents. Maybe the parents could not stop the problem. 
Maybe it is not really being fair to the parents of this young 
offender. We have to look at the two sides of it. On one side we 
have a parent, in the situation we are suggesting, and it has been 
demonstrated that their lack of exercising parental control was a 
contributing factor to the offence being committed.
<P>
	On the other side we have the victim. The victim is wholly 
innocent. There is no question of the innocence of a victim in 
these types of situations. Who really should have the financial 
burden placed upon them by the actions of this offender? Should 
it be a wholly innocent victim or should it be a parent who 
perhaps should have exercised more control in preventing that 
offence in the first place? If there is any injustice in this at all it 
certainly should be on the side of the one where there could be 
presumed certain responsibility for this. There is no question 
that it should not fall on the victim who is wholly innocent.
<P>
	We believe that these are basic changes to the act that must 
take place. The Liberal government has not addressed this 
concept whatsoever.
<P>
	One of the things that involves the Young Offenders Act and 
in fact the entire criminal justice system is what is this act in 
place for. Who are we trying to protect? Who are we trying to 
reward or make life easier for? Is it the victim or is it the person 
who perpetrates the crime? I suggest that we have to provide 
protection for the innocent people.
<P>
<B>(1940) </B>
<P>
	There may well be cause for people to say the poor youth, they 
have had a bad upbringing, they come from a broken home, they 
come from poverty. These things may all be true and may have 
in fact contributed to the person committing the crime.
<P>
	We have to deal with those issues separately. Our first premise 
is that we must protect law-abiding citizens and their property. 
The Young Offenders Act needs to be changed and the reason it 
needs to be changed is for protection of society at large and also 
for young people themselves who are the most frequent victims 
of juvenile crime.
<P>
	I had high hopes when they talked of introducing this change 
to the Young Offenders Act and I am very disappointed that they 
have gone half measure. On one  side, we might say that 
something is better than nothing but on review it seems that 
what they are offering us is nothing at all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to stand tonight to say a few 
words on this bill because it is one that we have been waiting for 
for a long time.
<P>
	Having brought it forward now, it is one that has improved the 
initial act. I am sure that all of us know of cases in which the 
previous act was applied and was not certainly considered 
sufficient for the crime and certainly not a corrective measure to 
any extent either.
<P>
	Some will say that there is a crisis with youth offenders today. 
Some will say there is not. We have hear that on the floor of this 
House. People who witness youth or adult crime know there is a 
problem. Communities that have witnessed a problem out there 
in youth crime know there is a problem.
<P>
	It is easy to judge from afar and from a save perch but when it 
comes home to people, that is the time that they get serious 
about these issues. Of course the media wants something 
spectacular or there is nothing newsworthy about it. Some will 
say that the media is responsible for the hype about issues and 
others will say that it is only reporting the news.
<P>
	Be that as it may, there is always room for improvement in 
legislation of this nature. Young people usually get their first 
sense of authority, their first feeling that there is authority 
around them, in the home. If they get the feeling at home, that 
there is an authority there, when they get out to face society they 
are able to handle it because they are accustomed to it.
<P>
	When youth are not accustomed to discipline, a sense of 
authority and sound practices in the home they rebel when 
suddenly confronted with it in society because they have always 
had their own way. When they cannot get their own way they 
become angry.
<P>
	I want to quote from paper written by Dr. Victor Szyrynski 
who is a well known medical doctor and doctor of psychiatry. He 
has a PhD as well. In his very learned way he says: ``Parents are 
the first people who gratify the child's basic needs and in this 
way provide him with evidence of their love and stimulate 
similar reactions in return''.
<P>
	At another stage in his paper: ``Generally speaking, security 
is provided by parental love. Here, however, in accordance with 
David Levy, we might consider the harmful aspects of ``too 
much love'' and ``too little love''. Children overfed with love in 
their early days by overprotective and overaffectionate parents 
find it too difficult to face the real frustrations present in the 
outside world''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5606"> 5606 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	Today we know that in the outside world people in a 
community have a fear of law breakers. There are home 
robberies reported that have been witnessed and there have been 
many business break-ins. Older people want security. When 
something happens in their community they have a great sense 
of fear.
<P>
	Medical attention becomes very important as a corrective 
measure while a young offender is incarcerated. It is all right to 
talk about long sentences and so on, but while that person is in 
prison they must receive the proper medical attention. If they 
are not ready to be back on the streets when their time is up then 
a very definite assessment should be made of the case at that 
time.
<P>
	I was interested in the words of the minister in his statement, 
his news release, on the day he tabled the bill when he said 
poverty, alcoholism, family violence, racism, illiteracy and 
many other factors may lead to criminal acts by young people 
and adults alike. Of course we have witnessed that from adults 
and young people alike. The conditions of our times certainly 
contribute to the moulding of the character of individuals today.
<P>
	The increased sentences for teenagers convicted on first 
degree murder would be ten years, seven years in and three years 
out in the community under supervision, and seven years for 
second degree murder, four years in and three years under 
supervision in the community.
<P>
	The personal injury offences would be in adult court unless 
they can show a judge that public protection and rehabilitation 
can both be achieved through youth court. They have to prove 
that they should be heard in youth court if they are 16 or 17 years 
of age. Otherwise they go to adult court.
<P>
	Those who have been convicted of murder in an adult court 
must serve before they can be considered for parole. It is 
important that a person who is not ready to be out on the streets 
should not be out there. I mentioned that a moment ago but I 
think this is one of the largest fears people had about the 
previous legislation, that a person would be out on the street. 
There were a number of cases that have been very well 
documented and very well publicized and of course it helped to 
really drive that point home.
<P>
	We know that in the present legislation the maximum 
sentence for young people convicted of murder in youth court is 
five years. It used to be three years. There is no parole in the 
youth system at the present time. However, the proposals that 
the minister brought in recently would increase sentences in 
youth court to ten years. There is a reason for it, and that is why I 
am repeating that particular part. With the previous three year 
sentence there was no timeframe for the medical attention that 
person should have been receiving and there was no medical 
attention for the proper assessment before they went back out on 
the street.
<P>
	The minister will be meeting with ministers of health from the 
various provinces and territories later this year on this very 
important provision. The provinces are in charge of health care 
and we must have the proper number of people involved in the 
system who are well qualified to make assessments on young 
offenders and to make recommendations for their treatment 
while they are in prison. If that does not happen the additional 
years are not going to mean very much. The person will only 
come out with the same attitude with which they went in.
<P>
<B>(1950) </B>
<P>
	In my view, and having gone through a couple of very 
traumatic situations with families who were involved with youth 
murders, it is a very difficult situation for them. It is very 
serious for the parents but it is also very serious for other people 
in the family. Certainly it is serious for the people in those 
communities, particularly if the communities are small and 
people know one another. I want to emphasize the importance of 
proper medical care for these young people once they are in 
prison.
<P>
	I commend the minister for increasing the sentences and 
lowering the age limit for people being brought into adult court. 
If measures of this nature are not taken, then crime will continue 
to grow among those people who are today laughing at the law. 
When people start smiling and laughing at the law it is not only 
they who are in trouble, our whole society is in trouble.
<P>
	This is very important legislation for this Parliament. It is 
very important to put it in place. The follow through is going to 
be very important because it is going to spell the success or the 
failure of this new initiative.
<P>
	I want to say to the ministers and to the members of the House 
that as this bill unfolds and as the legislation, the regulations and 
the provisions for medical care are brought forward there will be 
a number of us in the House watching the procedure very 
carefully to make sure that the proper provisions are being 
carried and that it is going to be useful to society and useful for 
the young offenders who get into trouble.
<P>
	A lot of improvements can be made if we have the proper 
discipline in the home and some direction in the home to begin 
with. We should encourage that while we are discussing this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on June 6, when I rose to support the amendment tabled 
by the Bloc Quebecois regarding the Young Offenders Act, I 
asked the Minister of Justice to say who, in Quebec, had hoped 
for such amendments. <B></B>
<P>
	I am still waiting for an answer, but I know that it will never 
come, because nobody in Quebec was in favour of such 
repressive changes as those proposed by the Minister of Justice. 
If there are people in favour of such changes, it has to really be a 
small minority. In fact, when I see the minister remain silent, I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5607"> 5607 </A></B>
<P>
think that it must be an  extremely small minority, otherwise I 
would have heard from him.
<P>
	As for me, I did not waste my time. I checked with those who 
are really concerned by this issue to find out what they thought 
of those amendments. I am referring to those who will have to 
implement the legislation. I consulted these people and no one, 
absolutely no one agreed with the bill. On the contrary, they all 
rejected it.
<P>
	On May 5, 1994, before Bill C-37 was tabled, Quebec's 
National Assembly voted almost unanimously in favour of 
asking the federal government to ensure that any amendment to 
the Young Offenders Act is in compliance with Quebec's laws 
and policies regarding youth protection.
<P>
<B>(1955) </B>
<P>
	After reading the report released by the Minister of Justice, 
the Quebec Liberal minister disapproved of the decisions made 
by its big brother and stated that he was concerned and 
disappointed by the position taken by the federal government on 
this issue. He is not the only one. Whether it is the official 
justice critic for Quebec, the Association des centres jeunesse 
du Québec, the Maison Bosco, the CUM Director, some Quebec 
police associations, renowned criminologists like Jean 
Trépanier and Marc Leblanc, and many more, all agree that the 
bill introduced by the minister is counterproductive and goes 
against the educational direction Quebec has been trying to 
follow for at least 15 years.
<P>
	We must realize that reactionary measures will not help us to 
overcome these problems. Things are far from perfect, but the 
direction taken by the province of Quebec is far more worthy 
than that chosen by the Minister of Justice. Despite some 
horrendous crimes that have been committed, this is not the time 
to blindly opt for repression and intolerance, which will only 
add to the problems instead of solving them. We should not use 
this issue to play petty politics, which the government seems to 
be doing by trying to pull a fast one on Reform members on the 
one hand and silencing the minority advocacy groups on the 
other hand.
<P>
	Yes, we must realize that the praiseworthy efforts made by the 
province of Quebec on this issue reaffirm once again its special 
status. Yes, from the debate on this issue and many others 
addressed here in this House, we can see that there are two 
countries within this country. The federal government is 
responsible for creating a greater gulf between our two people. 
It is slowly but surely helping us on our way to separation.
<P>
	It will all be explained in due course to Quebecers. Till then, 
however, I remind my constituents and Quebecers who almost 
unanimously opposed this bill that Ottawa just gave in to the 
mass hysteria that mainly took over western Canada and those 
hooked on televised information and isolated but sensational 
cases.
<P>
	The minister gave in this time and it is legitimate to ask 
ourselves if and when he will give in again. Will he do it when 
some members from western Canada ask to legalize corporal 
punishment against the young or to lower the age at which one 
can be indicted pursuant to the law or to return to capital 
punishment? What will the Minister do then? His actual stand 
worries me. Will he give in again? Unfortunately, if it can bring 
some temporary and irrealist glory, this heir apparent of the 
Liberal Party of Canada will undoubtedly do it.
<P>
	This issue is too important to put the interest of a politician or 
a party before that of society and especially that of the young. 
Should I remind the Minister that today's young are tomorrow's 
society? Even if they are given a prison sentence, they will come 
out some day. That is why education, social reintegration and 
rehabilitation are so important.
<P>
	More prisoners become real bandits than rehabilitated 
citizens. We must not fall into this trap. As I said, this bill does 
not solve anything and reflects a purely repressive philosophy. 
The government should understand this and withdraw the bill. 
Those national standards forced on Quebec, which does not want 
them, give its courts less flexibility in sentencing.
<P>
	As a Quebecer, I understand that the federal government 
imposes standards that are divorced from reality. In the end, 
these standards will fill up prisons, increase court costs and add 
to the legal red tape-all areas of Quebec's jurisdiction. That 
gives us another good reason to free ourselves from this 
constitutional straitjacket, where the federal government always 
did what it pleased while ignoring Quebec's demands and 
imposing national standards without any consideration for our 
legitimate wishes. But the time for that is almost past.
<P>
	I confess, I believed that the federal Minister of Justice was a 
progressive man who listens to those responsible for 
administering justice. Unfortunately, I was wrong; that is what I 
confess. I made a mistake, because had he been such a man, he 
would not have proposed such amendments. He could have tried 
to correct some problems in the enforcement of the law, within 
his own jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(2000) </B>
<P>
	We heard many members say in this House that the problem is 
not the act itself, but its application. Everybody knows that. 
Neither Quebec nor Ontario now for the last few years seems to 
have understood the intent of the Young Offenders Act. The rest 
of English Canada uses this act to put away problem teenagers. 
That is not the intent of the YOA.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5608"> 5608 </A></B>
<P>
	Do people really think that increasing sentences from 5 to 10 
years or even from 7 to 10 years will help us achieve the aims of 
the act? Do people really think that reversing the onus to force 
the young offenders to demonstrate that they should be 
proceeded against in youth court instead of adult court will solve 
the problem and help us achieve the aims of the act? Do 
members opposite think that? Are Reform Party members of this 
opinion? Does the government think that increasing the period 
of time that a young offender who has received a life sentence 
must serve before being eligible for parole will help us achieve 
the aims of the act?
<P>
	I have to believe that the minister did not ask himself these 
questions. The Liberal federal government, through its Minister 
of Justice, made a point of stating in clause 1 of the bill that 
crime prevention is essential to the protection of society and that 
a multi-disciplinary approach is needed to deal with this 
problem.
<P>
	It is even stated in clause 15 that an order of custody is not the 
solution. However, the bill provides absolutely nothing to 
strengthen what is stated. Finally, they try to put on a smoke 
screen, to put everybody to sleep, saying that it will pass without 
a hitch. Well, no, it will not pass without a hitch. In Quebec, we 
do not want this bill. We feel unanimously that this bill is 
harmful to youth and that is not the solution. The solution lies in 
the implementation of the act as it now stands. The solution lies 
in social rehabilitation.
<P>
	What I ask the Minister of Justice to do is simply to postpone 
this piece of legislation, not to have it given second reading in 
order that the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs 
can properly analyze the issue and report to this House. We will 
then see whether or not the act should be changed.
<P>
	For the moment, the minister is saying: I am bringing changes 
to it and you go and study it. This is not the way things are 
supposed to work. That is not the way to improve legislation.
<P>
	I would simply ask the minister to backtrack as common sense 
would require.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure tonight to address Bill C-37 
respecting the Young Offenders Act. Although I believe the 
government is perhaps considering changing the Young 
Offenders Act, I do not feel Bill C-37 really addresses the 
issues.
<P>
	I have two main concerns with the bill. One of them is the 
reverse onus that everybody seems to think is a real change, 
something that is going to make a real difference, sort of the 
meat and potatoes of the bill. I would argue that the reverse 
onus, which means that the youth courts will put the onus on the 
<P>
16 and 17 year olds to prove that they should be heard and dealt 
with in youth court, is really going to solve the problem.
<P>
	My concern is that the people presently in the youth court 
system are the ones who make a decision on whether or not 
youths 14 years old and up will be tried in adult court. These 
same people are the ones who will hear the cases of 16 and 17 
year olds and make the decision on whether they will stay in 
youth court.
<P>
	The past will show us that judges in the youth court division 
are very reluctant to place 16 and 17 year olds into an adult court 
to face the serious charges of murder, second degree murder and 
manslaughter. They seem to be very reluctant to have the 
younger people move up to adult court.
<P>
	I do not see that the bill will make any change. I do not see 
where these same people will force young people to be tried in 
adult court. What we will see is that the people who make these 
decisions will continue to allow 16 and 17 year olds to be tried in 
youth court.
<P>
<B>(2005 ) </B>
<P>
	One of the cases that comes to my mind is the young person 
who was convicted of killing Jessie Cadman. He was a young 
offender at the time of the murder. The youth court judge 
determined that he would be tried in youth court. It was only 
because of the pressure put on by the community that that youth 
judge was forced to consider adult court. Isaac Deas was 
eventually tried in adult court and was convicted of murdering 
Jessie Cadman.
<P>
	I suggest to this House that the same thing is going to happen 
where the youth court judges are going to act in favour of the 
young people and keep them in youth court as opposed to 
moving them into adult court. I do not feel that this change in the 
bill is going to make any bit of difference to the way that 16 and 
17 year old serious offenders are going to be treated. I have great 
concerns about that. I think it would have been a much stronger 
message for the government to automatically lower the ages so 
16 and 17 year olds are tried in adult court without any kind of 
dilly-dallying around in the youth court system.
<P>
	The other concern that I have is in lowering the ages. It 
concerns me when I hear some colleague from the Bloc 
suggesting that the only reason this government introduced Bill 
C-37 was because of complaining and hysterical comments 
from the west, that people in the west want to throw their young 
people in jail and throw away the key. I think they are 
misrepresenting what the people in the west are saying.
<P>
	Westerners are very concerned about the direction in which 
young people are headed and the way our justice system is not 
treating them. We suggest that young people and adults have to 
be responsible for their actions. For every action there is a 
reaction. If the action is serious, the reaction should be duly 
serious. If we have young people out there creating physical 
harm to other young people, young people who are murdering 
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5609"> 5609 </A></B>
<P>
with intent or without intent other young people or adults, they 
should take the responsibility for their actions.
<P>
	We are suggesting that 16 and 17-years olds are old enough to 
take that responsibility in an adult court situation. We are also 
suggesting that we cannot just forget about young people, 10 and 
11 year olds, who have made a decision to commit crime, things 
that they know are wrong. We have to bring them into the system 
so that we can deal with the problem at that early age. If the 
problem is showing itself at 10 and 11 years it is very important 
that the system deal with that problem.
<P>
	I suggest that when my colleagues from the Bloc say that 
people out west just want to lock away their kids and not deal 
with the problem, to ignore the problem, that perhaps they are 
ignoring the problem. Not too many weeks ago there was a 
15-year old boy who was stabbed to death in Hull. Last week or 
perhaps the week before a 10-year old boy took two loaded 
handguns to school and threatened his classmates.
<P>
	I suggest by not dealing with those problems, my colleagues 
are ignoring the problem in their province. If they really think 
that people in their province are not concerned about safety in 
their homes and on the streets and that young people bear the 
responsibility for their actions, they are fooling themselves. I do 
not think this problem only concerns western Canadians. I think 
it is a problem all Canadians are concerned about.
<P>
	The results of various polls show that people in my 
constituency, representing all different classes of people and 
economic situations, feel that we have to lower the ages to 10 
and 15 years old, and to let 16 and 17 year olds be dealt with in 
adult court. I received 3,500 replies to the poll included in my 
householder. Of those 3,500 replies over 90 per cent of the 
respondents were in favour of lowering the age.
<P>
	This is not an insignificant number. Over 90 per cent of the 
respondents of 3,500 replies feel that the age limit should be 
lowered.
<P>
<B>(2010) </B>
<P>
	In a poll separate to mine taken by the community newspaper 
only 12.7 per cent of the readers who responded felt that the age 
limit should be kept the same. Over 80 per cent wanted either to 
eliminate the age restrictions with the Young Offenders Act or to 
lower them. I would suggest that I am in a position of 
representing my constituency. It may be in western Canada, but 
it is telling me loud and clear that my constituency feels one of 
the major changes the government should have considered in its 
amendment to the Young Offenders Act was to lower the ages.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that another concern of mine was reverse 
onus. It will not make any difference at all. I do not think we will 
see any changes in the numbers of young people who are raised 
to adult court. It certainly will not deal with offenders who are 
under 16. The present act as it stands right now allows 14-year-
<P>
olds and older to be raised to adult court. I do not see the same 
kind of conditions in this piece of legislation.
<P>
	In summation, the only feeling of hope is that this is the first 
of two stages. The bill is only the first stage in amending the 
Young Offenders Act. The second stage, which is a 10-year 
review of the act, will allow the kinds of changes I feel 
Canadians are demanding, Canadians all across the country and 
not just in western Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words on second 
reading of the bill. I have been listening carefully to comments 
by both the Official Opposition and the Reform Party in respect 
of the bill. I want to make a few preliminary remarks in that 
regard.
<P>
	First, quite frankly the position of the Bloc Quebecois startles 
me. I was here in the last Parliament when the Conservative 
government introduced certain amendments to the Young 
Offenders Act. At that time the vast majority of members of 
Parliament from the province of Quebec were from the 
Conservative Party. They supported the bill. They supported the 
so-called strengthening of the Young Offenders Act at that time. 
They spoke as Quebecers, specifically stating that the people of 
Quebec wanted the Young Offenders Act strengthened, that 
there were problems with young offenders not only in Quebec 
but throughout Canada, and that it was necessary in order to 
make certain amendments.
<P>
	Unless I am not hearing things clearly, it would seem as if 
there has been a startling transformation in the opinions of the 
people of the province of Quebec as represented by the Bloc 
Quebecois. I find that a bit hard to believe. I am very interested 
in knowing where they are coming from. I find they are literally 
coming out of left field. They are not representing the people of 
the province of Quebec as I understood the concerns of the 
people of the province of Quebec for five years prior to the last 
election. Maybe things have changed but I honestly do not 
believe so. I have to discount much of what the Bloc Quebecois 
is saying with respect to the bill.
<P>
	Until I start hearing some realistic comment and I start 
hearing some acknowledgement that the Young Offenders Act 
applies exactly the same way throughout the country or does not 
apply exactly the same way throughout the country rather than 
hearing that those in Quebec do this and that as if there were a 
different Young Offenders Act in the province of Quebec, that is 
absolutely untrue because the Young Offenders Act applies from 
coast to coast to coast.
<P>
	With that said let me turn then to the bill and to the approach 
we in the Liberal Party have decided to take with respect to 
young offenders. We do not pretend that the act is perfect. We 
never have. It was clearly stated in the red book and in our 
campaign that we acknowledged the people of Canada were not 
happy, if nothing else, with the perception of how the Young 
Offenders Act was working. It may have been working 
extremely well. I am not one who believes it was but it may have 
been. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5610"> 5610 </A></B>
<P>
However that is not the important point. The important  point is 
that it was perceived and still is perceived by the people of 
Canada not to be working to the best effect that it could. We 
decided as part of our campaign strategy that we would agree to 
do something about the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	As soon as the Minister of Justice took office he began 
holding meetings with his colleagues in the Liberal Party to 
develop a strategy. The strategy that was developed was 
mentioned by my hon. friend, the last speaker. It was very 
clearly a two-stage process.
<P>
<B>(2015 ) </B>
<P>
	Stage one is to deal with the immediate concerns that we feel 
were brought to us by the people of Canada, namely, violent 
offenders, young offenders. Stage two is to conduct a complete, 
extensive section by section review of the act, taking as much 
time as is necessary, examining it in parliamentary committee, 
listening to the views and concerns of the Bloc Quebecois, of the 
Reform Party, of the Liberal government and anybody else who 
feels like coming in. For example, the the NDP might want to 
come in and make a contribution.
<P>
	When we take that second step process, we will then be able to 
examine and consider with the benefit of expert testimony and 
opinion the various points that have been made throughout this 
debate including, for example, lowering the age to whatever age 
it might be. Should it be 10? Should it be eight? Should it be 
seven as it was under the juvenile delinquents act? Why was it 
raised from seven to twelve? I do not know. Should it be moved 
down to 10? Should it be moved down to seven? These are the 
kinds of questions that are going to take some time to discuss.
<P>
	In the meantime we have something in front of us, Bill C-37. I 
really only want to spend the few minutes that I have on three 
sections. I would ask colleagues on the other side whether they 
agree or disagree with the preambles found in section 1 of this 
act which I am going to read in their entirety as they would 
amend paragraph 3(1)(a) of the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) crime prevention is essential to the long-term protection of society-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Who would argue that?
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-and requires addressing the underlying causes of crime by young persons and 
developing multi-disciplinary approaches to identifying and effectively 
responding to children and young persons at risk of committing offending 
behaviour in the future;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	All that says is that we have a problem. Let us see if we can 
figure out how to deal with it before the young offender offends.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a.1) while young persons should not in all instances be held accountable in the same 
manner or suffer the same consequences for their behaviour as adults, young 
persons who commit offences should nonetheless bear responsibility for their 
contraventions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	With great respect, I doubt very much if there are too many 
Canadians who would disagree first, that people  should bear 
responsibility for their contraventions and second, that children 
are not adults. In my view children should not be treated in 
exactly the same way as adults.
<P>
	Therefore the debate then becomes this. What is a child? 
Under what circumstances is the behaviour so egregious that it 
is necessary to take that child and say: ``Okay, you are not a 
child. For the purposes of what you have done, you will be 
treated as an adult''. Those circumstances are few and far 
between.
<P>
	They are delineated in section 8 of the bill dealing with 
section 16 of the Young Offenders Act. Those are very clearly 
set out. If a young person is alleged to have committed first 
degree murder or second degree murder, the taking of a life, it is 
something that is sufficient to take them out of the realm of 
being dealt with as a child.
<P>
	Second, attempting to commit murder, a very serious offence; 
manslaughter, technically one step below murder; aggravated 
sexual assault or aggravated assault, these are all violent crimes. 
They are the kinds of crimes which make people say that enough 
is enough, young people are not going to be allowed to do that 
and then be given the opportunity to be treated as if they had 
walked into a local Beckers store and stolen a chocolate bar 
because the two offences are entirely different.
<P>
	While society might tolerate a 13-year old who goes in and 
steals a chocolate bar, a pen, some books or a girlie magazine or 
whatever it may be, they are not prepared to tolerate that kind of 
behaviour if someone takes a life. The bill says in those 
circumstances, if you are 16 or 17, you are going to be tried in 
adult court unless you can demonstrate why you should not be. 
Anytime a line is drawn, any line, some will say the age is too 
high and others will say the age is too low, but the fact is that 
lines have to be drawn. In this case it seems to me that 16 and 17 
years of age is reasonable. You can drive a car at that age so if 
you are charged with committing a murder at that age, 
presumably you have the wherewithal to be able to be tried in 
adult court.
<P>
<B>(2020) </B>
<P>
	Now what about the perceptions of Canadians? I happen to 
have a petition signed by hundreds of people from the 
metropolitan Toronto area. I want to tell my friends in the Bloc 
that I absolutely refuse to believe that the people of 
metropolitan Toronto are any different from the people of 
Quebec, Montreal, Chicoutimi, or any other place when 
personal safety is at risk.
<P>
	The petitioners believe what this petition states. Whether the 
stats are exact is irrelevant. That is what they believe and this is 
what they have signed: ``Violent crime in Canada has increased 
by over 40 per cent since 1984. Youths age 12 to 17 although 
representing only 8 per cent of the population account for 23 per 
cent of all persons charged with criminal code offences''. As I 
said, it is not relevant whether or not the figures are accurate to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5611"> 5611 </A></B>
<P>
the exact percentage. What is more relevant is that people 
believe them to be true.
<P>
	The petition goes on: ``Canadians from coast to coast are calling for changes to the Young Offenders Act and for heavier penalties for all those convicted of''-and I underscore this-``violent crime''. That is the key. We do not want to lock these poor ki
<P>
	So the petitioners have asked that the Criminal Code of 
Canada and the Young Offenders Act be amended to provide for 
heavier penalties. Indeed what they see is the Liberal Party 
doing just that.
<P>
	We know the act is abused. In my riding there is a particular 
street where every night on any night of the week drug 
transactions are taking place. Most times children under the age 
of 12 are used to run the drugs or to carry the bags from the 
customer to the vendor. In exchange they get a nice gold bracelet 
or gold chain or some sort of bauble. The perpetrators, the scum 
of the earth who deal with drugs, use and abuse these children 
because they know there is no way the law can reach them. 
Believe me, many of these kids know exactly what they are 
doing regardless of their age.
<P>
	In preparing for the debate on the Young Offenders Act I 
spoke with my 11-year old daughter. I asked her a few questions 
about right and wrong in general, what she thought was right and 
what she thought was wrong and what her views were of the 
news. There is no doubt in my mind that she is a person who at 
age 11 knows precisely that if you kill somebody you are doing 
something wrong. She knows that if you take something that 
belongs to someone else you are doing something wrong. I have 
no doubt that is the case.
<P>
	I am very sympathetic to lowering the age, but I am prepared 
to wait to hear the evidence in committee. I am prepared to hear 
the departmental officials tell me why it was that in 1917 people 
were deemed capable of answering for their actions at the age of 
seven, whereas in 1984 it was felt that people could only be 
responsible enough to deal with their actions at the age of 12 and 
over.
<P>
	There may be reasons. There may be psychological studies, 
tests or any number of pieces of evidence to demonstrate a 
reason for the age of 12. Frankly, I rather suspect it is what I was 
talking about earlier. It was simply a question of drawing a line. 
If the line was drawn at 10 years there would be those who would 
say seven. If the line was drawn at 14 years, there would be those 
who would say 10 or 12. I guess for whatever reason, in 1984 our 
counterparts in Parliament chose the age of 12. I assume we will 
hear the reason in committee.
<P>
<B>(2025 ) </B>
<P>
	I underscore that we have a two-step process. Step one deals 
with the immediate violent criminals in the young offenders 
system. Step two will be a section by section examination of the 
act with recommendations to the justice minister and the 
cabinet. I have no doubt that everybody will have an opportunity 
for their input.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, whenever I 
have the honour and pleasure of rising to speak in this House, I 
always think of my constituents in the riding of Shefford, to 
whom I owe this privilege.
<P>
	This evening, I would like to present my views on Bill C-37 to 
amend the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	Because of my own training and education, I tend to favour 
the rehabilitation of young offenders over repressive measures. 
I believe that the present Act contains all of the provisions 
required by courts and prosecutors to adequately protect society.
<P>
	The real problem lies in enforcing of the provisions of the 
Young Offenders Act, not in subjecting it to an in-depth review. 
I understand that certain painful events in recent years have 
generated public anger and misunderstanding, and have fuelled 
the debate on how minors found guilty of very serious crimes are 
treated by the courts.
<P>
	I can see that the public is deeply concerned about the need to 
control youth crime, but I cannot tolerate people like the 
Minister of Justice, my colleagues across the floor-the 
Liberals-and my colleagues in the Reform Party believing that 
harsher sentencing is the best way to curb criminal activity 
among young people.
<P>
	Basically, the provinces which complain about the present 
Act do not enforce it rigorously; Quebec and Ontario, on the 
other hand, have the right attitude and see no problem with the 
Act. It seems to me, quite obviously, that the justice minister has 
yielded to the demands of the western provinces and the 
right-wing faction of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	I must question the relevance of this bill, since studies 
indicate that the average number of homicides committed by 
young people has declined sharply since the 1970s.
<P>
	Would it not be more accurate to say that the minister is 
simply trying to keep an election promise from the last 
campaign, armed with the knowledge that the Canadian 
Sentencing Commission, in its 1987 report, found that three 
quarters of the Canadian population believed that 30 per cent of 
crimes were violent? In reality, according to 1992 statistics, 
only one of every ten Criminal Code offences reported to police 
were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5612"> 5612 </A></B>
<P>
violent crimes. From 1982 to 1992, even the number of murders 
committed in Canada increased only marginally.
<P>
	This public perception is contrary to the reality as shown by those facts. Is this a sufficient political reason to change the Young Offenders Act? In my humble opinion, the Minister of Justice, by tabling this bill in the House, is only trying to look g
<P>
<B>(2030) </B>
<P>
	Is this what we want? Is this the effect that the Liberals, who 
are in power, and the Reform Party want? The Minister of 
Justice should try to prevent young people from committing 
criminal acts and should react effectively instead of taking 
harsher measures like longer sentences, lower age limits for 
young offenders and stiffer penalties.
<P>
	As a teacher, I worked for a long time with young people, and I 
can tell you that the solution is not to punish more harshly, but to 
help young people through better supervision and better efforts 
at reintegrating them into the community. I am deeply 
convinced of that. The deterrent effect of longer and harsher 
sentences is not supported by the literature and experiments to 
date.
<P>
	Crime prevention requires that we examine the economic, 
educational, social, moral and legal conditions that foster crime, 
and that we make an effort to correct those conditions. The 
co-operation of many departments, the private sector, and the 
community are needed. Developing effective crime prevention 
programs is a big challenge we have a duty to meet. The result of 
such programs, namely crime reduction, is much more 
advantageous to young people and to Quebecers and Canadians, 
who could otherwise become victims of crime.
<P>
	However, even the greatest efforts to prevent crime cannot 
eliminate crime altogether. Social rehabilitation of young 
offenders must therefore be one of the main objectives of the 
legislation. It is really a form of long term crime prevention 
aimed at making young offenders stop their reprehensible 
behaviour.
<P>
	The proposed amendments to the bill fly in the face of the 
objective sought, namely the protection of juveniles and of 
society.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to remind this House that Quebec is 
a distinct society, not only because of its language and culture, 
but also because of our beliefs, philosophy and social concerns. 
In Quebec, we know what are the main principles behind the 
protection of juveniles and of society. The objective is to avoid, 
as much as possible, criminalizing cases involving young 
offenders. First of all we seek the rehabilitation and 
reintegration into society of young offenders because, in  
Quebec, we believe that is the way to go. You would be surprised 
at the results we are getting.
<P>
	I would like to remind my colleagues that, under certain 
conditions, these young people can be helped to become 
productive and responsible adults for the good of society as a 
whole. Moreover, a cost benefit analysis shows that the money 
invested by society to rehabilitate a young murderer is paid back 
in less than five years when he becomes a productive adult.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to remind all my colleagues that it 
is essential for Quebec to maintain its own approach regarding 
the reintegration of young offenders. Therefore, I am asking 
them to take into consideration the fact that any amendments to 
the federal Young Offenders Act must respect Quebec 
legislation and policies regarding the protection of juveniles and 
of society.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, on May 12 of 
this year members on this side of the House presented an 
opposition day motion. The purpose of that motion was to call 
upon the government for positive and immediate action with 
regard to the Young Offenders Act. I commend the government 
for bringing forward so quickly some amendments which are a 
step in the right direction.
<P>
	I rise today however to demonstrate my lack of enthusiasm for 
this bill. I believe that although measures were taken they 
certainly are far from enough.
<P>
	In an attempt to help calm the fears of Canadians we proposed 
three basic amendments to the Young Offenders Act. The first 
was to have the age limits changed from 12 to 17 to 10 to 15. 
This was in recognition of the fact that there are offenders under 
12 years of age who currently slip through the system and go on 
to be full-fledged youth criminals because police are unable to 
charge them or to deal with them in any way. As for older 
offenders, we believe that youths aged 16 and 17 are old enough 
to assume full responsibility for their crimes and should 
therefore in serious cases be tried as adults.
<P>
	Under Bill C-37 the justice minister has proposed that 16 and 
17-year old youths who are charged with murder, attempted 
murder, manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault and aggravated 
assault be tried in adult court unless an application is granted for 
the youth cases to be heard in youth court. The onus is now on 
the young offender to demonstrate why he or she should not be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5613"> 5613 </A></B>
<P>
tried in adult court and the court will have the discretion to 
accept or reject the application.
<P>
	Although this amendment will be somewhat positive in nature it misses the point that we tried to raise some weeks ago. Sixteen and 17-year olds, given today's society and the rate at which our youth are maturing, according them the same degree of respons
<P>
	The Reform Party had proposed increasing sentencing. I am 
therefore pleased to see that the minister has recommended 
increased sentences for first degree murder from five to ten 
years. We also recommended that amendments to the Young 
Offenders Act include a permit to publish the names of young 
offenders who have been convicted of any offence involving the 
use of violence, who have contravened any Narcotic Control Act 
or Food and Drug Act or who have been convicted previously of 
two offences.
<P>
	Unfortunately Bill C-37 has failed to provide this amendment 
and it is this topic I wish to elaborate on today. I firmly believe 
that the publication of the names of young offenders is essential 
for the protection of Canada's innocent children. For example, a 
school principal may not know that one of his students had been 
convicted numerous times for drug trafficking. A parent may not 
know that his child is associating with an offender convicted of a 
series of rapes. The young man next door whom you have 
entrusted to babysit your children could be another Jason 
Gaumache.
<P>
	Who should we be protecting, the vast majority of Canadians 
who are law abiding, hard working and caring people who will 
continue to be the building blocks for a productive society or the 
local high school's drug dealer or an unknown rapist in the 
neighbourhood? I do not think that is a hard question to answer. 
Undoubtedly it is these offenders who must be made known to 
our society.
<P>
	We are not talking about the youth who makes a small mistake 
and comes in contact with the justice system on a single 
occasion wherein the best interest of the public may not be 
served by publishing the details. However, we do propose and 
firmly believe that in order to make community protection the 
number one priority, the publishing of violent youth offenders' 
names must not be prevented by law as it is today and is 
continued in Bill C-37.
<P>
	The first penalty paid for committing a criminal offence 
against society ought to be full disclosure of who you are, where 
you come from and what you have done. This is completely 
exempted from this act and from the amendment.
<P>
	The names of victims and the horrific details of the crimes 
perpetrated on them are open to public scrutiny but the names of 
the offenders remain a state secret. The young faces in Canada's 
courts and jails are like masks. They hide society's ugliest scars, 
scars that will fester if they are not exposed.
<P>
<B>(2040 ) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party on behalf of our many constituents had 
asked the government to establish a registry of child sex 
abusers. The government has provided its typical response to a 
request of this nature. It knows there is a problem. It knows 
Canadians want something done about it. Therefore it has 
promised to study the issue and consult the proper authorities. In 
other words, the government is dragging its feet and in the 
meantime children will continue to be sexually abused and 
violently attacked by repeat offenders that the government is 
guilty of protecting by refusing the public the information they 
need to protect their children and society in general.
<P>
	In their effort to understand the need for a child registry, 
Health Canada, Justice Canada and the Ministry of the Solicitor 
General commissioned a study. The federal ad hoc 
interdepartmental working group on information systems on 
child sex offenders prepared a discussion paper. Do you know 
what the conclusion of that study was, Mr. Speaker? We need 
another study and we need further consultation. However, 
contained in that paper is information which clearly indicates 
both the need for the child registry and for the publishing of 
young offenders' names.
<P>
	I really have to wonder what purpose all these studies, 
reviews, consultations and more consultations serve. Are they to 
find viable solutions to problems we already know exist or are 
they a means to keep full the hands the taxpayers are feeding at 
the present time?
<P>
	The ad hoc group reports that current research indicates that 
the development of sexually intrusive behaviour may begin as 
early as childhood and adolescence. The report goes on to say 
that statistics compiled on all violent crime committed against 
children in Canada indicate that young offenders, those aged 12 
to 17, account for approximately 23 per cent of all accused 
offenders.
<P>
	It is important to note that the same age group only represents 
7.9 per cent of the Canadian population. Studies have repeatedly 
indicated, states the report, that sex offenders have one of the 
highest recidivism rates of any criminal group with an estimated 
40 per cent reoffending within five years of release. 
Furthermore research examining the effectiveness of offender 
treatment programs has shown limited results.
<P>
	I ask, does the right hand of the government know what the 
left hand is doing. Did the Minister of Justice not read the report 
of the federal ad hoc group? If he did, he would know that sex 
offenders reoffend. If he could do simple calculations he would 
know from the statistics that 23 per cent of sex offences in 
Canada are committed by young offenders. If 40 per cent of that 
23 per cent reoffends, violent, sadistic acts will continue to be 
committed against the most innocent and vulnerable members 
of our society and the government could have prevented it. If it 
had read its own report and acted  immediately on the findings of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5614"> 5614 </A></B>
<P>
that report, unspeakable acts and attacks upon our children 
could have been thwarted.
<P>
	However I believe the government is in direct contravention 
of article 34 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child which 
states: ``States, parties undertake to protect the child from all 
forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse''.
<P>
	Bill C-37 does not undertake to protect our children from the 
Jason Gamaches of this world. It does not protect us from the 
faceless, nameless monsters who pose behind the masks of 
adolescence.
<P>
	The government is in direct violation of the UN Convention 
on the Rights of the Child. Furthermore the weight is still 
balanced in favour of the young offender. The protection of 
society, the protection of our children, is still outweighed by the 
so-called rights of violent and delinquent young Canadians.
<P>
	All we are asking is that the scales be evened out, that the 
rights of the victims, and the rights of the potential victims, that 
is the rights of our children, be given priority and that the 
protection of society outweigh the protection of violent young 
offenders who have no respect for the lives and the rights of 
others.
<P>
	I reiterate my opening remarks. Bill C-37 is a step in the right 
direction but the stride is not long enough for the people walking 
on my side of the street.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 45(5)(a), I 
have been requested by the chief opposition whip to defer the

<P>
	Accordingly, pursuant to Standing Order 45(5)(<I>a</I>), a recorded 
division on the question before the House stands deferred until 
tomorrow at 3 p.m., at which time the bells to call in the 
members will ring for not more than 15 minutes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Perhaps 
Your Honour could find unanimous consent in the House to 
delay the adjournment for a maximum of 15 minutes.
<P>
	I understand that the member representing the New 
Democratic Party participating in the adjournment debate has 
not yet had time to physically reach the Chamber. We could 
adjourn to the call of the Chair for a maximum of 15 minutes. If 
the member has not arrived by then at least the House would 
have done the respectful thing, that is given a reasonable 
opportunity for the member to attend.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I rise on a point of order, 
Mr. Speaker. I say to the hon. member across the way that I too 
was running to the House to try to speak on the last debate so I 
think if we are not here in our seats we are not here in our seats. 
If such is not the case then I would like to rise to speak to the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We took the vote. The Chair should 
indicate to the hon. member that I made note of the fact he was 
not in the Chamber. I knew he wanted to speak, but because he 
was not in the Chamber we had to go on to the vote, at least the 
voice vote.
<P>
	Whether the House wants to give unanimous consent to let the 
member speak is entirely a question for members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, do I understand there is 
unanimous consent to suspend the commencement of the 
adjournment debate to the call of the Chair or a maximum of 15 
minutes in order to permit the New Democratic Party member to 
attend in the House?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair takes it that there is not 
unanimous consent to suspend for 15 minutes to give the 
member for Kamloops a chance to participate in the 
adjournment debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Perhaps I could rephrase.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is unanimous consent to wait 15 minutes. Is that 
agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, the House theoretically would 
now be suspended until ten o'clock unless we give that 
unanimous consent because that is the adjournment time. The 
adjournment debate would take place at that point.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5615"> 5615 </A></B>
<P>
	Perhaps I could ask the question again, whether we could 
agree to wait a maximum of 15 minutes or until the appearance 
of the member in order to proceed with the adjournment debate. 
If not, I would remind hon. members that they will be waiting 
one hour and 10 minutes instead of 10 minutes. Perhaps that 
would help the House a little.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Somebody will be waiting an hour and 
10 minutes. I am not sure it will be members of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, may we call it ten o'clock and 
adjourn?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member is asking for unanimous 
consent to call it ten o'clock. Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is unanimous consent to call it 
ten o'clock.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 38(5) the motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. The House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m.
