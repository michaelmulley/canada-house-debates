	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have received notice of a number of points of 
privilege with which I propose to deal immediately. As members 
know, points of privilege are the most important points so I intend 
to hear them immediately. The first point of privilege I will hear is 
by the member for Crowfoot.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
question of privilege and I wish to place my case before you this 
morning.
<P>
	Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 24 reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The distinctive mark of a privilege is its ancillary character. The privileges of 
Parliament are rights which are absolutely necessary for the due execution of its 
power. They are enjoyed by individual Members because the House cannot perform 
its functions without unimpeded use of the services of its Members.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Committee members provide a service to the members of the 
House. By not reporting a bill back to the House a committee 
impedes members from performing their legislative duties.
<P>
	On December 13, 1994 Bill C-234 was referred to the justice 
committee by a majority of votes in the House. The Minister of 
Human Resources Development and the member for Vancouver 
Quadra, along with 72 of their colleagues, the hon. member for 
Saint John and the Reform caucus voted to send Bill C-234 to the 
committee, engaging its services to conduct a thorough review and 
investigation of this private member's bill and then report back to 
the House.
<P>
	We expected the bill to be reported back to the House so that this 
House could make the final determination on the bill and not just a 
few committee members beyond the authority of the House.
<P>
	It is this House that gave life to the bill and only this House has 
the authority in its final determination. For the committee to kill a 
bill which was given life by this  House and a majority of its 
members is a violation of our privileges as members of Parliament.
<P>
	The committee decided that Bill C-234, which became Bill 
C-226, was not to be reported back to the House. It was this action 
which has breached my privileges as a member of this House.
<P>
	The Liberal members of the committee voted on each and every 
clause of this private member's bill and they voted not to report it 
back to the House. The Liberal members killed Bill C-226. The 
members of the justice committee are in contempt of Parliament 
for their actions.
<P>
	Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 639(1) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A bill must pass through various stages, on separate days, before it receives the 
approval of the House of Commons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Citation 679(2) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To commit a bill means to refer it to a committee, where it is to be considered and 
reported.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I suggest reported back to this House.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if you rule this is a prima facie question of privilege 
I am prepared to move the appropriate motion.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to the point raised by the hon. 
member. Respectfully I disagree with him when he indicates that 
the action taken by the committee was wrong, that it breached his 
privileges and that some members were in contempt of Parliament.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am sure you will recall that the last session of 
Parliament dealt with a bill known as Bill C-203. It was dealt with 
at that time in committee H under the former structure. The 
committee was very ably chaired by the hon. member for Welland. 
Bill C-203 at that time, in committee, was killed by an action of 
certain members who moved that the deliberations on the bill be 
terminated sine die. In other words, the action of the committee 
made the bill disappear.
<P>
	That issue was dealt with by the chair of the committee at the 
time, the hon. member for Welland. Then it was raised in the House 
by another hon. member. On February 26, 1992 the hon. member 
for Edmonton-Strathcona rose in the House and claimed that this 
was an issue of privilege and that the action of the committee was 
wrong.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4198"> 4198 </A></B>
<P>
	In a subsequent ruling by the then Speaker of the House of 
Commons it was determined that in fact this was not privilege and 
the matter was dropped.
<P>
	The action on Bill C-203 was far deeper than the one brought to 
our attention today by the hon. member. It was not just a committee 
which determined that the bill should not be reported, it was 
actually a motion that the bill be killed in committee. Even that was 
not ruled to be unparliamentary by the Speaker at the time.
<P>
	By the way, the motion that was put by the committee, that the 
consideration of the bill be terminated sine die, was ruled by the 
chairman of the committee at that time, the hon. member for 
Welland, to be totally in order.
<P>
	I am sure, Mr. Speaker, that with the two excellent rulings I have 
just brought to your attention you would agree with me that this is 
not a case of privilege.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Welland is quite the fellow I 
understand. Is this on the same point of privilege?
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a few 
different points to add to this point of privilege-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Would the hon. member respond? Is this on 
the same point of privilege?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> It is on the same point, Mr. Speaker, with 
additional information.
<P>
	Before I present my arguments on the point of privilege I would 
like to reflect what the government whip said in the arguments he 
put forward. The instance that he talked about referred to deferring 
on a sine die basis and we are talking here about an entirely 
different situation.
<P>
	I believe that my privileges and the privileges of the House have 
been breached. The justice committee has thwarted the rights of 
individual members to discuss a private member's bill-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt, but I have just been told 
we have no interpretation. There must be some technical problem.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Will the hon. member stand down until we get this small 
problem resolved?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We can resume, as everything seems to be working now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am sorry. The hon. member may continue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Again I would like to 
reiterate my original comments in rebuttal to the arguments put 
forward by the government whip. He pointed to an incident where a 
bill was deferred sine die, without a date, so that it might be 
recalled at some future indeterminate date. There is a major 
difference between deferring it to some future point and deciding 
unilaterally that a committee will not deal with the issue. Note the 
specific difference.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to continue by putting my argument on this point of 
privilege. I feel that my privileges and the privileges of the House 
have been breached.
<P>
	The justice committee has thwarted the rights of individual 
members to discuss a private member's bill on the Criminal Code 
and has instead promoted the interests of a ministerial bill, Bill 
C-45, above the interests of a private member's bill on exactly the 
same matter.
<P>
	The order of precedence and the logical conclusion to debate Bill 
C-234 was ignored. According to Beauchesne's 6th edition, 
paragraph 1010, after committee consideration, a bill such as this is 
placed back on the Order Paper for consideration in the House at 
report stage.
<P>
	The subject of Bill C-234 is section 745 of the Criminal Code. 
By not reporting the bill back to the House, the justice committee 
has unduly intervened in the performance of all members' 
individual legislative duties. The committee has obstructed the 
rights of all parliamentarians. It has also given the appearance of 
prejudice toward the minister and the government.
<P>
	Erskine May's 21st edition states that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of Parliament in the 
performance of its functions, or which obstructs or impedes any member or officer 
of such House in the discharge of his duty, or which has a tendency, directly or 
indirectly, to produce such results may be treated as contempt even though there is 
no precedent for this offence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	By not reporting back to the House, the justice committee has 
interfered in two ways. First, it decided that the business of a 
minister was more important than due process or the business of a 
private member. Second, the committee has circumvented the 
authority of the whole House in this decision. On an issue as 
important as this one, the matter should have been brought to the 
House for a decision.
<P>
	According to Beauchesne's, 831(2):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A committee is bound by, and is not at liberty to depart from, the Order of 
Reference. (Bourinot, p. 469.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In this case, the committee circumvented the order of reference. 
In so doing it has created the appearance of preferential treatment 
to the government. Members cannot fulfil their duties if the 
committee does not report back to the House.
<P>
	Joseph Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I>, page 14 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4199"> 4199 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Individual privileges of members of the Senate and House of Commons are the 
absolute immunity they require to perform their parliamentary work; corporate 
privileges are the necessary means for each House to effectively discharge its functions. 
Thus a breach of any privilege constitutes a contempt of the House rather than of the 
member-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, if you rule this to be a prima facie question of 
privilege, I am prepared to move a motion. Again, I draw your 
attention to the fact that the committee decided not to report back 
the House rather than deferring it sine die as the government whip 
would suggest.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> From what I can gather, the point being made 
today is that a decision that was taken in committee should be 
reported to the House. I believe that is the point that is being made.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I take every point of privilege as a very important 
point. I want to hear debate on it but if a point has been made I 
would appeal to hon. members not to intervene to make the same 
point.
<P>
	If there is another point which needs to be made on this point of 
privilege then I am prepared to hear it. However, members will 
understand that as your Speaker I reserve the right, if I do not hear a 
new area being discussed, that I will probably not hear all of what 
is being said.
<P>
	Do I have another intervener on the same point of privilege? The 
hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I believe I have additional information on this topic.
<P>
	I rise to support the hon. member's question of privilege. By not 
returning Bill C-234 I too believe that the privileges of this House 
have been breached. How can we as members fulfil our function as 
legislators if committees refuse to report bills back to this House?
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	From Joseph Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I>, 
pages 12 and 13:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In order to perform its function as a legislative body, a legislature requires 
absolutely certain privileges, rights or immunities; that is to say, it cannot carry on 
unless it has them. It will be seen that a distinctive mark of a privilege is its ancillary 
character or subordinate nature. It is a means to accomplish a purpose or fulfil a 
function.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I say the members of the justice committee are in contempt of 
Parliament for refusing to send both Bill C-234 and my own bill, 
Bill C-245, back to the House. In both cases the bills were referred 
to committee by a majority of members, unanimously in the case of 
my grandparents bill, and we deserve to have an opportunity to 
know what transpired.
<P>
	A committee is a creature of the House but it is not supreme and 
should not make assumptions about what the House may want to 
consider. It should consider and report all bills referred to it as 
part-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> With the greatest of respect to you, my colleague, 
I believe the point being made was made a little earlier. I am taking 
notice of what has been said. I suggest that from what I can get 
from the point of privilege of the hon. member for 
Mission-Coquitlam, this is the same area that has been covered.
<P>
	Is there any new information members want me to take under 
consideration before making my decision? I will hear from the hon. 
member for Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to add one or two points on this point of privilege. As 
has already been mentioned and as you can tell today, many 
members have written to you and have expressed this problem with 
the privileges of all members of the House, not just in the Reform 
caucus, although certainly we are bringing it to your attention.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, we cannot overemphasize the need for you to deal 
with this very seriously, as I know you will. Each of us goes to a lot 
of work on these private members' bills. I have two more coming 
out of a 15,000 name petition which will come to the House. That is 
why we treat them seriously, and I know that you do.
<P>
	The only other point I could add to this, which has been well 
stated already, is that there is also the established practice of the 
House. As you are well aware, when you are presented with two 
amendments at report stage, one calling for the deletion of an entire 
clause and one calling for an amendment of a clause, you group 
those together, we debate them together and that is the way they are 
dealt with.
<P>
	However, you always call the question on the deletion before the 
amendment. In other words, you let the House decide if it wants to 
delete it entirely or if it wants to amend it. In this case, what has 
happened in committee is that we are not able in the House to deal 
with whether the House wants to delete it in its entirety and deal 
only with an amendment. Our chance to debate that, discuss that 
and vote on it has been taken away from us because it has been 
deleted in committee and we have not had that chance to vote.
<P>
	I ask that, taking the established practice Speakers have worked 
with in the past, you work with that to see that it is a case of 
privilege that we have not been able to discuss the points that we 
should be able to here in the House. Our privileges have been 
contravened.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are a 
number of quotations I would like to have given you from 
Beauchesne's and Maingot, but I will not go through that. Some of 
my colleagues have already done that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4200"> 4200 </A></B>
<P>
	However, I make reference to one with regard to former Bill 
C-226, now Bill C-234, and how it was handled in committee. I 
refer to page 12 of Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I> 
where he describes that function:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Parliamentary privilege is the necessary immunity that the law provides for 
members of Parliament, and for members of the legislatures of each of the ten 
provinces and two territories, in order for these legislators to do their legislative 
work.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What we are saying is that our parliamentary privilege was taken 
away by that committee, when a group that has a majority of 
government members on it, Liberal members, decided it did not 
like what was in the bill. It said that bill would not be reported back 
to the House.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	On that basis, as a private member it took away my 
parliamentary privilege, my right to speak to the bill, to debate it on 
behalf of Canadian citizens and maybe to have the opportunity of 
keeping murderers in this country in prison for 25 years.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Once again, the point was made and the hon. 
member for Lethbridge was giving greater assurance and more 
information with regard to his agreement with a certain part. I have 
let the hon. member say that. Once again I appeal to members that 
if they have another point to make, rather than simply saying they 
agree with this or that, I would be willing to hear new points on this 
matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my colleagues have pointed out the sections of 
Beauchesne's that apply to this question of privilege. I believe this 
action is a breach of privilege. As my colleagues have said, it has 
impeded my ability to function as a member of Parliament.
<P>
	Here is the point. A handful of members on the justice 
committee simply cannot arbitrarily decide if they are not going to 
report a bill back to the House and in that process denying members 
an opportunity to consider the bill at report stage. That is a fact.
<P>
	The justice committee is not an entity apart from this legislature. 
It is an integral part of the legislative process and the functioning of 
the House. It has a duty to consider bills sent to it by the House and 
return them with or without amendments.
<P>
	Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 639(1) says a bill must pass 
through various stages, on separate days, before it receives the 
approval of the House of Commons.
<P>
	One of those stages must be report stage. However, the justice 
committee has decided to unilaterally alter the legislative process 
by not reporting the bill back to the House. This is wrong. I cite 
Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 679(2):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To ``commit'' a bill means to refer it to a committee, where it is to be considered 
and reported.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I also believe Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 831(2) may be 
of some help to you. I am sure you understand this one:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A committee is bound by, and is not at liberty to depart from, the Order of 
Reference. In the case of a committee upon a bill, the bill committed to it is itself the 
Order of Reference to the committee, which may only report it with or without 
amendment to the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is pretty clear that the justice committee has acted in an 
inappropriate manner.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Once again, this is a reiteration of areas we have 
gone into before. I once again ask that if members have a new point 
to be made, that is fine. They may rest assured that should I take 
this under advisement, and I am in the process of making up my 
mind now, I will research this whole area completely.
<P>
	I want to give that assurance to the hon. member for Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
refer you to Standing Order 98(1):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When a Private Member's bill is reported from a-committee-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The clear wording of the standing order is ``when'', not ``if''.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as hon. colleagues have pointed out, we feel this is a 
breach of our privilege. I point out that this was passed twice to 
committee by the House. As hon. members how can we fulfil our 
responsibilities as legislators if a committee sets itself up superior 
to the judgment of the House by deleting every clause in the bill 
passed by the House not once but twice, rather than being a servant 
of the House, which I believe committees are?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member. He is going over ground 
I heard this morning.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member for Wild Rose to be very precise if 
he has something new to add to this debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be very brief. It is with reference to the same point of privilege.
<P>
	I have been sent here, as we all have, to represent the people of 
Canada and to ensure that proper laws are in place to protect them. 
The people of my constituency of Wild Rose were expecting me to 
have a registered vote on a final vote for Bill C-34 in support of it. I 
am being denied that opportunity and I think that is wrong.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I appeal to members again that if there is a new 
point I want to hear it. I want to hear all the new points. But if it is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4201"> 4201 </A></B>
<P>
simply a reiteration of what has gone  on before I know members 
will appreciate that I will move in a little sooner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the points have been amply made and I will be very brief.
<P>
	I was the one who seconded the bill and I would have introduced 
another bill if this bill had not proceeded through the House. 
Therefore I feel my privileges have been breached because that 
opportunity is now gone and I feel it is really important. If you rule 
this to be a question of privilege, I am prepared to move the 
appropriate motion.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Prior to the adjournment the hon. member for 
York South-Weston reserved the right to speak on a point of 
privilege. Is this the point of privilege the hon. member was 
referring to?
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it was not my intention this morning to make submissions with 
regard to the point of privilege I raised with you prior to the 
adjournment of the House on June 19, 1996. As the sponsor of Bill 
C-234, I feel compelled to make submissions with respect to this 
point of privilege.
<P>
	It seems the matter before the House this morning is not one that 
is partisan in nature but one that deserves the very careful 
consideration of the Chair.
<P>
	I am not about to impute any motives to the Justice committee or 
to any other committee as to the reasons why it may or may not 
have decided to report my bill back to the House.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker is the custodian of the rights and privileges of all 
members of Parliament in the House. That is why I request that you 
not deal with this matter summarily and render a decision today, 
but rather that you reserve judgment on this matter and give careful 
consideration not simply to the precedents because, as you know, 
the precedents could be interpreted in many different ways, but that 
you look at this issue from the point of reference of today.
<P>
	Given the commitment of various committees of the House and 
the government for parliamentary reform, it is important to look at 
the private members' process. In my respectful submission, if there 
is to be any integrity at all to the private members' process it 
should not be left up to the majority of government members of any 
given committee, whether it be the present government or any 
other government, to undermine the process or the integrity of the 
process in any way.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	All members of this House have committed themselves to 
parliamentary reform. When the supreme body on Parliament Hill, 
the House of Commons, makes a decision with respect to a bill, I 
would suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that it is not up to a committee 
of this House,  even a standing committee of this House, to thwart 
the wishes of the House of Commons itself.
<P>
	The House of Commons passed Bill C-234 dealing with the 
repeal of section 745 of the Criminal Code, a provision which 
allows first degree killers to apply for early release. This House in 
its wisdom decided at second reading to support the bill in principle 
and to refer it to the committee. That was the decision of the House. 
If you allow the decision of the justice committee to stand, in effect 
you are allowing the justice committee to thwart the wishes of this 
House.
<P>
	What did this House want to happen to that particular bill? It 
wanted the bill to be sent to committee for consideration. 
Presumably everyone in this House expected at some point after 
due consideration and recommendation from the committee that it 
would be brought back to this House for further consideration and 
for a final vote.
<P>
	This is an important matter. If we as members of the House of 
Commons are truly committed to parliamentary reform and to the 
whole private members' process, I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that 
you rule that the committee was not within its jurisdiction to do as 
it did.
<P>
	In conclusion I should also point out that my office has been 
advised that this is a practice which is developing as of late, the 
practice of standing committees of this House deciding not to refer 
back to the House of Commons matters that have been referred to 
them by the House of Commons. Mr. Speaker, I think you should 
take note of that fact as well.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am going to take the advice of the hon. member 
for York South-Weston and I know my colleagues will give me 
time to reflect on this.
<P>
	I intend to make a complete review of everything that has been 
said today. I also intend to review all of the precedents. I will 
consider the matter and I will get back to the House at a date in the 
near future.
<P>
	If there are no further points on this point of privilege, I will 
report back to the House after I have done research and I will let 
you know my decision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise with the 
intention of possibly coming to the assistance of the Chair in some 
manner.
<P>
	I know that the government and the private members of this 
House are very concerned about this issue and would like to see it 
dealt with. It is a very important decision and I know, Mr. Speaker, 
you will bring back a decision with regard to the presentations that 
were made here today.
<P>
	On the point of order in terms of the order of business, I was 
wondering if there would be any consideration by yourself, Mr. 
Speaker, through government, with regard to Bill C-45 which is on 
the Order Paper today. Possibly the House leaders could get  
together with members of the justice committee and request that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4202"> 4202 </A></B>
<P>
they report back on Bill C-234 and we could then deal with that bill 
in terms of that principle. Following that, we could deal with Bill 
C-45. We would then be able to make a judgment with regard to the 
matter of that substance.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> You know of course that your Speaker is loath to 
give direction to the House leaders. I believe you have been 
functioning well and you will continue to function well. Any 
negotiations that go on will be done by the House leaders. I will 
come back to the House on the point of privilege and you will be 
having my decision in the very near future.
<P>
	Am I to deal with any other points of privilege today?
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did send you a notice in writing 
that I would like to speak on a point of privilege on what happened 
on my own bill. I believe my privileges and the privileges of this 
House have been breached on it.
<P>
	It is wrong for a group of members, in this case the justice 
committee members, to deny the majority, that is-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> With the greatest of respect to my colleague, I 
believe what you are dealing with is the same point of privilege that 
I am going to deal with as I mentioned a little bit earlier. If indeed it 
is not, I wonder if I might ask the hon. member for 
Mission-Coquitlam if it is an entirely new point of privilege after 
she hears my decision then perhaps we could return to that point at 
that time. Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Agreed.

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-216, in Clause 1, be amended by replacing line 11, on page 1, with the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``vice''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, 
speaking on behalf of the official opposition and all fellow 
members of the Bloc Quebecois, now we are all gathered here at 
the beginning of this session, I would like to express our sympathy 
and solidarity with all the people in Quebec, in the Saguenay, on 
the North Shore and in the Eastern Townships, who went through 
such difficult times as a result of the natural disasters that struck 
this summer.
<P>
	Our sympathy and solidarity are also with those who went 
through much the same experience in Nova Scotia and St. John's, 
Newfoundland, as a result of this hurricane.
<P>
	I think it is important to show our solidarity with our fellow 
citizens, and that is what I wanted to do.
<P>
	There were also some very serious incidents in Quebec this 
summer, including the killing of a number of women in Quebec. 
We are witnessing an increase in violence in our society, and the 
official opposition urges this government to provide for greater 
justice in our society so that our fellow citizens will not find 
themselves in these desperate and tragic situations.
<P>
	The official opposition extends its sympathy to all the victims.
<P>
	The following concerns Bill C-216 introduced by the hon. 
member for Sarnia-Lambton, which would prohibit negative 
option billing by cable distributors, a practice that leaves it up to 
the consumer to specify whether he wants to keep the service for 
which he is billed by the company.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Unless subscribers send a notice of refusal, the company goes 
ahead and bills them. This is called negative option billing. Our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4203"> 4203 </A></B>
<P>
colleague from Sarnia is focussing on a real foundation of our 
society, which is that companies must not have business practices 
that harm consumers. In this regard, the bill put forward by  our 
colleague from Sarnia is aimed at protecting consumers.
<P>
	Beyond that, however, there is a problem because this bill 
meddles in provincial areas of jurisdiction over marketing.
<P>
	Second, this bill as tabled will make it more difficult to provide 
services to francophone communities in Quebec and elsewhere. 
Since the market is smaller in Quebec, business practices will have 
to be clearly identified, as services must be much more widespread 
to become profitable. Third, this bill is totally inconsistent with the 
structure of cable distributors.
<P>
	Before getting back to these aspects, I would like to put this bill 
into context. We must keep in mind that this bill results from a 
consumers' revolt in English Canada, especially in the Vancouver 
region-and, as my colleague rightly points out, in the Toronto 
region-that occurred in January 1995 against the new bundling of 
programming services by the Rogers cable company.
<P>
	Rogers took this opportunity to modify its service packages and 
offer subscribers packages completely different from those they 
had before, at a higher price, placing the onus on them to cancel 
service, otherwise they were billed extra after a while.
<P>
	Making the consumers responsible for notifying the cable 
distributor they did not intend to subscribe to these new channels 
amounted to negative option billing, which has already been 
banned in Quebec and in a few other provinces under the Consumer 
Protection Act.
<P>
	Take Quebec for example. How was it done there? Vidéotron for 
instance did not offer multi-level packages or modify its service 
packages. It just added the new channels to its basic service 
package at no extra cost. As for Cogeco and CF Cable, they came to 
an agreement with the consumer protection bureau. They 
demonstrated the need and merit of penetrating the francophone 
market to ensure that the services offered were cost-effective. It 
was all done through negotiation and within the law in Quebec.
<P>
	I should point out it was not so everywhere and this has led to 
protest, particularly in English Canada, where there was no 
consumer protection legislation in force. How are the provinces 
affected within their own jurisdiction? To set the debate in context, 
let me quote section 92 of the British North America Act, in which 
the business relationship between a consumer and a service 
provider is defined as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In each province the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to matters 
coming within the classes of subjects next herein-after enumerated; that is to 
say-property and civil rights.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Hence the business practice whereby a contract exists between 
the person who offers the service and the person who buys it. This 
section of the Constitution applies to all undertakings, including 
those under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	While the CRTC has the authority to grant licences to 
broadcasting undertakings, the Quebec government, as any 
provincial government, has the authority to make legislation 
respecting the business relations between these companies and the 
consumers.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	In fact, this exclusive jurisdiction for Quebec and the other 
provinces was recognized by former heritage minister Dupuy, in 
January 1995. But, for greater certainty, we should refer to a 
Supreme Court decision.
<P>
	Quebec's Consumer Protection Act prohibits negative option 
billing, which can be defined as follows: no merchant, 
manufacturer or advertiser can, in any way, demand any money for 
goods or services provided to a consumer, when the consumer has 
not agreed to receive such goods or services.
<P>
	The Consumer Protection Act even applies to a business which 
comes under federal jurisdiction, since it deals with a business 
practice, namely a contract. In the Kellogg's Company of Canada 
ruling, Justice Martland wrote something very important to define 
jurisdictions:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Kellogg is not excluded from the application of the restrictions imposed on 
advertising practices because it chooses an advertising medium which comes under 
federal jurisdiction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I already told the hon. member and the committee about this 
issue, because a federal bill such as this one reactivates the whole 
debate on federal-provincial jurisdictions and the issue of business 
practices. Kellogg's tried.
<P>
	It is easy to see that companies would try to challenge Quebec's 
Consumer Protection Act by asking the Supreme Court to 
determine who has jurisdiction. In the Kellogg's Company ruling, 
it is stated that ``the advertising regulations passed under the 
authority of the Quebec Consumer Protection Act seek to protect 
children from the adverse effects of certain advertisements. The 
province can regulate advertising from a commercial business 
within its boundaries, even if such advertising comes under federal 
jurisdiction. So, Kellogg's should not be excluded from the 
application of the restrictions imposed on advertising practices 
because it chooses an advertising medium which comes under 
federal jurisdiction''.
<P>
	This is very clear. This is a provincial jurisdiction and the 
province is the one that regulates the issue of business practices.
<P>
	In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, since you are about to tell me my 
time is up, I would like to say that the Bloc Quebecois has opposed 
this bill, first, because of jurisdiction, and second, because of the 
great difficulty that will be experienced by the new services in 
French to be offered everywhere, since this bill states that a 
company must obtain the consent of all its subscribers in order to 
offer a new service.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4204"> 4204 </A></B>
<P>
	Where the francophone community is in the minority in a 
province, I have a lot of trouble seeing how it will obtain services 
in French. We have seen this in the past. This becomes a very great 
danger for francophones generally. Third, for penetration of a 
service to be cost-effective in Quebec, the percentage has to be 
very high, 80 to 85 per cent. But this bill prevents cable 
distributors from doing their work and offering services in French 
in Quebec.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is therefore putting this amendment forward 
to have the bill withdrawn.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to participate in this debate at report stage of my 
private member's Bill C-216.
<P>
	This bill has one clear objective and that is to prohibit negative 
option billing by cable companies. This prohibition would also 
apply to other distribution undertakings as defined by the 
Broadcasting Act, such as direct to home satellite.
<P>
	On Motion No. 1, I cannot support this amendment as proposed 
by the member for Richmond-Wolfe. The amendment would have 
the effect of defeating this bill totally. Quite simply, we cannot turn 
our back on consumers and leave the door open to a repeat of last 
year's cable fiasco.
<P>
	I am fully aware of the position expressed by the Bloc critic in 
his belief that the consumer protection act in the province of 
Quebec prevents negative option billing by cable companies. 
However, I must say I am confused in that I heard that argument 
and then I also heard the argument that if it applies in Quebec it 
should not apply outside the province of Quebec.
<P>
	The reality in Quebec is such that all new programming services 
are marketed through negative option billing. In fact in most cases 
the Quebec consumer is afforded less choice by cable companies 
than elsewhere in the country. In Quebec new services are simply 
tacked on to the basic service and the price goes up. There are no 
additional tiers of specialty services.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	The cable television industry has a unique and powerful position 
in providing programming services to Canadians. Very few 
industries are capable of supplying a service directly into our 
homes 24 hours a day, 365 days per year.
<P>
	More important, in this country the cable industry has a 
monopoly on the service it provides. The cable industry abused its 
unique and powerful relationship with consumers by employing an 
outrageous billing practice known as negative option billing to 
market the last round of specialty channels.
<P>
	With the CRTC's blessing the cable monopolies added new 
specialty channels to existing services and increased  the price, but 
apparently no one felt it necessary to ask consumers and customers 
if they wanted the new service. The onus was on the customers to 
somehow contact the cable company and cancel the service before 
it was charged to their bill. To add insult to injury, some of the 
larger cable operators packaged the new channels in such a manner 
that by cancelling them the customer would lose existing services.
<P>
	By mid-January 1995 the cable companies finally backed down 
on forcing customers to cancel existing services to avoid new ones. 
Apologies were issued. Free viewing periods were extended. 
However, the onus was still on the customers to somehow cancel 
the new service before it appeared on their bills. The negative 
option survived and remains a threat to this very day.
<P>
	This bill was first tabled in February 1995 in response to 
Canadian consumers who demanded that we put an end to this 
practice. The bill was reintroduced in this session of Parliament 
and passed second reading on April 30, 1996 and I might say by an 
overwhelming majority. It was then referred to the Standing 
Committee on Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	In May, the committee heard testimony from various consumer 
groups, representatives of the cable industry and officials from the 
CRTC. In committee on May 30 of this year the parliamentary 
secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage moved an 
amendment to Bill C-216. The amendment was adopted by the 
committee and the bill was reported back to this House as 
amended.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary's amendment fine tuned and 
improved this important piece of legislation. I would like to thank 
the hon. member and indeed all members of the committee for their 
efforts in this regard.
<P>
	The House should also note that the parliamentary secretary's 
amendment to Bill C-216 came as a result of testimony from the 
CRTC. CRTC officials had suggested the alternative wording as a 
means of improving the bill.
<P>
	Some would say that a legislative end to negative option billing 
by cable companies is not necessary because the cable companies 
have learned their lesson.
<P>
	We heard last week from the new chair of the CRTC as she 
announced 23 new specialty channels. We heard the former chair, 
Mr. Spicer, when he testified before the heritage committee. He 
said the issue was dead, but if we wanted to make certain it was 
dead we could do so and he would send flowers. He also stated that 
there was no harm in passing Bill C-216; this from the then chair of 
the CRTC.
<P>
	The head of the Canadian Cable Television Association, Mr. 
Stursberg, testified at the committee that the cable industry would 
only use positive option billing practices. They said it will not 
happen again. If it will not happen again, I am prepared to call their 
bluff. This past week I received confirmation that contrary to what 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4205"> 4205 </A></B>
<P>
the cable industry would have us believe it intends  to use negative 
option billing to market the new round of specialty channels.
<P>
	I received a call from Pauline Couture, a lobbyist who represents 
one of the 23 new specialty channels. She freely admitted that her 
client's business plans call for a negative option marketing 
strategy. When I asked how she reconciled this fact with the pledge 
made by the cable industry, she stated that in her view there are 
different kinds of positive option billing.
<P>
	We can see that the industry intends to keep its pledge to 
consumers. It will use negative option billing but it will call it 
something else. That is not good enough. It said it will not happen 
again. Then why is the industry still trying to derail Bill C-216?
<P>
	It was reported in the press last week that André Bureau had been 
lobbying MPs to speak against this bill. Interestingly, the same 
André Bureau was until 1989 the chair of the CRTC and could 
probably be described as the godfather of negative option billing. 
He was the person who first validated the practice. He is now the 
president and CEO of Astral Broadcasting, a group which is in the 
marketing of specialty channels.
<P>
	With respect to the proposed amendment moved by the critic 
from the Bloc, I would tell my hon. colleague that I disagree with 
him on the issue of jurisdiction. I should point out that cable 
companies, telephone companies and direct to home satellite 
companies are all federally regulated undertakings. As such they 
can claim immunity from provincial laws, especially consumer 
protection laws. If my hon. friend would take the time and closely 
read Quebec's consumer protection law, he would see that in 
section 5 of the act there are services which are in fact exempt from 
the application. It refers to contracts regarding any 
telecommunications service supplied by an operating company.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	Finally I would ask my hon. friend from the Bloc if, as his party 
maintains, Quebec has already solved the problem of negative 
option billing by the cable industry then why should we in this 
House neglect to do the same for the rest of the consumers in 
Canada?
<P>
	Speaking with respect to Motion No. 2, which is the one I have 
proposed, I would like to briefly explain why I have proposed this 
small change to Bill C-216. My amendment would delete the words 
``offered by an undertaking licence'' from line 11 of Bill C-216.
<P>
	Quite simply these words which were added as part of the 
amendment passed at the committee stage are redundant and I must 
emphasize redundant. They are unnecessary because paragraph 
3(1)(t) of the Broadcasting Act, which my bill seeks to amend, 
already states clearly that we are talking about distribution 
undertakings, in other words, cable companies that are licensed to 
provide programming services.
<P>
	Since the Broadcasting Act already makes this crystal clear, 
there is no need to include these additional words in Bill C-216. As 
a result I would encourage all members to support Motion No. 2 
which is the motion fine tuned which was proposed and put forward 
by the parliamentary secretary and was the amendment proposed 
by the CRTC itself.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak on the hon. member's 
bill, and would like to take advantage of the same opportunity to 
congratulate him on the effort he has put into it.
<P>
	I, and I believe most of the other members of this House, share 
the objective sought by the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton in 
introducing this bill. We all agree that Canadians must be able to 
fully express their opinion on the programs they receive in their 
homes. We all wish to ensure that Canadian consumers receive the 
programs they want at a reasonable price. In this respect, I 
congratulate the hon. member for his initiative.
<P>
	While supporting the underlying reasons for this bill, I have had 
the opportunity to discuss and review it with other members, and 
have reached the conclusion, in light of the questions raised, that 
this bill would have unexpected and dramatic effects.
<P>
	This bill would, unintentionally, restrict Canada's capacity to 
guarantee Canadian content and the availability of French 
programming outside of Quebec. As a francophone from outside 
Quebec, I believe that access by the regions outside Quebec to 
French programs is essential. For example, had the bill being 
proposed at this time been in effect a few years ago, it is very likely 
that we would not have Newsworld and RDI today. Despite its 
intention, which I believe to be an honourable one, I feel that the 
unexpected consequences of this bill would be devastating.
<P>
	In tabling this bill, the hon. member's intention was to guarantee 
all Canadians fair and equitable treatment. Unfortunately, it would 
hamper the flexibility the CRTC requires to ensure that very 
fairness and equity.
<P>
	As such, therefore, while congratulating the hon. member for his 
intentions in proposing this bill, its unexpected consequences force 
me to vote against it.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In a nutshell, the intent of the bill is good. In reviewing 
comments made by members of Parliament from all parties, they 
agree with the intent of the bill that there should be no negative 
optioning, that consumers should be protected.
<P>
	What we are saying here today is that this bill goes beyond that. 
It takes away a lot of the flexibility of the  CRTC. It takes away the 
flexibility of the government. I can give an example, as I have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4206"> 4206 </A></B>
<P>
mentioned. Had this bill been in effect years ago, we might not 
have ``Newsworld'' today or RDI, the French version of 
``Newsworld''. That is what would have happened.
<P>
	It would be impossible for me to support such a bill that would 
take away the flexibility of the Canadian government. That would 
also go for Canadian content. It would also go for the rural regions. 
It would have a negative impact right across Canada.
<P>
	It is clear that MPs are against negative optioning. The new 
president of the CRTC has indicated that she prefers the positive 
option. The cable companies have indicated that they are against it 
and they do not intend to use it.
<P>
	The member must be congratulated for the intent. The member 
who is quite imaginative, who has grasped the subject quite well, 
should be able to come up with a new way to propose something to 
the House at a later date which deals directly with negative option 
billing.
<P>
	I suggest to members that they review the legislation before they 
cast their deciding votes. It could have some very serious 
implications for their regions, for Canadian content, for the 
flexibility the CRTC has in distributing programs across Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was very pleased to hear the Heritage Canada critic say we are 
against Bill C-216, because it certainly is a very bad bill.
<P>
	This bill is more or less like the proverbial sledgehammer. It is 
an attempt to camouflage a problem that may clear up by itself. Of 
course, it is all because of a rather notorious case in Vancouver, 
where the Rogers company found a way to make subscribers opt for 
channels they had already paid for by using the negative billing 
option.
<P>
	In fact, this caused such an uproar that the cable companies were 
smart enough to realize that this was perhaps not the way to treat 
their customers. There was such an uproar in Vancouver, and even 
in Toronto and across the rest of English Canada, that the cable 
companies will watch their step from now on.
<P>
	And not only because of that but also because the government 
will probably introduce a bill on competition in the cable industry. 
And we can expect satellite cable or satellite television to put even 
more pressure on the cable companies.
<P>
	This is just to say that the problem does exist to some extent and 
that one company, a major one, took undue advantage of the 
situation. However, it is not unlikely the problem will solve itself, 
without the government having to go to the extreme of using a 
sledgehammer.
<P>
	In fact, there are several reasons why we should object to this 
bill. First of all, it infringes on provincial  jurisdiction over 
business relations. It is common knowledge that in Quebec, for 
instance, legislation has already been passed and agreements in this 
area already exist with companies in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	This is already a bad bill because it interferes in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. Without going into details, as it could get 
boring, from the wording and tabling of the bill it is clear that the 
hon. member does not know anything about the cable television 
industry as the bill is totally inconsistent with the way this industry 
operates. This is why the industry itself is opposed to it.
<P>
	But the main raison why we in the Bloc oppose this bill is that it 
prevents new specialty and other channels from being introduced 
without the prior approval of a majority of area subscribers. In 
other words, every time a cable distributor wants to offer a new 
channel to its subscribers, it must first get the approval of the 
majority.
<P>
	Of course, as the former Minister of Canadian Heritage knows, 
this is almost impossible in practice and, worse yet, it puts all 
French-language channels in Canada at a disadvantage once again.
<P>
	This bill will surely impede the development of the 
French-language television industry in Canada. For example, if this 
bill were now in force, chances are that TVA would not even be 
available in Hull.
<P>
	In any case, it has been proven that RDI, a specialty channel I 
love, which keeps viewers up to date on Canadian and foreign 
politics, is available to only 40 per cent of French-speaking 
Canadians. Only 40 per cent of Canadian francophones have access 
to RDI. Yet, despite all the government promises that this channel 
would be made available to all francophones in Manitoba and 
elsewhere, such is not the case.
<P>
	This bill would rob francophones outside Quebec of any hope of 
ever getting access to RDI or other French-language channels.
<P>
	This bill has several problems, but the main one is that it shows a 
poor understanding of Canada and does not respect the current 
reality by advocating the principle that, even in the cable television 
industry, the majority of subscribers must approve the channels or 
services provided to the minority.
<P>
	Again, this is significant. It shows the great difference between 
English Canada and Quebec. At least, this is another example of 
misunderstanding and the fact they forget that there is not only a 
French-speaking province-Quebec-, but also other francophone 
communities throughout Canada. It is as though they did not even 
exist.
<P>
	Furthermore, Quebec has already passed a bill in this regard. The 
Government of Quebec has already struck an agreement. It is 
unfortunate therefore that this bill is even being considered. We are 
wasting our time,  although I am happy to see that the hon. critic on 
Canadian heritage opposes this bill. I hope that the hon. member 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4207"> 4207 </A></B>
<P>
for Ottawa-Vanier will do the same since, as a Franco-Ontarian 
himself, he has suggested that this bill be amended, although his 
amendment would not send the bill to the trash can, which is where 
it should go.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-216.
<P>
	I have listened to the previous speakers, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage and to the member 
from the separatist party. I believe they missed the whole intent of 
the bill. The bill is not about protecting this or that channel or 
Canadian or French language content. It is a simple bill about 
protecting the consumer.
<P>
	I cannot imagine how hon. members have missed this point. 
Their arguments have gone completely in another direction 
intended by the bill from the member for Sarnia-Lambton.
<P>
	We are beginning the first day of this fall session with a bill 
which I think is a good piece of legislation. Whether it will be 
deemed valid because of provincial jurisdiction is a whole other 
story. However, it is a good piece of legislation, as is the private 
member's bill of the member for York South-Weston. I hope the 
Liberals do not send this bill to the same fate as they did with Bill 
C-226.
<P>
	I am sure many members of the House remember the great cable 
revolt of January 1995. That was a time when Canadians across the 
country stood up and said: ``We do not like what the cable 
companies are doing to us. We do not like the way they are billing 
us. We are saying no to it. We want the opportunity to order 
something if we want it. If we want extra channels we will order 
them, thank you very much''.
<P>
	The cable companies thought they could gain a marketing 
advantage by putting the channels in and then requiring people to 
say no to them instead of the other way around.
<P>
	Many MPs' offices were inundated with calls and their fax 
machines were kept pretty busy during this period. I remember 
reading that the member for Ontario received so many faxes at his 
office that the fax machine broke down.
<P>
	This huge revolt by consumers was sparked by a marketing 
technique which was created by the cable companies. Members 
will recall that seven new speciality channels were introduced on 
cable television on January 1, 1995 and cable subscribers received 
the channels free for a period of time. At the end of that trial period 
the onus was put on the subscriber to call their cable companies and 
say they did not want them if they did not want to be charged for 
them. That is a little different  than the way things began when 
subscribers actually ordered what they wanted. Now they have to 
say they do not want them in order not to be charged for the 
channels.
<P>
	This is how it came to be called negative option marketing. 
Consumers are expected to exercise a negative option and decline 
the service, otherwise they end up paying for it.
<P>
	Most Canadians were either unaware that the onus would be put 
on them or they simply could not be bothered phoning in to cancel 
the new channels. As a result many Canadians ended up paying for 
a service they did not want, much less understand the billing 
process the cable companies were trying.
<P>
	Either way, the negative option marketing is a cash cow for the 
cable companies and that is why they prefer it. They know there is 
confusion in the minds of Canadian consumers.
<P>
	Where else can someone be charged for a service when it is not 
requested in the first place? Only through this negative option 
marketing process.
<P>
	Consumers should be given the opportunity to choose what they 
want. It is only fair. Negative option marketing turns that concept 
on its head since consumers are asked to decline a service and if 
they do not they are charged for it.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	That is the whole point behind the private member's bill before 
us, not this smokescreen of whether it will hurt this particular area 
of channels? The protection of French language channels is just a 
smokescreen.
<P>
	It appears the proponents of these channels some how got to the 
Bloc members and the parliamentary secretary to the minister of 
heritage. Only a few months ago the government was indicating 
this was a good bill. Over the summer maybe some cable company 
tycoons and some of the ministers went fishing one weekend, came 
back and lo and behold some of the ministers have a whole new 
concept about this bill. It is amazing what happens over a summer.
<P>
	Recently a new collection of channels has been licensed by the 
CRTC. Consumers are left wondering if they will have to face 
another negative option marketing blitz like we saw in January 
1995. This is all about consumer protection, and hopefully the 
House will do the right thing to protect consumers and pass Bill 
C-216 prior to the introduction of these new channels. Hopefully it 
will do the right thing. Unfortunately that rarely happens in the 
House.
<P>
	Further, in the future new competitors will be entering the 
market to take on the cable companies. Will they be allowed 
negative option marketing as well? Where is the poor Canadian 
consumer left in all of this? We saw the uproar last year when they 
said quite frankly that they  did not like this kind of billing. Let us 
do something about it as parliamentarians and protect the consum-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4208"> 4208 </A></B>
<P>
ers. That is what the bill is all about. Let us forget about the cable 
tycoons who got to some of these Liberals over here and the French 
language cable interests that got to the Bloc members over the 
summer. Let us do the right thing and talk about protecting 
consumers in this country.
<P>
	If we pass Bill C-216 we can be assured these new players in the 
cable industry will not be able to use negative option billing on 
their consumers. We can be assured that Canadians get only what 
they order and what they are willing to pay for.
<P>
	Some of the legislatures in the provinces have had the good 
sense to implement legislation within the provinces that ban 
negative option billing, and that is a good thing. If at the end of the 
day we find that is where the jurisdiction lies, at least we have sent 
a message from the House of Commons that we support the 
Canadian consumer.
<P>
	I believe a ban on this form of marketing is what Canadians want 
to see and they have spoken loud and clear on this issue. All 
members of the House are aware of the forcefulness of their 
constituents' convictions on this matter.
<P>
	The cable companies certainly should get a great deal of blame 
for using this somewhat doubtful and slick marketing scheme, but 
the CRTC is also at fault. Section 3 of the Broadcasting Act 
instructs the CRTC to be responsive to the evolving demands of the 
public. Has it been responsive? I am afraid not. Has it been 
listening to Canadians? The answer is no.
<P>
	Canadians want an end to negative option billing. The CRTC 
says no, it is a necessary evil when new programming services are 
introduced. However, when the chair of the CRTC testified before 
the heritage committee in May, he saw ``no harm in passing Bill 
C-216''.
<P>
	It appears that members of the CRTC are talking out of both 
sides of their mouths. One says there is no harm and the other says 
no, let it pass. Canadians have come to realize the CRTC is not 
responding to their concerns and is not protecting them from this 
form of marketing.
<P>
	Canadians have been demanding direct to home satellite services 
which exist in every other industrialized nation, but the CRTC says 
no, it is a threat to Canadian culture. The CRTC prefers to deny 
consumers what they really want, the option, the choice or the 
privilege of what they want to see.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	The cable companies get a huge cash grab and the CRTC gets 
money pumped into Canadian programming if this negative option 
billing is allowed to go on.
<P>
	This is wrong and it has to stop. Quebec, Nova Scotia and B.C. 
have moved to ban negative option billing for goods and some 
services on cable TV because the people have sent a clear message 
to their premiers that they do not want it.
<P>
	This House has an obligation to support this bill. I have no 
problem supporting the bill personally because it is a protection 
bill. It is a bill that is to protect the Canadian consumer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
item would ban negative option billing by cable companies. I want 
to explore with my colleagues the positive and supposed negative 
features of this bill.
<P>
	The bottom line, which I think all of us will agree, is that we do 
not want negative option billing if it is to inconvenience or treat 
Canadians unfavourably. We want to protect the Canadian 
consumer.
<P>
	However, we should not do this at any cost. Therefore our job as 
parliamentarians is to look at the pluses and, if there are any 
negatives, to correct those so that we can go forward in our 
protection of the Canadian consumer.
<P>
	I want to give a bit of background. On January 1, 1995 cable 
companies across the country began offering 7.5 million 
subscribers seven new Canadian owned specialty channels.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The controversy arises from the fact that cable subscribers are 
automatically billed for the service unless they cancel it. This 
practice is called negative option billing.
<P>
	The public reacted strongly when new services were introduced 
in January 1995. There were almost 9,000 complaints filed with the 
CRTC in three weeks. By comparison, the CRTC had received only 
1,300 letters about cable service in all of 1993.
<P>
	At my office, we could feel how angry people were.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We were inundated with calls and letters from constituents 
opposed to the policy. It was seen as an unacceptable exploitation 
of the Canadian consumer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Judging from their reaction in January 1995, Canadians clearly 
do not want negative option subscribing imposed on them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This bill reflects the desire of Canadians not to have this kind of 
episode repeated. Currently negative option billing is allowed on 
discretionary cable services not regulated by the CRTC. However, I 
am told the CRTC could do that if it wished.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4209"> 4209 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If passed, this bill would require the CRTC to regulate and 
monitor the practice of negative option subscribing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It would require agreement by consumers to take on a new 
service before having it added to the channels they receive.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Consumers would be getting the services they want to receive.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Members may be interested to know that both the Consumer 
Association of Canada and the Public Interest Advocacy Centre 
have urged MPs to support the prohibition of this practice. This bill 
would respect that governments have long recognized that 
consumers should not pay for unsolicited goods.
<P>
	It is also interesting to note that while 92 per cent of Canadian 
cable subscribers receive extended basic service, more than the 
absolute minimum, in 1993, 66 per cent believed they were seeing 
the lowest price for basic service.
<P>
	People might ask two questions:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Why deal with this now? Should we get involved at all?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Should the federal government be dealing with this issue?
<P>
	Why deal with this issue now? Some people have pointed out 
that the CRTC recently considered applications for 40 some 
channels.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The CRTC continues to support negative option billing despite 
the public's clearly expressed opposition to this practice. 
Canadians absolutely must be provided with an alternative they 
find acceptable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Negative option billing is unfair since it places the onus on 
consumers to somehow cancel the new service before it shows up 
on their bill. Unless they know to ask not to get the expanded 
services all customers, including new ones, will get speciality 
channels and forced into higher cable bills.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That being so, we should also be asking ourselves this question:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Should the federal government be dealing with this issue? We 
should also consider whether this is in the federal government's 
sphere. Normally issues of commerce and consumer protection are 
a provincial affair. Some provinces have already banned negative 
option billing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	But broadcasting comes under federal jurisdiction. If negative 
option billing is used by a cable company in a province where this 
practice is banned under provincial legislation, chances are it will 
get away with it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is therefore a need for federal leadership in this domain. 
The provinces may not be able to act to prevent the abuse of 
negative option billing in cable. Given this possible escape route 
we need to look at it extremely carefully.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have drawn conclusions that I wish to share with my hon. 
colleagues. First, here is an opportunity for us parliamentarians to 
put an end to the abusive practice of negative option billing for new 
services. A number of the points that were raised seem to indicate 
that the bill may not have been adequately responsive, which 
means it is now up to us to make it so by introducing a new bill or 
simply by amending this one. Canadians are clearly opposed to this 
practice.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The CRTC, by continuing to endorse negative option billing, has 
shown itself, it would seem to me, to be out of touch with a number 
of Canadians. This practice is so unpopular that it can actually 
harm new undertakings. It is evidently clear that we need to do 
something.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Clearly, the time has come to put an end to negative option 
billing for new cable services. However, is this bill the proper way 
to do so? I am told that, unfortunately, this legislation could 
prevent the addition of new services such as the RDI and 
Newsworld networks, as well as French language services. 
Obviously, such was not the hon. member's intention. Should this 
be the case, something would have to be done to correct the 
situation.
<P>
	Would this bill restrict Canada's ability to guarantee a Canadian 
content and the availability of French language programs outside 
Quebec? If so, this was certainly not the hon. member's intention 
and, again, something would have to be done to correct the 
situation. Through this bill, the hon. member would like to make 
sure that all Canadians are treated fairly. But is this the case? If not, 
let us make a change.
<P>
	Competition will be more fierce when Canadians start receiving 
directly in their homes services provided  through satellites. Will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4210"> 4210 </A></B>
<P>
they be offered new programming options by telephone and 
broadcasting without cable? My dear colleagues, when we legislate 
to protect the rights of Canadians, we must be careful not to throw 
out the baby with the bathwater.
<P>
	Does this bill violate the principle whereby we must protect 
Canadian content as the cornerstone of basic Canadian 
programming? I am asking the question. So, even if I strongly 
support the principle underlying the hon. member's bill, I want to 
stress the importance of integrating the points raised by my 
colleagues, and of trying to ensure that we do not, in any way, 
impede progress in these areas and that we do not hurt anyone 
concerned.
<P>
	So, if this bill does indeed protect consumers as wished by some, 
then it is up to us to go ahead with it. On the other hand, if it 
protects consumers while also blocking progress and initiatives in a 
manner that is unacceptable to us as parliamentarians, then we have 
two options: we can either set it aside and come up with another bill 
that will correct these problems, or we can simply propose 
amendments to make it acceptable to the House of Commons.
<P>
	In conclusion, we all want to protect Canadian consumers, but it 
is up to us to find the way to do it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill 
before us is of vital importance to consumers. It is a bill designed to 
ensure that the consumer will not be billed for something he does 
not wish to buy.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	A few months back, we saw a cable company bill its consumers 
for the cost of television channels they had not requested. The 
consumers were told by this company that they should have warned 
it that they did not wished to be billed for something they had not 
ordered. Thank goodness the food chains do not operate like this, 
because an order of groceries would start to get rather expensive.
<P>
	The attitude of this cable company was unacceptable. Pressure 
from outraged consumers forced the company to reverse its 
position. This was an excellent thing. We do not ever want to see 
such a situation again, either in the provision of cable service or of 
any other service.
<P>
	At the same time, we must ensure that if legislation is necessary 
in this area, that it be passed by the right legislature. The question 
that quite naturally arises is this: Is the House of Commons, the 
Parliament of Canada, the federal government the institution which 
has the responsibility with respect to consumer affairs for resolving 
this type of problem?
<P>
	The proposer, the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton, maintains 
that because telecommunications comes under federal 
responsibility, it therefore follows that consumption of a product 
whose production and  distribution are federally regulated should 
be treated likewise and also come under federal responsibility.
<P>
	If that were the case, the federal government could put up 
buildings in any municipality in this country with no regard for 
zoning bylaws. If so, federal government employees would no 
longer have to pay provincial income tax, or municipal property 
taxes.
<P>
	The lines need to be drawn where they are, where they have to 
be. In this instance, no one is disputing the fact that broadcasting 
and telecommunications are matters of federal jurisdiction. 
Unfortunately, this question was decided some years ago, when 
Quebec had the rights it had hitherto assumed in the area of 
communications taken away from it. This, unfortunately, is now 
just water under the bridge.
<P>
	Is Quebec now also going to be deprived, along with all of the 
other provinces, of its right to pass consumer legislation? A few 
months ago in this House, I had the opportunity to question the 
Minister of Industry specifically on broadcasting and consumer 
protection. The minister told me in this House that this was a 
provincial matter. If the minister says so, I have difficulty 
understanding that a member of his government is not taking his 
minister's word for it.
<P>
	However, I clearly understood the hon. member for 
Sarnia-Lambton to have said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``If Quebec has already solved this question for its consumers, 
why should this House be prevented to do the same for the rest of 
Canada?''
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In other words, why could this House not look after the rest of 
Canada, since Quebec can look after itself. I appreciate the 
clairvoyance of my colleague from Sarnia-Lambton, but he may 
have jumped the gun by a few months or years. Quebec is still part 
of Canada.
<P>
	Yet, if he were prepared to amend his proposal so that it applied 
only to the rest of Canada, specifically excluding Quebec, thus 
acknowledging and confirming this jurisdiction which it has under 
the Constitution, perhaps I could find some sympathy for such an 
amendment.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I would like to draw your attention to another comment that was 
made in this House. Earlier, the hon. member for St. Boniface said 
that a company that practiced negative option billing in a province 
where this was banned under the laws of that province would 
probably, since it was operating in an area under provincial 
jurisdiction, be able to get around this ban.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4211"> 4211 </A></B>
<P>
	When I hear members of this House claim that a 
federally-regulated company operating in an area under federal 
jurisdiction would be able to flout the laws of a  province and 
probably get away with it, I say there is something wrong with the 
system.
<P>
	If the hon. member said that the Constitution and the law should 
be enforced in such a way that provincial jurisdictions are 
respected, that would be a responsible thing for a member of this 
House to say. But to claim that, since the laws of a province could 
be flouted, the federal government should interfere in an area under 
provincial jurisdiction, is irresponsible in the extreme.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I have to say it is merely one example of the lack 
of responsibility and sometimes irresponsibility shown by the 
federal government in its dealings with the provinces. I will not go 
into the problems of health insurance which are a source of 
frustration for a number of western provinces. I will not go into the 
fact that some members opposite support certain things that were 
done during the last referendum, in violation of provincial laws. I 
will not go into the fact that, through its spending power, the 
federal government consistently trespasses on provincial 
jurisdictions. If I did, I would be here all day.
<P>
	To conclude my comments, the intentions of the hon. member 
for Sarnia-Lambton are praiseworthy. The consumer must be 
protected. -I am one myself-, but we should go to the 
legislatures that have the authority to do so, and I am referring to 
provincial legislatures. I can assure you that in Quebec, since I am 
a Quebecer, I will make sure that the consumer gets all the 
protection to which he is entitled. Since Quebec has already taken 
action in this respect, I would urge the other provinces to follow 
Quebec's example, instead of urging this government to 
compensate for the inertia of the other provinces.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is one and a half minutes left. Is 
there another speaker or can we say that debate is over?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for York South-Weston has approximately 
one minute.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I will take every opportunity to speak and I appreciate being given 
this opportunity.
<P>
	I would like to commend the member for Sarnia-Lambton for 
bringing this bill forward. It is important that the House pass the 
bill. In my respectful submission, the bill does not go far enough; 
nonetheless, it is deserving of support.
<P>
	The bill is an amendment to the Broadcasting Act which clearly 
only applies in this particular case to cable companies. It seems to 
me what is needed is a bill that would ban this type of marketing or 
billing across the board at the federal level. Whatever is within 
federal jurisdiction, this type of billing or marketing should be 
prohibited.
<P>
	It is clear that Canadians were very upset about what happened 
with the cable companies. The whole debate begs the question: 
should consumers have to pay for something they do not want or 
need?
<P>
	The cable companies were arrogant and presumptuous in 
thinking they could foist upon consumers something consumers did 
not want. They would bill the consumers for it and if the consumers 
did not want it, they would take away something the consumers 
already had with respect to cable television.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	I hope in the very near future that this whole debate will be 
rendered academic. It seems to me that with the pace of modern 
technology at some point in the very near future Canadians will be 
able to actually pay for the channels they want. If the technology 
exists today for pay TV, why should consumers have to buy a 
basket of channels as opposed to simply paying for the channels 
they want?
<P>
	I will resume my comments when the bill is brought forward 
again.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time provided for the consideration 
of Private Members' Business has now expired. The order is 
dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the Order 
Paper.

<P>
	Motions Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will be grouped for debate and

Motions Nos. 3 and 5. An affirmative vote on Motion No. 1 
obviates the necessity of the question being put on Motions Nos. 2, 
4, and 6. On the other hand, a negative vote on Motion No. 1 
necessitates the question being put on Motion No. 2. A vote on 
Motion No. 2 applies to Motions Nos. 4 and 6.

	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point order. We are 
dealing with Bill C-45. While I understand the House leaders of the 
parties may have had an opportunity to meet, to discuss and to 
agree on the way of proceeding with Bill C-45, I can tell you that I 
was not consulted as to the procedure that would be followed today.
<P>
	You are seeking unanimous consent. Perhaps for the time being I 
will refrain from giving unanimous consent until someone from the 
traditional parties provides me with an explanation as to what is 
happening with respect to these amendments.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member is fully entitled, as 
colleagues will know, to deny unanimous consent on reading these 
motions. It will get awfully boring for members to have to listen to 
me read six pages but I recognize the member is fully entitled to do 
that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not denying unanimous 
consent to dispensing with the reading, and yes it would get rather 
boring for the Speaker to have to read all the amendments. But 
there appears to be some form of agreement between the House 
leaders as to which motions are agreed to. The government whip is 
shaking his head. Perhaps he could provide me with an explanation. 
In the meantime I have no difficulty with not reading each motion.
<P>

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motions are all deemed to have been 
read.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, let us 
first get things straight. Over the summer, it was rumoured on the 
Liberal side that Bill C-45 had been killed by the official 
opposition, by the Bloc Quebecois, that we were against this bill, 
that we were on the side of those who rely a little too much on 
rehabilitation. There were all sorts of rumours going round.
<P>
	The position we took in second reading was very clear. We 
supported the bill while pointing out that, after 20 years of 
operation, the time had come to review section 745 of the Criminal 
Code, under which a person sentenced to life imprisonment for 
murder can request that a jury be summoned and his or her case 
reviewed after serving only 15 years.
<P>
	This section that came into force 20 years ago last July deserved 
to be reviewed but not in all of one day and a half, as it were, with 
time allocation being imposed on Bill C-45, the committee 
working almost round the clock to report to the House in a rush and 
the bill finally never being considered because time ran out.
<P>
	One of the main concerns we had in the official opposition, in the 
Bloc Quebecois, was to determine where the interest of the victims 
lay in this whole issue. The hon. member for Crowfoot raised this 
point time and time again in committee. We too trust the jury, of 
course, as an institution, to make a decision under section 745 in 
relation to the exceptional release of lifers. We trust the jury, 
provided it has all the facts. One factor that was missing in our 
opinion was the notion that the victims, their families, other 
individuals and even the community at large may have sustained a 
loss because of the murder.
<P>
	Whether it is made by psychologists or sociologists, there is 
always a delineation made. That is the main reason why we gave 
our support to this bill in second reading. We can either use the 
steamroller or have a logical and enlightening discussion right 
across Canada on the implementation of section 745 of the 
Criminal Code. The value of this section in certain circumstances 
has been demonstrated, and it has been shown that, when a person 
is sentenced to life in prison but is released after 15 years or more, 
the rate of relapse is practically non existent. Indeed, the value of 
this section has long been demonstrated.
<P>
	Today, the government wants to change it, quickly and without 
any study. Three major amendments are being proposed: first, the 
jury which currently makes its decision or recommendation based 
on a two-third majority would, with this bill, have to make 
unanimous decisions.
<P>
	The idea is to give these jurors the same role as the members of a 
jury rendering a verdict at a trial. In a trial, the jury's decision must 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4214"> 4214 </A></B>
<P>
be made beyond any reasonable  doubt. It makes perfect sense that 
the 12 citizens forming a jury have to render a unanimous guilty or 
not guilty verdict. However, the jury referred to in section 745 is 
not at all the type of jury that we have known for centuries in the 
British criminal law system. One has the right to be judged by one's 
peers and to see them render a verdict.
<P>
	The jury that exists since 1976, twenty years is a short period in 
history, is a special jury which does not have to render a verdict but 
to give its opinion. Should an inmate sentenced to life in prison for 
murder-the act also mentions high treason, but since Louis Riel I 
do not think we have had the audacity to condemn anyone on that 
ground-be eligible for release after 15 years, in exceptional 
cases? This jury does not even make the decision. It authorizes or 
not the inmate to submit a request to the National Parole Board, 
which will hold hearings. And here we say that, of course, the 
victims should have a right to be heard.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	The evidence on which this jury bases its decision is not judged 
on the same criteria as the evidence presented during a trial. It is an 
opinion issued by a jury. It is normal that there may be dissension 
and disagreement. The two thirds rule established in 1976 appeared 
to us to be a wise rule allowing uniform application of the law 
throughout Canada in criminal matters.
<P>
	It is obvious that, if the bill were to be passed as it reads today, 
section 745 of the Criminal Code would be applied differently 
according to the province in which inmates resided. It is obvious 
that juries empanelled in Quebec under section 745 of the Criminal 
Code are generally more liberal, more socially open to such an 
application, while in other provinces it will take just one person to 
block parole.
<P>
	One of the basic principles for our having one criminal code for 
the entire country is that there must be uniform application of the 
rules of law. In practice, we will not have uniform application of 
the rules of law throughout Canada.
<P>
	The government is presenting us with a bill, Bill C-45, that is 
nothing but double talk. On the one hand, in those parts of Canada 
where it suits its purposes to do so, it will be able to say that it has, 
to all intents and purposes, made it impossible for someone serving 
a life sentence to be released on parole. And in other more liberal 
parts of Canada, the government will say that it has not abolished 
section 745, even though the House of Commons passed Bill-226 
presented by our colleague, the hon. member for York 
South-Weston, which repealed section 745.
<P>
	The background discussion has taken place. Should the section 
remain or not? It is a good question, a clear question with a clear 
answer. I am in complete disagreement with the points of view 
expressed by my  colleague, but at least he asked the right question: 
Should it, or should it not, remain in the Criminal Code?
<P>
	For us in the official opposition, a life sentence is a life sentence. 
This means that a person released while serving his prison sentence 
is nevertheless released conditionally and may be returned to 
custody if he violates the conditions of his release.
<P>
	However, we should not make the false hopes raised by section 
745 disappear altogether, and I say this because other aspects of 
Bill C-45 will make the application of section 745 of the Criminal 
Code even more haphazard. From now on, it will be necessary to 
obtain the judicial approval of a provincial superior or supreme 
court for the inmate to be eligible to file his application. Why was 
this done? Why was this done so quickly during the last few hours 
of the session? Because a serial killer in Canada became eligible to 
apply for parole this summer.
<P>
	Some people made it appear as though this criminal would 
automatically be released. The only right he obtained this summer 
was the right to file his application with the provincial chief justice. 
A jury will be called and asked to decide, probably with a 
two-thirds majority, whether he should be released or not. That is a 
good way to test the system. Will the jury, in this case, allow a 
serial killer to be released? Will a jury cognizant of the facts allow 
this to be done, and if it did, second question, will the National 
Parole Board which appears before our committees be comfortable 
with justifying that release? Personally, I am confident this will not 
happen, even if Bill C-45 is not passed.
<P>
	I am far more concerned about a government that acts in haste 
when dealing with the Criminal Code and unthinkingly alters the 
rights and freedoms of each citizen, although the judicial area is the 
very area where prudence is of the essence, because often the 
secondary or side effects may be more serious than expected.
<P>
	That is why we suggest that the unanimity rule proposed by the 
government in Bill C-45 should be changed to three quarters, in 
other words, nine jury members out of 12 must be in favour of the 
inmate's release as opposed to the present two thirds rule, and this 
for the purely technical reason that maintaining the status quo was 
already voted down in committee and it was therefore impossible 
to reintroduce it at this stage, at the report stage.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	For these reasons we intend to vote for the motion to establish 
the three quarters rule for jury decisions when section 745 is being 
applied.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I begin my speech, I would like to say that I support the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4215"> 4215 </A></B>
<P>
motion moved by the hon. member for Bellechasse. I prefer his 
amendment to my own and will  support it when it comes to a vote. 
I hope he will vote for mine if his amendment is not passed by the 
House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to make it very clear that my opposition to this whole bill, 
which I indicated by my vote at second reading, is because I oppose 
changes to section 745. My own preference would be to get rid of 
section 745, not in accordance with the proposals from hon. 
members opposite, but to get rid of minimum sentences for murder 
and substitute a sentence of life imprisonment and allow the 
National Parole Board to allow for release in the normal course of 
events, as used to be the case in this country before the adoption of 
section 745.
<P>
	I recognize that would be a perfect world, which is unlikely to 
come. Therefore I am having to satisfy myself with proposing 
some pretty modest amendments to this bill which I hope my hon. 
friends opposite will consider voting for. I know that may be asking 
a little much, but it is still worth a try.
<P>
	Bill C-45 has three main points. It takes away the right of 
multiple murders to apply for early release. I can live with that 
change in the law. It provides for a screening process for all 
applications before a judge alone. With reluctance I can 
accommodate that change in the law. It also removes from the 
current law the provision that a jury must recommend early release 
by having eight of the 12 members agree. It now requires that all 12 
members agree. That is a change in the law which in my view will 
in most parts of Canada, as the hon. member for Bellechasse has 
said, result in no releases under this section. In my view this is 
unduly punitive and unnecessary for the proper administration of 
justice in this country.
<P>
	I would like to look at what our system should be aiming for 
when it seeks to punish offenders or when it applies a sentence 
following a trial on a serious charge such as a murder charge, the 
most serious of all charges.
<P>
	It seems the goals of sentencing should be first and foremost the 
protection of the public. Second, there should be rehabilitation for 
the offender. Third, there should be punishment for the offender. 
One thing there is not in our law, nor should there be in our law, is 
revenge. That is what I suggest is the basis for this amendment.
<P>
	The law is there to protect the public. I put this question 
rhetorically to the House. How is the public protected by the long 
sentences that are imposed for these offences, the 25-year 
minimum will become the standard sentence if this bill is adopted, 
in my opinion?
<P>
	From 1968 to 1974 the average time served by a person whose 
sentence had been commuted to a life sentence for murder from the 
death penalty, which was then in force, was 13.2 years. Every 
sentence was commuted during those years. How is it that if 13.2 
years was satisfactory then we now have to look at doubling  that to 
25 years in order to mete out a suitable sentence? I suggest it is 
quite inappropriate.
<P>
	During the years that there were commutations taking place, and 
I am sorry I do not have the exact figures today, I understand that 
approximately 200 persons were released under the auspices of the 
National Parole Board, in most cases with the consent of the 
governor in council. Of those approximately 200, my recollection 
is that there were only one or two who reoffended and who were 
subsequently arrested for various offences and brought into prison.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	In other words, in terms of the safety of the public, the risk of 
releasing persons serving long sentences, murderers in particular, 
is minimal. I know members of the public tend to be fearful 
thinking that if a person has murdered once he is likely to murder 
again. However, the statistics and facts all indicate the opposite is 
true. Usually murderers do not re-offend.
<P>
	These very onerous sentences, the minimum 15-year sentence 
with the provision for application to a jury for early release, was 
put in place when the death penalty was abolished. In my view it 
was put in solely to appease the persons who were in favour of 
hanging. It was to convince them that a long sentence would make 
up for the abolition of the death penalty.
<P>
	This law has been in operation for some 20 years, as the hon. 
member for Bellechasse has pointed out. Of course no applications 
could take place for an extended period but then they started. As of 
December 31 last year 63 cases have been heard for consent to 
reduce the term of the sentence. Fifty of the 63 were successful in 
one way or another. Some of them were minimal reductions while 
others were significant reductions. However, of those 50, two are in 
difficulty with the law. One is unlawfully at large and one has 
re-offended. I note that it is not a murder.
<P>
	There is absolutely not a tittle of evidence to indicate that the 
current law is not working as it was planned to work and as it 
should work. The risks to the public in the operation of the current 
law are minimal and the hon. member for Wild Rose knows that. 
He just buries his head in the sand and ignores the facts.
<P>
	This bill before the House today, C-45, does not enhance the 
safety of the public. It simply proposes more draconian prison 
sentences on those who already have received a life sentence. It 
will ensure that they stay in for a longer period of time.
<P>
	Let us turn to the second part, the rehabilitation of offenders. Do 
we rehabilitate these offenders by keeping them in prison for 
longer sentences? The answer from experts in penology is ``no we 
do not''. Longer sentences do not assist in the rehabilitation of 
offenders. Rehabilitation can usually, not always, be accomplished 
in a shorter time and usually the person can be released  safely. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4216"> 4216 </A></B>
<P>
There will always be cases where a release is not safe, it is not in 
the interests of the public and rehabilitation has not occurred.
<P>
	However, we have a National Parole Board which has had some 
extremely capable people appointed to it by this most capable 
minister, the Solicitor General of Canada, with the assistance of our 
most capable Minister of Justice. These two ministers have set an 
example of quality appointments to our National Parole Board, I 
am pleased to say. The National Parole Board is doing an excellent 
job in reviewing parole possibilities for inmates.
<P>
	I suggest the punishment of 25 years without any hope of release 
is excessive. Even murderers in the United States are not sentenced 
to such long sentences. They are given a life sentence but the 
normal release period is less than 25 years. It is excessive and high 
by any standard. In fact I would suggest it is one of the highest in 
the world for murderers.
<P>
	I am appalled that the government would propose such an 
amendment when I consider the cost of keeping inmates in prison 
and more appalled when members of the Reform Party, who 
profess to be budget conscious, are supporting this kind of 
measure. We know from the figures released by Corrections 
Canada that it costs between $60,000 and $70,000 a year to keep an 
inmate in maximum security. These lifers are being kept far longer 
than they used to be kept, and quite needlessly in many cases 
because the law states they must be kept for 15 years plus. 
Everyone knows they are spending more than 15 years in prison. 
The average has gone from 13.2 up to-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Everybody does not know that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says that everybody does not 
know it. They should know it because the application cannot be 
made until after 15 years have expired on a sentence. Then there is 
a waiting period while the jury trial takes place. After the jury trial 
is over and the jury has permitted a reduction, the inmate must then 
apply to the National Parole Board and have a hearing. All of that 
takes months. Therefore the minimum sentence is in fact more than 
15 years in every case. It extends into the 10-year period before 
release can be achieved even in the most favoured case.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	To keep people locked up in prison at great public expense when 
they do not pose a risk to the public-at least in the opinion of the 
National Parole Board-when they are genuinely sorry for their 
misdeeds, have indicated that they are sorry and are trying to 
improve their lot, and when they are most unlikely to reoffend as is 
the case with most of the persons in this particular class, then I 
suggest that the Canadian taxpayer is being taken for a ride. Hon. 
members opposite who are so opposed to misspending of public 
funds ought to be on their hind legs objecting to this kind of over 
expenditure.  However, I do not need to argue solely on that basis. 
We need to approach this case with compassion. We must regret 
profoundly the loss of a victim and of course we do.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired. Is 
there unanimous consent for him to continue?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak in opposition to the amendments proposed by the hon. 
member for Bellechasse and the hon. member for Kingston and the 
Islands. These amendments clearly demonstrate that the hon. 
member for Bellechasse and the hon. member for Kingston and the 
Islands have absolutely no understanding of the horror inflicted on 
murder victims.
<P>
	The truck driver who witnessed the horror of Melanie 
Carpenter's face as she sat captive in the front seat of her killer's 
car understands the terror endured by this victim. The jury who 
endured the vivid testimony of Karla Homolka and witnessed the 
graphic audio account of the torture inflicted by Paul Bernardo on 
Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy understand the pain and 
suffering of these victims. They understand the constant anguish 
the families of these young girls live with every day of their lives, 
lives that have been destroyed.
<P>
	These amendments show that the member for Bellechasse and 
the member for Kingston and the Islands do not empathize with the 
families of murder victims and the nightmares they endure as a 
result of the heinous crimes committed against their children and 
grandchildren. For these members to allow that anguish to keep 
festering, to allow the wounds of the families of victims to be 
opened and reopened is wrong. Yet that is precisely what this 
amendment will allow.
<P>
	Every time a killer applies for a judicial review of his parole, the 
family and society relive the horrible memories and live in terror of 
the possibility that these killers will be released early from prison.
<P>
	Section 745 of the Criminal Code demeans the value of a human 
life as does Bill C-45. These amendments are proposed by the 
member for Bellechasse and the member for Kingston and the 
Islands. All are examples of a blatant disregard for human life, the 
families of murder victims, the safety of society and a blatant 
disregard for the wishes of the Canadian public, many of whom are 
demanding a return of capital punishment for first degree murder.
<P>
	Section 745, which provides killers with an avenue for early 
release, makes a mockery of the term life imprisonment. The 
penalty for premeditated first degree murder is life imprisonment 
without the eligibility of parole for 25 years. A life sentence is not 
about rehabilitation. It is about punishment and retribution for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4217"> 4217 </A></B>
<P>
most horrible crime in society, the premeditated and  unlawful 
taking of an innocent life and the devastating effect this has on 
society.
<P>
	These amendments and the minister's refusal to eliminate 
section 745 demonstrates clearly the value the justice minister 
places on the lives of Canadians. He, as does a majority of his 
caucus and the Bloc, believe the lives of our children and 
grandchildren are worth only 15 years.
<P>
	If the justice minister asked Canadians to place a value on the 
lives of their children, overwhelmingly their response would be life 
in prison or capital punishment. The justice minister does not 
believe in punishment or retribution, only in rehabilitation and that 
is what we have been getting from the bleeding heart mentality for 
the past 25 years. They tolerate the most extreme crimes in society 
while mocking and ridiculing those who would bring a sense of 
sanity back into the justice system.
<P>
	They accept and promote the worth of a human life at only 15 
years. Section 745 of the Criminal Code nullifies the penalty for 
first degree murder. It provides murderers an opportunity for the 
judicial review of their parole ineligibility after they have served 
just 15 years of a life sentence.
<P>
	These amendments do not repeal section 745. Bill C-45 does not 
repeal section 745 of the Criminal Code despite strong demand 
across the country to do so. Victims groups, the Canadian Police 
Association and I would suggest the majority of Canadians believe 
that section 745 should be eliminated completely because a life is 
worth much, much more than 15 years.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Nothing except the full elimination of section 745 is acceptable 
to the Reform Party. It is for precisely this reason I oppose these 
amendments. I oppose any half-baked attempt to modify, change or 
amend this repugnant and unacceptable section of the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
	The amendments and Bill C-45 are nothing but a meagre attempt 
by the justice minister to sugar coat this repulsive provision of the 
Criminal Code which bestows on killers an unjustifiable right for 
early release.
<P>
	Bill C-45 strips multiple or serial killers of the right to apply for 
early parole. However, this only applies to multiple murders 
committed after passage of the bill. This creates categories of 
killers, good killers and bad killers. Good killers are being granted 
special status, a hallmark of this government. We saw special status 
in Bill C-41, in Bill C-33 and in Bill C-110. We see special status 
being created in this bill.
<P>
	Good killers will have the right to appeal for early release from 
prison while bad killers will serve out their life sentence. Thanks to 
the justice minister's ill-conceived strategy of waiting until the 
11th hour to introduce Bill C-45 and thanks to Bloc members for  
reneging on their word to not unduly delay Bill C-45 so that it 
could pass before the summer recess, Clifford Olson, Canada's 
most notorious killer has the right in law to apply for a reduction in 
his parole ineligibility. Section 745 provides killers like Olson the 
right to appeal any negative decision to the Supreme Court of 
Canada.
<P>
	As of December 1995, there were 574 first degree murderers 
incarcerated in Canada. Of those, approximately 5 per cent were 
multiple killers. Multiple killers, sentenced after the passage of 
Bill C-45, will not be eligible to apply for a reduction.
<P>
	The provisions of Bill C-45 do not appease the Rosenfeldts, 
whose son was murdered by serial killer Clifford Olson. The 
Rosenfeldts, the Mahaffys, the Frenchs and many other Canadians 
will not be satisfied until multiple killers receive fair and just 
penalties: consecutive life sentences for each of the lives they so 
viciously stole, not a meagre 15 years for the torture and killing of 
11 innocent children as supported by the Liberal government.
<P>
	Clifford Olson should be serving 11 consecutive life sentences. 
This is the only fair and just penalty for the taking of 11 young 
lives.
<P>
	This amendment of Bill C-45 is nothing but a bleeding heart 
attempt to tinker with a penalty for first degree murder. Killers do 
not deserve that which they denied their victims. Murderers should 
not be given a glimmer of hope nor any incentive to ease the burden 
of the severity of their punishment because they did not give their 
victims any hope.
<P>
	For the criminal justice system to provide a killer with a 
so-called glimmer of hope or to restore their rights is a further 
injustice to the victim, the victims' families and an offence to 
Canadians.
<P>
	I am confident all Canadians would agree with this statement. I 
think most Canadians would agree that these amendments to Bill 
C-45 demean the value of human life. I therefore oppose them 
because they are not worthy of support.
<P>
	It has been suggested by my House leader that we not proceed 
with Bill C-45 today until the matter of Bill C-234 is resolved. It 
can be resolved in many ways. For the good of this institution and 
the spirit of private members' business we should adjourn this 
debate and allow the House leader to work out a solution.

fulfilled this summons.

Walkerton where she shared her victory with the people.
<P>
	All Canadians who participated in the games did us proud. The 
Olympic spirit is captured in competition and in the drive for 
excellence.
<P>
	Our presence in the Olympics is a microcosm of our essence as a 
nation. Canadian athletes of different languages, different regions, 
even different countries of birth stood together as one people under 
one flag.
<P>
	Again to Laryssa and all our athletes, a hearty congratulations 
and thank you from us to all of them.

	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on July 19 
and 20, the Mauricie, North Shore, Charlevoix and 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean regions were hit by disastrous floods. 
Some people lost their lives, and extensive material damage was 
sustained throughout the area, as roads and bridges were washed 
out and homes, businesses and industries were severely damaged if 
not completely destroyed.
<P>
	We must draw attention to the exceptional courage shown by the 
victims. They are working very hard to rebuild their homes and 
their region.
<P>
	Their courage found its strength in the solidarity shown not only 
by Quebecers but also by many Canadians. On behalf of all the 
flood victims, I wish to extend my warmest thanks to all those who 
put generosity first.

	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in June I asked the 
Minister for International Cooperation why a successful Ontario 
company, Markham Electric, was denied the chance to compete for 
a CIDA contract. Only three companies, all from Quebec, were 
lucky enough to be picked by the minister to submit formal bids.
<P>
	CIDA is obliged to use an independent appeal mechanism to 
resolve disputes, but despite petitions to CIDA, to the Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal and to Treasury Board, Markham 
Electric has found no venue in which to launch an appeal.
<P>
	This summer the Minister for International Cooperation made a 
cross-Canada junket ostensibly to encourage more Canadian 
companies to bid on CIDA projects. This cynical, typically Liberal 
strategy will fool nobody. The shameful treatment of Markham 
Electric  confirms that CIDA is closed to companies lacking a 
Quebec address, connections with the CIDA bureaucracy and a 
donor's receipt from the Liberal Party.

would like to raise a concern I share with many Manitobans about 
what Liberal policies are doing to Manitoba and particularly to jobs 
in Manitoba.
<P>
	We face the prospect of the abandonment of the Sherridon sub, 
the tearing up of our northern rail infrastructure for scrap to be sold 
in some other country. We face the decimation of the CPR shops in 
Winnipeg as a result of Liberal policies with respect to how they 
settled the railway strike.
<P>
	We face the prospect of jobs disappearing in the wholesale sector 
as a result of the deal on softwood lumber. We see jobs being 
threatened in the railway wheel industry as a result of proposed 
advances in the tariff reduction schedule. We see Air Canada jobs 
that were promised to Winnipeg going to Air France because of this 
trend for outsourcing.
<P>
	The people of Manitoba have cause to feel betrayed by the 
Liberals in Manitoba who promised jobs and have delivered 
nothing but devastation since they were elected.

this past summer Canadians were very proud observers of an 
outstanding performance by our Canadian Olympic team at the 
1996 games in Atlanta. With a total of 22 medals, these games 
proved to be the most successful ever for Canada.
<P>
	As the member of Parliament for London-Middlesex and on 
behalf of all Londoners, I would like to extend our congratulations 
and thanks to the following Londoners who represented Canada so 
well in Atlanta: Catherine Bond-Mills, heptathlon; Jason Tunks,

rowing; Brian Peaker, silver medalist in rowing; and Al Morrow

Speaker, this past August marked the 225th anniversary of the 
Upper Londonderry Pastoral Charge with three churches serving 
the communities of Glenholme, Debert and Masstown. 
Descendants, both local and international, of the first minister of 
the charge returned home to celebrate this historic anniversary.
<P>
	Originally founded in 1771 by Presbyterian minister David 
Smith, this charge continues to thrive as a vital part of the United 
Church of Canada. As the oldest pastoral charge in Canada, it has 
influenced community values and inspired a sense of pride and 
hope among all its parishioners.
<P>
	I ask that all members join with me in thanking the charge for the 
communion, prayer and spiritual guidance it has provided to 
Canadians for over two centuries. As well, I extend my 
congratulations to successive ministers and parishioners who have 
sustained this sanctuary of fundamental values and religious 
freedom.

Corporation, an American chemical manufacturer, has recently 
launched a trade dispute under NAFTA regarding Bill C-29, the 
manganese based fuel additives act. Ethyl claims that the passing 
of Bill C-29 constitutes discriminatory trade action.
<P>
	We must not forget that above all this bill is about the health of 
Canadians. The effect of MMT on exhaust emissions has serious 
health implications for all Canadians. We must also remember that 
MMT is not used in American gasoline due to health concerns, yet 
this company is prepared to attempt to force the hand of the 
Canadian government.
<P>
	We do not need to import a foreign made octane enhancer. We 
can replace MMT with domestically produced and renewable fuels 
which are safe both for human health and the environment.

Lyse Lemieux to the post of chief justice of the Quebec Superior 
Court. Ms. Lemieux thus becomes the first woman to fill this 
position in Quebec.
<P>
	Ms. Lemieux has had an impressive career. She was director of 
legal services at the Quebec department of justice, where she also 
worked as deputy minister for three years. For the past two years, 
she was assistant chief justice of the Quebec Superior Court.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois commends the appointment of this 
competent woman to head Quebec's highest court.
<P>
	We wish Ms. Lemieux the best of luck in tackling the major 
challenges awaiting her in her new post. We especially hope that, in 
addition to modernizing the legal system, she will help promote a 
solid balance between men and women in this area.

Canadians were handed a death sentence from a simple blood 
transfusion.
<P>
	Today Krever is an expert in blood. He is independent, he is 
unbiased. Yet this government has undermined and subverted 
Krever at every turn; undermined him in court; subverted him with 
big changes to the system before his report and without his input.
<P>
	Reform challenges the health minister and his colleagues. Let 
Justice Krever speak. He will surely recommend that 
accountability rests squarely on the shoulders of the health 
minister. Come to think of it, maybe that is what this minister is 
afraid of.

September 9, 1996 Canada Post issued the semi-postal stamp in 
support of literacy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The new stamp will cost 50 cents. For each stamp sold, five cents 
will go to funding literacy efforts. ABC Canada will look after the 
distribution of collected funds among the various literacy groups.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We must remember that reading is considered a challenge for 
approximately 42 per cent of all Canadians. In fact 16 per cent have 
difficulties with daily tasks such as reading menus and signs. We 
need to work together to try and expand the reading world of these 
Canadians. This initiative is certainly a step in the right direction.

	<B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau-La Lièvre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Parti Quebecois militants from Quebec City just passed three 
resolutions aimed at determining who will have the right to vote in 
the next referendum.
<P>
	First, the minimum age to qualify as an elector would be reduced 
from 18 to 16; secondly, immigrants will not be able to vote in a 
referendum until 18 months after becoming Canadian citizens; and 
thirdly, voters outside Quebec will have to prove that they own 
property in Quebec or that they have been paying taxes in Quebec 
over the past two years.
<P>
	While the Parti Quebecois brags about how democratic it is, 
these new measures it has put forward must be seen not as an 
improvement but rather as a departure from our democratic 
traditions. This is a totally unacceptable situation that the people of 
Quebec must condemn.

will recall that, before the summer recess, the Bloc Quebecois 
vigorously criticized the Liberal government's decision to cut off 
its $7.2 million contribution to the Tokamak project in Varennes.
<P>
	This government has made more nonsensical decisions since. In 
May for instance, we learned it had launched its flag project, which 
has cost Canadian taxpayers $23 million to date. This unfortunate 
decision was followed by the establishment, over the summer, of a 
propaganda agency operating under the misleading name of 
Canada Information Office and administering a budget in excess of 
$20 million. Not to mention the tens of millions of dollars allocated 
to Heritage Canada, the Council for Canadian Unity, Operation 
Unity and so on.
<P>
	There are more than ten Liberal members in this House 
representing the Montreal area. What are they waiting for to speak 
out and call their ministerial colleagues to order? The Liberal 
government must realize that what Quebecers need is not to see 
more red but rather to see their taxes used to help create jobs.

Clifford Olson got his much anticipated shot at early release after

<P>
	The justice minister did nothing to prevent Olson from once

prevent Olson from forcing his victims' families to relive a

<P>
	The justice minister has had Canada-wide support and ample 
opportunity to bring in a bill which would have denied Olson the 
appalling opportunity to flaunt his heinous crimes.
<P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JOBCREATION">JOB CREATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the federal government's performance in the area of job 
creation certainly falls far short of the promises made during the 
last election campaign. Since 1993, nothing concrete has been done 
by the government to stimulate job creation, with the exception of 
an infrastructure program.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell us if he agrees with what his Minister 
of Human Resources Development had to say this summer: ``You 
can go to the Government of Canada for matters of national 
defence, justice, national health care, but for job creation, go knock 
on the door of your provincial legislature''?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, obviously the government would like to have seen the 
Canadian economy create more jobs over the last three years. I 
would like to point out to the Leader of the Opposition that the 
Canadian economy has, since November 1993, created more than 
667,000 new jobs, more than Germany, France and Great Britain 
combined.
<P>
	We have put such programs as the infrastructure program in 
place, and this June we made an offer to the provinces to continue it 
next year. The first ministers, after examining the program over the 
summer, have accepted. We have already begun negotiations to 
extend the program to 1997, perhaps beyond.
<P>
	We have also implemented job creation programs for youth, and 
a number of other measures. Most important of all, however, we 
have created the necessary climate to allow such things as a 3 per 
cent reduction in the interest rate. As a result, there has been an 
upswing in construction in recent months. People wishing to own a 
home are now paying far less interest on their mortgages.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4223"> 4223 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister and his government have fallen into 
the habit of riding on the wave of economic upturn and of claiming 
responsibility for the job recovery that has taken place, a recovery 
required by  the fact that, over the same time period, more than 
800,000 jobs had been lost.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that, for Quebec, with its heavy 
unemployment, one of the consequences of federal government 
policies, particularly the policy on purchase of goods and services, 
is a shortfall of $1.2 billion for 1994 alone? That this deprives the 
economy of Quebec of thousands of jobs, because of his 
government's refusal to right a long-standing wrong?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to start off with a correction to what the 
Leader of the Opposition has said, since when we refer to the 
669,000 new jobs created in Canada since this government has 
been in existence, we mean those jobs in excess of the level of 
employment existing at the time of the election. In the economy, 
jobs are always being lost, while others are being created, but the 
net increase was 669,000 new jobs created since this government 
has been in existence.
<P>
	As for the redistribution of all government purchasing, we have 
an open policy and, while in some fields there may be more in one 
province than in another, generally everything operates by calling 
for bids from suppliers. The one offering the best product at the 
best price gets the order. I believe this is the system that has been in 
operation in Canada for a very long time, and I doubt the accuracy 
of the figures the hon. member has given.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the system the Prime Minister is referring to always leads 
to the same kind of results, as he ought to realize: the federal 
government always ends up purchasing goods and services in the 
same place.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister aware that, in 1993-94, using a recognized 
and reliable method of economic calculation, by being deprived of 
$2. 5 billion in goods and services sales to the federal 
government-since it always buys from the same place- Quebec 
was deprived of an estimated 44,675 jobs over two years?
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that, through inadequate 
policies such as these, which he supports and defends, Quebec and 
its economy is losing jobs in the meantime, to the tune of some 
22,000 for each of the years of his mandate?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have nothing to add to what I have already said. The 
Bloc Quebecois has been making these statements for ages, and 
there is no basis for them, because in a country like ours, bids and 
tenders are nationwide. The bids are made and then someone gets 
the contract.
<P>
	In some sectors, sometimes we find when we go to other parts of 
Canada that people are complaining that we are doing too much in 
Quebec. Sometimes Quebec  complains that we are doing too much 
in the Prairies. In a federation, that is always how things are.
<P>
	I must say, however, that if the Leader of the Opposition were to 
call his head office in Quebec, he would find that if there were no 
more political insecurity in the country, there would be a great 
many jobs created in Quebec, as there have been in the rest of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would point out to the Prime Minister that all the figures 
cited by the Leader of the Opposition come from Statistics Canada 
and not from the Bloc Quebecois and that when it comes to giving 
contracts to Ontario, there are no calls for tender, as in the case of 
the armoured vehicles.
<P>
	The federal government is spending over one and a half billion 
dollars a year on research in its federal laboratories and research 
centres. It is admitted, however, again according to Statistics 
Canada, that Quebec has never received its fair share of federal 
government research and development investments.
<P>
	In federal laboratories and research centres, the spending deficit 
in Quebec has gone on for over 15 years and, according to Statistics 
Canada, for 1993-94 alone, only 15 per cent of spending took place 
in Quebec, as opposed to 59.1 per cent in Ontario. Does the Prime 
Minister realize that it is policies like this that create 
unemployment in Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the province of Quebec generally in the area of 
research and development receives approximately 27 per cent of 
the funds from the federal government.
<P>
	Apart from the national capital area, the city of Montreal 
receives more funds than most other areas in Canada for research 
and development. They are getting their fair share in Quebec. For a 
province that has a population of approximately 30 per cent, it 
receives approximately the same amount in research money.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not allowed to show the papers I have on my desk, 
but they come from Statistics Canada, and they say that 15 per cent 
goes to Quebec and 59.1 per cent goes to Ontario, to research 
centres in the national capital, and that 90 per cent of spending 
takes place in Ottawa. To my knowledge, Ottawa has not yet moved 
to Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4224"> 4224 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister admit that Quebec's annual shortfall of 
$152 million in federal laboratories and research centres is 
contributing to the unemployment problem, depriving the Quebec 
economy of close to  1,000 steady and meaningful jobs in leading 
sectors, and weakening our ability to create steady and meaningful 
jobs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would point out to the hon. member that one third of the 
public servants working for the federal government in the National 
Capital Region come from the Quebec side. Here, the national 
capital straddles both sides of the river, and government spending 
is worked out not by streets, but by regions.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Since one third are here in the region, very often contracts are 
shown as belonging to Ontario, but one third of those who benefit 
are Quebecers. If an honest division is done, Quebec receives at 
least a share equal to its population.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all the evidence presented to the Somalia inquiry indicates 
gross mismanagement at the top of the Department of National 
Defence, yet Canadians have seen General Boyle blaming 
subordinates and passing the buck instead of taking full 
responsibility. Then they watched the Minister of National Defence 
strongly endorse his hand picked chief of defence staff even before 
General Boyle had completed his evasive testimony.
<P>
	At the same time, both of these people, the Minister of National 
Defence and the chief of defence staff, maintain that they enjoy the 
full confidence of the government and the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Do the minister and the chief of defence staff have the complete 
support and confidence of the Prime Minister, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are happy to see the leader of the third party with a 
new haircut. We hope he will also cut his policies according to new 
needs. I guess he really wanted to be different from the leader of 
the Conservative Party.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence has a job to do. General Boyle 
has a job to do. The Somalia inquiry has a job to do. Let them do 
their jobs. I have confidence in the Minister of National Defence 
and in General Boyle.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister is probably the only one with 
confidence in the defence minister and the chief of defence staff.
<P>
	He is aware that these individuals do not have the confidence of 
the rank and file of Canadian Armed Forces personnel. Major 
General Addy made that perfectly clear just hours after hanging up 
his career  uniform. They certainly do not have the confidence of 
the Canadian public, which many of us have found out in visiting 
with our constituents.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister explain to the House why he continues 
to have confidence in the Minister of National Defence when the 
Canadian public and the armed forces personnel do not?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of National Defence has taken on a very 
difficult task. We are in a period of readjustment in military 
expenditures of the government. We have been obliged to reduce 
bases, reduce the number of personnel and reduce by many billions 
of dollars the expenditures in the Department of National Defence. 
It is always an extremely difficult job.
<P>
	When I appointed the Minister of National Defence I warned 
him it was to be a difficult period. He has done an excellent job in 
extremely difficult circumstances during the last three years. I 
encourage him to stay in his job and keep doing what he is doing. 
He is doing a good job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, evasion and doing nothing seem to be the Prime 
Minister's answer to every difficult problem.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	He has done nothing to roll back the national debt, which will to 
hit $600 billion in a few weeks. He has done nothing to provide 
Canadians with much needed tax relief. He has done nothing on 
national unity except hand out free flags. He is doing nothing now 
to restore the morale of the Canadian Armed Forces or the 
confidence of people in their own military.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister do something? Will he act to restore 
some integrity and accountability in the Canadian Armed Forces by 
asking General Boyle and the Minister of National Defence to 
resign?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for the first time in a long time a government has had the 
courage to ask for an inquiry into the operations of national 
defence. Never has it been done before. Of course we knew it 
would be difficult. It is being done. The inquiry is proceeding. We 
want the inquiry to finish the job.
<P>
	In the meantime, the Minister of National Defence and General 
Boyle have to operate the armed forces, and they are doing it to the 
satisfaction of the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	Criticism is coming in from all directions. We see soldiers, 
officers and even retired generals publicly criticizing, from within 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4225"> 4225 </A></B>
<P>
and from without, the chief of  staff of the Canadian armed forces. 
The critics are unanimous. General Boyle is no longer trusted by 
anyone, and we do not have to wait for the report to know that.
<P>
	How can the minister justify his stubborn insistence on keeping a 
chief of staff whom no one trusts? What is behind all this?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister has essentially answered the question with respect to the 
chief of defence staff and myself.
<P>
	It is very important to realize that, as the Prime Minister said, we 
have initiated an inquiry. It is something we called for when we 
were in opposition with respect to the deployment of the Canadian 
Airborne Regiment in Somalia in 1993. We have discharged our 
promise to the Canadian people by having that inquiry take place.
<P>
	We have to respect the process we now have put in place. It is not 
right to look at evidence in isolation, to judge individuals in 
isolation. We have to look at the entire process.
<P>
	I have faith in the three individuals leading the inquiry that they 
will come to judgments. They will find the truth. That is what we 
want, that is what the Canadian people want.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	While the government is waiting, there is a major crisis of 
confidence in the Canadian armed forces. The Minister of National 
Defence desperately insists on protecting his creature, General 
Boyle.
<P>
	This has been going on for more than a hundred days. Does the 
Prime Minister realize it is now up to him, and no one else, to deal 
with the problem? What is he waiting for to ask for the resignation 
of the minister and General Boyle?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have a commission of inquiry that is doing its job at 
this moment.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the Minister of National Defence is doing a 
difficult job. It is his duty to do so. General Boyle, who took charge 
of the situation at a very difficult time for the armed forces, is 
doing his job as he must. And he must continue to do so. We should 
let the commission of inquiry get on with its job. As soon as we get 
the report from the commission, we will be able to see what 
happened, what is wrong and what action is required.
<P>
	Today, the Canadian armed forces have been substantially 
downsized. Bases have been closed. There has been a considerable 
reduction in the number of officers at headquarters. We use to have 
more than 100 generals, and now we have about 30 less. Some have 
to leave, and this will continue.
<P>
	When someone leaves a post like that, it is not unusual for him to 
complain. Unfortunately, the armed forces have been downsized, 
and it is always difficult when we have to downsize any 
organization, especially the armed forces.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister said today that the Minister of 
National Defence undertook a very difficult task, and indeed he 
did. The Minister of National Defence, after all, oversaw the policy 
of containment of access to information documents. General Boyle 
implemented a policy of containment. The policy was designed to 
mislead the media, to withhold the information from the public and 
to destroy key evidence.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	Was the Minister of National Defence a pawn or a player in this 
scheme, or did Boyle do it on his own?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it very 
troubling that the hon. member, who alleges his party was happy to 
have this inquiry established, is now reflecting on testimony that 
has been given before the inquiry, coming to conclusions and 
raising them here in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I believe this shows that he and his colleagues are not really 
respecting due process. I am sure he would not want us or the 
Canadian people to believe that he is in fact interfering in the very 
process that he applauded when it was set up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Defence insults those 
Canadians who have served in the Canadian Armed Forces. He 
insults those who have died for our country at Dieppe and Vimy 
Ridge and the battle of Ypres. He insults those who have spent 50 
years fighting for peace in our country.
<P>
	Morale in the Canadian Armed Forces has suffered under this 
Minister of National Defence and General Boyle. Our forces 
deserve leadership of the highest calibre. Instead they get unethical 
conduct driven by a policy authorized by this minister, there is no 
responsibility, no accountability.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Canadians are calling for 
the minister and General Boyle to be fired. What is the Prime 
Minister going to do about it?

	I want to take a minute to try to put this in context. Canada is not 
alone in dealing with problems with respect to the military 
following the end of the cold war. The Dutch have had to deal with 
the tragedy in Srebrenica. My friends in the United States have had 
to deal with problems within the navy. In Britain there are 
problems with the decommissioning of historic institutions, of 
structures. In Germany, it is the incorporation of a foreign army 
within the German army.
<P>
	All of this has a common thread that Canada shares. In this 
changing world there is a need to redefine missions, to readjust 
one's priorities, readjust one's spending and also to adapt to the 
changing norms and values of contemporary society.
<P>
	The Canadian forces are doing that, our allies are doing that.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the Minister of National Defence are 
telling us today that they have nothing to hide about the ongoing 
crisis in the Canadian armed forces. They are now trying to hide the 
truth by requesting an injunction aimed at muzzling the 
Information Commissioner in order to prevent him from releasing 
a damning report on the issue of access to information.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister trust a minister who is involved in 
an action aimed at muzzling by all possible means those who 
criticize the way our armed forces are managed?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member is referring to an ongoing court case.
<P>
	I have to be very wary about what I say. This case cannot be 
construed in any way as an attempt by the Department of National 
Defence or the government to deny the public its right to 
information.
<P>
	The court challenge, which is now before the Federal Court, is 
what we believe to be about the inalienable rights of employees of 
the government to fair treatment, a right enjoyed and expected by 
all Canadians.
<P>
	To ensure that an individual employee of ours, the Government 
of Canada, is not unfairly and irredeemably harmed, we are having 
this matter fully adjudicated by the courts. I think we should let the 
courts deal with it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
has been telling us for months that he cannot say anything in this 
House.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister keep in his cabinet a minister who 
will stop at nothing to hold back information in order to protect the 
man he himself appointed to the position of Chief of the Defence 
Staff?
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister and I have answered those questions.
<P>
	For those who say, as does the hon. member and colleagues in 
the Reform Party, that the military is in a mess, I would like them 
to tell that to the men and women who are serving in Bosnia, in 
Haiti and in the Middle East. I would like them to say that to the 
people who man our ships, our air crews and those who conduct 
search and rescue work. I would like them to say that to the 500 
men and women of the air force and army who helped in the 
Saguenay flood. Is that a mess? That is an armed forces that works 
and works well in a difficult climate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the military is doing well despite rather than because of the 
leadership.
<P>
	A good leader and in particular a good military leader must be 
trusted and respected by those who follow.
<P>
	General Boyle's Somalia inquiry testimony indicates that his 
leadership includes misleading the military police, breaking the 
spirit of the Access to Information Act, accusing junior officers of 
lacking moral fibre and receiving preferential treatment from his 
department.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister now act to provide unquestioned 
leadership for the Canadian forces by removing General Boyle and 
the Minister Collenette?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Before I let the Prime Minister answer the 
question, I would like to remind hon. members that we address 
each other by our titles and not our names.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will reply with a long answer. I am keeping the Minister 
of National Defence in his position because I have confidence in 
him. In the previous administration the minister of defence was 
changed each year. I decided that was a problem. I therefore 
appointed one competent person to the job until the job is done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of National Defence accused my colleague of 
interfering with the process. I would point out that it was the 
minister who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4227"> 4227 </A></B>
<P>
drew the conclusions  with regard to General Boyle before General 
Boyle had even finished testifying.
<P>
	The Prime Minister campaigned on issues of leadership, 
integrity and accountability. Will the Prime Minister now admit 
that in continuously defending his hand-picked chief of defence 
staff by doing nothing, he is failing to give the Canadian forces the 
leadership, integrity and accountability it needs and deserves?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is exactly what I am doing. The Canadian forces need 
stable leadership. I have appointed a man who has had a great 
career in the armed forces.
<P>
	There is an inquiry going on at this time. It is always a difficult 
period for any organization when facing an inquiry. Let the 
minister of defence, the chief of staff and the inquiry do their jobs. 
That is what they are there for and they should be allowed to do it.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Last spring, the Minister of Justice explained that the federal 
government was only getting involved in the Bertrand court case 
because the Quebec government was involved.
<P>
	Now that Quebec has announced it will not have anything more 
to do with this case, is the next logical step not for the Minister of 
Justice to also withdraw from this case?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a decision regarding our 
involvement in this case will be made in the days to come. One 
thing is very clear though, we fully intend to fulfil the commitment 
made a few months ago in the speech from the throne, when we 
said that, if and when there is another referendum, we will make 
sure that the question is clear, that the implications are clearly set 
out and that all Canadians have a say on the future of this country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
days preceding the last referendum, the Minister of Justice stated 
that sovereignty was above all a political rather than a legal matter.
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	Could the minister tell us today if the tight vote in the last 
referendum had anything to do with him changing his mind and 
now looking to subordinate the will of the people of Quebec to a 
Constitution that has never been recognized by Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, these two basic principles are 
connected and each of them is very important in its own right. It is 
very important first to determine what the people of Quebec want 
and it is also very important to have a framework within which to 
operate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Without a legal framework, one has chaos. The position 
apparently taken by the Attorney General of Quebec, a surprising 
position, is that he is going to have a referendum which is 
consultative. The very next day, if he gets the results that he wants, 
that is the end of the matter. The country is finished and the 
province is separate.
<P>
	That is not the way things are done in Canada. True to say, the 
will and the decision of the population of Quebec is important. It 
must be seen in the context of a legal framework, because that is 
the way we do things in this country, in accordance with the rule of 
law.

American states, the Government of Canada committed to taking 
steps to strengthen Canada's ties with that region.
<P>
	Given the growing importance of Central America to Canada's 
foreign and trade policy, can the Minister of Foreign Affairs tell us 
what concrete action the government has taken since last spring to 
enhance our relations with Central America?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last spring the Prime Minister and the Central American 
presidents were able to launch a new set of relationships between 
our two regions, which are 30 million people each.
<P>
	Last week we were able to put real, concrete expression to those 
initiatives by starting negotiations on new sets of air links between 
Central America and Canada, signing a series of agreements on 
protection of foreign investment that will give Canadian investors a 
new incentive to develop in that area and a new series of trade 
promotions and marketing proposals.
<P>
	Those economic ties now carry over into a much closer political 
relationship where we now work with them. Central American 
governments now agree to a total ban of land mines, which is a high 
priority for Canadians. They are working very closely with us on 
matters of human reform.
<P>
	We can clearly see in a very short period of time that they have 
been able to launch a brand new generation of relationships in a

Defence and the armed forces over the last few years.
<P>
	Some people cannot accept change. We see that every day in the 
House of Commons by the performance of the hon. member and 
her colleagues. Those people who cannot accept change in the 
armed forces also include people at the general officer level. When 
they cannot accept change, they do the right thing by moving on.
<P>
	We will continue the change. We will continue the revitalization 
of the officer corps, of getting better value for the taxpayers' 
money, of doing more with less. We will continue doing that.
<P>
	If some members of the armed forces are uncomfortable with the 
direction we are taking the armed forces, then they are doing the 
honourable thing by leaving.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

<P>
	The fact is that I am demanding change. There are millions of 
Canadians who are doing exactly the same thing by making sure 
that he leaves. That is demanding change.
<P>
	He also talks about money and downsizing changes in the 
military. We are not talking about money here. We are talking 
about morals.

frivolous and useless spending.
<P>
	My question is for the heritage minister. How can the minister 
justify the fact that, starting today, she will spend $20 million on 
the Information Canada office, a propaganda tool, in addition to the 
$23 million that she is wasting on flags?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, to be sure all Canadians 
are concerned. It is also true that, according to the daily <I>Le Soleil</I>, 
the Quebec separatist government spent $82 million to promote 
separation.
<P>
	I believe that, instead of spending money to break up Canada, we 
should spend to keep our country together.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
clearly we are referring here to the minister's flags and patronage. 
If this is not propaganda, how can the minister justify the fact that 
the usual hiring procedures for the public service were set aside so 
that she could reward her federalist friends?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Canadian flag is not 
my flag, it is the flag of our country. As for the Information Canada 
office, there is a similar service in Germany, in France, in Belgium

are sending a message today by trying to talk about budgets and 
shutdowns of certain armed forces' facilities that it is okay to have 
a different code of conduct for a different level of officer.
<P>
	Why was an officer like General Vernon fired for the actions of 
his subordinates while another General like Boyle is congratulated 
and praised by the minister for doing exactly the same thing?
<P>
	Is there a different standard for a Liberal appointment to the 
highest level or is the same standard to be expected throughout the 
entire armed forces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister dealt with those matters concerning the chief of defence

<P>
	It is very important to underline again at the end of question

	They are saying this to the Minister of National Defence and 
begging him to do something. We will need an inquiry into the 
inquiry the way this is going. He has set a special standard for the 
chief of defence staff, special briefings, special help, special 
treatment by the military police, a special way you treat access to  
information documents, special treatment for the chosen one, the 
Mr. Bean of the Canadian Armed Forces.

defence staff and expect higher standards for other people even 
among the general staff?

	We have had a parliamentary debate on defence policy. We have 
instituted a white paper. We have a procurement policy of new 
equipment. We have re-equipped the army in a way that gives it the 
equipment to deal with the peacekeeping challenges of the future. 
We have delayered, restructured, reduced personnel by 25 per cent. 
We have closed 50 to 60 installations and bases with hardly a ripple

	Following the French decision to ban asbestos in France

<P>
	He will remember that three years ago he and the Liberal Party 
of Canada ran on the issue of jobs. Here we are, three years later, 
with the highest consecutive period of unemployment, above 9 per 
cent, that we have had since the 1930s. In the meantime, his 
government has rejected out of hand any suggestion that the federal 
government cut taxes.
<P>
	Today, the first day of the return of the House, I want to make a 
concrete suggestion to the Prime Minister and the government. 
Will he not recognize that the EI premiums will lead to a $5.5 
billion surplus this year and $5.3 billion next year? That is a total of 
over $10 billion in tax on jobs. Will he not return the money to 
workers and small businesses in the country, cut taxes and create 
jobs as he promised to do three years ago?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the leader of the Conservative Party should remember that 
when we took over from the Conservatives the level of 
unemployment was 11.5 per cent. It is now at 9.4 per cent.
<P>
	As far as the question of the employment insurance program, at 
that time the fund was in a very serious  deficit of approximately $6 
billion. As prudent administrators we want to build a surplus, but in 
the meantime we have managed to reduce the premium from $3.30 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4231"> 4231 </A></B>
<P>
to $2.95. We are reducing the premium on a gradual basis. We have 
paid for the deficit which was established by the Tories. We are 
building a reserve because when it is an insurance scheme it is 
normal in business to have a reserve when there are better years.

the House in 1953 he was reeve of Arthur, chairman of the local 
school board and a member of county council.
<P>
	After he became the member of Parliament for 
Wellington-Huron he served on several committees in the House 
of Commons and was chairman of the transport committee on two 
occasions.
<P>
	I remember him as one who got along well with other members 
and was always a jovial type of person. He served in Parliament 
under four prime ministers, the Rt. Hon. Louis St. Laurent, the Rt. 
Hon. John Diefenbaker, the Rt. Hon. Lester B. Pearson and the Rt. 
Hon. Pierre Elliot Trudeau.
<P>
	During his tenure in the House between 1953 and 1972 there was 
considerable rapport among members of Parliament from both 
sides of the House of Commons. As a result members tended to get 
to know one another extremely well. That boded well for this 
institution. Regardless of the different party affiliations each of us  
realized the other person had some good community and national 
spirit to share. Marvin Howe was a hard working MP and was 
always a friend.
<P>
	It is ironical that today we are paying tribute to two former 
members of the House, both of whom lived to be over 90 years of 
age. Marvin Howe was one who spent those years trying to help his 
neighbours and his country and we thank his family for sharing him 
with us for a long period of time.

	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to add my condolences, and those of the other Bloc Quebecois 
members, to those expressed by the hon. member who has just 
spoken to the House honouring the memory of Mr. Howe. Our 
sympathy also goes out to his four children and his wife, Susan.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	None of us sat with him, so we did not know him personally, but 
during my few years as a Conservative MP, I heard others speak of 
the good work he had done, especially at Transport.
<P>
	His Conservative colleagues knew him to be a jovial man, with a 
great respect for others. After his involvement on the municipal 
and school board level, he served for several years here in the 
House of Commons. We salute him for his remarkable contribution 
and his commitment to the Canadian community.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to join hon. members of the Liberal Party and the Bloc 
Quebecois in remembering Dr. Victor Railton and Mr. William 
Marvin Howe.
<P>
	Both men from Ontario dedicated years of their lives to the 
service of Canadians both in this place and in their communities. 
They were living examples of service above self. Their 
commitment to serving the public should be an inspiration to us all.
<P>
	On behalf of the Reform Party I want to extend our sympathies 
and condolences to the families and friends of these two fine 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the NDP caucus I would like to join with my colleagues in 
the House of Commons in honouring the memory and the service 
of former members of Parliament William Marvin Howe and 
Samuel Victor Railton.
<P>
	It was mentioned earlier by the member for 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke that both these men lived to the 
ripe old age of 90. They were lives long and fully lived, fully lived 
in part because so much of their lives they gave to their 
communities in the form of their service in the House of Commons 
and in so many other ways.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THELATEDR.VICTORRAILTON">THE LATE DR. VICTOR RAILTON</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Dr. Victor Railton, whom we are fondly 
remembering today, was a great Canadian by virtue of his many 
achievements and his dedication to each cause he undertook.
<P>
	Victor Railton was a no nonsense person when it came to getting 
a job done, but at all times he practised a sense of decency and was 
always considerate of other people's feelings. These qualities 
helped him to exercise excellent bedside manners as a physician 
and surgeon and also served him extremely well in carrying out his 
duties both here in the House of Commons and with his 
constituents during his tenure as a member of Parliament from 
1972 to 1979.
<P>
	He and his wife Ruth, who predeceased him in 1987, were highly 
regarded both on and off the Hill.
<P>
	With regard to his academic background, Victor Railton 
graduated from Brantford Collegiate and then from the University 
of Toronto in medicine in 1929. He practised family medicine in 
Port Colborne, obtained a fellowship in surgery as a specialist and 
served brilliantly in the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps from 
1940 to 1945 as a surgeon in France, England, Belgium and 
Holland where he played a leadership role in field hospital work.
<P>
	After he came home he practised surgery in Welland where he 
became chief of staff of the Welland County General Hospital. This 
outstanding Canadian served as chairman of the board of education 
for the city of Welland and was awarded the Centennial Medal in 
1967.
<P>
	He was a dedicated, talented person who led many fine 
community causes. He became a volunteer surgeon in Nigeria 
during the Biafran War in 1970.
<P>
	In 1972 he was elected as the member of Parliament for Welland 
and was re-elected on July 8, 1974. He served as parliamentary 
secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs and served on several 
committees in the House. Dr. Railton always delivered well 
informed speeches in this House.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	He is survived today by his wife Deirdre Railton, his sons 
Richard and James, and his daughters Jane and Eleanor. He is also 
survived by eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. We 
extend our sincere sympathy to all of them on this occasion. He 
was predeceased by his daughter Nancy, and three sisters. We thank 
his family for sharing the life of their wonderful father with us.
<P>
	As an MP he was everybody's friend and adviser and indeed a 
doctor to many of his colleagues, including yours truly. It was not 
his nature to become rattled or upset in any way. He always had his 
feet planted firmly on the ground and his head on his shoulders.
<P>
	Dr. Railton was a hardworking MP, a friend and a very congenial 
and jovial person at all times. Victor Railton was over 90 years of 
age when he passed away. Those 90 years were productive, 
dedicated and a fantastic service to his family, his community, his 
country and the international community.
<P>
	Today as we pay tribute to this remarkable man, many members 
and aspirants to public office could well use his exemplary life to 
help them mould their own future.
<P>
	We thank his family for sharing his life with us for the 
betterment of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
also like to join the previous speaker in paying a short tribute to 
Victor Samuel Railton, who was from Welland. It is a pleasure to 
do so on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois and on behalf of all 
members, since this city is twinned with the city of Tracy in my 
riding. There is as a result a great deal of affinity with the people of 
my riding who have made several visits to this region. They did so 
at the time when Mr. Railton was a federal member, and I therefore 
hasten to offer my condolences to his children and grandchildren.
<P>
	We greatly respect his work as a remarkable physician in 
hospitals, as a president of the school board and in many 
associations where he was very active, such as the Canadian Cancer 
Society, the Red Cross and the Canadian Arthritis Society. He also 
served our community and our nation well in the Canadian armed 
forces.
<P>
	I would also like to recall what my colleagues told me. When I 
arrived here in 1984, when people referred to good speakers, those 
who were noted for exceptional content and the wealth of their 
vocabulary, Mr. Railton's name was often mentioned. I remember 
these references and also that people said he was a very tolerant 
man who showed the utmost respect for every member of the 
House.
<P>
	We will remember his work as a member of Parliament, as a 
physician and as a citizen involved in the community of Welland. 
Again, we offer our sincere condolences to his family.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, you will permit me to say a few 
words about Dr. Railton inasmuch as he was the member of 
Parliament for the riding which I presently represent.
<P>
	Dr. Railton as was pointed out served as a participating member 
in many of the debates. He had a very special  affinity for veterans 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4233"> 4233 </A></B>
<P>
because he was one. I am reminded of a story. During the second 
world war in the Falaise gap Dr. Railton was performing surgery in 
a tent on our wounded soldiers and it came under fire. As a matter 
of fact the tent at one point was almost overrun by enemy soldiers. 
Dr. Vic Railton through all of that stayed at his post and continued 
his surgery until that area was retaken.
<P>
	As members of Parliament, many times things happen to us 
nearby where doctors are just not readily available for one reason 
or another. I can recall in the 1970s, around 1977, when one of our 
members had a heart attack. We were all running around bumping 
into one another. Thank God Vic Railton was there because I do 
think that in that case it was a matter of life instead of death for one 
of our members.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Vic Railton was very highly regarded in our community of 
Welland. He served in various posts. He will be remembered more 
than anything because he was an accessible person. We are going to 
miss him in Welland. In the last few years he was not feeling very 
well.
<P>
	May I, on behalf of the House, offer our condolences to his wife 
Deirdre, to his sons and daughters and to his many grandchildren 
and great-grandchildren.
<P>
	I do not use the term loosely when I say that Vic Railton 
contributed a great deal to this House and a great deal to Canada 
both in war and in peace. To his remaining family we do extend our 
very sincerest condolences. We are going to miss him.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SECURITYINTELLIGENCEREVIEWCOMMITTEE-SPEAKER'SRULING">SECURITY INTELLIGENCE REVIEW COMMITTEE-SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> On June 19, 1996 following the tabling of the first 
report of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs 
entitled ``The Heritage Front Affair: Our View'', the hon. member 
for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley raised a question of 
privilege. She alleged that the standing committee's subcommittee 
on national security had been misled by the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee, which I will refer to as SIRC, in connection 
with the subject matter of this report and that SIRC had shown 
contempt for the House of Commons by knowingly providing 
inaccurate information to the subcommittee. Further, she argued 
SIRC had provided inaccurate information to the solicitor general 
thereby causing him to table an incomplete report in the House on 
December 15, 1994.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	After hearing additional comments from the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre, the chief government whip, and the hon. member 
for Gander-Grand Falls, the Acting Speaker took the matter under 
advisement.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Before addressing the question of privilege itself, may I preface 
my remarks with a comment.
<P>
	When members raise a question of privilege in the House, I take 
it as an extremely important matter, as I am sure all hon. members 
do. Privilege exists in this institution to ensure that members are 
able to carry out their duties without interference. A breach of 
privilege is so serious that we expect it to be brought to the 
attention of the House at the first opportunity. Then, if in the 
opinion of the Chair there is found to be a prima facie breach of 
privilege, the matter will be given precedence over all other 
business before the House. A motion will be moved by the member 
raising the question of privilege and it will be up to the House to 
decide what to do with the matter. That said, it must also be 
recognized that time is a precious commodity in this Chamber.
<P>
	I would request therefore that when raising questions of 
privilege members keep both of those ideas in mind and attempt to 
explain the facts of their case as succinctly as possible. This should 
be done by indicating at the outset which privileges have been 
breached and how they have been breached, without entering into 
debate and repeating arguments either already made before the 
House or, as in the present case, contained in a committee report 
presented to the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our tradition dictates that when matters of privilege arise out of 
the proceedings of a committee, the committee should report the 
matter to the House in order for the House to be seized with it.
<P>
	Beauchesne's sixth edition citation 107 explains that breaches of 
privilege related to committee deliberations may be dealt with only 
by the House itself on report from the committee. Only in the most 
extreme circumstances would the Chair of its own volition deal 
with matters arising from the proceedings of a committee.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	The standing committee has reported to the House on the 
Heritage Front affair. It has not, however, reported to the House 
that it views that any contempt has been made by Security 
Intelligence Review Committee in connection with the 
committee's study.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4234"> 4234 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have carefully reviewed the member's arguments. It appears 
the member clearly has a dispute as to the facts presented to the 
committee. However, in my opinion this is a matter for debate and 
not a question of privilege.
<P>
	Should the member wish to return to the committee with the 
matter and the committee opt to report to the House on this aspect 
of the question, the House at that time may choose to deal with it.
<P>
	In addition, the member for Surrey-White Rock-South 
Langley has placed on notice a motion for concurrence in the first 
report of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.
<P>
	I respectfully suggest she will have ample opportunity to bring 
her concerns forward when this motion is moved for the 
consideration of the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I thank all hon. members for their participation in the discussion 
of this question of privilege.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I have the honour to inform 
the House that Mr. Chuck Strahl, member for the electoral district 
of Frazer Valley East, has been appointed as member of the board 
of internal economy in place of Mr. Jim Silye, member for the 
electoral district of Calgary Centre, for the purposes and under the

<P>
	The petitioners suggest that although herbs, botanicals and 
natural extracts and other natural remedies are not explicitly 
mentioned in Bill C-7, it is ambiguous. For that reason the

highly skilled professionals who are shut out of their professions by 
licensing bodies that protect their market from the entry of foreign 
trained professionals. Whereas there is no federal or provincial 
program to assist foreign trained veterinarians to enter the 
profession where there is a high demand in most provinces, the 
petitioners call on the Government of Canada to help integrate 
foreign trained veterinarians into the profession, reduce the power 
to restrict entry into the fields granted to the licensing bodies, 
remove all barriers that prevent foreign trained veterinarians from 
competing in a free and open labour market and create a  national 
body that can assess foreign credentials and grant licences based on 
its findings.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Have any tenders been awarded in the last twelve months by Public Works 
Canada, that were not accompanied by a deposit cheque, where the terms of the 
tender stated ``a certified cheque payable to the Receiver General for Canada in an

offer to purchase'' and, if so, why?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B> Insofar as Public Works and 
Government Services Canada is concerned, no tenders have been 
awarded in the last twelve months that were not accompanied by a 
deposit cheque, where the terms of the tender stated that ``a 
certified cheque payable to the Receiver General for Canada in an 
amount equal to 10% of the price offered must be submitted as a 
deposit with the offer to purchase''.
<P>
Question No. 33-<B>Ms. Bridgman:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With regard to the increasing use of Electric Shock Treatment (ECT) in Canadian 
hospitals and, specifically, in British Columbia hospitals, what: (<I>a</I>) are the numbers 
by province, by sex, and by age groups of people receiving ECT annually across 
Canada for the past ten years; (<I>b</I>) is the number of patients by age group who died 
while undergoing the ECT procedure, within fourteen (14) days of treatment, and 
within one (1) year of treatment; (<I>c</I>) is the cost of ECT in Canada including the cost 
of the shock and all related costs such as anaesthesia, associated pharmaceutical 
treatment, and hospitalization; (<I>d</I>) federally-funded psychiatric research involves the 
use of ECT especially with regard to senior citizens; and (<I>e</I>) psychiatric conditions 
appear to make ECT the treatment of choice?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> a) &amp; b) 
Questions regarding the frequency of ECT use in British Columbia 
(B.C.), and outcome, should be referred to the B.C. Ministry of 
Health.
<P>
	As for national statistics, Statistics Canada keeps information on 
procedures in general hospitals but not in psychiatric hospitals. 
They have advised us that:
<P>
	(1) The information requested is not available ``off the shelf''. A 
user fee would be levied by Statistics Canada for analysis of the 
data.
<P>
	(2) It may be possible to produce figures showing the number of 
general hospital separations following ECT in the past 10 years, 
broken down by province, age group and sex.
<P>
	(3) It may also be possible to determine how many of these 
separations were discharges of living patients and how many were 
deceased.
<P>
	(4) Before 1992-93, the absence of personal identifier data 
precluded the determination of the link between the number of 
separations and the number of patients involved: e.g., whether the 
same patient was (admitted and) discharged 5 times or whether, in 
the other extreme, five separations involved five different 
individuals.
<P>
	(5) The following questions cannot be answered using Statistics 
Canada data: (i) total number of people receiving ECT annually for 
the past 10 years (because data exclude psychiatric hospitals, and 
data prior to 1992/93 relate only to separations, not individuals, as 
noted above); (ii) number of patients who were given ECT and who 
died within 14 days or one year of treatment (all that could be 
obtained are the number of separations of living patients and the 
number of deceased, in the same year that ECT had been 
administered in a general hospital, but the causal link could not be 
established).
<P>
	c) There have not been any comprehensive Canadian studies on 
this issue. Statistics Canada have advised that they keep data on the 
number of separations following the administration of ECT in 
general hospitals (as above) and the average cost of a day of care in 
hospital, but the number of hospitals days actually attributable to 
ECT would not be known. As well, unknown is the cost of a day in 
a general hospital attributable to ECT administration compared to 
the average cost of a day in hospital for any treatment.
<P>
	The interpretation of any cost study should include an estimate 
of the costs, both direct and indirect, of alternatives to the use of 
ECT for the severe conditions for which it is administered [see 
response to question (e)].
<P>
	d) The only federally-funded research identified by the Medical 
Research Council (MRC) and by Health Canada's National Health 
Research and Development Program (NHRDP) was a three-year 
study at the University of British Columbia, currently funded by 
MRC, entitled ECT-induced Prolactin Release, the Mechanism of 
Action of ECT and Clinical Outcome.
<P>
	e) According to the 1992 position paper of the Canadian 
Psychiatric Association on ECT, the main diagnostic indications 
for ECT include major depression, bipolar disorder, non chronic 
schizophrenia (especially when affective or catatonic 
symptomatology is prominent), schizoaffective disorder and 
schizophreniform disorder.
<P>
	The decision to use ECT in the treatment of an individual patient 
is a medical one, based on the  psychiatrist's assessment of the 
patient's illness and an evaluation of the merits of ECT versus 
alternative treatments. It involves a process of informed consent. 
The decision is based on factors, in addition to diagnosis, such as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4238"> 4238 </A></B>
<P>
the patient's prior treatment response, the severity of the disorder, 
the relative need for rapid response to treatment (e.g., when the 
patient is suicidal), the risks and benefits of ECT in comparison 
with other appropriate treatments and the patient's preferred 
treatment modality).
<P>
	Additional questions on this subject may be addressed to the 
Canadian Psychiatric Association, 200-237 Argyle Avenue, 
Ottawa, Ontario K2P 1B8.
<P>
Question No. 34-<B>Mr. Althouse:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Which Canadian institutions or agencies does the government consider to be 
``state trading entities'' for purposes of the GATT negotiations which begin in 1999 
and have departmental officials received such a list?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> The Canadian Government considers the following to be 
State Trading Enterprises (STEs) for the purposes of the GATT 
1994, and, in accordance with the requirements under GATT 
Article XVII, has submitted notifications on them to the World 
Trade Organization (WTO):
<P>
	-Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation;<BR>
	-Canadian Wheat Board;<BR>
 	-Canadian Dairy Commission;<BR>
	-Provincial Liquor Boards.
<P>
	The Canadian Government has not, therefore, ``received'' any 
list; rather, the Government has compiled its list of STEs as shown 
above, and has submitted the required notifications to the WTO.
<P>
	In addition, it has been determined that, in order to complete the 
list, Canada should also submit a notification on the Ontario Bean 
Producer's Marketing Board; this will be completed in the near 
future.
<P>
	Turning to the 1999 negotiations referred to in this Question: In 
the Uruguay Round, WTO Members reached an Agreement on 
Agriculture which establishes binding commitments in the 
following key areas: market access; domestic support; and export 
subsidies. There are no provisions in the Agreement on Agriculture 
relating to STEs. Members agreed to resume negotiations on the 
Agreement on Agriculture in 1999.
<P>
Question No. 40-<B>Mr. Simmons:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to the plain and generic packaging component of the Tobacco 
Demand Reduction Strategy: (<I>a</I>) is Health Canada continuing to study the 
effectiveness of plain packaging in reducing the uptake and consumption of tobacco 
products; (<I>b</I>) does Health Canada currently have evidence of the impact, either 
positive or negative, that plain packaging of tobacco products would have on 
tobacco uptake and consumption; and (<I>c</I>) when the federal government puts forward 
legislative measures to ban advertising of tobacco products as outlined in the 
Blueprint document of December, 1995, will the packaging of tobacco products be 
subject to control?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> a) At this 
time Health Canada's priority is to fill the gap in the federal 
tobacco control strategy resulting from the Supreme Court ruling. 
With respect to plain packaging, Health Canada is evaluating the 
international trade, legal and economic issues surrounding this 
possible legislative measure.
<P>
	b) Health Canada commissioned an Expert Panel to conduct a 
series of studies on plain packaging. The Expert Panel released its 
report entitled, When Packages Can't Speak: Possible impacts of 
plain and generic packaging of tobacco products, in March 1995. 
These studies with other published research on plain packaging are 
being evaluated.
<P>
	c) Packaging is an important element of the marketing strategies 
of the tobacco companies. Measures have been proposed in the 
Blueprint to control aspects of packaging. Legislative options 
regarding the control of packaging are being considered.
<P>
Question No. 41-<B>Mr. Simmons:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to Canada's Drug Strategy: (<I>a</I>) has this Strategy achieved its 
objective of reducing the demand for substances and the associated social, medical 
and economic costs; (<I>b</I>) will this initiative be renewed; and (<I>c</I>) what federal actions 
will continue to be taken for youth, women, seniors, and off-reserve Aboriginal 
people?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> The 
government is now evaluating the results of Canada's Drug 
Strategy (CDS). This work will be completed in March 1997. In the 
meantime, the government knows from the results of the second 
national survey on alcohol and other drugs issues conducted in the 
Fall 1994, there has been a decrease in the number of Canadians 
who drink alcohol, since 1989. Similarly there has been a reduction 
in the percentage of people who drive after consuming two or more 
drinks in the previous hour, and a reduction in the use of some 
illicit drugs. The findings of the CDS evaluation will guide 
decisions regarding future initiatives to reduce substance abuse. 
The evaluation will look at the harm caused by alcohol and other 
drugs and at the extent to which the needs of youth, women, seniors 
and off-reserve Aboriginal people with regards to substance abuse 
have been addressed.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Health is currently undertaking a 
study to review Canada's drug policy. The Committee plans to 
study substances that have the potential to cause harm to 
individuals when abused or misused, including legal drugs such as 
those contained in alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, solvents 
and prescription drugs as well as illegal drugs such as cannabis, 
heroin and LSD.
<P>
Question No. 51-<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For each of the last 10 years, how many Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
(RCMP)-owned service revolvers, pistols, rifles, shotguns and tactical weapons have 
been destroyed by the government, and why is the government planning to destroy  
approximately 178 rifles, 136 pistols and 22,000 revolvers in 1995-96, and (<I>a</I>) what is 
the fair market value for these firearms as collectors' items or as historical artifacts, and </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4239"> 4239 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) why does the RCMP remove or obliterate the corporate markings, such as 
``RCMP'' or ``MP'', which reduces the market value and historical significance of 
these firearms, and (<I>c</I>) why are these firearms not traded-in for newer weapons or 
offered for sale to individual firearm owners who are authorized by the RCMP to own 
these types of firearms?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Insofar as the 
Ministry of the Solicitor General of Canada and its agency is 
concerned, the answer is as follows:
<P>
	ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE (RCMP)
<P>
	Information from RCMP computerized records from June 1991 
to June 1995 indicates that the RCMP has destroyed the following 
types and quantities of RCMP-owned firearms:
<P>
	Rifles-183<BR>
	Gas Guns-21<BR>
	Pistols-35<BR>
 	Revolvers-391<BR>
 	Shotguns-13<BR>
 	Tactical weapons (Submachine guns)-13
<P>
	The majority of these firearms were destroyed because they were 
no longer serviceable or were not economical to repair. Information 
from (paper) files prior to 1991, is no longer available. Files were 
destroyed in accordance with schedules established for the 
retention of such documentation. Information was not kept 
specifically for statistical purposes.
<P>
	The RCMP is also in the process of destroying an additional 178 
rifles, 136 pistols and 22,000 revolvers, which the RCMP considers 
obsolete or surplus to its requirements.
<P>
	Current Public Works and Government Services Canada 
(PWGSC)/Crown Assets Distribution Directorate (CADD) policy 
governing the disposal of firearms only allows for the sale of 
serviceable weapons on a government-to-government basis, or 
destruction. CADD also views the trade-in of firearms as another 
form of ``sale''. The RCMP did not pursue the possibility of trading 
in its .38 calibre revolvers or other firearms because it was not clear 
what degree of control the RCMP would have over the final 
disposition of those firearms, once they were turned over to the 
purchaser (in most cases a firearms distributor acting on behalf of a 
manufacturer).
<P>
	The Solicitor General of Canada and the Commissioner of the 
RCMP recognize that both public opinion and government policy 
strongly support stricter gun control and initiatives that reduce the 
proliferation of firearms in society. The RCMP chose to lead by 
example and not pursue the authority to trade-in or sell its obsolete 
firearms to any firearms distributors or individuals for collection 
purposes. As no sale or disposal is being considered, it is difficult 
to speculate on the fair market value of the firearms as collectors 
items or as historical artifacts.
<P>
Question No. 54-<B>Ms. Meredith:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Could the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration list all special immigration 
centres established in Canada and overseas for the review of written applications for 
entry to Canada and for the determination of entry visas without oral examinations?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> In Canada, there are two case processing 
centres which deal with applications for entry to Canada. They are 
Case Processing Centre (CPC) in Vegreville and Case Processing 
Centre (CPC) in Mississauga. In April 1994, CPC Vegreville 
became the centralized point of processing for all visitor and 
immigrant applications from within Canada. CPC Mississauga is 
the national case processing centre for all overseas sponsorships.
<P>
	Overseas, the Area Processing Centre (APC) in Buffalo, New 
York reviews and processes written visa applications from 
residents of the U.S.A.
<P>
	By next year, Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) will 
have less than 30 missions abroad which receive immigrant 
applications and screen them to determine whether a selection 
decision can be made solely on the basis of written information 
provided by applicants. Interviews are conducted only when the 
information provided is insufficient to properly assess an 
application or when the reliability of the information is in doubt.
<P>
	The same principles apply to visitor, student and temporary 
worker cases, with the caveat that clients often submit these 
applications in person. Whenever possible, missions screen 
in-person visitor applications on a priority basis and conduct client 
interviews, if required, on the spot. Most in-person visitor visa 
applications are finalized on the day they are received, thus 
providing optimal service to clients.
<P>
Question No. 55-<B>Ms. Meredith:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Could the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration explain the circumstances 
under which entry visas are granted without oral examinations for all immigrant 
categories and for temporary entrants other than visitors?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Whenever possible, missions finalize 
immigrant and non-immigrant (e.g. student, temporary worker) 
visa applications on the basis of objective evidence contained in 
documentation provided by the client. Interviews are convoked 
only when needed to deal with more subjective issues such as 
intention or credibility or to clarify ambiguous issues related to the 
documentation. Employing risk management principles, the visa 
office which receives the application determines whether a client 
interview is needed.
<P>
	Because some types of cases are more easily resolved through 
documentation than others, interview waiver rates vary between 
application categories. For example, interviews are waived in a 
high percentage of spousal applications. Refugee applicants are 
systematically interviewed to determine their eligibility as ref-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4240"> 4240 </A></B>
<P>
ugees  under the United Nations Convention and their admissibility 
to Canada as permanent residents.
<P>
	Interview waiver rates also vary between visa offices. The 
incidence of fraud and the availability, quality and reliability of 
documentation vary from place to place.
<P>
	In 1995, about 45 percent of the immigrant cases were finalized 
without an interview. Risk management practices are continually 
assessed and reassessed through quality assurance measures and 
this percentage will likely continue to increase. In no way, 
however, are these practices implemented at the expense of the 
integrity of the immigration system.
<P>
Question No. 59-<B>Mr. Simmons:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In reference to the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, what action is the 
federal government taking in response to the claims made by the Auditor General in 
his November 1995 Report to Parliament, that, (a) with respect to the Action 
Program and Fisheries Alternatives Program, there were ``weaknesses in assessing 
key economic development criteria-and weaknesses in monitoring project progress 
and results''; and (<I>b</I>) with respect to the COOPERATION Program, ``the 
agreements-have broad eligibility criteria and objectives that are not clearly linked 
to program objectives'' and ``information on project activity and results is not 
maintained in a consistent manner?''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Secretary of State (Veterans) 
(Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), Lib.):</B> Insofar as the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA) is concerned, a 
number of steps have been undertaken to respond to the concerns 
expressed by the Auditor General (AG) in his November 1995 
report to Parliament.
<P>
	-ACOA's multi-year plan emphasizes results measurement in 
response to the AG report. This will be reflected in the Agency's 
second five-year report to Parliament. The plan incorporates 
improvements in the Agency's program information and reporting 
structure;
<P>
	-ACOA has commenced the development and application of 
intermediary indicators which link mandated objectives of jobs and 
earned incomes to the Agency's program and project activity. The 
Agency is also evaluating its non-commercial activities to improve 
knowledge regarding their economic impact. These indicators 
relate to several key economic criteria which will guide the 
measurement of Agency programming success;
<P>
	-ACOA continues to undertake periodic surveys as a means of 
identifying trends in employment and commercial achievement. 
The establishment of Economic Benefits Monitoring Policy and 
Procedures will become a guideline for all of ACOA's program 
activities;
<P>
	-ACOA is laying the ground work for successful monitoring 
and evaluation by developing and implementing evaluation 
frameworks for all of the Agency's major program activities and by 
assigning  responsibilities and accountability for evaluation and 
monitoring;
<P>
	-Quality Assurance Reviews, which are being done annually, 
will help ensure that monitoring efforts take place and results 
measurement indicators are applied consistently, and;
<P>
	-A statistical sampling approach to monitoring projects is also 
being developed. A pilot project is underway and full application is 
anticipated for the near future.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-45, an act to amend 
the Criminal Code (judicial review of parole eligibility) and 
another act in consequence thereof, as reported (without 
amendment) from a committee; and of motions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to make the following comment. I listened 
religiously to what both the government and the Reform Party had 
to say about this amendment to section 745. From what I can see, 
the government paid some attention to our suggestions, as the 
speech I heard went, in large part, along the same lines as what we 
have always said about this amendment.
<P>
	What baffles me somewhat is the Reform line where they seem 
to put everything in a jumble and even go in for some 
disinformation. I do not wish to dwell on this but what I have heard 
said to spook people was so gross that I must at least give you one 
example among many. The hon. member said, referring to the Paul 
Bernardo case: ``It is terrible; he could apply for parole in 15 
years''.
<P>
	I would remind members that this individual was declared a 
dangerous criminal and, as such, will not be able to take advantage 
of section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I think that the Criminal Code already goes a long way towards 
addressing the Reform Party's claims and concerns about public 
safety. But the Criminal Code must be considered globally, as it 
applies to parole as well as to the concept of dangerous criminal, a 
relatively new concept that the courts, yielding to public pressure, 
will eventually enforce. After all the judges live in the same world 
as we do.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	This concerns me because the Criminal Code forms a whole. 
And I have a problem with the amendment the Minister of Justice 
wants to make to section 745 of the Criminal Code. The minister is 
trying to respond to public pressure or to in-house polls we do not 
have,  which probably show how the population is increasingly 
moving to the right. Perhaps the minister is thinking: if I want to 
score political points with the voters in this regard, I should tighten 
the screw.
<P>
	I think that the Minister of Justice is acting irresponsibly by 
simply going ahead and amending section 745, as it is a very 
important section of the Criminal Code. This section is a link in the 
chain of the prison system. It did not come out of nowhere. 
Everything hangs together in the Criminal Code and in the 
philosophy we have defended in this country, whose evolution 
Quebecers have done a great deal to bring about. Section 745 is 
already aimed at protecting the public and rehabilitating criminals.
<P>
	True, this section was adopted 20 years ago. You may recall that 
many moving speeches were made in this House during 
consideration of section 745 as the bill was aimed at abolishing 
capital punishment. However, the arguments put forward by the 
minister today to speed up the legislative process are designed to 
hide his failure to plan a piece of legislation originating from his 
own department. Instead of thinking about how to muzzle the 
people of Quebec, which is moving toward sovereignty, the 
minister should perhaps stop and think for a few minutes about 
what he could do in his own department to design a bill that 
provides for the rehabilitation and social reintegration of criminals 
while at the same time protecting the public.
<P>
	In this regard, as I was saying earlier, section 745 already 
protects the public, which is entitled to the protection it seeks. So 
this is not a real problem. True, it is fashionable today to adopt 
extremist positions in order to win some votes votes in English 
Canada, but this must not be used as an excuse.
<P>
	In fact, if we read documents from the department, and also 
some newspaper articles, we can see that the proposed amendments 
to section 745 are primarily motivated by the case of serial killer 
Clifford Olson who, under this provision, has the right to apply for 
his release.
<P>
	The minister seems to be have been caught off guard by this 
case. Yet, we have known for 15 years that, on August 12, 1996, 
this criminal would have the right to invoke section 745, but the 
minister did not do anything. Now, at the last minute, he wants to 
quickly pass an amendment on the grounds that we cannot allow 
this criminal to use section 745. We have known for 15 years that 
this criminal would invoke section 745; all criminals do so. 
However, not all of them see their application approved.
<P>
	In its present form, section 745 provides some security and I 
have no doubt that, if we apply this section and instruct the jury in 
an appropriate manner, this criminal will not get what he is seeking 
to obtain through section 745. But the section must be applied. We 
have to give the jury a proper opportunity to make a decision.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4242"> 4242 </A></B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois made a number of observations regarding 
section 745, including three in particular, which have led us to 
propose, as did the hon. member for Bellechasse, motions to 
amend three clauses of this bill.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	First, we believe in rehabilitation. However, the amendments to 
section 745 of the Criminal Code put such restrictions on the scope 
of the judicial review that this review will exist only in theory. 
Indeed, the requirement for a unanimous decision by the jury 
makes it almost impossible for an applicant to get a positive 
response to his or her application for a judicial review, since a 
single juror could block the whole process.
<P>
	The second reason we oppose these changes is that they remove 
the right of multiple murderers to apply for judicial review. It is 
completely arbitrary and unfair. In the field of justice, in the field 
of crime, there is no formula by which someone who has 
committed a murder has certain rights, whereas someone who has 
committed two murders does not have those rights. All this must be 
looked at in its context. It is because of the system as a whole that 
there is a history to the administration of justice, with the result that 
if we amend a section here and a section there, we may change the 
rules of the game, with disastrous consequences.
<P>
	The third reason we are against the proposed changes is the 
introduction of a new concept in the Criminal Code, the so-called 
reasonable prospect that the judge must consider. I think that 
further study and closer examination of this new concept in the 
Criminal Code are indicated.
<P>
	We have nothing against reviewing a section 20 years after it was 
passed. What we are saying is that we should take more time to 
analyse the changes, listen more carefully to what the public wants. 
We should listen to what the experts who will be applying this 
section can tell us about what direction to take in amending section 
745, something the minister is not doing now, in his haste to 
proceed.
<P>
	It must be remembered that the first reading of Bill C-45 took 
place on June 11, 1996. We adjourned for the whole summer, and 
today, the first day of our return, we are already at the report stage. 
What is the rush? Why change such an important section in the 
Criminal Code? Let us take the time to examine section 745 and to 
listen to the experts who will be applying it.
<P>
	That is why the member for Bellechasse, a member of the Bloc 
Quebecois, has at least presented amendments. I say at least, 
because this point should be studied further. But at this stage, I 
think that the unanimity rule is the most important rule that must be 
blocked. We must not vote in favour, and the amendment proposed 
by the member for Bellechasse changes unanimity to three quarters 
of the members of the jury, so that nine out of 12 will make the 
decision on whether or not to apply  section 745, instead of the 
unanimous decision that the minister is calling for.
<P>
	If the minister wants to be clear about what he is doing, if he is 
against section 745, then let him follow the lead of the Reformers 
and make up his mind to repeal it. But if he believes in 
rehabilitation, if he believes in section 745, I think that he should at 
least receive the amendments proposed by the member for 
Bellechasse to change the requirement from unanimity to three 
quarters of the members of the jury.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak against the motions which have been 
introduced. These motions are for the purposes of amending Bill 
C-45, an act to amend the Criminal Code, judicial review of parole 
ineligibility and another act.
<P>
	There are six motions on the Order Paper. Three have been 
introduced by the hon. member for Bellechasse and three have been 
introduced by the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
	However, as I am sure the hon. members will have observed, all 
six motions come down to the same thing. All of them seek to 
change the proposed amendment in Bill C-45 that would require 
that a section 745 jury be unanimous in order to grant an offender a 
reduction in his or her parole ineligibility period.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	As anyone who has followed the debates on this issue will know, 
at present section 745 allows a review jury to reduce an offender's 
parole ineligibility period with a two-thirds vote, or 8 members out 
of 12 on the jury. In Bill C-45 the government proposes to change 
that standard from two-thirds of the jury to unanimity so that all 
members of the review jury reviewing section 745 applications 
must agree in order to reduce the ineligibility period for parole.
<P>
	The motions before us today seek to do is to replace the 
government's proposed standard of 12 votes out of 12 in order to 
reduce the parole ineligibility period, with a lower standard of 10 
votes out of 12, in the case of the motions introduced by the hon. 
member for Kingston and the Islands, and 9 votes out of 12 in the 
case of motions introduced by the hon. member for Bellechasse. 
These motions then would provide a standard that is somewhat 
higher than that under the current law but is still significantly lower 
than the standard proposed by Bill C-45.
<P>
	When the government introduced Bill C-45, its aim was among 
other things to strengthen the role of the community jury in section 
745 proceedings by strengthening the statement made by the jury in 
making their decision. In those cases where the jury decides to  
reduce the offender's parole ineligibility period, under the 
government's amendments it could only be done by unanimous 
decision, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4243"> 4243 </A></B>
<P>
the strongest possible statement by a jury of ordinary Canadians 
drawn from the community.
<P>
	In addition, the government's intention was to return to the time 
honoured standard in our criminal justice system that a jury's 
verdict must be unanimous. The standard for conviction or 
acquittal in the Canadian justice system is and always has been that 
the jury must be unanimous in their decision. Why, I would ask, 
would the standard be anything less for a section 745 application?
<P>
	Perhaps it would help to recall that section 745 is an exceptional 
mechanism under which a person convicted of the most serious 
offence in the Criminal Code may obtain a grant of clemency with 
respect to their parole ineligibility period. Why should an offender 
not have to convince all members of the jury that he or she deserves 
to have his or her parole ineligibility period reduced in order to 
obtain such a grant of clemency? A unanimous decision by the 
review jury is a clear statement that the offender deserves 
clemency.
<P>
	I have already noted that there is a difference between the hon. 
member's motions with respect to this bill in terms of the number 
at which they would place the standard. One set of motions would 
establish the standard at 9 while the other set of motions would 
establish the standard at 10. The current standard is at 8.
<P>
	More than anything else it seems to me that this difference points 
to the complete arbitrariness involved in establishing a standard 
short of unanimity. Should it be the current regulations which is 8 
votes, or should it be set at 9, 10 or even 11? What possible 
rationale is there for establishing any of these standards?
<P>
	In the face of this conundrum the government has proposed in 
Bill C-45 that we utilize the only sensible standard, the time 
honoured standard of our criminal justice system: the standard that 
requires that the verdict of the jury be unanimous.
<P>
	For all of these reasons the government cannot accept these 
changes to Bill C-45. Therefore, I would ask that hon. members 
defeat these motions.
<P>
	During my comments made with respect to these motions which 
are restricted to reducing the proposed standard for the jury at 
unanimity in reaching a decision to 9 or even 10 votes, I have 
restricted my comments very specifically to those issues. I will be 
speaking again in general terms with respect to Bill C-45 and 
particularly section 745 of the Criminal Code at third reading.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	In wrapping up, we cannot accept these changes as proposed in 
these motions. I ask hon. members to defeat these motions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me pleasure to rise today to speak to this bill and its amendments. I 
hope I can reflect something that has never been reflected in this 
House by the opposition party or by the party in power, that is, the 
concerns, the worries and the cares of the victims of crime.
<P>
	We do a lot of concentrating. We hear a lot of messages about 
rehabilitation, all the good things we need to do for the criminals of 
our land, but we do not hear much about the victims. I hope to 
speak on their behalf first of all by opposing the amendments to 
this bill and later by opposing the bill in total.
<P>
	I could never support any amendment to Bill C-45 unless it was 
the total and unequivocal repeal of section 745 of the Criminal 
Code. Over the years we have asked ourselves what is a fair or just 
penalty for the murder of an innocent person. In my opinion, the 
answer of a mere 15 years is not a just penalty. The problem is there 
are a select few out there who do not agree and they have proposed 
legislation in the form of section 745 and Bill C-45.
<P>
	I find it appalling to hear a comment that if a person has taken 
the life of another on purpose, in cold blood and planned it and is 
put behind bars for life, that it is a wasted life. May I remind 
members of the House that the wasted life is the victim of that 
individual and the victim's family and friends. They are the 
victims. That is what we need to be addressing here.
<P>
	Until now the Canadian people trusted those they elected to 
make proper decisions in their best interests when it came to the 
justice system. Unfortunately, Canadians have started to realize 
that their trust has been misplaced and that some of the decisions 
are not made in their best interests.
<P>
	All we have to do is look to the many relatives and friends of 
murdered Canadians who say they thought that when an offender 
was sentenced to life that meant life with no chance of parole for 25 
years. That is what they thought.
<P>
	I cannot imagine the tremendous pain a family must endure 
when they learn that the criminal who took their beloved family 
member is now eligible to be released from prison after a mere 15 
years.
<P>
	We now know that in the next 15 years, over 600 families will 
encounter this same pain. Under Bill C-45 this pain will continue. 
Bill C-45 ultimately still provides a glimmer of hope for murderers 
for early release before serving their full life sentence of no parole 
for 25 years.
<P>
	Which murderer ever provided his victim with a glimmer of 
hope? Why on earth do we extend that same hope to them? There is 
no hope for the victims, none at all. They have lost someone and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4244"> 4244 </A></B>
<P>
that someone will not be back. Where is their glimmer of hope? 
Their glimmer of hope lies in the fact that the people of this place 
will wake up and realize the value of life and make those who  take 
a life pay a price so that they wish they had not done it.
<P>
	There have been many times in history when we as legislators 
thought we had all the answers to the world's problems. It takes the 
Canadian people speaking out to remind us that we have lost our 
way. And they are speaking out.
<P>
	I see petitions tabled here with over two million signatures 
asking us to do something about this justice system. I see the 
Darlene Boyds running across the country and others bringing in 
thousands and thousands of names-probably millions by now-to 
repeal section 745. Can we not get the message? It is not what can 
we do for the criminal, not what can we do for the cold blooded 
killer, but what can we do for the victims of our land. That is the 
question we had better start answering. What can we do to prevent 
this from happening in the future?
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Last spring when many families of murder victims launched this 
campaign to alert the public about section 745, the petitions began 
flowing and they are continuing today.
<P>
	Darlene Boyd's daughter Laurie was abducted, raped and 
murdered in January 1982 by Jim Peters and Bob Brown. These 
men were also found guilty of the abduction, rape and beating 
death of Debbie Stevens of High River, Alberta in December 1981. 
Brown committed suicide in prison but Peters' parole review is 
now set for February 1997.
<P>
	Mrs. Boyd stated back in February of this year that even the 
possibility that her daughter's murderer could be considered for an 
early release after 15 years in jail is a travesty, referring to it as a 40 
per cent killer's discount. Because Mr. Peters killed two women 
she figures that if he were to be released next year he would be 
getting the equivalent of only seven and a half years for each 
murder. She said that nothing short of the repeal of the early parole 
provision would ease her concerns. She said that she is serving a 
life sentence and questioned why can the killers of her daughter not 
serve the same.
<P>
	The problem is that Darlene Boyd's family, like many other 
victims' families, will be traumatized again as they are forced to 
relive the tragedies that caused them so much pain with each 
section 745 review.
<P>
	It is good for the industry. The legal industry will flourish. We 
will have lots and lots of court cases. It is a chance for parole for 
killers. I am sorry, I cannot buy that. It is time to cut that industry 
down. Let us get rid of some of these things. That is a good area in 
which to start.
<P>
	Revictimizing the survivors is cruel. It is unjustified. That is why 
nothing short of repealing this section would be the only humane 
thing to do.
<P>
	I cannot understand why the government does not recognize the 
fact that victims should be the ones at issue. To have a family 
member murdered is one of the most horrendous crimes committed 
in Canada. They will never forget and the hurt will never go away. 
Unfortunately the new legislation shows no regard for the victims 
and does not allow them any way in which to fight back.
<P>
	This weak action by the government gives into the bleeding heart 
Liberal philosophy of protecting convicts instead of victims. The 
watered down amendments to section 745 are not even going to 
come close to satisfying Canadians.
<P>
	The people spoke back in June. A petition calling for section 745 
to be repealed was presented by my hon. colleague from Crowfoot. 
It contained more than 20,000 signatures. The Calgary <I>Sun</I> last 
spring received an astonishing 35,000 coupons signed by readers to 
protest the existence of section 745. Some of the signatures even 
came from guards who work in a central Alberta prison. When the 
front line workers speak out, how can they not listen? If they do not 
listen to the front line workers, why would they listen to the 
victims' families?
<P>
	There are so many examples and they are growing every day. 
Look at the past. Constable Brian King. Remember him? He was a 
40-year old father of three when he was lured into a trap and 
executed with two shots to the head on a river bank in Saskatoon in 
1978 by Greg Fisher and Darryl Crook. They had boasted openly 
that day that they were going to kill a police officer. Already Mrs. 
King and her family have been exposed to and have had to endure 
two judicial reviews for Fisher to hear his application for early 
release.
<P>
	What about Calgary police Staff Sergeant Keith Harrison who 
died in the line of duty back in 1978? One of his murderers, John 
Nichols, applied under section 745 back in 1994. The Calgary 
parole jury decided to let him out after just 17 years of his sentence. 
Mrs. Harrison said that the only thing that made her feel even a 
little better was knowing he was serving 25 years. I can only 
imagine how she feels now knowing that he is roaming around free 
and living in a halfway house in Vancouver.
<P>
	Then there are the present victims. A day does not go by without 
thinking of the Rosenfeldt family and the other 10 families affected 
by Clifford Olson's application for early release this past month. 
Gary Rosenfeldt stated on a number of occasions that section 745 is 
nothing but an insult to victims.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	There are the future victims. I recently received a letter from the 
mother of Tanya Smith. I am sure everybody remembers her, the 
16-year old girl from Abbotsford, B.C. who was snatched off the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4245"> 4245 </A></B>
<P>
street by a man with a baseball bat. Tanya Smith was later found 
bludgeoned to death and dumped in a river. One thing is  for 
certain, the pain for Mrs. Smith will never go away. It is only 
intensified by knowing that Tanya's murderer will have the right of 
a section 745 hearing.
<P>
	I would like to read the letter from Mr. and Mrs. Smith in the 
time I have left, which is one minute, but I will read it as fast as I 
can. I would like people to listen carefully. It is addressed to the 
House of Commons members:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How many more children are going to die at the hands of these monsters before 
you listen to us? Our daughter has been snatched away from us and we will never be 
able to touch her again. Do you know how she died? Do you care? Actions speak 
louder than words.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are left behind now to ask these questions and we had better start getting some 
answers. Our daughter's life was worth more to us than anything in this world and 
now our lives are empty and worthless. Tanya's baby brother asks when Tanya's 
coming home every day. Her sister cannot sleep in the room they shared together.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When we finally are able to start going to the cemetery this animal comes out 
from under his rock and takes our daughter's headstone, leaving it on top of a car in 
the middle of a town. When all of this happens to us we are told that we are not 
technically the actual victims here.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our daughter has been murdered. Her headstone has been desecrated and this 
thing is still walking our streets and you say we are not victims.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We live in fear every day. Tanya's father cannot work because of what has 
happened and I cannot sit still all day, enraged with what has happened. Our family 
are now prisoners of our own home and community because of this. Our torment is 
now someone else's big story. It sickens us and only adds to our hell on earth.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One person has changed our lives and took our precious Tanya's life forever. If 
this does not make us victims then you tell us what does. Our greatest joy taken from 
us and for what?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I will tell you this, if we ever find out that this person was jailed at one time or 
another for violence and then set free, we will hold the government responsible for 
Tanya's death. Maybe others will follow until you finally wake up and get the 
message that the government is making us, the innocent people, prisoners and the 
prisoners the victims, and that is wrong.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I encourage members of the House, let us get rid of section 745 
in total. It is something Canadians do not want, and it is our duty to 
serve Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for recognizing me in this debate on Bill C-45, 
a bill that would substantially amend article 745 of the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
	Many members of the public might ask what is article 745 of the 
Criminal Code. This provision was introduced in 1976 at the time 
when this House abolished capital punishment. At that time, with 
the abolition of capital punishment, the House decided that the 
penalty for murder would be a life sentence, but it also provided 
that those convicted of murder would be eligible for parole at  25 
years for first degree murder and a period not less than 10 years for 
second degree murder.
<P>
	At the same time, the House also provided that these convicted 
murderers, if they had a parole eligibility date of more than 15 
years, could apply for a review of their parole eligibility date at 15 
years by applying to the court in the province where the murder 
was committed and where there would be a judge and jury 
appointed to review the reasons the individual would give for 
reducing the parole eligibility from 25 years.
<P>
	In the law it stated that the judge and jury in considering this 
application would have to have regard to the character of the 
applicant, his conduct while serving his sentence, the nature of the 
offence and other matters as the judge would deem relevant.
<P>
	Therefore, after looking at all this evidence the jury, by a vote of 
two-thirds, which would be eight of twelve, could decide to reduce 
the parole eligibility date from 25 years to 20 years or 17 years or 
something like that.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Once they would have done that, if they made such a decision, 
the individual would then have to go to the parole board. All the 
judge and jury would do is consider a change in the parole 
eligibility date. For the individual, if his parole eligibility was 
reduced from 25 years to 20 years, then when 20 years arrived he 
would have to go to the parole board and prove he was no longer a 
danger to the public and that he was rehabilitated.
<P>
	If he convinced the parole board at that second step that he 
fulfilled those conditions then he would be released, but he would 
not be released if he could not demonstrate those conditions. There 
is no suggestion by any of us who support section 745 of the 
Criminal Code that anyone who is still dangerous to the public or 
who is not rehabilitated be released. We would be completely 
opposed to the release of those individuals.
<P>
	It is a two step process under section 745. First you apply to have 
your parole eligibility date changed to something less than 25 years 
and if that is agreed to by the judge and jury then you must go to the 
parole board and prove that you are no longer a danger to the public 
and are rehabilitated.
<P>
	This provision was not a loophole. It is clearly in the legislation 
of 1976. A suggestion by some members that this is some sort of 
hidden provision in the law, that it was sneaked in, is completely 
false.
<P>
	I had the responsibility of introducing this bill. It was introduced 
in this House. It was spelled out in black and white like all bills and 
it was clear to all those who can read and write that it was in the 
bill. Those who suggest today that it was some kind of hidden 
provision are merely misleading the public.
<P>
	The reason we introduced this new process was that the abolition 
of capital punishment was a free vote  matter. Being a free vote 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4246"> 4246 </A></B>
<P>
matter the whips were not on and there was a lot of negotiation with 
individual members in the House as to what they would accept in 
place of capital punishment. The bargaining went back and forth, 
we had committees of all parties of the House, those who were for 
and against the abolition. I dealt with those who were for the 
abolition and we worked out this very complex solution. It was not 
my preferred version but that is how it ended up in the bargaining 
in the House and that is what was legislated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Let the people of Canada decide.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> I listened to the hon. member and I never 
complained while he was speaking and I wish he would have the 
courtesy to listen to me.
<P>
	This provision has worked well. It has not been used 
irresponsibly, and the record will demonstrate that. Since 1976, 175 
inmates have been eligible to apply under this provision. However, 
up until December 1995 only 74 or 42.3 per cent of those eligible 
have applied. One might ask why have they not all applied. It has 
been suggested that if it is such a great provision why have they not 
all applied? It is obvious that many have not applied because they 
know they do not have any chance in the world of having their 
parole eligibility reduced from 25 years so they do not bother. That 
can be the only explanation. Only 75 or 42.3 per cent have applied.
<P>
	Of those who have applied, 63 reviews have been completed out 
of the 74, and 13 of those were totally refused any reduction in their 
parole eligibility date, and 50 were granted either partial or whole 
reduction. In other words, they were given some sort of reduction, 
down to 15, and others were given the total reduction.
<P>
	There is a suggestion insinuated in the House that once they get 
this reduction in parole they are released. They are not. They still 
have to go to the parole board, which takes another one or two 
years. That has been the record so far and I know of a case where 
the parole eligibility was reduced three years ago and that 
individual still has not had a hearing before the parole board.
<P>
	What has happened with those 50 who had either partial or whole 
reduction in their parole eligibility date? Only 17 were granted full 
parole and 8 were granted day parole. Only 25 out of the 175 
eligible since 1976 have been granted finally by the parole board 
either partial or full parole. The rest have either been turned down 
or have not had their cases heard.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Of those who were granted parole and put on the street, two were 
returned to prison for breaking their parole conditions and only one 
committed another offence, and it was not murder.
<P>
	That is the record. This provision has not been a failure, has not 
led to massive threats to the public, has not led to repeated 
murders. On the whole it has worked well.
<P>
	Bill C-45, now before the House, suggests the decision of the 
jury in these cases should be a unanimous decision rather than a 
decision of 8 out of 12. One must ask why when the provision has 
worked so well.
<P>
	In any case, there are two amendments before the House, one by 
the hon. member for Bellechasse who suggests that it should be 9 
out of 12 and another amendment by the member for Kingston and 
the Island who suggests that it should be 10 out of 12. I will support 
either one of those amendments, although my preference is to 
abolish section 745 altogether and have parole eligibility at 15 
years for first degree murder and parole eligibility for second 
degree murder at 10 years. Before 1976 parole eligibility was at 10 
years and there was no great abuse of the system.
<P>
	In the minute or two I have left I want to reply to some of the 
arguments raised by the Reform Party. It suggests that when we 
support section 745 we are equating the life of a murdered person 
with 15 years. I heard several members say we are suggesting that 
the murdered person's life was worth only 15 years. That is 
nonsense. Nothing can replace the life of a murdered person, 
whether it is capital punishment or 30 or 100 years in prison. 
Nothing can replace that life. It is to misrepresent our position to 
suggest that by having a parole eligibility date of 10, 15 or 25 years 
that we are equating that number of years with the value of a 
person's life. That is totally false and unfair.
<P>
	It has also been suggested that because we support this provision 
we are inflicting additional pain on the families of the victims. If 
there is any kind of parole or any kind of application for parole, the 
case will be brought up once again before the parole board or the 
courts. I do not think it is correct. I have sat in on some of these 
hearings. Some families of victims are upset by parole hearings and 
some are not. To suggest that it is universal is incorrect.
<P>
	I would say to the hon. members in the Reform Party that their 
conduct in bringing up these cases over and over again, even when 
many people are not aware that these cases are before the courts, in 
the House, on television and radio, is doing much more to bring 
back to life the horrible events of the murder than the application 
before the parole board or the court and jury in the area concerned.
<P>
	The suggestion by the Reform Party that getting tough and 
having no parole and that life means life will protect the victims 
and reduce the numbers of murders is again totally false. That has 
been done in many of the states in the U.S. They have brought back 
capital punishment. There are high rates of capital punishment and 
their murder rates are way beyond those in Canada. In other  words, 
the tough actions being suggested do not protect the public, do not 
reduce crime and it would not help the victims. The murder rate in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4247"> 4247 </A></B>
<P>
Canada has declined for four consecutive years now with the laws 
we have. It is approximately 2.2 per 100,000 population. The 
murder rate in Florida and in the southern adjoining states where 
capital punishment was brought back is about 10 per 100,000, 
much higher. They are doing exactly what the Reform Party has 
suggested.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to commend the hon. member 
for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce on his speech. It is refreshing to hear 
such comments in the House.
<P>
	I would like to say that I wanted to speak in this debate not as an 
expert or a lawyer-God forbid, I do not have those 
qualifications-but as one who would put this debate into the 
perspective of a better society. I think that is the objective we have 
in mind. That is what I heard in what was said by the hon. member 
for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and by those of my colleagues who 
spoke before me, with the exception, of course, of our Reform 
Party colleagues who see a return to the death sentence, and 
nothing else, as the only solution in this context.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to Bill C-45 now before the 
House for the fundamental reasons that were explained previously. 
What we object to in the government's handling of this bill is this 
eagerness to respond to a section of the population that asks for a 
stricter rule for conditional release measures, and meanwhile there 
is no opportunity for genuine debate in which all points of view can 
be heard and no opportunity to make a decision which, as I said at 
the beginning of my speech, would have the effect of improving the 
society in which we live.
<P>
	This afternoon I heard the hon. member for Wild Rose expose 
the views of the victims. With all due respect for our Reform Party 
colleague, who is entitled to his opinion-and he certainly 
presented a point of view shared by other people and especially by 
the families of murder victims-nevertheless it does not represent 
the general view or the consensus that exists among the public and 
especially in Quebec.
<P>
	I would like to take the next few minutes to give you the victims' 
point of view. These are also parents who lost their child in horrific 
circumstances. On June 30 this year in Sherbrooke, a young girl, 
Isabelle Bolduc, was kidnapped. Subsequently, it was found that 
three individuals were involved. For several days she suffered 
indescribable agony. There is evidence that she was raped, and then 
finally killed in circumstances I would rather not mention.
<P>
	Again, she suffered indescribable agony. Nobody will deny it, 
certainly not her parents, nor her friends. In a similar situation, if 
my daughter or my son were to meet such a fate, I would be 
inclined to wish a similar fate on the perpetrators of such a crime. 
On occasion, I have imagined I could take justice into my own 
hands, dealing with these individuals the way they had dealt with a 
member of my family.
<P>
	But if you give it some thought, do you really want to go back to 
the wild West, as some would have us do? Are we going to solve 
this problem once and for all? Are we going to make our society 
better? Of course not. We are not going to get rid of violence 
through violence.
<P>
	To go back to the example we had in our area this summer, the 
victim's father, Marcel Bolduc, whom I know personally, and who 
has been and still is devastated by his daughter's death, set up a 
foundation, the Isabelle Bolduc foundation, together with friends 
of the family, shortly after these events; this foundation is at work 
in the Eastern Townships and throughout Quebec, circulating a 
petition to tighten the parole system.
<P>
	Mr. Bolduc, in spite of pressure from some people around him 
and in his area, has refused to consider the death penalty as a 
solution to such crimes.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The goal of the Isabelle Bolduc foundation is to improve the 
system. It wants to make a suggestion to parliamentarians, not for 
their immediate debate, but for their consideration over the coming 
months. The Isabelle Bolduc foundation would like to launch a 
pilot project in the Eastern Townships whereby individuals would 
participate in the decisions of the parole board. It wants to create a 
watchdog committee comprising ordinary citizens whose function 
would be to review the decisions, the reasoning, the process and the 
follow-up on all decisions made by the parole board.
<P>
	We are certainly not calling for the reinstatement of capital 
punishment. Let me remind you that one of the originators of this 
proposal is the father of Isabelle Bolduc, the victim of a crime in 
our region.
<P>
	This is what we should be thinking about during a debate like 
this one. We must ask ourselves what we can do to improve the 
situation. The Isabelle Bolduc foundation is proposing one means 
of doing that. I know a request has been presented to the justice 
minister to have the pilot project implemented as soon as possible. 
I hope he will agree, because this is the only way to improve the 
situation.
<P>
	What the foundation is asking for is very simple. People know, 
they are convinced that rehabilitation is the best way to go in this 
area, and I agree. Every effort possible must be made so that these 
individuals who have committed odious crimes-let us not mince 
our words-can hopefully go back into society one day and live 
normal lives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4248"> 4248 </A></B>
<P>
	Sure, there are hard cases. When we refer to the example that 
was used to introduce this bill, the Clifford Olson case, that is a 
hard case. It is about monsters that no one wants to see out, on 
the street.
<P>
	Several murders were committed for a variety of reasons, but 
several of these murderers were able to be rehabilitated, with some 
support and supervision. That is what parents of victims wish for. 
That is what is happening now, in our region.
<P>
	I want to point out, I repeat and I insist upon demonstrating that 
there are not only individuals who wish to get their revenge in our 
society. There are ordinary people, no law experts-I have nothing 
against these-who are thinking and want to propose their own 
solutions.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, since you are indicating that my time is up, I will 
conclude simply by expressing the hope that the government will 
take into consideration the suggestions that were made by the 
official opposition to improve its bill, and also the suggestions 
made to it by the Fondation Isabelle Bolduc to improve society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to 
rise in support of Bill C-45, at the same time to ask the House to 
reject the six amendments that have been proposed.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to signal the sensitiveness of 
the government to debate in this House. It is worth recording in 
respect to two private members' measures that came before us 
which touched, somewhat peripherally in one case but nevertheless 
in the spirit, on the bill now before the House. The member for 
York South, if members remember, had his own private member's 
bill in relation to section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	I and government members supported this private members' bill 
as a vehicle for conveying to the government the feeling that in 
striking the balance among conflicting interests, the balance had 
shifted perhaps a little too far away from the protection of the 
community, and that it was time to make a correction.
<P>
	We have all moved a long way, of course, from those antique 
conceptions of the 19th century when the only aim of criminal law 
was to punish the offender. It was not a very effective measure of 
social control and we have moved to other methods that more 
closely study society.
<P>
	In this sense the government has recognized that in spite of the 
statistics showing crime is on the decrease, there has been an 
increase in the intensity of certain types of crime; mass crime, 
serial crimes and that a tightening of community controls is 
warranted here. This explains the elaborate screening devices that 
have been  set up here. It is a response to the sentiment that this 
House expressed.
<P>
	By the same token, the member for Saint-Hubert brought 
forward an excellent private members' bill in the spring which I 
and other government members supported. It was addressed, really, 
to the issue of protection of witnesses or victims in criminal trials.
<P>
	It has been noted that many of the accused took the opportunity 
of further harassing their victims by vicious forms of cross 
examination. I would have thought, as a jurist, that could have been 
corrected by judicial action. A judge, after all, is there to protect 
the community, which includes the victims. Nevertheless, the bill 
meets this problem.
<P>
	I am interested to note the debate in Great Britain in the last 
week on a very similar problem with exaggerated circumstances. 
Here, in this bill, it is certainly a design of the government to 
prevent persons who have been convicted and who are using the 
system under section 745 as an extra form of harassing victims' 
families.
<P>
	There have been such cases noted and it is good that the 
government has tried to close the door on that type of situation. It 
does represent a response to the spirit the member for Saint-Hubert 
brought forward in her excellent private member's bill.
<P>
	In another way also, we have responded to the situation of 
victims of crimes. This is not the 19th century. It is certainly not the 
earlier pre-common law period in the history of our law in which 
vengeance was the motive of the criminal law and the victims had 
the right of exacting sanctions. Not at all. It is a recognition that the 
viewpoint of the victims is a legitimate factor in considering the 
issue of sentencing, that it is a legitimate factor in considering the 
aspect of parole.
<P>
	I am reminded that years before I entered this Chamber as a 
lawyer, as a sometime juris-counsel, I was approached by the 
family of one of the victims of a mass murderer in the Vancouver 
area, the Rosenfeldt family, the husband, the wife and their lawyer. 
They raised the agonizing tribulations they had been through while 
their child's fate was unknown. They have devoted a life since to 
attention to criminal law and attention to protecting society and at 
the same time ensuring that victims' views are properly presented 
in a way compatible with our legal traditions and our legal spirit.
<P>
	I notice here that in a very proper and balanced way, the attitudes 
of victims' families can be presented in the government's bill.
<P>
	There is a response by the government to a feeling as expressed 
in this House on both sides, that the shifting balance in criminal 
law needs correcting in terms of a stronger protection of society 
based on the increase in intensity of crimes, if not in the actual 
percentage of crimes. I think this is recognized in the structured 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4249"> 4249 </A></B>
<P>
system that introduces the judge, the jury determination and the  
insistence, which is the history of the common law, of unanimous 
jury decisions before a parole board can operate. This is a good 
response again to the sentiment expressed in this House.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	As for the point I have made again that the parole application 
should not be used by a vicious criminal without repentance as a 
method of further harassing victims' families, this is contained and 
overcome by the structured system of preventing purely frivolous 
applications for parole. Finally allowing the victims in a way that is 
sensitive to the duties of all us to society to express their opinions 
on criminality on the particular case before the court, I think this is 
reflected in the bill.
<P>
	For these reasons I suggest with respect to those members who 
have taken the care to offer these amendments that the amendments 
be rejected and the bill as presented be adopted.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when I spoke earlier on Bill C-45, which would make changes to 
section 745 of the Criminal Code, a provision which allows 
murderers to apply for early parole, I gave seven reasons why I did 
not believe this bill should be passed by the House.
<P>
	To my utter amazement those very cogent and well argued 
reasons were ignored by the House and by the government, and this 
bill is back before us today. There are a few amendments proposed, 
most of which would water down the bill even more. Because I 
believe this bill is a bad bill and not in the interest of Canada, I do 
not think it should be passed at all, amended or not.
<P>
	I would like to place even more reasons, more thought and more 
argument before this House to try to persuade my colleagues to 
vote against this terrible piece of legislation.
<P>
	I remind the House of the forgotten lives which we really should 
be considering as we talk about what should happen to convicted 
killers. A lot of these families and loved ones of murdered 
Canadians are asking who really got life. Of course the answer is 
the victims but not just the victims. For the families, friends and 
those who cared about them who were left behind their privacy and 
emotional well-being is being discarded by the consideration and 
the tender concern for giving hope and giving every consideration 
to cold-blooded premeditated murderers. We have to ask why these 
shattered family lives are not higher on the priority list of people in 
elected positions who consider and call themselves compassionate.
<P>
	The wife of a murdered policeman said: ``He took away our 
future when he shot my husband. My daughter has been without a 
father. The last review was quite hard. We had to relive his death. It 
was like losing my husband all over again. The pain is unbearable. I 
have been  worrying about this since he became eligible to apply 
again''.
<P>
	The system allows brutal killers to continually cause havoc in 
the lives of the families left behind and extra pain and suffering 
beyond the murder of a loved one. We need to put a stop to that.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	This bill violates the truth and justice, which we should demand 
and expect of our justice system. The people who loved and cared 
for murdered Canadians really believed the sentence that was 
handed down, life in prison with no possibility of parole for at least 
25 years.
<P>
	Then they come to find out that in fact it is not life in prison, it is 
only 25 years maximum, and rather than there being no eligibility 
for parole before 25 years, murderers are eligible after only 15 
years. They feel betrayed by that and they have a right to expect 
transparency in what is said by the courts and in the sentences and 
penalties that are handed down.
<P>
	The justice minister has been saying for months that section 745 
was under review, leaving many people who had been asking for 
greater justice to believe that something substantial was going to be 
done to respond to their demands that murderers not be let out of 
prison early. The net effect of this bill is to continue to allow 
convicted killers to walk our streets after only 15 years if their 
application for early parole is successful. Only multiple murderers 
will actually serve 25 years. That is just a few years for each of the 
people who were brutally killed by that person.
<P>
	Of the 70 killers who have applied for early parole so far-and 
remember that the section has only been in effect since the 
seventies-75 per cent of the applicants won early parole. These 
killers also have the right to apply more than once.
<P>
	We have to ask if we treat murder lightly, why should not 
criminals? If only a few years is the result of taking somebody's 
life, in the view of most Canadians that is not a sufficient deterrent.
<P>
	The emphasis should not be on the accused, the convicted person 
or the criminal. The emphasis should be on the protection of 
society, law-abiding citizens, our families and our communities. 
Section 745 is costly for law-abiding citizens. The estimates range 
anywhere from half a million to a million dollars for a single 
review.
<P>
	Now, of course, there will be more layers of appeal laid on top of 
the ones already available because a superior court judge must now 
hear everything and decide whether the applicant has a chance for 
success. Then, if the criminal does not like the decision of the 
superior court judge, that can be appealed and appealed again. It is 
all at taxpayers' expense. All of this is at the expense of hard 
working, decent Canadians who are looking for justice and safety 
for their families.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4250"> 4250 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill provides hope for those least deserving. It has no 
business being placed before Canadians who are asking for the 
opposite.
<P>
	Using taxpayer funded legal aid resources in a bid to have debts 
to society reduced is simply not acceptable. No amount of time 
served is enough to replace or to pay for a precious, innocent life 
ended in pain and often in utter terror.
<P>
	The public is demanding greater assurances for public safety. In 
my home city of Calgary, in just a few days the Calgary <I>Sun</I> 
collected over 35,000 coupons urging the justice minister and the 
Liberal government to repeal section 745 of the Criminal Code. 
Those appeals, like thousands and thousands of others from across 
the country, have fallen on deaf ears.
<P>
	Here we see the Liberal contempt for victims. The Liberals have 
always said they have great compassion for people who have been 
victimized. There is a bill which will come before the House in the 
near future to prevent sexual assault victims from having to 
disclose their private writings and diaries in sexual assault cases in 
order to spare them the embarrassment, pain and further trauma of 
having to be further invaded.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	However, under this bill there seems to be no compassion at all 
for the families and the loved ones of murdered Canadians. Over 
and over there will be these hearings, reviews and applications for 
early parole. One of the Liberal senators has actually written a 
newsletter to convicted killers telling them how they can best be 
successful in getting out of jail early and having the penalty they 
might have to pay for brutalizing other Canadians reduced. That is 
absolutely repugnant and reprehensible but that seems to be the 
attitude.
<P>
	One of the members opposite said nothing can replace a life. Is 
he implying somehow that there should be no penalty at all? Is 25 
years too much? Is 15 years maybe too much? Maybe it should be 
five years or maybe one. Maybe we should say ``gee, you should 
not have done that. That was not very nice. Do better next time''.
<P>
	What actually is the government's attitude to protect the people 
of this country and the innocent, brutalized victims? There have 
been young women who have been sexually assaulted and actually 
burned alive and their killers are out applying for early parole after 
only 15 years. This is a disgrace. For the government to stand up 
and say it supports that and it is going to allow that to continue is 
absolutely reprehensible.
<P>
	I think Canadians have a very clear choice. It is between a 
Liberal government, which believes that all the compassion, breaks 
and considerations should be given to brutal killers in our society, 
and the Reform Party, which states that we have to send a very 
strong message from our society that if someone violates the rights, 
freedoms, safety and lives of innocent, law-abiding  citizens they 
will be punished. They will pay a price for that. They had better be 
deterred from that because society is going to take that very 
seriously.
<P>
	For the families of murderer victims there is no hope. Section 
745 gives hope to criminals, to cold blooded, brutal murderers. 
However, for their victims and the families of victims there is no 
hope for peace, for a sense of closure and no hope for justice under 
the Liberal government.
<P>
	I urge the Canadian people to think about their choices in this 
matter when they vote in the next election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to support Bill C-45 and oppose the suggested 
amendments.
<P>
	I congratulate the justice minister for the courage of bringing in 
Bill C-45 which, rather than rejecting outright section 745 of the 
Criminal Code, provides at least some alternative to absolute 
rejection of section 745.
<P>
	Section 745 is a very bad bit of legislation. There has been a lot 
of talk in the House that it lets criminals sentenced to 25 years out 
on early parole when the victims of crime suffer the the chance of 
additional offences by these people if they do get out early.
<P>
	What is missing in the debate is the suggestion of accountability. 
Section 745, as we heard from the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, has not led to an increase in crime. I reject 
the Reform Party suggestion that it has somehow caused fear in the 
victims of crime that these people will get out and again commit 
offences against them.
<P>
	The real problem with section 745, if the members of the Reform 
Party will listen for a moment, is that it lacks accountability. It was 
created in an age in which governments in every way rejected basic 
accountability. In 1976, 20 years ago, governments ran up deficits. 
It was a time of unlimited welfare. It was a time when kids went to 
school and instead of demanding they produce good marks, they 
got a pat on the shoulder and were told: ``It is not so bad. You still 
have other potential''.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Section 745 is bad because it does not demand the accountability 
that society demands today for the actions of everyone. When they 
talk about victims of crime, they are complaining about those who 
have been harmed. When after 15 years they have an easy option 
for early parole, then they are not being held accountable for their 
crimes. That is the problem.
<P>
	Added to that is the way that section 745 operates by permitting 
early parole. It allows a community jury to review the record of a 
criminal who has been sentenced to jail for 25 years without parole. 
Unfortunately, this jury of ordinary citizens is allowed to come to a 
decision by consensus rather than by unanimity. A jury of  ordinary 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4251"> 4251 </A></B>
<P>
citizens is asked to make subjective judgments rather than to 
decide the issue on a matter of fact.
<P>
	Consider that when an accused is convicted of a crime, that 
accused is convicted by the unanimous decision of a jury based on 
fact. The fault with section 745 is that it requires consensus and 
asks a jury of laymen to be subjective in their assessment of 
criminals.
<P>
	I can say that someone who has committed a heinous crime is 
very often capable of deceiving the most clever individual because 
he or she can dissemble. A person from the community who is not 
used to the way some criminals can disguise their real feelings is 
liable to be lured into a sense of compassion which would lead to a 
decision which may not be in the public interest.
<P>
	If 25 people have been granted early parole in the lifetime of 
section 745, it is too many.
<P>
	Why should the justice minister not do what the Reform Party is 
suggesting and reject section 745 altogether? I can tell the House 
why. It is because there must always be hope. We humans live 
together and we have a strong tradition in the Judaeo Christian 
culture where we believe that there is at least some possibility of 
redemption.
<P>
	If in any law that we create we believe absolutely in the dark side 
of human beings, if we do not believe that there is some 
opportunity, however rare, that a miracle may happen and that one 
or two may be saved, then we are much less for it. I believe that the 
justice minister has allowed for that miracle.
<P>
	Rather than rejecting section 745 entirely, he has brought in 
certain provisions that make it very difficult for a person who has 
been sentenced to 25 years without parole to gain an early parole.
<P>
	Let me cite the ways in which that has been done. First, he has 
eliminated absolutely serial killers and multiple murderers. They 
are eliminated. They have no chance whatsoever.
<P>
	Second, he has initiated a screening process where a judge will 
intervene first and consider the character of the person applying for 
early parole. This is an excellent provision. Previously the case was 
brought to the community jury automatically when the application 
was passed. A very serious problem was that the victims of crime 
were required on occasion to go before the jury to argue against a 
person being let out on early parole. I suggest that this caused 
needless suffering to the victims of crime.
<P>
	However, when a judge first considers whether the application 
has any merit before it reaches the community jury, I think that 
would be the kind of check to make Bill C-45 work.
<P>
	Finally, the best part of the bill is the fact that it requires a 
unanimous decision of a community jury to finally allow the 
applicant for early parole to have the  application heard by the 
National Parole Board. That is as it should be.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	If it takes 12 honest men and women to convict and sentence a 
killer to 25 years without parole, it takes a unanimous decision. 
Why should it not be the same way with a jury of 12 to decide 
whether or not 25 years should be lessened or changed in any way?
<P>
	This is an excellent bill in every way. It addresses the 
fundamental flaw in section 745 which makes it too easy for people 
to seek early parole. At the same time it provides exceptional 
circumstances where all of us as human beings would want to see a 
miracle occur. Perhaps some person who has committed a major 
crime is worth saving. The system should somehow recognize this 
and do something about it.
<P>
	This is an excellent bill and I congratulate the minister for his 
courage in introducing it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak on this bill to amend section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	At times I have been kind of hard on the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, but I want to congratulate him for giving 
us, earlier today, the background of section 745 of the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
	I also listened to the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra, for 
whom I have only had praise so far, but I must say that I was a bit 
disappointed to hear him continue to defend the indefensible, to 
support the untenable, to attempt the impossible, and let me explain 
what I mean, with all due respect for my colleague from Vancouver 
Quadra, whom I remember as a law professor at the school I 
attended.
<P>
	Section 745 does not come out of nowhere and I want the 
members of the Reform Party who are bringing back the threat of 
capital punishment, because that is what we are in fact talking 
about here, in a roundabout way. I want them to be able to sleep as 
if nothing happened. However, history has taught us that the people 
who claim to speak on behalf of the majority, even those who talk 
until they get flushed with emotion, as we saw earlier, do not 
always have a monopoly of truth.
<P>
	We do not have to look at foreign governments. Just look at what 
the Canadian government has done. My friend and colleague, the 
hon. member for Vancouver Quadra, must surely remember the act 
that was passed during the last world war to intern Japanese 
Canadians. Not one of the members sitting in this House at the 
time-and I know the Reform Party did not exist back then, but 
there were other similar parties-not one of them said: ``Wait a 
minute. We are making a horrible mistake here and passing very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4252"> 4252 </A></B>
<P>
harmful legislation that  may have some totally unforeseen impact 
on the lives of our fellow citizens''.
<P>
	Nobody asked this question. Some 35 years later, we have had to 
correct the situation, if money can be used for such a purpose, by 
passing redress legislation to make up for the mistake made by the 
members of Parliament 35 years earlier.
<P>
	I think we may be making a similar mistake by hardening our 
views on section 745. When capital punishment was abolished, 
section 745 was seen as-mind what I say-a kind of release for 
people who had committed odious crimes and were under sentence 
of death. That person's safety inside could be ensured for a certain 
period of time. That person would generally accept his or her fate 
and be convinced that it would not be for long.
<P>
	Since capital punishment was abolished and replaced by a 
25-year term imprisonment or more, people who had been 
sentenced to death and were locked up for 25 years would lose all 
hope.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	They would say to themselves: ``This is unbelievable. I cannot 
take it. I expected to die, not to spend 25 years behind bars. This is 
unacceptable''. Basically, what the law makers wanted to do was to 
reassure them by giving them some hope and telling them that 25 
years is a very long time but it is possible to survive it.
<P>
	We must give them some hope to control them and be able to 
keep them in prison without constantly having to face catastrophes, 
riots, rebellions, all kinds of crises inside our prisons.
<P>
	That was the purpose of section 745 of the Criminal Code. There 
was a 25-year parole ineligibility period which, under section 745, 
could be now reduced. That was clearly explained to us by the 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.
<P>
	The present government-and this is one criticism I have to 
express to my learned colleague from Vancouver Quadra-is 
``reforming'' itself. In western Canada, it is important not to lose 
too many votes to the Reform Party, so the government has to have 
a ``western'' platform in the west and a more social platform in the 
east. How can it be done? The government comes up with solutions 
that are totally preposterous, things that we know will never 
happen.
<P>
	The danger in that is that we can have two different kinds of 
justice in one country. I will elaborate on that because my 
colleague from Vancouver Quadra does not seem to understand 
what I am saying. Let us take the 12-person jury for example, 
where in Quebec, since people are generally a bit different, as we 
have heard and seen many times, it would not be impossible to find 
a jury that would be 9 to 3 in favour of a reduction of the 
ineligibility period whereas in western Canada,  particularly in 
areas where the Reform Party is very strong, we might find a jury 
that would be unanimously against such a reduction.
<P>
	Even with similar or identical crimes, we would see that the 
tendency would not be the same in one part of Canada as in another. 
My friend from Vancouver Quadra is smiling, but he knows that I 
am right, and so do you, Mr. Speaker, and I suppose this is why you 
are not interrupting me.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will take this opportunity 
to stretch a little and simply say: ``Never take anything for 
granted.''
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> However, I detect here a bit of hypocrisy. If you 
mean to tell criminals that there is no hope, that there will be no 
hope, and never will be any, go ahead and say it and simply strike 
down section 745. If what you want to do is say there is hope, it is 
that you want to flirt a little with Quebecers, but you are setting 
such conditions that nobody will meet them.
<P>
	One has to present a written application to convince a judge. 
Oral or verbal presentations are not allowed and one cannot appear 
before a judge. A written application is needed to ask a judge to 
convene a jury. The judge can deny the request, it is his right. If he 
agrees to it and convenes a jury, the jury has to be convinced that 
you are right and that requires unanimity.
<P>
	If you manage to succeed, the jury allows you to go before the 
Parole Board, step number three. And then you have to convince 
these people too.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	If we start the process after 15 years as it is stated in section 745, 
with the speed of the whole process, I fear the 25 years of the 
sentence will be over before the guy is even heard by the Parole 
Board.
<P>
	We did a good job. The Quebec government cannot be accused 
of a lack of compassion for people in a bind or for those who made 
a mistake. There will be no grounds for accusing the government of 
facilitating the release of criminals, dangerous persons, monsters 
or whatever else they many be called, because this is how they 
describe them in the West. We are talking about the same people, 
but we simply do not identify them or define them the same way in 
eastern Canada and western Canada. This is one criticism I have of 
the government.
<P>
	There is another point I must mention and that is the ineligibility 
of anyone guilty of multiple crimes, that is two or more, would not 
be covered by the new provision of this section, which I find 
unacceptable. Let us take the case raised by my friend the member 
for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, who spoke about Isabelle 
Bolduc but refused to explain in details what really happened, and I 
will follow his example, because it was simply horrible. According 
to this new provision, the criminal involved would be eligible for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4253"> 4253 </A></B>
<P>
the process and  might even be released a few months or a few 
years earlier than the initial sentence provided.
<P>
	On the other hand, some others commit multiple crimes 
accidentally as we saw in the case of Florent Cantin, who started a 
fire in a bar during the Christmas period. It was a bad joke that 
went wrong and killed 37 people. This young man was not a 
criminal. He wanted to play an innocent joke as many do without 
consequence. This one had tragic consequences, as it killed 37 or 
38 people. If you are not too busy, Mr. Speaker, you can tell the 
hon. member about actus reus and mens rea. The hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra knows what I am talking about. Both are 
required for a crime to be committed. In Florent Cantin's case, I am 
not sure if mens rea was present, if there was criminal intent. The 
act was certainly there. These are elements that must be considered 
in this bill, but the criminal aspect has been swept under the carpet.
<P>
	I therefore ask the government and my colleague from 
Vancouver Quadra to exert some influence on the Minister of 
Justice-who is an authority on legal matters-to get him to be a 
little more flexible, to admit that making it tougher for inmates 
may lead to more intolerance and crime in Canadian prisons, and I 
am not sure we will win.
<P>
	I think the Reform Party is on the wrong track as it starts playing 
with life and death issues. Grandstanding is all very well; it is 
terrible indeed to lose a loved one to a violent or heinous crime, but 
basically, if life has a price-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am sorry. I realize that, 
during our time back home, in our ridings, we have had plenty to 
say, but many members want to take part in the debate and I am 
trying to be as fair as possible to everyone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Unanimous consent can still be requested, can it not?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Chambly is asking for an extension of one minute or so to complete 
his remarks. Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just wanted to say that, in 
a society, one has to have a minimum of compassion for others, try 
to understand their point of view and take to have real debate in this 
House. I was going to make the suggestion to the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra and the Minister of Justice.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased once again to have the opportunity to 
represent the voice of the Canadian people in this debate on Bill 
C-45.
<P>
	I am amazed listening to the separatist Bloc members and the 
Liberals across the way. I am amazed at how far removed their 
thinking is from the average Canadian on the street.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I sit here in utter astonishment as speaker after speaker stands up 
and basically says that the Canadian people out there do not count. 
They think this is good and they are going to do it their way. So 
much for democracy. So much for what the Canadian people think 
about this.
<P>
	As a Reformer I will speak on behalf of the Canadian people. 
Although my words may fall on some pretty deaf ears in the House, 
at least the Canadian people deserve a chance to be heard and the 
Reform Party and I will speak on their behalf.
<P>
	We are talking about Bill C-45. The majority of my constituents 
and millions of Canadians believe that section of the Criminal 
Code should be abolished because it serves no purpose. It is no 
deterrent for people who go out and ruthlessly take a life.
<P>
	Bill C-45, the minister's pride and joy, introduces a few cosmetic 
changes at best.
<P>
	Victims of Violence, CAVEAT, the Canadian Police Association 
and millions of Canadians want the section repealed. However, the 
Minister of Justice, just like the separatist Bloc members, have 
ignored their pleas and are pushing Bill C-45 through the House. It 
is a shame that a Liberal minister of justice cannot hear or chooses 
to ignore the cries of the Canadian people.
<P>
	The bill makes a few amendments to section 745. First, the right 
of multiple murderers to apply for a judicial review for early parole 
will be removed. However, instead of making this provision 
retroactive so that it would apply to serial killers such as Clifford 
Olson and Paul Bernardo who are already incarcerated, it will 
apply only to those convicted of multiple murders after this bill 
comes into effect. If a person killed a bunch of people before the 
bill comes into effect they still have a chance. They can still apply. 
They are exempt from the bill.
<P>
	Does the minister believe serial killers who are already 
incarcerated should have a better chance than those who will 
commit multiple murders in the future? Is that his logic? 
Considering what we have heard in the House today, as he sends 
speaker after speaker to support the bill, I suppose that is the 
philosophy of the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	The minister has done nothing to prevent serial killers who are 
already in jail from getting their day in court and a chance at a 
reduced parole ineligibility period. He has done nothing. The bill is 
a sham.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4254"> 4254 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, the bill would ensure that the murderer will have to 
convince a superior court judge that their application has a 
reasonable chance of success before  they would be allowed to 
proceed before a jury. This sounds like a good measure. However, 
considering that applicants have had a 72 per cent success rate 
since May 1994 in having their parole ineligibility reduced, it is 
unlikely that a judge will find fault with a majority of the 
applications and dismiss them. In short, the new hurdle the 
Minister of Justice so proudly stands up to defend, which the Bloc 
so quickly supported, is really no hurdle at all. We will continue to 
see far too many section 745 hearings.
<P>
	Last, Bill C-45 stipulates that a section 745 jury will have to 
reach a unanimous decision before the applicant's parole 
ineligibility is reduced. At present only two-thirds of the jury need 
to find in the applicant's favour.
<P>
	The bottom line in all of this stuff is that section 745 should not 
exist at all. This is nonsense. This bill is nonsense. It does not 
reflect the wishes and the cries of the Canadian people in any way, 
shape or form. It is typical Liberal touch it up and they will not 
notice.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	This bill was introduced as part of Bill C-84 in 1976 by the 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce who was serving as the solicitor 
general for a Liberal government at the time. Bill C-84 abolished 
capital punishment and established two categories of murder, first 
and second degree. However, not too many people-and this is 
Liberal trickery-noticed the inclusion of section 745 review in the 
original bill,
<P>
	As a result, Canadians have had to wrestle and deal with this 
provision for 20 years. Many Canadians believe that 25 years 
before being eligible for parole is not a suitable sentence for first 
degree murder. The polls have consistently shown, and this 
government will not admit it, that Canadians favour a return of 
capital punishment for those who are convicted of first degree 
murder, consistently. Right now almost 80 per cent of Canadians 
would welcome a binding national referendum on capital 
punishment.
<P>
	These Liberals do not hear that. It is not in their philosophy. 
People are outraged that murderers are given a glimmer of hope 
after serving only 15 years. What glimmer of hope did these killers 
give their victims?
<P>
	Speaking of victims, section 745 does them an incredible 
disservice. The whole judicial review process causes the 
revictimization of families and at times of entire communities. 
Gary Rosenfeldt, whose son was murdered by Clifford Olson, said 
the whole of section 745 is an insult to victims.
<P>
	What do we have coming from this Liberal government? Simply 
window dressing with respect to dealing with section 745. As I said 
before, this comes as no surprise. The Liberals are constantly 
promoting the rights and privileges of criminals, constantly 
mollycoddling the very worse people in our society while  victims 
are completely ignored. If the Liberals had any simple basic 
understanding of victims' rights, and they do not, they would have 
abolished section 745. They would not have had to come back to 
this weak-kneed pointless piece of legislation known as Bill C-45.
<P>
	I would also like to take issue with this. This really bugs me. Bill 
C-45, this stupid bill, actually creates categories of good and bad 
murderers. It actually does that in reality. If you kill one person you 
will be entitled to a section 745 hearing. These are good murderers 
according to the Minister of Justice' understanding. If you kill one 
you are okay.
<P>
	However, serial killers are not entitled to section 745 review 
because according to the justice minister's understanding these are 
bad murderers. It is truly unbelievable that the minister has actually 
quantified human life in this piece of legislation. He actually has 
set himself up as a person who can quantify whether one killing is 
better or worse than two killings. It is unbelievable.
<P>
	According to this bill a murderer should be given a glimmer of 
hope if they kill only one person but any more than that and they 
will not get a review. The minister has set the quota at one life 
should at a future time they want an opportunity to reduce their 
parole ineligibility. It is disgraceful. It is reprehensible that the 
minister would sit down and draft his very own category of 
murderers, some deserving of leniency and some not.
<P>
	I submit that one life is as important as two or three or four. If the 
minister wanted to differentiate between murderers he should have 
introduced consecutive sentencing. That is the way to deal with it. 
This would ensure that serial killers like Clifford Olson would 
never have a chance at parole.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	It is time for the government to stand up for Canadians and their 
desire to have the justice system overhauled. It is time for the 
government to stand up for victims and against criminals. It is time 
for the government to stand up and do the right thing and abolish 
section 745. It should be ashamed that it has introduced such a 
reprehensible bill. It should be ashamed that it has ignored the 
views of millions of Canadians, particularly the views of victims' 
rights groups. I cannot support this bill. My party cannot support 
this bill. We will stand here speaking for Canadians and will 
oppose this stupid bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the issue before the House today ought not to be a partisan issue. 
We are dealing with the question: what should be the appropriate 
penalty for the worst crime in the Criminal Code and that is first 
degree murder?
<P>
	I have sat here all day listening to Liberals attack Reform 
members, Reform members attack Liberals as if  this is a partisan 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4255"> 4255 </A></B>
<P>
issue. It should not be a partisan issue. We should look at this issue 
on the basis of its merits and what is right and just.
<P>
	There are those who have argued that the maximum period of 
incarceration should be 15 years. The author of section 745 spoke 
earlier today. When he was the solicitor general he brought in 
section 745. He believes that at the 15-year period all convicted 
killers should have the opportunity to apply for early release. His 
views are in the extreme minority. Those who suggest that section 
745 can somehow be made better, can somehow be made more 
acceptable, are in the extreme minority if the views of Canadians 
are looked at.
<P>
	The overwhelming majority of Canadians want the return of 
capital punishment. If you extrapolate from that particular poll 
result it is easy to conclude that an even greater number want the 
repeal of section 745.
<P>
	I first became aware of this section of the Criminal Code when I 
was elected to this House and sat on the justice committee. We 
started reviewing the criminal justice system. It became abundantly 
clear to me that section 745 is an example of what is wrong with the 
criminal justice system when you allow those who commit the 
most heinous crime in the Criminal Code the opportunity to be 
released after serving only 15 years. There are of course other 
issues within the criminal justice system, whether it is the issue of 
consecutive sentences or the Young Offenders Act, that cause 
Canadians a great deal of concern.
<P>
	In particular, section 745 reflects a bleeding heart attitude 
toward the criminal justice system that is not in keeping with what 
is fair, just and equitable in a criminal justice system. The Canadian 
criminal justice system is not just. Section 745 allows convicted 
killers to make a mockery out of the justice system.
<P>
	Take the example of Clifford Olson. Everyone agrees that he will 
never be allowed to be free again yet he is using this section to 
revictimize, to repunish the survivors of his victims. This is the 
section that guarantees all convicted killers, and there will be some 
600 of them that will be eligible to apply over the next 15 years, the 
right to apply to have their parole ineligibility reduced.
<P>
	Over the last number of years I have worked very closely with 
families of victims, parents of victims and in particular mothers of 
victims. I have worked very closely with Darlene Boyd, Sharon 
Rosenfeldt, Debbie Mahaffy, Priscilla de Villiers and many others 
who have lost children, who have lost daughters to murder.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	These mothers of victims make a compelling argument. I only 
ask members of Parliament to listen to the submissions put forward 
by these women and the hundreds of others who are survivors of 
victims as to the reasons why section 745 ought to be repealed, the 
reasons  why section 745 is an unconscionable provision in the 
Criminal Code of Canada.
<P>
	We are not dealing with choir boys. We are not dealing with 
crimes of passion. I have heard arguments put forward such as 
``what about the abused wife who murders an abusive husband?'' 
We are not dealing with those situations here. Those people are not 
convicted of first degree murder or for that matter second degree 
murder.
<P>
	We are dealing with those people who have characters that say it 
is okay within themselves to deliberately take the lives of other 
people, planned and deliberate murder, the worst crime in the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	If we are saying that a period of incarceration of 15 years is an 
appropriate penalty for first degree murder, what does that say 
about our society? What does that say about all the other awful 
crimes in the Criminal Code like rape, the molestation of young 
children, aggravated assault? All the other crimes become less 
significant. They become not as bad as murder. If the going rate for 
murder becomes 15 years, what will the going rate be for raping a 
child or for raping a woman? What will the penalty be? When we 
look at the penalty for first degree murder we should look at it in 
context.
<P>
	We are not talking about rehabilitation. It really irks me when I 
hear members talk about rehabilitating a first degree killer. Tell me 
how. How do we rehabilitate a first degree killer?
<P>
	Most first degree killers will not kill again. That is fact. Some 
will, most will not. It is not a question of the protection of society. 
It is a question of what the appropriate penalty should be for first 
degree murder.
<P>
	How does society reflect its abhorrence of this awful crime? We 
read about them every day. We see them on television. We watch 
the families of the victims grieve. For them it becomes an unending 
funeral. To them the pain and suffering never ends.
<P>
	Section 745 revictimizes them. It retraumatizes them. As one 
mother told me, it brings back all the awful feeling, the feeling of 
complete devastation when you are told by a police officer at your 
doorstep that your child or your husband or your wife has been 
murdered.
<P>
	I ask hon. members not to detach themselves from the emotion 
of what this is all about because it is about emotion. It is about 
morality. It is about what is right and wrong. Look at this through 
the eyes of the parents who have lost children to convicted killers.
<P>
	Is it right, is it just, to drag these families back through the courts 
after 15 years? Is it right and just and equitable for them to continue 
to suffer and to allow, whether it be a faint hope or any other hope, 
for those who have committed these awful crimes?
<P>
	In my respectful submission, a 25-year prison term is 
reasonable. A minimum of 25 years is a reasonable  period of 
incarceration in order to reflect society's abhorrence at this type of 
crime. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4256"> 4256 </A></B>
<P>
is the moral thing to do. It is right to take away someone's freedom 
for having denied someone's right to live and for having destroyed 
not only the life of the victim but the lives of the family and friends 
those people have killed.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	Millions of Canadians support the repeal of section 745: The 
Canadian Police Association, police officers across the country, 
correctional workers across the country, the Canadian Association 
of Chiefs of Police. An overwhelming majority of Canadians want 
section 745 repealed so that the minimum period of incarceration 
becomes 25 years. To whom is the government listening when it 
tinkers with section 745?
<P>
	We have been elected to the House of Commons to represent our 
constituents. We are here to represent the best interest of Canadians 
and what is right and just for the majority of Canadians. To 
continue to support the inclusion of section 745 in the Criminal 
Code, in my view, is a breach of the trust that Canadians put in each 
and every one of us three years ago when they elected us to the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	I have tried as an individual member to have section 745 
repealed. In fact the House voted to repeal section 745 in principle 
in December 1994. What has happened to all those members, 
including over 80 government members, who supported the repeal 
of section 745 who now will be supporting a bill which merely 
tinkers with section 745? They will have to reconcile with their 
constituents their change in vote.
<P>
	In closing, let me urge the Prime Minister, who has committed 
himself to parliamentary reform, to allow a free vote on this matter, 
to allow a free vote on a bill that would repeal section 745. In my 
view that would go a long way to restoring the trust and confidence 
that Canadians ought to have in their elected members.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased but also rather concerned about having to 
speak on this very serious bill on judicial review and parole 
ineligibility.
<P>
	When dealing with these issues, we must be careful not to 
become excessive, as the Reform Party tends to do, but we must 
also avoid giving in to what I would call election-related pressure. 
This is not an issue that must be influenced by election-related 
pressure or constraints. Rather, it calls for a serious and thorough 
review that will allow us to see if the measures that have been part 
of the Criminal Code for quite some time are good. Have these 
measures been effective? Have they provided interesting results? 
Do we need to change them?
<P>
	This is also an issue about which we must be careful not to 
become emotional but, rather, rational. Let us look at the overall 
situation in terms of those affected by this measure.
<P>
	As of December 31, 1995, there were 175 eligible inmates; 76 of 
them had applied for a judicial review of their parole ineligibility. 
In other words, these people wanted to have the opportunity to be 
paroled after the 15th year and before the 25th year of their 
sentence. Of these 76 applications, 13 are pending, while a decision 
has been made in the other 63 cases. A reduction was granted to 39 
inmates. It is important to mention that only one of them 
reoffended. And it was not murder, but armed robbery.
<P>
	One has to realize that this is not all black and white. We need to 
ponder this issue carefully and make a balanced judgement instead 
of resorting to anecdotal evidence. It is really a terrible situation 
when a crime is committed. The impact on the family members and 
relatives of the person who has been killed is horrendous. We often 
tend to look for remedy for the guilt and the grief by demanding a 
severe punishment for the murderer. Maybe not as severe as the 
crime itself, but a sentence long enough to make sure the murderer 
is not back out on the street.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	It has been proven that families who have this ultimately quite 
natural reaction do not experience a lessening of their grief because 
the murderer has been severely punished. It has been proven both 
in Canada and in the United States. The grief for the lost one 
remains, and there is no connection whatsoever with the 
punishment.
<P>
	We have to get to the bottom of this issue and see whether the 
steps taken have given the anticipated results. For example, I am 
told that 39 inmates got a reduction, that 38 have not reoffended 
and that not one of them has been convicted for a new offence. This 
means that the vast majority of the people have been able to come 
back out into society and to make a positive contribution.
<P>
	Therefore, we now have to determine the real purpose of our 
criminal justice system. Among the offenders sentenced to 25 years 
in prison, there are career criminals, but also people who have 
committed a crime, who have made a terrible mistake under some 
kind of impulse, an act that was not necessarily premeditated.
<P>
	We also have to know what direction the system is taking. Is 
there an increase or a decrease of the crime rate in Quebec and in 
Canada right now? The figures show that the crime rate is declining 
everywhere, at least in Quebec.
<P>
	We need to compare what we have with the other systems where 
the measures taken are getting tougher and tougher. We can often 
compare ourselves to the  Americans in this regard. The way the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4257"> 4257 </A></B>
<P>
system works in Canada, how it ultimately affects the crime rate, 
the reintegration of people into the society and the costs of the 
system. I think our approach, that is, the one which was developed 
in the last 15 or 20 years, compares favourably with the one that 
has been developed in the United States. I think we must build upon 
our successes.
<P>
	The real objectives of the government can be called into 
question. When we look at the statistics and see that of the 73 
individuals who asked for a review, 63 obtained one and 39 were 
granted a reduction in their sentence and only one committed an 
offence subsequently, one has every reason to wonder why the 
government introduced such a bill.
<P>
	This bill appears to have been introduced in reaction to pressure 
and ultimately will not solve much. We can see what has been 
proposed for multiple murders. This will create terrible confusion 
and injustice. It is not the fact that a person has taken one or two 
lives that is important, it is the type of crime that has been 
committed. The number of victims seems totally irrelevant to me.
<P>
	The other element concerns the decision committee. Again the 
government appears to be closing the door completely without 
having the political courage to say so. It should take a clear stand in 
favour of abolishing this provision or say that the present system is 
working well and prove it to all Quebecers and Canadians so they 
can judge for themselves.
<P>
	I also think that it is typical of politics nowadays. It is very easy 
to slip into demagogy. It is very easy to say that we have a typical 
example, a horrible situation, the kind of things we occasionally 
see in the newspapers. It is terrible to see and to experience this 
kind of thing; it stirs up lots of emotions. It is a personal situation 
that can be very difficult to go through.
<P>
	We are not here to make a sensation. We are here to pass laws 
that will have a real positive effect and that will, ultimately, make 
our society more equitable and less violent, more evolved and more 
aware of new ways of rehabilitating criminals.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	Even if tomorrow we could arrange for nobody to be eligible to 
have their ineligibility reviewed, we would not have solved the 
problem. There is no link between murders that have been 
committed in the past and those that will be committed in the 
future. People who are in such situations of violence are not 
calculating whether, if caught and sentenced, they will be able to 
apply for a review of their situation after 15 years. This is not how 
it works. This is not what is going through their head. These 
situations are more likely to arise after a number of years in prison, 
when individuals have lived through more, and have had the idea 
that they are capable of  reintegrating into society. There is a whole 
process provided for the assessment of these cases.
<P>
	I feel that the present model needs more thinking and more study 
before we come up with measures such as the one the government 
is proposing or, even worse, such as the one the Reform Party was 
advocating. If we were to adopt very tough legislation or this bill, 
we would have the feeling that we had done our job, but with the 
corrective measures, those that will come in the future, will we, 
five or ten years down the road, be able to say that we truly 
improved the situation?
<P>
	Rather, might we not try to hide things a bit, saying that, in the 
end, all those measures we took did not settle anything or improve 
the situation, that the recividism rate cannot really be lower than 
what it is. We have to make sure that those who must act in these 
decisions may do so rapidly.
<P>
	I will conclude on this. It is important that we make a balanced 
judgment. I encourage the government to do its homework. If there 
are changes to be made in this section, they should be made after 
more careful study with no regard to the temptation put in the way 
by the Reform Party, which wants to create a mockery of justice. I 
do not think it is in the interests of Canadians and Quebecers that 
things be done this way.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
dying days of the last session of Parliament I stood in the House to 
voice my opposition to what the justice minister was doing with 
section 745. I have listened to the justice minister over the summer 
and I have come to the conclusion that the minister just does not get 
it.
<P>
	Instead of talking to my lawyer friends in Calgary and the 
inmates and criminals that the justice minister wants to coddle, I 
talked with some of the people that Bill C-45 would affect: my 
constituents. I sent out surveys to see what my constituents thought 
and I have never received more responses in the three years I have 
been an MP, 1,702 to be exact.
<P>
	Of the people who responded, 85 per cent felt that the people 
who were convicted of first degree premeditated murder should not 
have their sentence reduced at all. Eighty-five per cent. Not only 
that but two-thirds of the people who responded felt that those who 
committed first degree premeditated murder should be subject to 
capital punishment. Based on the questionnaire, I believe that a 
nationwide referendum on the issue is becoming more and more 
mandatory.
<P>
	One question asked was: What do you believe should be the 
penalty for first degree premeditated murder? This does not need 
much explanation. Most people know what premeditated first 
degree murder, the taking of a life, is. The response was that 1,144 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4258"> 4258 </A></B>
<P>
favoured capital punishment, not the lifetime with parole after 25 
years  which is being bandied around in the House by the bleeding 
heart government members.
<P>
	The second question was: Do you think that people convicted of 
first degree murder should have the ability to go before a jury after 
15 years and present a case to have the time they are required to 
serve in jail reduced? In response, 1,469 said no. A high number of 
those responding said no, serve the full time.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	The third question was: Should people serving a sentence for 
first degree murder have their sentence reduced at all? After all, in 
the wisdom of the House back in the seventies the penalty was 
supposed to be life. One thousand, four hundred and fifty-three said 
no, the sentence should not be reduced.
<P>
	The public is scared. Our streets are not safe. Violent crime is on 
the rise. Even the justice minister admitted that in the House. 
Canadians expect and deserve a country where they can feel secure 
in their homes and communities and where they can grow old 
without fear. Canada has been shaken by crime and a defective 
criminal justice system which the Liberal government has been 
slow to fix. When will the minister get this?
<P>
	Why does the government place less value on one life than it 
does on two or 20 lives? Corrections Canada's mission is to 
contribute to the protection of society by exercising lawful control. 
The government will send peacekeepers around the world to 
prevent people from murdering one another, yet it will release 
rehabilitated murderers onto Canadian streets. Why do two people 
have to die before the government will step in to lock these 
criminals up?
<P>
	Where are the government's priorities? Has it forgotten that its 
first responsibility is to law-abiding Canadians and that it must do 
everything to protect their safety? Is it any wonder that people do 
not trust our justice system?
<P>
	It is time to place the rights of victims, the survivors of crime, 
and law-abiding citizens ahead of the rights of criminals. Let us 
remember that a victim's sentence is forever; it is a lifetime 
sentence served in a graveyard. The murderer gets life with a 
reprieve, an opportunity to get out.
<P>
	The justice minister has never offered the Boyd or Rosenfeldt 
families compensation for the horrific murders of their children, 
but the government will give inmates compensation for slipping in 
a stairwell. The government paid Clifford Olson compensation to 
the tune of $100,000 and will even allow him to publish books and 
to make videos while in jail. What a slap in the face to those 
families. Where is the justice in all of this? There is none. This is 
protecting the criminals' rights more than the victims'. It is not a 
strong enough deterrent.
<P>
	Despite the justice minister's claims, the public interest will not 
be served by keeping first degree murderers in prison for any less 
than 25 years, even if they just kill once. The government must 
repeal section 745. The safety and the lives of Canadians depend on 
it.
<P>
	When we were debating the gun control bill, Bill C-68, many 
members on the government side stood and talked about the 
justification of the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars 
which will be sucked out of the system in order for law-abiding 
citizens to register their firearms. The argument was an emotional 
one which came from the heart: If it saves just one life the gun 
registration system is well worth it.
<P>
	If that is the logic the government used to justify the gun control 
bill, why does it not apply the same logic in this instance and repeal 
section 745? If by repealing section 745 a murderer must serve the 
full life sentence with a parole opportunity after 25 years, why not 
do that? Why not try it to see if it would be a stronger deterrent? 
Why not implement that?
<P>
	If the repeal of section 745, despite all the great arguments on 
both sides of the House, saves one life, then why not? If it saves 
one single life then why not repeal section 745? Why is the 
government not consistent? The justice minister speaks about the 
multiple murderer syndrome. The life I am talking about that could 
be saved with the repeal of section 745 is that life the murderer 
would not get a chance to murder.
<P>
	The member for York South-Weston said that most murderers 
do not repeat their crime. Notice that he said ``most''. If after the 
passage of Bill C-45 a murderer who has killed once does it again, 
if it just saves that one life, the repeal of section 745 is worth it.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	I have one other objection to this whole farce and fiasco that this 
justice minister perpetrates on the House of Commons and the way 
he operates his department, this business of sending bills after 
second reading to the House. Even when they come back from the 
House and the standing committee and they are in his hands, for 
example, Bill C-41, the so-called tougher sentencing bill and Bill 
C-68, gun control, it sits in his department and then eight days 
before we leave or break he has to force it and limit debate for 
opposition members, not allowing them to fully discuss the issues 
at hand.
<P>
	That is not the way you do justice in this country. That is an 
injustice to Canadians. That is not the way he should be running his 
department. He did it on Bills C-41 and C-68 and now he will 
probably end up doing it on Bill C-45. He did it as well on Bill 
C-33.
<P>
	There is one other injustice that is being perpetrated by the 
justice minister of this government. The private member's bill, Bill 
C-234 from the hon. member for York South-Weston, was sent to 
committee. That is supposed to come back from the committee and 
be  reported. In the wisdom of the standing committee on justice I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4259"> 4259 </A></B>
<P>
understand it is not going to report it back to the House. It is going 
to ignore it.
<P>
	As members of the House of Commons we sent that bill to that 
standing committee and it is supposed to come back. It is not 
allowing this member of Parliament representing Calgary Centre to 
speak to Calgary Centre constituents about the fate of that 
particular bill, the status that it is at and what this government 
thinks about it. That is an injustice and this justice minister should 
be applying what his title calls for, justice, not injustice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going to 
offer to the House a personal experience today on how section 745 
has affected my life.
<P>
	Fourteen years ago, one block from my home at a convenience 
store a young woman about the age of the young pages we have 
with us in the House was abducted. Her disappearance from that 
convenience store that night put my small community in a state of 
panic. No one knew what had happened to Laurie Boyd. She had 
disappeared.
<P>
	The panic our community felt was something that touched me 
personally. My wife was afraid to leave our home and travel the 
short distance to Calgary. My daughter who was about the same 
age, within a year, was afraid to walk to school.
<P>
	Laurie's body was found by a good friend of mine and it was 
unrecognizable. I was the personal physician of the Boyd family. I 
knew them well. I had treated them, counselled with them and 
looked after them in sickness, and so I anguished personally with 
them over their loss.
<P>
	There were rumours in Okotoks about what had happened, 
rumours that some criminals had an undercover police car and a 
police light they were using to attract and murder individuals. 
There had been two murders in our community.
<P>
	One of my colleagues in High River hospital had a patient that 
tried to commit suicide. Under the effect of the drugs he had tried 
to commit suicide with he confessed to the two murders. He and his 
partner were then apprehended. The story of the murder of Laurie 
Boyd is something I will never forget, the story of how they enticed 
her to go to the back of the convenience store and clapped her in a 
van. They took her out to an abandoned gravel pit, forcibly raped 
her, promised her they would let her go, stabbed her repeatedly 
with a screwdriver and then poured on her dead body gasoline and 
made her unrecognizable.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	I guess I will never forget it because with the family I went over 
that specific issue in my mind, in my eye and in counselling with 
them. When the court proceedings went through the horrible crime, 
these two beasts-and I say that word harshly but that is how I 
felt-received the  most serious penalty anyone could receive in 
Canada. They were guilty of premeditated, first degree murder. I 
and the family felt some small satisfaction in that penalty. Life 
without chance of parole was the sentence from that judge.
<P>
	The Boyds then went on to try to recreate their lives, Trevor the 
son, Darlene and Doug. We stayed in close touch and they did 
rebuild their lives.
<P>
	I then found myself as an MP some years later. I had a call from 
my old friend, Darlene. She said: ``I have to talk to you, Grant''. 
She came to my office and said: ``Tell me this isn't so. Tell me that 
Jim Peters cannot get out in 15 years. Tell me that section 745 is not 
true''. I said to her: ``Darlene, it is true but there is hope. There is a 
member from another party who has a private member's bill on the 
table and it received support in the House of Commons to go to 
committee. There is hope that 745 will be tossed in the dustbin of 
history. It is at the committee stage. I am pretty sure that because of 
the unanimity that exists in the House the bill will be passed and we 
will see 745 gone. The one remaining beast, as the second one 
killed himself in prison, will not get out''.
<P>
	Darlene said: ``Thank you, Grant. Thank you for that 
reassurance. Thank you for that advice''. It was not too long after 
that when she came back and said: ``I hear that private member's 
bill is not going to make it. What should I do?'' ``Well, Darlene, 
campaign for the abolition of 745'', was my advise.
<P>
	Darlene Boyd resurrected the trauma in her life to do just that. 
She personally was responsible for the names in the Calgary <I>Sun</I>, 
the chorus of people crying for the abolition of 745. She has 
travelled at her expense throughout Canada to get 745 abolished.
<P>
	I have to stand in public and say to her: ``Darlene, I am sorry. I 
think the government of this day will not do what must be done. 
Section 745 in my view should be abolished but I do not believe 
that it will be abolished with this government''.
<P>
	What happened to the other members who with me said the bill 
from the member for York South-Weston should go to committee 
and should be considered carefully? What happened to those 
individuals who agreed in principle with abolishing section 745 of 
the Criminal Code? I have listened to some of them speak here and 
they say Bill C-45 is enough and that it will still provide a glimmer 
of hope. I have heard them say it does not bother the victims' 
families to go through this.
<P>
	My message is simple and clear, as I have counselled again with 
the Boyd family on this issue. The individual who tore their lives 
apart, who will have his hearing in February, has torn their lives 
apart again.
<P>
	I know the justice minister has compassion in his heart for Jim 
Peters. Jim Peters, who perpetrated this crime and who was 
sentenced to 25 years without chance of parole, a major sentence in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4260"> 4260 </A></B>
<P>
Canada, is being treated with  leniency. Darlene Boyd and her 
family are not. I believe that is wrong.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after that 
moving testimony by my colleague from Macleod and the 
indictment that one has heard against this piece of legislation by 
the Minister of Justice, one would hope the Liberal backbenchers 
would think again, talk to their minister and ask him to reconsider 
what he intends to impose on Canadians.
<P>
	There is no question in my mind that Canadians from coast to 
coast are absolutely appalled that the Minister of Justice has 
decided to water down section 745 a little rather than eliminating it 
entirely. Therefore I call on my colleagues on the Liberal 
government bench to do the honourable thing when it comes to a 
vote and vote down this legislation and call for the return of the 
private member's bill by the member for York South-Weston. 
That would be the honourable thing to do.
<P>
	Take a look at this piece of legislation and how it affects 
individuals. We have just heard from the member for Macleod how 
it tears individuals, innocent Canadians, who have suffered 
horribly at the hands of criminals, how they have been torn apart 
and their lives shattered and how 15 years later they have to relive 
the horror and the tragedy; how they have to fight the government 
that is disposed to defend their freedom and their principles; how 
they have to fight the government that is supporting the criminal. 
They feel all alone in society and ask who stands up for them.
<P>
	It is we, all of us in this House, who are supposed to stand up for 
them. That is why I think the members on the government side 
should do the honourable thing and defeat this piece of legislation 
and call for the return of the private member's bill by the member 
for York South-Weston which would repeal this section in its 
entirety.
<P>
	Looking at the proposals by the Minister of Justice, he is now 
talking about having a superior court judge assess the situation and 
the application by the criminal to find out if it has a reasonable 
prospect for success. If he feels it does he can refer the matter to a 
jury. That in itself is an insult to the principle of juries in this 
country where we ask juries, peers of people who stand accused, to 
judge.
<P>
	Now we are asking a judge to prejudge what a jury is going to 
hear. That seems to be turning our whole justice system upside 
down because juries are the people in this country who are given 
the right to decide, not superior court judges who will decide what 
juries will hear and what they will not hear.
<P>
	Why are we putting the superior court justice in the middle of 
our judicial system where we depend on juries to pass impartial 
judgment on people who stand accused? Now we are going to put in 
the middle the superior  court justice who is going to decide 
whether or not a jury should hear a case.
<P>
	Of course, his judgment is going to be subject to the potential for 
an appeal and subsequent appeals all the way up to the Supreme 
Court. Our whole judicial system has the potential to be totally 
caught up in the throes of reworking and rehashing something a 
judge decided at the time the sentence was handed out.
<P>
	This crime was so heinous, this person should be locked up for 
25 years without parole. If the judge decides that based on the 
evidence presented to him, surely Canadians expect the right to 
have that judgement rendered and carried through all the way.
<P>
	Section 745 was introduced as the faint last hope clause and has 
become the open door clause for convicted murderers. The 
Minister of Justice should have closed it.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	I think of what life sentences mean in other countries. In the 
United Kingdom for example a life sentence is a life sentence 
where someone will spend 25 years in jail and when he gets out he 
is on parole for the rest of his life. If he violates his parole 
conditions, he is back inside. He is subject to the government and 
to the parole conditions for the rest of his life.
<P>
	When I think of Clifford Olson I am appalled how justice failed 
Canadians. Not only are we going to allow him to appeal his 
sentence after 15 years, but everybody knows he should have been 
designated a dangerous offender. However, the law allows such a 
narrow window for that application to be made that by the time the 
judgment is rendered and the sentence is passed the prosecutor 
forgets to apply for dangerous offender status. Therefore Mr. Olson 
and others like him will be able to walk the streets of this country 
absolutely and totally free after 25 years, perhaps sooner. Is that the 
type of justice that we feel Canadians expect? Is that the type of 
justice that this government feels Canadians want to have? I do not 
think so. The people I talk to certainly do not want that.
<P>
	We need safe streets. People need to feel they can walk the 
streets at night without fear of murder, without fear of rape and 
without fear of robbery. We seem to bend over backward to help 
those who have murdered and raped yet we do nothing to help those 
innocent people who have been injured, who have been terrorized, 
who have been destroyed by these crimes.
<P>
	The member for Fraser Valley West has introduced a victim's 
rights bill where we are going to start recognizing that these 
victims have rights and these rights should stand before the rights 
of the criminal. That is the type of legislation we should be talking 
about in this House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4261"> 4261 </A></B>
<P>
	We should not be talking about whether the person has 
committed one murder or two murders and one murder is fine and 
two is maybe a little bit worse. The Minister of Justice talks about 
good murderers and bad murderers and makes differentiations. 
Ask any family who has had one of its members murdered if they 
feel that their hurt is any less because that was the only murder 
committed by a criminal versus someone who has committed more 
than one murder. Ask if they hurt any less. I can assure the House 
that they do not.
<P>
	The testimony of the hon. member for Macleod showed us that is 
the case. Therefore why is this government talking about statistics 
when we are talking about real people? We are talking about 
individuals who walk on the streets and individuals who should be 
walking on the streets but are in their graves today while the others 
are locked up and should stay locked up. Yet this government wants 
to turn those people lose on society.
<P>
	I think of the Gingras case in Edmonton where I come from. 
Because he was a good little boy in prison we took him to the West 
Edmonton Mall for his birthday party and he escaped from his 
guards and murdered two more people before he was back in. Is 
this the justice system Canadians want, where we take murderers 
out for a birthday party to the shopping mall and to the amusement 
park in West Edmonton Mall so that he can have a good time while 
others never ever heal from the hurt and the tragedy?
<P>
	This government has to think again. This government has to 
realize that Canadians want justice served. If government members 
will not do it at the next election, Canadians will find somebody 
who will do it. That is the point. The member for York 
South-Weston said to scrap the bill. They used political backroom 
deals to bury it and to bring forth their own piece of legislation.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	Canadians see through that. Very definitely they see through 
that. They want a government that stands up and is accountable. We 
see this government. It does not matter if it is crime and 
punishment. It does not matter if it is the Somalia affair. It does not 
matter if the chief of defence staff stands up and says: ``Mea culpa. 
Sure, I broke the spirit of the law but does it matter?'' Of course it 
matters. Everything matters because we need to have some 
leadership and accountability in this country. It can start right here 
with the repeal of section 745.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this bill. It gives 
me no pleasure at all to make some of the points that I have to make 
today.
<P>
	I was the one who seconded the bill that the member for York 
South-Weston brought to this House. I laid aside partisan politics. 
It did not matter that he was a  member of the Liberal Party at that 
time. I felt the issue was important and deserved to be supported.
<P>
	I would appeal to every member in this House to do what we 
have been sent here by our constituents to do, which is to look at 
every piece of legislation, to listen to the debate very carefully and 
to decide whether or not it is a good law.
<P>
	I would submit that the evidence that has been presented, all the 
speeches that have been given on this would indicate to the 
members in this House that section 745 should be repealed.
<P>
	As my constituents have sent me to Ottawa to be their voice, I 
want to express my complete and utter opposition to the 
amendments and to this bill. My constituents have told me this: If a 
criminal is sentenced to life imprisonment without parole, then that 
is exactly what the sentence should be. I believe that no one can 
reasonably second guess a decision made by a judge and jury 15 
years earlier, nor do I think our laws should ever permit them to do 
so.
<P>
	Eighty-six per cent of my constituents say that it is time to return 
to capital punishment as a punishment option for judges. Eighty-six 
per cent. At every public meeting I attend, from virtually everyone 
who deals with criminal justice issues there are demands not only 
for capital punishment but also for corporal punishment to be 
reinstated.
<P>
	These are the things that my constituents are saying. I 
wholeheartedly agree with them. I have looked at the evidence. I 
have examined the issues. They are right.
<P>
	Given my constituents' thoughts on the return of capital 
punishment, members can understand their determination to ensure 
that premeditated murderers are required by law to serve their full 
sentence. Twenty-five years without parole should mean 25 years 
without parole. Section 745 must not be repealed and not be 
amended.
<P>
	The question that I want to discuss very briefly is, why should 
we be listening to the people out there in regard to this criminal 
justice issue. Is it important or do we somehow feel we think at a 
higher level than the people around us? I do not believe we do.
<P>
	Justice is fundamental to maintaining the fabric of a society. 
That is why we should listen. The laws that are put in place by a 
Parliament in a democratic country should reflect the values of that 
society. If they do not, the very fabric of society begins to unravel.
<P>
	I want to give an example. The Young Offenders Act has become 
a revolving door for many young people. I have fairly close 
connections with the high school in the city of Yorkton. I have had 
my own children going through that school. The effect of not 
having a young offender properly dealt with is that it begins to 
affect everyone else in society. That is what I mean by the  fabric of 
society beginning to unravel if we do not have true justice in 
<P>

<P>
society. If the people do not perceive that justice is being served 
their whole attitude toward the law begins to decline. That is why 
section 745 needs to be repealed. The people in our country are 
beginning to develop a very cynical attitude toward the law.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	In the high school in Yorkton that I am referring to, when these 
young people are not dealt with properly the rest of the young 
people in that school begin to take the attitude: ``It does not matter 
what I do. It does not matter. I can do as I wish''. It even goes so far 
that the quality of work produced by the students begins to decline. 
Therefore justice does not affect the attitude toward the law but it 
begins to affect everything else in society.
<P>
	If we want to maintain a quality of life within our country, we 
must listen to what the people of Canada are telling us. It is 
fundamental to maintaining a structured, healthy, vibrant society. 
That is why I submit that we as politicians, as parliamentarians, 
should be looking at the overall effect of the laws in our country 
and what they do.
<P>
	If we underestimate the impact this section is having, I ask 
members to please keep in mind this fact. In the next 15 years 
approximately 600 killers will become eligible for judicial reviews 
to have their sentence reduced by up to 40 per cent. Six hundred 
killers will have the opportunity of having their sentences reduced.
<P>
	Currently section 745 hearings are biased in favour of the 
criminals. When I went to some of the investigations and some of 
the prisons across Canada I could not believe the system and how it 
does not work.
<P>
	These hearings are preoccupied with the interests and rights of 
the criminal to the detriment of the interest and rights of the victim 
and the victim's family. At these hearings the criminal has more 
rights than the victim. Victims are currently not even allowed to 
appear as a witness and give evidence at these hearings.
<P>
	The bureaucrats who are running the prisons get to select what 
information is given to the judge and jury about the inmate. They 
say they cannot release negative information about the convicted 
killer because it would invade their right to privacy. Can anyone 
believe this? A killer has the right to privacy. I believe that when 
someone commits a heinous crime like murder, some of those 
rights are lost. I especially believe the right to privacy is forfeited. 
They have failed our society. I question the need for killers to have 
any rights when they are in jail.
<P>
	I know my constituents are making these demands and it is time 
for the government to listen to what Canadians are saying. It is so 
fundamentally important that justice be the thing we focus on in the 
House.
<P>
	The hon. member for Macleod gave an example and, time 
permitting, I will also give the House an example. This is not an 
isolated case. We must understand that every murder committed in 
this country has a story surrounding it. Here is another one.
<P>
	In 1994 an early parole hearing for a murderer was held in 
Saskatoon. The victim's family was not allowed to appear before 
the judge and jury. The victim's story was never told. Here are the 
facts of a premeditated, cold blooded murder.
<P>
	In 1978 Constable Brian King was working alone in the 
Saskatoon detachment area. He was married to Marie and had three 
small children. He stopped a car with no rear licence plate, 
something he had done hundreds of times. But this time there were 
two men inside the car that had only one thing in mind: they were 
going to kill a cop.
<P>
	Greg Fisher and Darryl Crook had been partying earlier that 
night and had told people they intended to kill a cop that very night. 
They removed the licence plate from their car so that the 
unsuspecting police officer might stop them. When Constable King 
stopped their car, Crook threw a beer bottle into the ditch. As King 
went to pick up the beer bottle the two killers got out of the car, 
jumped King, stole his gun, handcuffed him, forced him into the 
car, drove him to the bank of the South Saskatchewan River, made 
him kneel down and shot him twice in the head at point blank 
range.
<P>
	They were caught later that night by the Saskatoon city police. 
Both Fisher and Crook were convicted of first degree murder, 
which means premeditated murder, and they were both sentenced 
to life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for at least 25 
years. It was not 15 years, but life imprisonment with no eligibility 
for parole for 25 years.
<P>
	This information and all its gory details had to be part of any 
hearing regarding the possible reduction of the sentence. Every 
juror at the hearing must feel the horror of Constable King's last 
minutes on earth. Only in this way would they understand why 
these killers were sentenced to the maximum sentence allowed by 
law.
<P>
	I and the majority of Canadians only wish that capital 
punishment had been an option for the judge and jury in this case. It 
should have been.
<P>
	There is another part of the victim's story that these hearings are 
denied, the pain and suffering the victim's family had to go through 
because of the callous disregard for human life that Fisher and 
Crook had for the victim. The judge and jury in these cases must 
understand all of the consequences of these senseless murders 
before they rule on reducing the sentence by even one month.
<P>
	When Mr. Fisher's hearing came up early this year it was 
suggested by Mrs. Marie King-Forest that they might just want to 
stay at home and not even attend the hearings. After all, what could 
be gained? Mrs.  King-Forest said: ``How can it be that my entire 
family is forced to go through this all again? This is wrong. He was 
sentenced to life with no parole for 25 years. That is the penalty for 
killing Brian. There should be no shortcuts''.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4263"> 4263 </A></B>
<P>
	To Mrs. King-Forest's credit she was able to mount such a high 
level of public support for her situation that the judge granted a 
hearing mistrial because of media coverage and police attendance 
at the hearing. She later appeared before the federal Minister of 
Justice to ask him to repeal section 745, but he gave no indication 
leading toward such changes.
<P>
	This is one more story to underline that we must repeal section 
745.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In order for members to be 
clear, this afternoon I have been using my clock and there is a 
difference of approximately one minute. I am going to ask for 
resumption of debate and whoever that member might be will be 
the first on the speaking list when this matter returns to the House. 
If no one is prepared to resume debate we will call the question.
<P>
	Resuming debate, the hon. member for Calgary Northeast.
<P>
	With the agreement of the House I will see the clock as being 
6.30 p.m. rather than giving the floor to someone for less than one 
minute. Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 6.30 p.m., the House 
stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 24.
<P>
