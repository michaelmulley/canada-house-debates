	<B>Mr. Murray Calder (Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to take the time today to extend my 
congratulations as well as those of the people of Orangeville and 
Dufferin county to the Orangeville Northmen, the Canadian Junior 
A lacrosse champions.
<P>
	I cannot remember a lacrosse team that has so dominated its 
competition, winning its second Minto Cup in three years. The 
Northmen, their coach Terry Sanderson, general manager Bob 
Clevely climaxed a phenomenal season winning 35 of 36 regular 
season games and all 16 of its playoff games.
<P>
	It was a truly astounding 1995 season. I wish to indicate my 
appreciation to the young men who represented Orangeville, 
including first year Captain Rusty Kruger who won the most 
valuable player award for his play during the Minto Cup.
<P>
	My thanks to the Orangeville Northmen.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
federal government, the one parading about on every possible 
platform to vaunt the merits of bilingualism in Canada, is totally 
thumbing its nose at francophones by shamelessly flouting its own 
language policies.
<P>
	For example in Beijing the Quebec women participants, 
although making up one third of the Canadian participation in the 
NGO Forum and the World Conference on Women, ran up against 
application of the Official Languages Act. They were invited to the 
Canadian embassy for an information session aimed at facilitating 
their contact with China and ensuring their  security and then were 
briefed in English only, not once but twice.
<P>
	These francophones, like those in the federal public service,

	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Atlantic Canadians have had nothing but one bad catch of 
politicians after another. Both the Liberal and Tory catches have 
been a miserable failure for Atlantic Canadians but there is hope. 
There are more than two fish in the sea. There is a new 
underutilized species that is proving to be a bountiful catch, the 
Reform Party of Canada.
<P>
	In Ottawa the Liberal Atlantic Canada MPs have been gutted by 
their own government and cannot speak out on behalf of their 
constituents for fear of being left to rot on the docks.
<P>
	Now there is a new stock of people committed to standing up for 
Atlantic Canadians. That new voice for Atlantic Canadians is the 
Reform Party of Canada. The Reform Party wants to hear from all 
Atlantic Canadians who wish to see the east coast returned to its 
former prosperity.
<P>
	The old school is dying and the time for change is now. The 
catch of the day in Atlantic Canada is the Reform Party of Canada, 
always fresh and definitely the best choice on the menu.

<P>
	Big Brothers of Canada provides boys from father absent homes 
with a male role model and a friend. There are 180 Big Brother 
agencies from coast to coast. Unfortunately, most of them have 
waiting lists that are almost as long as their list of matched bothers.
<P>
	Nationally the organization has 9,000 young boys who have been 
matched with older volunteer brothers and a waiting list of 7,000 
boys. In London, Ontario there are 119 matches with a waiting list 
of 100. That means 100 boys between the ages of 7 and 12 can only 
hope that they will be matched with an older brother whom they 
can look up to, spend time with and talk to.
<P>
	It is today's reality that many children are being raised by single 
parents but organizations such as the Big Brothers and Big Sisters 
agencies help to fill the void. During this special month we 
recognize and thank the Big Brothers volunteers who have helped 
to make a difference in the lives of many boys simply by giving 
them the gift of time.

	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, economist 
Bill Robson of the C.D. Howe Institute stated yesterday that a 
sovereign Quebec could keep the Canadian dollar. He also said that 
when a country renounces its own currency it accepts having others 
make its decisions for it.
<P>
	His position is therefore in the same vein as that of the Prime 
Minister of Canada who stated on December 9 1994 that ``there is 
nothing to stop a sovereign Quebec from using the Canadian dollar 
if it so chooses''. The Prime Minister went on to say ``-but it will 
have to pay the price and will no have no more say in setting 
monetary policies''. What cynicism.
<P>
	First of all, it is good to see that Mr. Robson and the Prime 
Minister have understood Canada could not prevent a sovereign 
Quebec from using the Canadian dollar. However, what both 
choose to ignore is that Quebec has no say at the present time in the 
conduct of monetary policy. If they listened to the Finance Minister 
of Canada, they would also understand that Canada's huge debt 
does not leave it much leeway at all in its own monetary policy.

north-south transportation and information links will be far more 
effective than regional development grants.

<P>
	It is even more fundamental than that, since a line has been 
drawn between those who respect the democratic right of 
Quebecers to determine their future and those who deny them that 
right. Through the fault of the Prime Minister and his irresponsible 
attitude, Canada is now divided between democrats and those who 
no longer are democrats. This man, whose career has been 
dedicated to stoking the fires of discord between Quebec and 
Canada, has now launched an attack on what united us so far, our 
common democratic heritage.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the Prime Minister: We knew for 
some time that, given a choice between Canada and Quebec, he 
chose Canada, but are we now to understand that, if forced to 
choose between democracy and federalism, he will choose 
federalism?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I answered all those questions yesterday and the day 
before. I even quoted from René Lévesque's program, in which he 
mentioned the concept of a referendum as consultation, the need to 
respect the laws and constitution of a country and the need for a 
clear majority.
<P>
	As Daniel Johnson said in the National Assembly, we are not 
about to divide Canada following a judicial recount to see whether 
there is one vote more on one side or the other.
<P>
	Obviously I want a genuine debate on this problem because it is 
clear that the Leader of the Opposition and his leader in Quebec 
City, Mr. Parizeau, are hiding the truth from Quebecers. This 
morning in the National Assembly, they were once again unable to 
explain why studies by Professor Bernier stating that it was 
``unrealistic'' to have a partnership with the rest of Canada were 
kept under wraps.
<P>
	Could the Leader of the Opposition tell me whether he agrees 
with Professor Bernier when he says: ``I think some of my 
conclusions were not politically acceptable''? He added that it was 
not his intention to write to please the reader. He said that a 
partnership was ``unrealistic and an illusion''.
<P>
	Does the Leader of the Opposition agree with the tactics of his 
leader in Quebec City, Mr. Parizeau, which consist in keeping 
documents under wraps and asking professionals to act less than 
professionally for the partisan purposes of a lost cause?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I may suggest that during Question Period we 
expect some answers as well. That being said, the Leader of the 
Opposition has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps people ask questions when they have no answers.
<P>
	Aside from that, does the leader of the government not realize 
that, although he has this anti-Quebec obsession,  his first duty as 
Prime Minister is not only to protect democracy but to set an 
example by respecting it? I am not optimistic, however, since this 
is the man who forced a constitution down the throats of 
Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what we expect from the Leader of the Opposition and his 
leader, Mr. Parizeau, is that during the remaining four and a half 
weeks, they tell Quebecers the truth.
<P>
	Why will they not admit that in this document they want to keep 
under wraps, Professor Bernier clearly indicated that a separated 
Quebec's accession to NAFTA would not be easy to achieve? Why 
did we ask this professor to say publicly, to serve the cause, what 
the facts are: that it will not be easy? In fact, he was not alone. A 
few months ago, the ambassador of the United States made it clear 
that the automatic admission to NAFTA of a possibly independent 
Quebec would be very complex.
<P>
	So these are the real questions for those who have to prove their 
case. The Leader of the Opposition and his leader in Quebec City 
are the ones who want to separate Quebec from Canada, not us. The 
onus is on them to tell Quebecers the truth, and I hope they will 
have the courage to do so during the next four and half weeks.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is first and foremost about democracy. Coming from 
someone who came to power with 41 per cent of the popular vote in 
Canada and 33 per cent in Quebec, it takes a lot of nerve to deny 
Quebecers the right to determine their future with a majority of 
more than 50 per cent.
<P>
	Does he not realize that the people of Quebec do not need his or 
anyone else's permission to determine their future and that to be rid 
of this kind of arrogance is one reason why Quebec will vote Yes?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is nothing arrogant in what I say. I want Quebecers 
to be informed. How can the Leader of the Opposition give 
Quebecers the impression they will keep their Canadian 
citizenship, their Canadian passport, Canadian currency, and an 
economic and political union with Canada, when studies prepared 
by their own experts and paid for by Quebec taxpayers tell them 
this is impossible? Let him tell Quebecers the truth.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Yes, they know you.
<P>

is 99 per cent francophone. And they know perfectly well that

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister is taking great care to answer the questions put to him by 
the Leader of the Opposition to give him a second chance, because 
Quebecers know him and remember him.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's attitude toward honouring the result of the 
Quebec referendum strangely parallels his behaviour in 1982 at the 
time of the unilateral patriation of the constitution, when, for the 
first time, he made a mockery of democracy.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister aware that, by refusing to agree to honour 
the result of the Quebec referendum, he is creating a dangerous 
precedent by taking a step no Canadian Prime Minister before him 
has dared take?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the debate in Quebec City will adjourn at four o'clock this 
afternoon. The members of the Parti Quebecois and its leader, the 
Premier of Quebec, will have to vote on an amendment proposed 
by a member of the National Assembly in which the question will 
be very clear: Do you want to separate from Canada? Yes or no.
<P>
	This question was probably taken from the Parti Quebecois 
agenda at the time of the election, when the Premier himself was 
saying: ``We will ask a clear question: Are you in favour of 
sovereignty for Quebec on-'', followed by the date. It is very 
clear. As I said two days ago, they will have the opportunity to be 
really honest with the public and say clearly that they want 
separation. But again today they will keep the question ambiguous 
in order to keep the truth about separation from Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in addition 
to making compliance with the result of the Quebec referendum 
dependent on his choosing the question, which of itself is no easy 
task, the Prime Minister used the opportunity to make his Minister 
of Labour change her mind by twisting her arm. He made Daniel 
Johnson change his mind by twisting his arm. He tried to get the 
leader of the third party to change his mind by twisting his arm.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell me this? Just how far will he go in 
trying to subvert democracy? How far exactly?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, they are according me a lot of power. As far as I am 
concerned, I have clearly stated that the Prime Minister of Canada 
cannot agree to independence from Canada as the result of a simple 
majority vote plus one on an ambiguous question. Come on!
<P>
	As William Johnson said in <I>The Gazette</I> this morning, under 
proposed legislation, a two thirds majority will be required to 
dissolve a hunting and fishing club in Quebec.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> I am not saying it would take a 
two thirds majority, I am saying-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> No. Listen, what I am saying is 
that I see them using a double standard once again. Let us be

<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the referendum campaign Quebecers are being told by 
the separatists that a no vote means passively accepting federalism 
as it is, but many federalists, including 52 of us in the House, 
believe that no can mean both no to separation and no to the status 
quo, that no can be the word that opens the door to a changing 
federalism without amending the Constitution, without special 
deals, but with Quebec as part of the national family.
<P>
	What is the Prime Minister going to do, besides doing nothing 
more vigorously, to make sure that when Quebecers vote no it 
means more than simply accepting the status quo?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I see a smile on the face of the leader of the Reform Party. 
I did not break his legs or his arms yesterday. We had a very 
civilized discussion. We did not agree on everything, but we would 
be surprised if some day we were to agree on everything.
<P>
	However I agree today with him that change can come to Canada 
without changing the Constitution. It is what we are trying to do all 
the time. He says that we do not need to have a long constitutional 
debate. That is fine. We are trying to always find new ways to do 
things in this federation and we will continue to do that. We have 
made a lot of changes and we will make a lot of changes in the 
future. Canada is evolving all the time.
<P>
	When I became a member of Parliament the federal government 
was spending two-thirds of the public money. Now we are down to 
around 40 per cent. The rest is spent by the provinces and the 
municipalities. Of the 40 per cent a big part is to pay the interest on 
the debt accumulated by the Conservative government.
<P>
	If the leader of the Reform Party, who used to be a Social Credit 
person, can give me a way, in printing money or something like 
that, so that there will be no more debt, our share of the pie will go 
down.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have heard all of that before, but it is not strong 
enough and clear enough to be a real asset to the no side. While 
many Quebecers will vote no because they reject separation, 
others will vote no only if they believe there is a groundswell of 
support for changing federalism in Canada.
<P>
	There is such a groundswell and unlike Meech and 
Charlottetown it is coming from the bottom up, not the top down, 
and its key feature is a demand for real decentralization: greater 
control over health and social services by governments close to the 
people.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	If the Prime Minister wants a no vote as badly as we do, a big no 
vote, will he do something concrete in the next 30 days to 
recognize the demand for decentralization throughout Canada, 
including Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the burden of proof is not on those who believe in Canada 
at this moment but on those who want to destroy Canada. They are 
the ones who have to explain to Canadians how they can promise 
on behalf of Canada that they will keep the passports, the money, 
the citizenship and an economic and political union. They have the 
burden of proving to Quebecers how they are so sure they will 
become members of NAFTA and so on.
<P>
	Do not divert the debate. These people are faced with the burden 
of proof and have no answers. Let us keep the pressure on them and 
not on me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the separatists have been doing everything in their power 
to prove a no vote means more of the same and that Canada will 
never move off the status quo.
<P>
	The Prime Minister can disprove that charge by seizing 
opportunities to respond to the demand for decentralization. Even 
today his health minister is in Victoria. She could advance the 
cause by simply agreeing to open up the Canada Health Act to 
permit the provinces greater flexibility in financing health care. 
Albertans want it. Ontarians want it. Quebecers want it. Canadians 
want it.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister willing to put some meaning into this 
phrase of flexible federalism and thus advance the no side by 
committing to amend the Canada Health Act?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not think it would change the vote in Quebec if we 
agreed to have a two tier system of health care. The people of 
Quebec want a system for hospitalization and the Bloc Quebecois 
supports that every citizen should be allowed admittance into a 
hospital. We all agree we do not need clinics for the rich and 
hospitals for the poor. We want the same health care system for 
everybody.
<P>
	Destroying the health care system in Canada will not persuade 
the Leader of the Opposition and his leader in Quebec to vote no. 
However, the people of Canada would be very disappointed if I 
were to stand here just to maintain peace for 40 days and concede 
our national health system which makes everybody equal in 
Canada.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has just shown his real conception of 
Quebec. How can the Prime Minister of Canada compare the 
Quebec referendum to the decision to dismantle a rod and gun 
club?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not me. I am telling you that the hard and fast rule of 
the majority plus one is clearly stated in the Quebec Civil Code and 
that even to dismantle the smallest entity, a corporation, or to found 
a rod and gun club, one must respect more than the rule of the 
majority plus one.
<P>
	The Quebec Civil Code is based on the Napoleonic Code. I 
simply wish to state clearly that, with such an ambiguous question, 
they should not ask me to disregard the basic rules of the Quebec 
Civil Code. However, as I said before in this House, change the 
question and ask an honest one. You still have two and a half hours. 
Ask an honest question: ``Do you want to separate from Canada?'' 
Go ahead and ask it. I will not stand in your way, because I am sure 
we will win.

I have spent my whole career defending millions of francophones 
outside Quebec, whom those people want to abandon. Everyone

this country to protect the rights of anglophones who have lived in 
Quebec for centuries, who are proud anglophones as well as proud 
Quebecers.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in a September 6 letter to the minister of the Nova Scotia 
economic renewal agency regarding the cancellation of the 
<I>Bluenose</I> ferry winter service the Minister of Transport stated: ``I 
have asked Marine Atlantic to consult with the appropriate 
stakeholders. Until the consultations have been completed I will 
not be in a position to provide specific details concerning changes 
to the service levels''.
<P>
	One day after that letter was received Marine Atlantic chose to 
ignore the minister's undertaking and announced the October 10 
closure of the ferry.
<P>
	Will the minister direct this government corporation to retract its 
decision until a total economic impact study, now under way by the 
province of Nova Scotia, has been completed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke 
for having given me notice of the question.
<P>
	As a result of a meeting held today with the premier of Nova 
Scotia, Mr. Savage, and his minister of transportation, Mr. Mann, 
and particularly as a result of long discussions with the member for 
South West Nova, the member for South Shore and the member for 
Annapolis Valley-Hants, we have determined with the people at 
Marine Atlantic that although they were quite confident that very 
lengthy and in depth consultations had taken place and that all of 
the financial data and information required to make a decision had 
been reviewed, in the spirit of fairness and flexibility, as the 
government always tries to respect its undertakings, we will delay 
the implementation of the decision to suspend the service of the 
<I>Bluenose</I>.
<P>
	We are looking forward to that study being commissioned by the 
Government of Nova Scotia and we expect we will be able to take a 
final decision on winter service before the end of this year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the minister for his positive response to my 
question.
<P>
	It is unfortunate for those in southern Nova Scotia that it takes an 
advocacy other than their elected representatives in order to bring 
this matter to the minister's attention.
<P>
	Marine Atlantic's lack of response to market needs and 
ministerial direction coupled with Liberal strongarm penalties for 
MPs is interfering with the economy of southern Nova Scotia.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	Will the minister agree it is now time to start the process of 
privatizing Marine Atlantic so it can be controlled by market needs 
instead of some unknown internal or political agenda?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, schizophrenia is still rampant.
<P>
	What we are attempting to do with the process initiated by 
Marine Atlantic is achieve the objective of putting Marine Atlantic 
on a commercial basis.
<P>
	We look forward to co-operating with the people in that area. We 
understand the levels of service provided in the past. We 
understand the subsidies being paid by Canadian taxpayers are no 
longer sustainable.
<P>
	In response to the member's original question we have said we 
will look at the feasibility study commissioned by the Government 
of Nova Scotia. We will respond to it and with the co-operation of

	First, I want to mention that the student protests today in every

made by the federal government in social programs, as well as the 
stubbornness of a government which continues to ignore the

increase tuition fees, strictly because of the federal government's

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ouellet:</B> The decision will be made by Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I pointed out to the hon. 
member yesterday when he said he did not like to deal with 
numbers, this year alone we are increasing the transfer to Quebec 
by $20 million.
<P>
	Unfortunately for whatever reasons, and this is certainly the 
responsibility of Quebec, the minister of education for Quebec has 
already cut $200 million from the budget for higher education.
<P>
	Instead of laying the blame the hon. member should be placing 
the question where it properly belongs. Education in Quebec is the 
responsibility of Quebec. It decides on tuition and on curriculum. 
We have given it full right under the new transfer payment to make 
those decisions. I hope that when the hon. member has the 
opportunity he will go back to raise the same kind of issue, the 
same kind of question with the Government of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given the Prime 
Minister's silence, and since the Minister of Human Resources 
Development apparently wants to answer my question, I will tell 
him that this information is taken from his green paper on budget 
commitments.
<P>
	Can the minister deny today that the federal government will 
force Quebec to substantially reduce its spending by depriving the 
province, through the new Canada social transfer, of more than two 
billion dollars? Can he deny that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the figures quoted by 
the hon. member are not valid. In 1996-97, Quebec will only get 
$350 million less than it did in 1994-95. That is less than one per 
cent of the total revenues of the province, which was informed of 
that decision two years ago. In fact, Quebec's minister of finance, 
Mr. Campeau, accepted that decision at a finance ministers'

Minister's office did another masterful snow job on the media with 
a three day blitz designed to polish up the image of Atlantic 
Canada's king of patronage. Two so-called independent studies 
allegedly cleared the minister of public works of wrongdoing.
<P>
	My question for the minister of public works is a direct one. Did 
he or anyone connected to his office have any influence in dictating 
the terms of reference of the Price Waterhouse study into the 
Canada Post scandal in Sydney, Nova Scotia?

the minister of public works can hire the company of his choice, 
tell it what it can and cannot investigate, pronounce himself 
cleared, and expect the Canadian people to accept this charade?
<P>

the facts about a particular matter.
<P>
	I want the record to show that the incident he refers to took place 
as a result of representations made by a member of Parliament to 
me as the minister responsible for Canada Post. The House should

the very members of the House who are constantly demanding 
more responsibility for the provinces now want us to take the 
responsibility back and start making decisions for them.
<P>
	The reality is that in the area of education the Government of 
Quebec makes the decisions. It had already made decisions before 
transfer payments have even been effected.
<P>
	I recall very well Mr. Parizeau on his election saying that he 
would not raise tuition for the students of Quebec. I ask the hon.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

appreciate the initiatives we have taken to help students.

	On August 1 we announced the new student loan program that 
would provide direct grants to students who have fiscal needs, high 
needs for support. While Quebec has its own student loan program, 
we have transferred millions of dollars over to Quebec so direct 
grants could be provided for part-time students with fiscal needs, 
for disabled students, women going to graduate school, and to 
provide loan forgiveness.

	With the Mathews study, which indicates clearly that the costs of

<P>

principle is that fees should reflect the benefits of privileged access 
to public resources managed at public expense.
<P>
	The members of the Reform Party talk about the deficit, about 
increasing revenue, about reducing costs. Should a fisherman who 
makes $320,000 in the six week fishery not pay a fee for the use of 
a public resource?
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member and all fishermen that this will be 
based on an equitable formula and we will ensure that there is an 
even share. Those fishermen who are getting large revenues from 
their income will have to pay the highest fees. It will be on an 
equitable and fair basis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is not a fee, 
this is a tax. A fee implies that the bearer receive something in 
return for his payment. The minister offers only headaches to the 
fishermen in this case.
<P>
	The minister just does not get it. Canadians are taxed to death. 
Fishermen are in one of the worst predicaments they have ever

	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary to

the hon. member should know that fees have not been looked at

for an eight-week fishery. In 1995 the same fishers averaged more

someone who is making $1 million in landings, a $16,000 fee is 
perfectly reasonable under the circumstances.

	Does the minister realize that, in the absence of net job creation, 
only these UI cuts, which push the unemployed toward social 
assistance, can restore the UI fund and give the appearance of

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, unfortunately the hon. 
member does not deal in the realm of facts. She knows full well 
that since the government has come into power we have created 
over 455,000 jobs, in the province of Quebec alone 120,000 full 
time jobs, 70 per cent of them manufacturing, which are good well 
paying jobs.
<P>
	As a direct result of that, in the month of August there was a 13 
per cent decline in the welfare rate in the province of Quebec. It 
shows our programs are beginning to work.

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	This past summer $12 million was spent on a failed attempt to 
raise the <I>Irving Whale</I> barge off the coast of P.E.I. Officials are now 
saying they need to rethink the lifting of the barge because of 
onboard PCB contaminants.
<P>
	Why did the minister go ahead with the project, knowing full 
well from years before that PCBs were on board?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the presence of PCBs on 
board makes it that much more critical that the <I>Irving Whale</I> be 
lifted.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, according to a December 1992 study submitted by Marex 
International Limited to the Canadian Coast Guard, the heating 
fluid on board the <I>Irving Whale</I> was Monsanto MGS, a trade name 
for PCBs.
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	Why did the minister clearly ignore this study before embarking 
on such an expensive adventure thereby bringing about a court 
injunction? Twelve million dollars spent and it is still on the 
bottom of the sea.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the material the member 
refers to is by Monsanto. In fact the company that actually owns the 
<I>Irving Whale</I>, the Irving company, knew that the PCBs were there 
and did not inform.
<P>
	As a result of that lack of information, on July 6 I ordered a full 
investigation surrounding the presence of PCBs specifically cited 
in the Marex report but unfortunately not identified by the officials 
from the Department of Transport who were reviewing that study.
<P>
	On July 6 I ordered a report. This week our officials will be 
meeting with officials from the Irving company. We intend, 
hopefully within the next four weeks, to have the investigation 
completed and proper prosecution if and when necessary.

	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	As part of the last budget there was a requirement that as many 
as 400,000 small and medium sized unincorporated businesses in 
all of Canada be forced to change their year ends.
<P>
	Knowing the commitment of the minister and the government to 
help small and medium sized businesses to create jobs, how has the 
minister come to the assistance of the business community?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the member for 
Durham has just said, in order to prevent an undue deferral of 
income there were certain changes brought within the last budget to 
the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	Unfortunately we discovered, as the member has just said, that 
this imposed an undue burden on many unincorporated small 
businesses across the country. As a result we have been able to 
bring in changes that in effect allow small businesses to have a 
business year end and a tax year end.
<P>
	Therein does not lie the whole story. The fact is that the matter 
was brought to our attention by the member for Durham and a 
number of members on the government side of the House. Not only 
did they bring it to our attention, but in a very constructive and 
imaginative way they worked with the department to come up with 
a solution. I thank and congratulate those members of Parliament.

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, the hon. member for Roberval raised a point of order 
regarding a question asked by the hon. member for Vaudreuil.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	Today, I would like to read you a few comments Beauchesne 
made on this subject. The question concerned a report on the cost 
of separation prepared for the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	As I said, the hon. member for Vaudreuil directed his question at 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and this question 
concerned a report prepared for the Government of Quebec on the 
cost to the province of separating from our confederation. In my 
opinion, the question is in order as it concerns the obligations and 
duties of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. I am quoting 
from <I>Beauchesne's Parliamentary Rules and Forms</I>, Sixth Edition. 
Paragraph 410(16) reads:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ministers may be questioned only in relation to current portfolios.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This question was asked of the minister concerning a matter that 
clearly falls within his jurisdiction.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	He is responsible for the national unity office, and this report 
prepared for the Government of Quebec directly concerns his work 
in this office. Therefore, I think that the question is in order and 
that the point of order raised by the hon. member for Roberval is 
not relevant.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, as I said yesterday, I will review 
Hansard and make a ruling within a few days. It will not be long in 
coming.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="STANDINGCOMMITTEEONABORIGINALAFFAIRSANDNORTHERNDEVELOPMENT">STANDING COMMITTEE ON ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS AND NORTHERN 
DEVELOPMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order to call your attention to 
irregularities in the proceedings of the Standing Committee on 
Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development.
<P>
	For your information, Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I sought 
remedy within the committee to the problems which arose and we 
were unable to achieve or obtain adequate satisfaction.
<P>
	Although committees are creatures of this Chamber, I 
understand they are masters of their business within limits 
prescribed by the standing orders. Your Honour has recognized that 
Speakers have always been hesitant to interfere in the proceedings 
of committees of the House.
<P>
	However, as Speaker Fraser explained in a ruling on March 26, 
1990, at page 9756 of the <I>Debates</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Speaker has often informed the House that matters and procedural issues 
that arise in committee ought to be settled in committee unless the committee 
reports them first to the House. I have, however, said to the House that this 
practice was not an absolute one and that in very serious and special 
circumstances the Speaker may have to pronounce on a committee matter 
without the committee having reported to the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Also there is Your Honour's ruling of June 20, 1994 at page 5582 
of the <I>Debates</I>.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, this committee has a history of past irregularities, 
including the case to which I have drawn your attention. The 
irregularities from yesterday are as follows.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	First, as soon as the clerk's gavel fell I submitted a motion to 
elect a chairman. As Your Honour knows, under the standing orders 
the first item of business for an organizational meeting is the 
election of a chair for the committee. However the clerk 
acknowledged my speaking and asked me to wait until he had read 
his first item of business. I asked that he recognize that I had given 
notice of a motion. After the clerk read the item of business he 
proceeded to recognize someone else first.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14650"> 14650 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, once the chair was elected my colleagues repeatedly 
attempted to move a motion to elect a vice-chair, but the chair 
appeared to be intent on stalling so that a motion to elect a member 
of the Bloc could be put forward by the Bloc or by the government 
for the so-called opposition vice-chair.
<P>
	The chair stalled by insisting that we were to consider motions 
for government vice-chair. This is a false distinction. The standing 
orders do not recognize a government vice-chair per se. The 
standing orders only require that two of the three positions go to the 
government side.
<P>
	As soon as a motion to elect a vice-chair is put forward, whether 
to elect a government or opposition member that motion is surely 
in order. The chair made it clear that he was accepting no motions 
from the Reform.
<P>
	Third, once a member of the government moved to elect the Bloc 
to the vice-chair, my colleagues and I asked for debate on the 
motion. We were not only cut off; we were not allowed to debate at 
all. As Your Honour knows, Standing Order 116 makes clear that 
there is no limit on debate on a regular motion in committee.
<P>
	Fourth, when we put forward a motion to overturn the election of 
the Bloc member as vice-chair, the chairman refused to entertain 
the motion, which was surely in order. The chairman then 
summarily adjourned the meeting.
<P>
	We appeal to you, Mr. Speaker, to uphold the standing orders and 
our rights. This kind of conduct by committee chairs is surely less 
than acceptable. Are the committees and their chairs obligated to 
conduct their business according to the standing orders and 
according to the rules, or can the standing orders and the rules be 
ignored or changed at any committee chair's whim?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to respond to the points raised by the hon. 
member.
<P>
	First, the member acknowledged that it is customary for these 
issues to be dealt with in the committee and not in the House. 
Having said that I want to respond to some of the matters that were 
raised because I believe there are some factual inaccuracies in what 
was said.
<P>
	Second, there is an inaccurate knowledge of the rules, at least in 
my opinion. I would like to so submit, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	The matter of which position to be elected is dictated by the 
agenda duly prepared by the Committees Directorate of the House 
of Commons. I have a copy of the agenda in front of me which has 
the draft motions written on it as well as the various positions to be 
elected.
<P>
	The member suggested there was no such thing as a vice-chair 
from the government. I read here from the draft agenda point 
number two, which I will gladly table or at least give a copy to you, 
Mr. Speaker, to consider.  ``Moved by'' whatever member rises to 
make such a motion. Then there is a ``that'' and there is space for 
the person nominated ``be the vice-chair from the government''. It 
says so in the draft agenda prepared by the staff of Mr. Speaker, by 
the clerk staff, to be utilized by the person elected as chairman to 
then select names or invite nominations for those to be the two 
vice-chairs.
<P>
	Even if such a draft agenda did not exist at all, the member 
across has acknowledged that two of the three positions had to be 
from the government and one from the opposition.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	In view of the fact that the chair had already been elected from 
the government at the time that the two vice-chairs were elected, it 
stands to reason mathematically that at least one more position had 
to come from the government and one from the opposition. 
Otherwise, there are some mathematical differences in calculating 
things between the hon. member opposite and the majority of the 
rest of us.
<P>
	In addition to that the hon. member makes a claim that there was 
some difficulty in having a point of order recognized. It should be 
brought to the attention of the Speaker that under our rules 
members of the committee are recognized by the chair at the 
chair's discretion. There is also a provision whereby members of 
the House who are present in the room but who are not members of 
the committee can be recognized at the chair's discretion.
<P>
	In fact, the point of order was raised by the hon. member for 
Prince George-Bulkley Valley. The hon. member for Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley did not receive recognition for his point of 
order. He was not a member of the committee nor was he a 
substitute at that particular time because both members of the 
committee representing that party, the hon. member for North 
Island-Powell River and the hon. member for Surrey North, were 
present in the room. As the Speaker knows, a member can only be a 
substitute provided that the regular member is not in attendance at 
that particular meeting. In view of the fact that both of them were 
in attendance, then the other member was not a member of the 
committee at that particular time.
<P>
	That should take care of that point.
<P>
	Finally, I have before me the blues, or at least the rough <I>Hansard</I> 
of that particular committee, in which the hon. member, who in fact 
was not a member of the committee, the member for Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley, asked the chair for the following: ``Can 
we receive assurance that the vote on the nomination of Mr. 
Murphy will be called?'' In fact, this was the second nominee. He 
asked if we could have that assurance.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="14651"> 14651 </A></B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the hon. member stated the following: ``What we 
asked, Mr. Clerk, was that both names be put on the ballot, which 
the members of the Liberal Party agreed to do'', and so on.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am sure you are quite aware of citation Nos. 781, 
782 and 783 of Beauchesne. Citation No. 782 states that the clerk 
of the committee conducts the election of the chairman by putting a 
motion moved by a member of the committee. It says further that if 
this motion fails successive motions are moved. In other words, 
there was no provision for the two names to be on the ballot. It is 
contrary to our practices and contrary to the standing orders. What 
the hon. member was asking the clerk to do was to be in breach of 
the rules in order to gain something that he wanted.
<P>
	The clerk of the committee obviously followed the rules and so 
did the chairman subsequently. Just because the member has 
brought the matter to the House does not mean that the rules were 
breached. Perhaps it means that he did not have his way, but that is 
not the same thing as the rules not being observed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I do not want to get into a debate on this.
<P>
	If there is something that is relevant I will recognize it. Is the 
Reform whip rising on the same point of order?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
very simply, in view of the counter argument given by the chief 
government whip and in view of the fact that he has used some of 
the argument here himself as a whip in opposition or as a member 
of a committee, I respectfully ask that the deposition by the hon. 
member for North Island-Powell River be taken by the chair and 
be given back in written form as an answer, not just accepting the 
verbal answer given by the chief government whip today.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, you will remember that in the course 
of the last 18 months we have had at different times members 
bringing up situations which took place in committee.
<P>
	As the hon. member for North Island-Powell River said, it is 
rare that your Speaker would intervene in a matter of a committee.
<P>
	I have heard both sides today. I imagine there are some nuances I 
am not grasping because many times in the telling of both sides the 
whole flavour is not there. That is why this House in its wisdom has 
made the committees masters of their own destiny, if you will. It is 
only in really extraordinary circumstances that the Speaker has 
intervened.
<P>
	Having heard from both sides, and both sides seem to have very 
good arguments, I would be inclined to once again say very briefly 
that it seems to me the hon. member does have a grievance but that 
the grievance should be settled in committee. I would suggest that 
the  hon. member or members who feel aggrieved should bring this 
up in the committee proper. I would like to have this matter rest for 
now.
<P>
	Are there any other points of order?
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="STRANGERINTHECHAMBER">STRANGER IN THE CHAMBER</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I passed written notice to you that during question period 
at approximately 2:40 p.m., if my eyes did not deceive me and I do 
not have a videotape, it appeared to me that a stranger entered the 
House and spoke with the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup at his desk in the front row. If my 
eyes did not deceive me, this would be a very serious breach of the 
rules and traditions of the House. Under Standing Order 14 either I 
or one of my colleagues who witnessed this could have risen at that 
time during question period with an appropriate motion in relation 
to strangers but we did not, given the fact that it was an interesting 
question period.
<P>
	I put the matter to you now. I place the matter in your hands to 
clarify as you see fit, keeping in mind that if it did occur the way I 
saw it this would be a very serious breach of the House's rules and 
traditions.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member's point is well taken. Only 
members of Parliament are allowed in this House. I did not see 
anyone who was a stranger. I seem to recognize everyone, but you 
know my eyes sometimes fail me. This matter can be cleared up 
very quickly. We simply have to put the question to the member 
and the hon. member can answer the question at this time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I ask the hon. member this simple question: Did someone who is 
not a member of Parliament come to see him during question 
period?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, indeed, someone who is not a member of Parliament but 
who might be one some day came to see me. That person is the 
head of the pages.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Thank you. So, we have the answer.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, it has been a while since we have had a 
look at Bill C-45. It was introduced in March 1994. Most of us have 
pulled it off our shelves, blown the dust off and are having another 
look at it.
<P>
	Bill C-45 happens to be, in truth, a bill that was presented once 
upon a time by the old Conservative group and the bill had a 
different title.
<P>
	The government of today took the bill, watered it down, nursed it 
around and called it Bill C-45 and now are attempting to convinced 
Canadians we will really do something about law and order once 
again.
<P>
	In the two years we have been here I have already come to the 
conclusion, and I suspected right from the beginning but it is 
confirmed more and more, that the Liberals are tinkering around 
with criminals and legislation pertaining to them. This Mickey 
Mouse approach the government has had with regard to handling 
criminals has to come to an end.
<P>
	I remind members of government and members of the separatist 
party as well, because they are always in bed together on these 
issues regarding crime and law and order, there are two parties to 
every crime, a criminal and a victim. Nowhere in any legislation 
has the government addressed what it will do with regard to 
victims. Never once, not even when the government received 2.5 
million signatures from CAVEAT asking it to recognize the victims 
of crime.
<P>
	It constantly considers the rights and privileges of the criminal: 
``We have to make sure the criminal is protected here and protected 
there in every aspect. His or her rights are really important''.
<P>
	I am talking about the Solicitor General and the Minister of 
Justice. They received thousands and thousands of letters trying to 
get them to realize there are victims of crime. There were letters 
from the Melanie Carpenter campaign. We keep adding to the list. 
Only recently a 10-year-old girl was abducted and murdered even 
while her family was at home.
<P>
	No, we look at the legislation and it is a bunch of gobbledegook 
put together by a bunch of lawyers who run around in the little 
building over there called the  justice hall of Canada. They put 
together a thick pile of documents which would take 14 
Philadelphia lawyers to even interpret.
<P>
	The whole basis of fighting crime is supposed to deal with the 
problems. Instead we come up with all this stuff that takes a bunch 
of bureaucrats, highly paid, to make sure we put all this flowery 
stuff on it which will not solve one thing. It has to start addressing 
some problems in the country which it not now addressing.
<P>
	Motion No. 1 is an attempt by our party to get the government to 
recognize there are victims in the country.
<P>
	In my riding a student of mine was raped and had to live in fear 
afterwards because the perpetrator was still free. She almost had a 
nervous breakdown, requiring medical and psychiatric attention.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	The criminal was provided all of those services paid for by the 
taxpayers of Canada. The victim could get the same services. The 
only difference was she, her husband and their family had to dig 
into their purses and pockets to figure how they would pay for this.
<P>
	I recall a mother in Calgary whose five-year old daughter had her 
throat slashed, her body thrown in a garbage bag and dumped in a 
dumpster by a thirty seven-year old perpetrator who said he could 
not help himself because the little girl kept coming on to him.
<P>
	The little girl got life while the perpetrator will get 10 years. In 
the meantime the mother of this little girl, a single parent with 
other children, has gone through a terrible trauma. Not one penny 
of taxpayers' dollars has gone to help the victim in this case. 
However, that 37-year old killer has had psychiatrists, 
psychologists, dozens of legal aid lawyers throughout the whole 
period, helping him every whim of the way.
<P>
	I see a section in the bill that says the government will start 
doing something about these guys when they are locked up in jail. 
It will let them work to earn some money. It will take 30 per cent of 
that money and see it goes back into the government to help pay for 
meals, et cetera.
<P>
	This motion asks the people of the House to insist that any 
money collected from a perpetrator in prison will go to the victims 
to help them with their problem. Here is the chance for my Liberal 
friends to show their focus is on the victims of crime and not just 
the criminals day in and day out.
<P>
	I look back over the last few months with the Bernardo and 
Homolka situation, I remember the Olson situation and the 
hundreds of victims touched by those kinds of actions. It is terrible 
when we talk about people like that, like Mr. Olson, who are in 
prison. He killed one person which cost him a life sentence with 25 
years before possible parole. The second murder was free, the third 
one was free, the fourth one was free, the fifth one was  free, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14655"> 14655 </A></B>
<P>
seventh one was free, and on and on it goes. When will we stop 
making things free for these killers?
<P>
	The least we can do is if we are to get any kind of money from 
them it ought to be directed to those most affected, the victims. I 
am really sick and tired of this Mickey Mouse pussy footing around 
while really not giving a hoot about anything but making sure we 
do this glorified stuff in the House. We make sure we present 
documents so thick that we do not even have the time to read them. 
Certainly any common, ordinary Canadian could not understand 
them.
<P>
	It is time we got down to common sense and addressed the 
problem instead of creating 160 pages of gun law that will not do a 
stinking thing or creating another 45 pages of another law called 
Bill C-41. I am still trying to figure out what it will resolve. When 
will we acknowledge there are two people in crime, the victim and 
the criminal, and for a change concentrate on the victims instead of 
the criminal?
<P>
	We will look after criminals' basic rights. They are entitled to 
them. They are innocent until proven guilty. When they are 
convicted they will be sent to jail. When they are in jail they ought 
to have to work. If they do not work they should not eat. That is 
what happens in the rest of the world. If they do earn money and if 
is to be, as this bill says, 30 per cent of their earnings going back to 
the government, I say no. Let us put it toward the victim. Let us 
help them with the problems they face. Let us think about them for 
once.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	We would be more popular in our ridings if we put the victim 
first instead of the criminal in our legislation. Here is the chance. I 
beg hon. members to support Motion No. 1.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion presented by 
the hon. member would have limited effectiveness and is 
considered unnecessary in light of other mechanisms already in 
place to deal with restitution to victims.
<P>
	The Criminal Code also includes current provisions for 
compensation and restitution to victims by offenders. The proposal 
made by the opposition, which would make restitution 
commensurate with 30 per cent of inmates' total gross income, 
would have very little impact in compensating victims because of 
the low level of inmates' income.
<P>
	I would also emphasize that this proposal would be very costly 
and difficult to administer, particularly since the Correctional 
Service of Canada is not in the business of assessing the validity of 
victims' claims.
<P>
	A similar motion was defeated by the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs, of which the hon. member is a part and 
where he had ample time to put forward his claims.
<P>
	I would urge the House to reject the motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
decided not to speak on this issue quite simply because the 
parliamentary secretary has just spoken in exactly the same vein 
and I too find this motion inappropriate. To put it bluntly, we are 
against it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
we are discussing Bill C-45 and the motion put forward by my 
colleague from Wild Rose.
<P>
	The most important part of the bill is the rights of the victim. 
According to the Solicitor General, the amendments in Bill C-45 
are intended to restore public confidence in the federal correction 
process. When we talk about restore, that means to bring it back to 
its original state by rebuilding or repairing. Look at the work crew 
that is attempting to restore public confidence in the system. It is 
the same group that has perverted the justice system. It is the same 
group that has let Canadians down. It is the same group that has 
introduced things like section 45, allowing murderers back out on 
to the streets in 15 years.
<P>
	Now the members of this group come out and ask for the 
confidence of Canadians. ``Trust us'', they say. ``We know what is 
wrong with the system. We will fix it because we have heard your 
concerns. We will ensure that your rights are protected.'' On and on 
we listen to this rhetoric. I say it is absolute nonsense.
<P>
	The only thing the government is concerned about is looking 
good and sounding tough. It wants to look as if it is doing 
something to protect Canadians, to punish criminals and to make 
the streets and communities safe. ``Let us pass gun law legislation. 
We will not have any more crimes committed with guns.'' This is 
the kind of gimmick politics we have been seeing coming from the 
government.
<P>
	When it is gun control the government says that there is way too 
much crime. When Canadians are asking for the reinstatement of 
the death penalty, crime is on the decline. Where is it? Canadians 
are asking for the death penalty.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, may I point out 
that the hon. member is not speaking on Motion No. 1 at this time. 
He is giving us a general speech on gun control and everything 
under the sun except Motion No. 1.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I listened to the hon. member for Calgary 
Northeast and I am sure he is coming to his point just about now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am indeed coming to the point if the 
hon. member would be patient enough to listen.
<P>
	Bill C-45 calls for a full term detention of offenders who commit 
sexual offences against children. What about sexual offences 
against adults? What about sexual offences against women? What 
about sexual offences against anyone who is over the age of 12? Is 
that not a serious crime too? Of course it is. Yet it is not addressed 
in this bill. Why? All sexual assaults, regardless of the age of the 
victims, are serious and deserve full term sentences. Why are there 
no provisions for indefinite sentences once the offender has been 
incarcerated? This is also a part of the victims' compensation.
<P>
	Now we are getting back to the compensation, seeing the 
criminals pay for the crimes they have committed. If this work 
crew wanted to build a strong foundation, the first thing they would 
do is demand full term detention for all dangerous offenders 
deemed capable of repeating their offence. In fact they would 
consider indefinite sentences for offenders who are deemed 
capable of being repeat serious violent offenders. This too is 
compensation. Some say it is cruel and unusual punishment. I say 
no way, as do the Canadian people.
<P>
	The only thing I have seen that is cruel and unusual is a justice 
system that allows thugs and punks like this back out on to our 
streets to hassle, cause trouble, rape, assault and murder. Who 
should determine whether or not an offender should be released? 
How about trying a new approach? Ask the frontline workers 
instead of political hacks. Ask the victim or victims.
<P>
	A politically appointed board consisting of persons owed 
political favours is not the best system. Remember, they are part of 
the same group that is asking for a chance to restore public 
confidence in the system. Let the institutional staff, the people who 
deal with the prisoners day in and day out, determine the possibility 
of reoffending.
<P>
	Canadians are demanding real changes. Canadians are 
demanding that in all cases where a parole board decision results in 
an offender being released and reoffending a review must be 
mandatory. Taxpayers' dollars are going to be wasted to retain a 
bunch of political hacks who have no business to be sitting on a 
parole board. Put only qualified people in these important positions 
and use the money that is left for more important purposes, such as 
victims' compensation.
<P>
	Throughout this bill the victim is either forgotten or merely an 
afterthought. This is more of the same from the crew that is asking 
for trust that they will restore the system.
<P>
	Bill C-45 states that offenders earning income while incarcerated 
can have up to 30 per cent of their earnings deducted to help with 
their upkeep. Let us talk a little bit about their so-called upkeep. 
Corrections spend $67 million a year for health care for criminals. 
Some of that money is for sex changes and cosmetic surgery. 
Programs for special offenders, natives, females and the 
handicapped have $23 million. Education and personal 
development programs cost $65 million. Prisoners have cable TV, 
computer systems, babysitting services, conjugal visits with wives, 
girlfriends, and in some cases prostitutes, golf courses, health spas, 
cottages. The list goes on and on.
<P>
	Maybe the government should consider charging GST on some 
of those services to recoup some of the lost money. The 
government wants to claw back that money and support that system 
further? It is absolute nonsense. Prisoners get laptop computers and 
educational services costing millions and millions of dollars. On 
top of all this, these criminals get paid. Is that not decent of 
Canadian taxpayers? I am sure they are feeling good about the 
support they are offering to this criminal element.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	I am sure there are some students out there who are struggling 
this September because they do not have computers and have had 
to take out loans to go to school. I would like to see some of that 
money directed to them. Meanwhile, the government gives out 
goodies to crooks. It is unbelievable.
<P>
	The government wants to claw back some of the money it pays to 
criminals for sitting in jail. Do not pay them in the first place. 
These millions and millions of dollars should and could be spent 
more wisely helping victims instead of paying for prostitutes to 
visit prisons, helping victims instead of paying for sex changes, 
helping victims instead of helping the criminal. That is a novel idea 
for a Liberal.
<P>
	This bill does nothing to offer treatment or compensation to 
victims. Instead it takes a little bit of money back from the 
criminals and puts it back into the pocket of the government, that 
will turn around and supply them with the same type of material.
<P>
	The government claims that this bill will make offenders who 
are convicted of a new offence while on parole serve one-third of 
their new sentence before being eligible for release. What we need 
is a law that insists that any offender convicted of a new offence 
while on parole must serve the complete time left on the previous 
sentence, be sentenced with a minimum period of time for 
reoffending while on parole, and then serve the full term of the new 
sentence. How else will these offenders  be convinced that given a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14657"> 14657 </A></B>
<P>
chance to be a member of society they must be a member of society 
in good standing.
<P>
	According to the Solicitor General, between 1989 and 1994 no 
fewer than 78 convicted murderers murdered again while they were 
out on conditional release. These programs cost money, and we are 
going to throw it back into the whole thing by clawing back. Close 
to 5,000 people convicted of a lesser violent offence, such as child 
molesting, manslaughter, rape, or attempted murder, repeated their 
crimes while out on conditional release.
<P>
	Canadians are demanding that real sentences be imposed. The 
other side will scream that this will not work, that locking them up 
and throwing the key away is not the answer. It is part of the 
answer. Even the members on the other side realize that locking up 
criminals is the answer. They did ask for approval for harsher 
sentences for hate crimes. Why are they giving them higher 
sentences for hate crimes? Is it not the answer? If harsher sentences 
will reduce hate crime, full term sentences for crimes committed 
while society has given someone a second chance will go a long 
way to prevent that person from committing another crime and 
maybe it will stop them from committing the crime in the first 
place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Get out and visit some victims and you will not 
smile so much. You will not find anything to laugh about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> It is interesting to read what is included in this bill. 
What is more intriguing is what is left out. The Reform Party has 
been demanding that crimes committed with a firearm be given a 
full term sentence. If the government is so concerned about gun 
control and crimes involving guns, why did they not include full 
term sentences for offenders convicted of using a gun while 
committing a crime?
<P>
	In conclusion, Bill C-45 is nothing more than a lame attempt by 
the government to reassure Canadians that it cares. This bill could 
have been useful. The Liberals had their chance. It could have been 
effective. However, it is not even close to addressing the real 
problem, and that is compensation for victims.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Mr. Speaker, a brief point of order. I did not want 
to interrupt my friend from Calgary, which is why I refrained, but I 
wanted to stand on the same point of order the hon. member for 
Saint-Hubert spoke of earlier.
<P>
	We are on report stage on this bill. These amendments are very 
specific amendments to very specific sections.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	With great respect, there will be ample opportunity to address 
the general principles of the bill in third reading debate and 
opportunities to address capital punishment, gun control, no parole, 
or whatever. But if we are dealing  with a motion such as Motion 
No. 1 which talks very specifically about what to do with the 
compensation that is paid to prisoners, it is my respectful 
submission that the remarks should be confined to the motion and 
not to the principles of the bill in general.
<P>
	I would ask with great respect that the Chair be vigilant in the 
speeches that follow, not only on this motion and this group but 
other motions and other groups.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The point of both hon. members is well taken. I 
would encourage all hon. members to be quite specific in their 
remarks. I was not being facetious when I said the hon. member 
was coming to his point. In my view toward the end he came to it.
<P>
	I would encourage that it not take as long as the hon. member 
wanted to take in setting up where he is going. I am sure all hon. 
members will understand that these motions are very specific and I 
would ask you, my colleagues, to pay very close attention to what 
you are saying with regard to these motions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, bearing in 
mind the comments that have been made with regard to the point of 
order, I intend to stick as closely as I can to Motion No. 1. 
However, if I stray too far from the topic, I will certainly be guided 
by the Speaker's admonition.
<P>
	I rise today to speak to Motion No. 1 of Bill C-45. This 
amendment proposed by the Reform member would ensure that the 
victims of violence receive restitution. Without this amendment 30 
per cent of all income earned by an inmate would go to Corrections 
Canada to pay for room and board while victims or the victims' 
families are left empty handed.
<P>
	The financial burden placed on victims who require 
psychological counselling or medical treatment is an added assault 
upon the victim and the victim's family. If money is to be 
expropriated from criminals it should be directed to the victims 
first.
<P>
	Placing the victim first is a concept that the bleeding hearts of 
this country have yet to grasp. The rights of criminals have 
superseded the rights of victims for far too long. This intolerable 
situation must be reversed. This however can only be accomplished 
through significant changes to the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act of which Bill C-45 is devoid.
<P>
	I would like to read an excerpt from an article that appeared in 
the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> yesterday:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A pedophile named Martin Dubuc was convicted last week for offences 
against children, again. This is the same Martin Dubuc who, as a boy's hockey 
coach in Laval, was convicted in 1986 for molesting team members, the same 
creep who, after his release from prison, did not let a lifetime ban on coaching in

<BLOCKQUOTE>He simply changed locales, becoming a coach and eventually president of

recreation establishment is an old scandal. The new scandal involves the schools. 
It came to light last week when Dubuc pleaded guilty to using the telephone to 
threaten several boys aged 10 to 13 and to incite them to touch themselves 
sexually. Somehow, he had slithered his way into elementary schools as a </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14658"> 14658 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>substitute teacher. And this was not a slip up by just one organization. In recent years, 
three different school boards in the Montreal area had hired Dubuc.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The case illustrates the chilling ease with which predators with long criminal 
records can worm their way into positions of trust and authority to harm 
children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The author says: ``This was not a slip up by just one 
organization''. One slip up occurred within our penal system and it 
is a slip up that occurs regularly because correctional services has 
not been empowered by legislation to keep dangerous offenders 
behind bars where they belong. However, the biggest slip up can be 
attributed to the federal government where there exists this warped 
mentality that places the rights of criminals before the protection of 
society.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Currently the Corrections and Conditional Release Act allows 
the National Parole Board to suspend the parole or statutory release 
of federally sentenced offenders. Conditional release can be 
suspended for a variety of reasons but for sex offenders it is usually 
because there are indications of impending further sexual offence.
<P>
	This provision within the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act is necessary particularly in the case of child sexual predators 
who prey upon the most innocent members of our society. Sex 
offenders have one of the highest repeat rates of any criminal group 
with an estimated 40 per cent reoffending within five years of 
release. However, this provision is not enough.
<P>
	Bill C-45 is a watered down version of a Conservative bill. The 
Tory bill called for the full term detention of dangerous offenders 
and for the continued detention of those determined to be violent 
criminals at the end of their sentence. There are absolutely no 
provisions within the act nor are there any amendments in Bill 
C-45 to detain an offender identified through due process as being 
at high risk to reoffend. Unless someone is deemed a dangerous 
offender prior to sentencing, indefinite detention is not permissible 
afterward. This situation must be rectified.
<P>
	The Correctional Service of Canada in co-operation with the 
National Parole Board, the appropriate attorney general and a judge 
must be given the power to examine the prison history of offenders, 
including reviewing the courses they have taken and the perceived 
impact of those courses in controlling their behaviour. They should 
be able to order a psychological assessment of an offender during 
the last year of the criminal sentence if they have reason to believe 
the inmate still poses a threat to society.
<P>
	If the offender is deemed a high risk to reoffend they should have 
the authority to keep that individual locked up. An omission of this 
nature is indicative of a government that does not understand that 
crime prevention includes the reduction of opportunities to commit 
crime. It is suggestive of a government that places the rights of the 
criminal ahead of the rights of the victim.
<P>
	Last week the news media carried the admission of the Minister 
of Justice that he was somehow guilty of not funding crime 
preventive measures because of fiscal restraints imposed by his 
government. A provision of this nature, an amendment to the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act which could be facilitated 
through Bill C-45 is a preventive measure, a measure with 
relatively low financial cost compared to the very high return of the 
saving of innocent lives.
<P>
	This omission by the solicitor general was not missed by my 
colleague from Surrey-White Rock-South Langley. I would like 
to take this opportunity to commend my Reform colleague for 
filling this necessary gap in the corrections bill through her private 
member's bill.
<P>
	Bill C-240 if passed would keep individuals convicted of serious 
violent crimes who are deemed to have a high risk of repeating 
their crime off the street, something Canadians are demanding. 
Canadians can no longer tolerate a corrections system that releases 
high risk offenders back into their communities. They can no 
longer tolerate it.
<P>
	Statistics revealed yesterday by well-known columnist Diane 
Francis showed that between 1989 and 1994, 78 convicted 
murderers murdered again while on conditional release; 4,960 
persons convicted of lesser violent offences such as child 
molestation, manslaughter, rape or attempted murder repeated their 
crimes while on conditional release. Ms. Francis points out that this 
includes only those who have been caught.
<P>
	Canadians can no longer tolerate the likes of Wray Budreo, who 
psychiatrists diagnosed as a sadistic pedophile having a 30-year 
history of molesting children, being released unsupervised from a 
maximum security prison because correctional services did not 
have the power to detain him even though the parole board ruled 
him likely to reoffend. They cannot tolerate it because the cost is 
far too high.
<P>
	Not being able to assess and detain Fernand Auger cost Melanie 
Carpenter her life. The release of Joseph Fredericks, a man with a 
34-year history of sexual assault, assessed by case workers to likely 
commit further violent sexual crimes cost Christopher Stephenson 
his life.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	I will end by quoting a letter written by Andrew Tate which 
appeared on February 16 of this year in the <I>Times-Colonist</I>, 
Victoria, British Columbia:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14659"> 14659 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My heart and support go out to Steve Carpenter, family and friends regarding 
the abduction and murder of his daughter Melanie. I support his crusade to change 
the parole system for convicted, violent sex offenders and I strongly agree with the 
two angry Reform justice critics' demands that there should be no parole for 
violent offenders. Our premier agrees on this serious matter. Violent sexual 
offenders should not be granted parole for any reason and should serve out their 
full sentences. The federal government must enact tougher legislation. I believe 
that Melanie Carpenter's death could have been avoided if we had a more 
competent, no-nonsense, justice minister.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I conclude by saying that I believe the words of this Canadian 
reflect sentiments which echo throughout the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to address the motion which 
was made by my hon. colleague from Wild Rose. In that motion he 
proposes that we require the offender to pay restitution to the 
victim of an offence committed by the offender. We cannot 
separate this motion from any of the other concerns which we have 
with respect to the bill.
<P>
	I have stood in the House many times and said these very words: 
This bill is a step in the right direction, but it does not go far 
enough.
<P>
	Who can argue with the intent and the measures proposed in the 
bill? For example, strengthening the power of the National Parole 
Board to detain high risk sex offenders until the end of their 
sentence. That is very good. Strengthening the sentencing 
provisions for any person convicted of an offence while out on 
conditional release. All right. Strengthening the accountability of 
members of the National Parole Board or expanding the list of 
offences which would allow the detaining of offenders to the end of 
their sentence, or allowing Correctional Services Canada to deduct 
the costs of incarceration from income earned from offenders while 
in penitentiary. Good. That is the point we come to. What is going 
to be done with that money?
<P>
	The signal which needs to be sent to the criminal element is that 
their victims are hurting and the money which they earn should go 
to help those victims. Their crimes have hurt certain people. I 
would even go so far as to say that those people should not even be 
let out until they have compensated them.
<P>
	The point I am trying to make is that many of these things are a 
step in the right direction, but they do not go nearly far enough.
<P>
	While I was travelling and spending the last two years listening 
to my constituents, one of the people I talked to about the failings 
of our criminal justice system said: ``You cannot argue with these 
proposals but the Liberals do not go far enough. What are they 
afraid of? Why do they not do what is right? Why do they not fix it 
completely and not just tinker with it? Why are the  Liberals afraid 
to bring in legislation which is as tough as the people want?''
<P>
	Liberal members have to be hearing the same pleas that we 
Reformers are hearing. Why would the government not bring in 
legislation which would make these people happy? Why would the 
Liberal government not bring in legislation that would get really 
tough on criminals? All the government has to do is do what the 
people are asking.
<P>
	Here are some of the things they are telling me about the 
criminal justice system and what should be in the bill: Force these 
criminals to compensate their victims for the loss and suffering. I 
heard the Liberal member opposite say that it is already there. Why 
is it not happening? That is a very weak excuse for not approving 
the motion which the hon. member for Wild Rose has put forward.
<P>
	There should also be no statutory release for violent criminals 
and sex offenders. When a prisoner has breached the conditions of 
their parole or conditional release once, they should be kept in 
prison until the end of their sentence. Details of released child sex 
offenders should be accessible to all police forces in Canada. That 
should be in here.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	When prisoners receive an additional sentence while serving a 
prison term, the prisoner should serve the full term of the sentence 
remaining for the first offence and then the full term for the second 
offence. That is what people are telling us. Parole and conditional 
release should be revoked not just in the case of a conviction for 
another crime but for being suspected of another crime.
<P>
	Parole board members should be held accountable and liable for 
the mistakes they make by releasing violent criminals who then go 
on to commit violent acts. They should be held accountable.
<P>
	The number of appeals that go to the parole board by prisoners 
should be limited to no more than one appeal every two years. I 
realize that again we are taking a step in the right direction.
<P>
	Violations of prohibition orders imposed on sex offenders should 
result in an additional prison term.
<P>
	There should be automatic HIV or AIDS tests for all prisoners 
and all sex offenders. When I visited the prison in Prince Albert 
this summer I was appalled that these people did not have to submit 
to these tests. Prisoners should lose some of their rights. They 
should have to compensate their victims. They should not be 
putting other people in prison at risk because they will not submit 
to HIV tests.
<P>
	Bad behaviour in prison should result in extended sentences or 
even corporal punishment. The guard that I talked to said this 
should happen. Otherwise what can be done with them is very 
ineffective. Corporal punishment  should be reintroduced for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14660"> 14660 </A></B>
<P>
prisoners who misbehave. They were saying to bring back the 
paddle.
<P>
	I should like to give a case study on how the corrections system 
fails us. In June a person sent me a copy of a warning bulletin 
issued by the Metropolitan Toronto Police which reported the 
release of an habitual criminal from prison. The person had a 
record of over 100 criminal convictions, was a known member of a 
motorcycle club, was known to be involved in the distribution of 
heroin, and was considered by his case management team as a high 
risk to reoffend. The warning to police officers was as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Warning! Subject is extremely violent and should be approached with 
caution! Any police contact whatsoever with the above named individual 
should be reported immediately to the reporting centre.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Canadians will find it incomprehensible that the National Parole 
Board let this guy out of prison. The solicitor general explained it 
this way:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In light of these legislative provisions, it was determined that this person did 
not meet the criteria for detention.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If this hardened criminal considered by his case management 
team as a high risk to reoffend and known to be extremely violent 
could not be kept in prison because of legislative provisions, who 
can be kept in jail? The people of Canada are demanding that this 
law be changed and changed now.
<P>
	The solicitor general admitted the failure of the corrections and 
parole legislation and system by reporting that this dangerous drug 
trafficker had committed further crimes while on conditional 
release and that he had been arrested by police. There is no excuse 
for such legislative and bureaucratic incompetence. If the Liberals 
cannot fix it then Canadians will know which party to put in power 
that can fix it.
<P>
	The Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> reported on August 19 the victim impact 
statements of two Ottawa city police who were shot during an 
armed robbery attempt. One of the officers had this to say during 
the sentencing of the man convicted of attempting to murder him:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I will never understand why a prisoner has to be statutorily released before 
completing their sentence when we have a parole system to decide if they are 
worthy of early release. Had these individuals served their full time for previous 
crimes they would not have been able to do this.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Maybe criminals should not be released until their victims have 
been fully compensated, until their victims have healed. It may 
make them think twice about what they are doing.
<P>
	Frankly I just do not understand. No one I talked to can 
understand it either. The time to change is now. I appeal to Liberal 
members opposite and to the Bloc to support the proposed 
amendment that victims be compensated by the criminals for the 
crimes they have  committed. I would like to see some real 
democracy in this place.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to see some members opposite listening to the 
debate, listening to the arguments, judging for themselves, asking 
their constituents what they think about the amendment, and then 
voting accordingly. That is what should be happening and that is 
why I am making a speech saying that we do not go far enough in 
the House in fixing what is broke with the criminal justice system.
<P>
	I was sent to Ottawa to be the voice of my constituents. If I voted 
for this bill I could not go back home and look my constituents in 
the eye. They demand better from me, and I suspect the Liberal 
members across the floor are being told the same thing.
<P>
	I appeal to the House to support the amendment that would 
require criminals to compensate their victims more fully.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak to Bill C-45, an omnibus bill which amends the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act, the Criminal Code, the Criminal 
Records Act, the Prisons and Reformatories Act and the Transfer of 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	I am pleased to support the amendment put forward by the hon. 
member for Wild Rose. It deals with placing responsibility and 
accountability for crime on the criminal, something which is sorely 
lacking in our justice system.
<P>
	We are debating the bill as a result of Reform's focus on law and 
order and our belief and the belief of millions of Canadians we 
have received this message from that the rights of Canadians 
should be put first before those of the criminals.
<P>
	The bill is not the government's idea. It borrowed the bill from 
the previous government and even watered it down somewhat. It 
contains some provisions that will help strengthen the justice 
system, for example the detention of offenders who commit sexual 
offences against children. However this provision does not go far 
enough. Why should offenders who commit sexual offences against 
women or even men be exempted from full term or continued 
detention? Are these not considered serious offences?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are back to where we were a few 
minutes ago, that is speaking of Bill C-45 in general and not at all 
of Motion No. 1 which we have before us and which actually deals 
with inmates' income and the percentage that victims should 
receive.
<P>
	This is not at all what the hon. member is in the process of 
speaking to us about. He is speaking of the bill in general. This is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14661"> 14661 </A></B>
<P>
not the stage to be doing that, I  believe. That is why I wished to 
draw your attention to this matter.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> I thank the hon. member for 
Saint-Hubert. I am counting on the member for Vegreville to 
restrict his remarks to the motion before us at this time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. This is the 
second time the member has risen to make the same point.
<P>
	I have sat in the House for two years now and have heard a lot of 
debate and comments on each issue. I believe it is in Your Honour's 
power to direct members on how close they have to stick to the 
exact meaning of a bill or an amendment. I have heard a lot of 
members stray. I cannot recall which speech but perhaps the 
member herself strayed sometimes to make a point, to get to a 
certain issue in a roundabout way. I think members are allowed to 
have that flexibility.
<P>
	To continue to rise and object like this I do not think is in good 
taste. I feel members should be able to make their points. It is an 
important issue. It is something that is affecting the lives of victims 
of crime. I believe that you should allow-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Calgary Centre and 
other members will appreciate there is a standing order that 
requires members to be relevant to the matter before the House.
<P>
	Most people would say that rule is observed more in the breach 
than in the observation of it. When we come to the report stage and 
we are dealing with specific motions I hope my friend would agree 
with me it is more important than in other stages that members try 
to speak to the debate.
<P>
	I am sure the next remarks of the hon. member for Vegreville 
will relate directly to the motion before the House.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, not only is that opposition party trying 
to take Quebec out of Canada but it is also disrupting the House, 
and I see no need for it.
<P>
	I referred to the amendment of the hon. member for Wild Rose, 
the amendment we are debating today. It is absolutely and totally 
unjustified that the member from the Bloc would interrupt me after 
I made the connection.
<P>
	The amendment of the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine which we will be debating 
later calls for full term detention for those convicted of sexual 
offences against children because serious harm is understood. For 
all other cases serious harm must be proved in court. It is time 
serious harm is understood for more of these serious crimes.
<P>
	I fully support the amendment of the member for Wild Rose. His 
amendment will put some of the much needed common sense, 
accountability and responsibility back into our justice system. His 
amendment takes into account the rights of the victim, an 
individual who is all too often forgotten in our so-called justice 
system.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes that the rights of victims instead of 
the rights of criminals must receive the highest priority in our 
justice system. When the rights of the victim and the rights of the 
criminal are in conflict, the rights of the victim must in all cases be 
given the highest priority.
<P>
	The amendment calls for the offender to pay 30 per cent of his or 
her income as restitution or for psychological counselling for the 
victim of a sexual assault, aggravated assault or sexual assault with 
a weapon. This common sense puts some responsibility where it 
belongs, with the offender. Thinking about this amendment, I 
wonder why on earth the offender even gets a salary in the first 
place.
<P>
	When we talk about common sense and accountability in our 
justice system, I am reminded of an interesting editorial written by 
Ted Byfield in the September 11 issue of the Alberta <I>Report</I> 
entitled ``Memo to Allan Rock: Please check out what's going on in 
New York City''. The editorial deals with the opposing concepts of 
the root cause of crime. I quote from it because it sums up the 
Liberal philosophy and shows why our justice system is in such a 
mess. The editorial discussed effective deterrents to crime as does 
the hon. member's amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Back in the '60s our sociological experts made an amazing discovery. Crime, 
they found, is caused by poverty and social circumstance. Criminals are 
therefore not responsible for what they do; ``society'' is responsible. Any 
notion of ``blame'' for a crime was thereafter reflected, or at any rate, any 
blaming of criminals. The idea of ``punishment'' was summarily jettisoned. 
Crime called for counselling, understanding, sympathy, not punishment. No 
longer must we think primarily of protecting the public from the criminal; we 
must protect the criminal from the public.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This type of thinking has been the theme of the politically 
correct and is still held by the Liberal government as it was held by 
the Conservatives and the NDP before.
<P>
	Mr. Byfield went on to explain that this type of thinking has 
placed us in the mess we find ourselves in today. He cited the 
experience of William J. Bratton, a former police office who was 
the security director for the New York subway system and is now 
the police commissioner of New York City. Mr. Bratton took the 
advice of two rogue criminologists who advocated cracking down 
on petty crimes because it would send a firm message on what kind 
of behaviour would and would not be tolerated.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14662"> 14662 </A></B>
<P>
	When Mr. Bratton was the security director for the subway 
system he began cracking down on so-called petty crimes like 
graffiti and panhandling. The incidence of crime on the subway 
fell almost immediately.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	After five years, Mr. Byfield writes, serious felonies fell by 64 
per cent and robberies by 75 per cent.
<P>
	By giving harsh punishments for serious crimes, this also sends a 
message to criminals that serious crimes will be met with serious 
punishments. This is the theme the hon. member for Wild Rose 
carries into his amendment.
<P>
	Mr. Bratton continued this policy as police commissioner and 
the city experienced very similar results. The drop in crime has 
been very dramatic. Yet as Mr. Byfield explains, the criminologists 
were not pleased with the results. In the words of one criminologist 
it would verify the contention that crime is somehow a voluntary 
activity, that crime does not represent in any way the drives and 
forces and compulsions that are beyond the individual's control.
<P>
	This is a quote from a criminologist speaking out against the 
view that we should be tough on crime. To repeat, in the words of 
this criminologist, being tough on crime would, with the results 
found in New York City, in the subway system and later in the city, 
verify the contention that crime is somehow a voluntary activity, 
that crime does not represent in any way the drives and forces and 
compulsions that are beyond the individual's control.
<P>
	This reminds me of the Liberal idea that crime is motivated by 
poverty and other socioeconomic factors; society is at fault, the 
criminal is not responsible for his or her actions. On the other hand, 
Commissioner Bratton's view about the root cause of crime is very 
simple. Mr. Byfield believes the root cause of crime is criminals. I 
agree with him, although I recognize there are individuals who 
have experienced abuse and neglect which may lead them toward a 
life of crime.
<P>
	However, ultimately it is their own conscious decision to commit 
a crime. It is within the limits of our self-control to choose not to 
commit a crime. The choice is made by each one of us, every day, 
and each one of us should be held accountable for our actions and 
decisions. The law must be changed to recognize this, that each 
individual has the freedom of choice when it comes to committing 
crime.
<P>
	As a result of the focus on the rehabilitation of criminals instead 
of protection of law-abiding citizens, our society is living in fear of 
criminals.
<P>
	If we are looking to point a finger of blame for the breakdown of 
our justice system, or maybe it should be more accurately called 
our legal system, we could point to a lot of people. When looking at 
our law makers, members of Parliament who have sat in the House, 
we can point to all of those members who have supported 
legislation based on the politically correct but incorrect assumption 
that the cause of crime is anything but the criminal and that the 
criminal somehow does not have the power to choose not to 
commit a crime.
<P>
	If I were to pick a pivotal time and a pivotal statement, I would 
look to a former Liberal solicitor general, I believe in 1972, Jean 
Goyer, who consciously changed the focus of our justice system 
from a top priority of the right of citizens to feel safe and be safe 
and the rights of the victim to a new focus in which the rights of the 
criminal and rehabilitation of criminals were given top priority.
<P>
	This is a sad commentary not only on the Liberal government of 
the time but on all governments since that time. I believe it is time 
now for a political party that is willing to change the focus back to 
the right of citizens to feel safe and to be safe to take control.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	If the government does not do what Canadians want and if it 
refuses to change the focus back to what it was before the Trudeau 
government, we will be the government that will make this change. 
It will happen sooner than most of the members across the floor 
would like to believe.
<P>
	I support fully the amendment of the hon. member for Wild 
Rose.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 
38 to inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment is the hon. member for 
Frontenac-Agriculture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is not my intention to take an undue amount of time in the 
Chamber this afternoon. However, there are two or three thoughts 
in my mind I would like to express to the members present.
<P>
	There is an amazing paradox I would like to address for a 
moment. In an age when so many people benefit by proclaiming 
themselves to be victims of the system, victims of misfortune 
within their families and victims of circumstances, people who are 
victims caused by circumstances completely beyond their control, 
caused by the criminal activity of others, are almost if not totally 
ignored by the state and by their community.
<P>
	People who have suffered enormous loss of property, health, 
vitality and life within themselves or of family members, which 
leaves them grieving for the rest of their lives, are given no credible 
attention. They are given no opportunity to express their loss. They 
are given no opportunity to recover from that loss. No one seems to 
be responsible for them. They are left to their own resources.
<P>
	The attitude of some members of the House really startles me; an 
attitude of impatience as we talk about the  victims who suffer the 
losses we all know about. The attitude in the House reminds me of 
a ruling class that does not care about what is happening to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14663"> 14663 </A></B>
<P>
hurting of the people in our communities. I find that attitude 
deplorable.
<P>
	When hear the parliamentary secretary to the solicitor general 
say it would be too cumbersome, too problematic for some 
department of the government such as the parole board to figure 
out what compensation might be, I consider this to be nothing more 
than a lame excuse, not taking seriously the suffering of people 
who had this brought on them through no fault of their own.
<P>
	There seems to be an attitude that those who commit crimes have 
no responsibility to the victims. They may be called to account by 
the courts but for the damage, the suffering, the hurt and the loss 
they have caused they have no responsibility.
<P>
	We live in an era when we talk about people not being able to 
protect themselves; this is the job of the police. The consequence of 
that in rural areas like mine is that people are left defenceless if 
they keep the law. Yet when they become victims of this foolish 
notion there is no recourse for them. They are left to their own 
resources.
<P>
	Until we as a nation of individuals are called to be accountable 
and responsible for what we do, what we do to other people 
particularly, we can see there is no motivation to care about what 
happens as a result of our misdeeds, of the crimes committed.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	I call on the House to think about what responsibility means, to 
encourage our citizens as well as ourselves to be responsible in the 
small things certainly but in the large things as well.
<P>
	I support this amendment because I believe those who commit 
horrible things and do irreparable damage and who cause victims 
should be responsible to those victims for the rest of their lives 
until those victims are on their feet or have regained what they have 
lost.
<P>
	Let us in the Chamber be responsible. Let us be concerned about 
the victims in our communities. This is not an idle thought that has 
simply come to my mind. I as the member representing 
Cariboo-Chilcotin and Reform members are trying to represent 
the thoughts of our constituents who are saying give the victim a 
break. Give the real victim a break for a change. Take them into 
consideration when they have suffered loss and hurt. Simply wash 
the idea away that the criminal is the victim because the criminal is 
the one who has known what is right from wrong from the 
beginning and who chose to do the wrong thing. Make that person 
responsible. Give the victim the break.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I assure my hon. colleagues from the Bloc and from the 
Liberal side that I probably will refer  to Motion No. 1 no less than 
eight or nine times during my speech. I am sure the hon. member 
will be checking that.
<P>
	I am pleased to address Motion No. 1 to Bill C-45. The motion 
put forward by my colleague from Wild Rose deals with clause 25 
of the bill. We find in the bill clause 21 in its current form that 
would see deductions from the pay cheques of inmates who are 
involved in work programs within our prisons, deductions to go 
back to the prisons to pay for their room, board, clothing and things 
like that.
<P>
	Like my hon. friend from Vegreville, I find it astounding, as I am 
sure do many Canadians who probably do not know about it today, 
that we are paying prisoners at all in our prisons. If someone 
commits a crime in Canada they are sent to prison as a punishment, 
although not for long enough, and now many Canadians will be 
astounded to find out they are actually getting paid.
<P>
	The first thing that comes to my mind is whether this could 
possibly be another Liberal job creation program. The Liberals talk 
about their duty to create jobs. The Prime Minister has said they 
will give jobs, jobs, jobs. Now we find out our prisoners are getting 
paid. I did not know until today. The first thing I thought of was 
Liberal job creation. Now I understand. I find it unbelievable that 
prisoners are having a Canada pension plan. Are they having 
unemployment insurance deductions paid for them as well?
<P>
	The main part of this is that they are being paid at all. Thirty per 
cent of their pay is being deducted and going back to the prisons. 
Nowhere in the bill can I see a significant acknowledgement as far 
as compensation to the victims of crime.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague from Wild Rose stated in his motion, the 
least the government can do is recognize the victims in a 
meaningful way. The amendment put forward by the hon. member 
for Wild Rose would deal with that 30 per cent. I would rather my 
colleague had put 100 per cent in his amendment. One hundred per 
cent of anything paid to a prisoner should go to the victim of the 
crime that prisoner committed. I would have been happier with that 
than 30 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	I would like to address the principle of the amendment. It is an 
amendment which would recognize compensation for the help 
which many victims have to obtain at their own expense following 
a crime. In the event that the victim of a crime has died, there 
should surely be compensation to the family to help them get over 
the trauma.
<P>
	Motion No. 1 would see the clause amended so that the 30 per 
cent deduction would be redirected toward the victims. This is very 
important since we have seen that the bill does not effectively 
address the rights of victims.  Motion No. 1 would see the 30 per 
cent turned directly over to the victim or the family of the victim 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14664"> 14664 </A></B>
<P>
should he or she be killed or the family is left in a difficult financial 
situation as a result of the offence.
<P>
	Every day all across the country millions and millions of 
Canadians are crying out for justice. Every day across the country 
hundreds of thousands of victims of crime are left having to 
compensate themselves in some way for what has been taken away 
from them by a criminal act. Sadly, all across the country there are 
victims of crime who have died. They cannot cry out any more for 
compensation for the death which was caused by the crime. Their 
families are left to cry out for them and indeed they are crying out.
<P>
	The government had an opportunity to do something about this 
situation but it has not in the bill. This is typical of the way Liberals 
deal with the criminal justice system.
<P>
	It is always the victim who is left out when it comes to reforms 
to the Criminal Code, the Corrections Act or the Conditional 
Release Act. The Reform Party has said for years that the 
obligation of a government in formulating and creating a criminal 
justice system which works is to have as the number one priority of 
the criminal justice system the protection of society and indeed the 
protection and care of the victims of crime. In this country the 
number one priority of the criminal justice system is to look after 
the criminals, to look after the perpetrators of crime.
<P>
	At one time we did have a criminal justice system. We had it 
until Mr. Trudeau and his Liberals came into the House. They 
thought they would rearrange things to make it a more just system. 
Just for whom? Just for the criminals. In this country when 
criminals need a friend they call a Liberal. That is the way it has 
been for more than 25 years. Those colleagues who sit on the 
opposite side of the House know it. There are many lawyers over 
there. They know it. They know what the criminal justice system is 
all about. They know it is made for the legal system.
<P>
	Every once in a while a government gets a chance to do 
something about the criminal justice system and in this case a 
chance to address the victims of crime. Because of their 
weak-kneed, bleeding heart philosophy the Liberals do not have the 
guts to turn away from the Trudeauism which has been instilled in 
that party for the last 30 years. We have heard from the gutless 
wonders across the way.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	Our policy on victims' rights has been clear from the very 
beginning. As I mentioned earlier Reformers have always stated 
that victims should be compensated for the crimes committed 
against them. We have even extended this principle into the stand 
we have taken on the Young Offenders Act. We have also argued 
that the Young  Offenders Act should include the payment of some 
form of restitution to victims. The Liberals have not heard this 
because in their opinion someone who commits a crime is not 
really to blame because it is society that made them that way. In the 
Liberals' minds individuals are not responsible for the criminal 
acts they commit because society has made them that way.
<P>
	That is why we see our justice system in a complete shambles. 
We see serious criminals being let out on early parole. We see 
reoffence after reoffence because of the justice system members of 
this Liberal Party and the Liberals here before them chose to run 
with. They have ignored the cries of millions of Canadians. They 
are ignoring the cries of the victims of crime across this country.
<P>
	As we talk about amending clause 21 in Motion No. 1 Liberals 
are making jest of it. They are making jest of the fact that our party 
believes that victims of crime deserve recognition and 
compensation. The very idea that they make jest of our motion 
which was put forward in a most sincere fashion to try to establish a 
form of compensation for victims of crime is an insult to the 
victims of crime. They should be ashamed of themselves.
<P>
	As I have said before there are many lawyers in that party. In 
their real lives they dealt with crime on a daily basis. They have 
seen the victims of crime. They know what we are talking about but 
because their philosophy leans more toward the rights of the 
criminal than the victim they make jest of our motion.
<P>
	I have no problem whatsoever in recognizing the many victims 
of crime, the people who become victims of crime on a daily basis. 
We ask that all members support Motion No. 1 which deals with 
clause 21 in Bill C-45.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on Bill C-45, amendments 
to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act but it is also a 
disappointment. Once again we see another bill that shows the 
government is engaging in its usual modus operandi which is to do 
window dressing.
<P>
	As I spoke about yesterday this bill can be viewed as a metaphor 
for governments not only here but in other parts of the world. There 
is one thing I have discovered since being in this House. When we 
have a problem do we address the problem? Do we find the best 
solutions in the country, apply them to that problem and implement 
those solutions if only on a pilot project? The answer is no. We 
nibble around the outside of the problem and make it look like we 
are actually doing something. We study it, examine it, report on it 
but do we truly act on it? No we do not.
<P>
	The reason governments do not act on the problem is they are 
afraid of rocking the boat and incurring the wrath of usually a 
minority within the country. It is a shame and a disservice to every 
Canadian that we are engaging continually in this behaviour.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14665"> 14665 </A></B>
<P>
	I would say to the government that you would win enormous 
points in the public's favour if you were truly to address the 
problems that affect us-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. member to please 
put his remarks to the Chair rather than using that horrible word 
you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
apologies, it is early on in the year.
<P>
	The amendment to clause 21 in Bill C-45 which we wish to put 
forward addresses the victims of crime. It ensures that they truly 
have a legal standing within the system. It is unfortunate that this 
bill does not truly do that.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	We want to give this bill teeth. We want to make sure that this 
bill has action, that it is going to actually address the problem. 
Therefore my colleague has put this amendment that would enable 
victims to have 30 per cent of whatever moneys the offender earns 
during incarceration. Those moneys would be applied to the victim.
<P>
	Personally I find that insufficient. The moneys that should be 
applied which are earned by an individual who is 
incarcerated-and personally I find it amazing that they are 
actually earning anything at all-should go to two areas: one, the 
victim and two, the state, to provide restitution to the state for 
moneys that are spent by the state to incarcerate that individual.
<P>
	The public might be appalled to find out that for adults 
incarcerated in a federal institution it will cost $60,000 to $70,000 
per person per year. If it is a young offender that number jumps to 
$90,000 per young offender per year. Why should the public pay 
for that?
<P>
	Here we have a solution which our party has put forward, that 
those moneys can be used for the victim. I believe other moneys 
should be used to be applied to the costs incurred by that individual 
being incarcerated.
<P>
	When I worked as a physician and as a correctional officer in 
prisons, I found it absolutely appalling how the system failed in so 
many areas. It failed to prevent crimes from occurring. It failed in 
the restitution to the state and the restitution to the victim. It failed 
also in imparting to criminals that with their actions there is a 
responsibility for those actions. If a person is willing to commit a 
crime, no matter what their background is their past history does 
not exonerate them from the actions they have taken. The action 
they have taken almost always produces a victim.
<P>
	That is why we are putting the amendments forth in this clause. 
It is to ensure those forgotten victims are achieving restitution, 
which I am sure in 95 per cent of the cases will be insufficient, to 
provide for the counselling, the loss of income, the hurt, the pain 
that  those victims have endured through no fault of their own 
whatsoever.
<P>
	There are other things I would like to say with respect to failures 
of the justice system in this narrow area we are speaking about. 
One thing I did see is there are very few disincentives to crime. 
When I worked in the jails, time after time I saw repeat offenders 
coming in who have shown and continue to show a wilful 
disrespect for society and for their victims.
<P>
	That is why we are putting this amendment forward. In a society 
where being a victim is in vogue, and I say victim in parenthesis, 
the true victims we have in our society, the victims of criminal acts 
of others, are indeed being forgotten.
<P>
	I will give a simple case. A young boy in my riding who was 
about 11 or 12 years old, disabled and wore a brace was sexually 
abused by an older teenager. After all was said and done and the 
conviction went through, the older teenager who had committed 
these offences received an amount three times as much as the 
victim received. In fact the victim did not even have enough money 
to afford the counselling he required.
<P>
	What does that say about our system? I did not have anything to 
say to the mother who came to my office because I was appalled 
and ashamed that we allow this to happen in this country.
<P>
	It is true that many people who do commit acts of crime are 
indeed victims on their own. That though is a different topic. We 
are talking about the victims of those crimes. Again we must 
ensure that those victims' rights are held in the highest form over 
and beyond those of the criminals. Criminals do have rights, yes, 
but in balancing those off with the victims it is important to realize 
that it is the victims' rights that should be held in the highest 
esteem.
<P>
	There are other things that we are not able to do, that is, 
preventing crimes before they happen, identifying the persons who 
commit crimes and doing something about that.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	I strongly implore the Minister of Justice to work with his 
counterparts in the provinces to look at interventions that can be 
made at a very early age. The pillars of a normal psyche are 
developed in the first seven years of life. It is imperative that if 
down the line we are to reduce the incidence of criminal activity we 
address the children who are at risk of not developing those pillars 
of a normal psyche.
<P>
	A lot has to do with the socioeconomic and family milieu these 
children tragically endure. Some of them go on to a life of crime 
and then there is a duality of innocent people being victimized and 
the criminals who if they had been caught at an early age perhaps 
would not have engaged in criminal behaviour. I encourage the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14666"> 14666 </A></B>
<P>
hon. minister to please look at this. We could be very forwarding 
looking with this.
<P>
	I draw attention to a private members' bill by my colleague to 
address a very important aspect of those individuals who when they 
are to be released from prison are known dangerous offenders in 
society. We must have the power within our justice system to 
incarcerate individuals beyond their length of sentence if at the 
time of their discharge they are proven to be a significant threat to 
society.
<P>
	I encourage all members to support that bill. It is in the interest 
of public safety and all Canadians. I hope members will support my 
colleague's clause which will ensure victims receive the restitution 
they so justly deserve.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Motion No. 1 of Bill C-45 today.
<P>
	Bill C-45 amends a series of acts which deals with all types of 
offences and the release of offenders from incarceration. There are 
26 amendments proposed to the bill which members of the House 
will address over the next few days. Today we are debating Motion 
No. 1 brought forward by my colleague, the member for Wild 
Rose.
<P>
	The bill has many shortcomings. One way to rectify this would 
be to address the concerns of Canadians. The one I must stress is 
the one I hear from my constituents and other Canadians: the 
victims are forgotten. There is no greater threat to the faith 
Canadians have in their justice system than the belief many have 
that criminals have more rights than the victims.
<P>
	In the aftermath of a terrible crime it is the victims who must 
pick up the pieces of their shattered lives and move on. The impact 
of a crime committed against them is immense. It covers every 
aspect of their life. There is the emotional toll, the physical toll and 
the economic toll. Motion No. 1 attempts to address some of these 
concerns.
<P>
	Simply put, the motion calls for amendment to clause 21 of the 
bill so that 30 per cent of the income an inmate earns goes to the 
victim or the victim's family. It is a simple concept that calls for 
the offender to pay some sort of restitution for the crime he or she 
has committed. If criminals had to pay 30 per cent of their income 
to the victims it would make a connection to the criminals that they 
have to pay in two ways for their crime, through incarceration and 
financially.
<P>
	In my community of Maple Ridge there is a youth and justice 
advocacy committee. It is patterned after a program that has 
existed in the United States for some years. It deals with first time 
young offenders. It requires them to make some restitution for their 
crimes. In these cases they are not violent young offenders, not 
using guns, they are first time offenders, stealing cars and so  on. 
There is a volunteer group in my community that meets once a 
week with the young offender who has to also be present with a 
guardian or a parent. The young offender is given a job and the 
minimum wage earned from that job goes to the victims. It has 
been very successful in the United States with an over 90 per cent 
success rate. In my community it has be operating for only a year 
but it is having a phenomenal amount of success.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	In order for the impact to get to criminals on what they have 
done, whether they are young offenders or not, they have to 
somehow pay for their crimes. A financial payment always hits 
home.
<P>
	In the more serious ones which we are talking about now, Motion 
No. 1 in Bill C-45, the criminal would have to make that financial 
payment to the victim. Victims would finally be getting some kind 
of recognition. That is very important.
<P>
	In the case of sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault or sexual 
assault with a weapon, the victim can request that 30 per cent of the 
offender's earnings would help pay for treatment for the victim. I 
think members on both sides of the House can appreciate the long 
and painful recovery process from such an assault. Therapy can 
take years and it can be costly. We believe criminals convicted of 
the crime should help pay for the victim's restoration.
<P>
	I urge members on both sides of the House to support this motion 
because it will send a message to Canadians that the victims of 
crime do count and that they are not ignored.
<P>
	Every day Canadians are feeling let down by the justice system. 
They feel it is too lenient on the criminal and not enough emphasis 
is placed on the victim. This motion would send a powerful 
message to the victims that their concerns do count.
<P>
	Accepting this motion would also help strike a balance with a 
provision in the bill that calls for the treatment of sexual offenders. 
It seems treating an offender to lessen if not eliminate the 
possibility of repeat offending is a good idea. However, it should 
not come at the expense of treating the victim. If funding for 
treatment or facilities is lacking the victims should receive priority.
<P>
	The Liberal government always mentions the provisions for 
offenders to be kept beyond their treatment date. Let those 
provisions be implemented if there is a likelihood the offender will 
reoffend. As it stands now section 21 of the bill calls for 30 per cent 
of the offender's earnings to go toward paying Corrections Canada 
room and board.
<P>
	In short, the government wants the criminal to help pay for his or 
her stay in jail. This is a good idea but we in the Reform Party 
believe the welfare of the victim is  simply too important to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14667"> 14667 </A></B>
<P>
forgotten. There is no reason here for the government to reward 
itself over the well-being of the victim.
<P>
	The amendment proposed by the member for Wild Rose is an 
important step to show Canadians the justice system and we as 
parliamentarians can and will respond to their needs. I urge 
members on the government side of the House to support this 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will give the House a bit of history about why this 30 per cent for 
room and board is in Bill C-45.
<P>
	About two years ago, shortly after the election, I found out 
prisoners in Canada were receiving certain payments. I asked the 
solicitor general why they were receiving those payments. His 
comment was to acknowledge it. He said that in his bill coming 
forward to the people of Canada he would address that. How he 
addressed it was to take 30 per cent out for room and board.
<P>
	If we address a problem with an answer of 30 per cent I suggest 
that 70 per cent is wrong. He has left out 70 per cent. Our 
amendment is light. Although I am in favour of it, I wish our 
member for Wild Rose had put a higher percentage in it.
<P>
	I will give 21 reasons why it is light. These 21 reasons are 
benefits, things given to inmates in our prisons. I have spent a lot of 
time going through prisons, at parole boards, at hearings and so on.
<P>
	Inmates today receive a room. It is not much of a room but it is 
paid for by the taxpayer. They get meals. Check the menu 
sometime. The Liberals should go to some of the institutions and 
check what is on the menus. They would say it is not bad for people 
incarcerated for various crimes, and it is paid for by the taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	They get counselling. They should have counselling. After all, if 
they are to come out we should do something to improve on what 
went in. That is paid for by the taxpayers. They get education. 
Good old Karla Homolka has her education paid for by the 
taxpayer. They get their clothing, and it is not bad clothing, paid for 
by the taxpayer.
<P>
	Let us get into some other things they get in our prisons courtesy 
of the government. They get the right to refuse work. In our prisons 
today if a prisoner does not want to work he says no. That is not 
bad. Most of us on the outside have to work.
<P>
	They have access to legal aid. How many know Clifford Olson 
has about 30 litigation cases before the federal government today? 
The federal government tried to stop him by filing litigation to stop 
him from filing litigation. Talk about a government that has gone 
weird.
<P>
	They get legal aid. You ought to see the lawyers inside those 
prisons, standing there saying: ``You need my help''.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Perhaps the hon. member was not here 
earlier when a colleague used the word ``you''. I know we are all 
back at school, but I ask the hon. member to refer to the Chair if the 
word ``you'' is being used.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was using the 
word ``you'' in a different context. If I want to refer to the people 
who should be listening, I will say Liberals or government.
<P>
	If a prisoner is incarcerated for less than two years in this 
country they can vote in British Columbia. Who has a litigation 
case before the crown that if they are in excess of two years in a 
federal penitentiary they will be able to vote? Yes, the inmates. I 
suppose they will get that. Next the Liberals will be in the 
institutions looking for the vote from the very people they gave it 
to.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They will parole people to run.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Let us talk about the money 
inmates get in prisons. GST rebates, congratulations. They get old 
age security. They get the Canada pension plan. They get the 
guaranteed income supplement because they do not make enough 
money with old age security. They do get medical but you and you 
out there have to pay for it.
<P>
	They get dental coverage. How many people have to pay for 
dental work?
<P>
	The government is asking for 30 per cent of their income.
<P>
	Let us not forget about the free condoms. Let us not forget they 
can grieve virtually anything they wish. In the observations I made 
last year there were in excess of 3,200 grievances by inmates in the 
Atlantic region and in the western region. When they file a 
grievance there must be a grievance committee assembled of 
staffers and inmates, the chairman of which may be an inmate. 
Congratulations.
<P>
	How many people know about project bleach? That is where we 
give them a one ounce bottle of bleach to sterilize their needles for 
cocaine intake. Congratulations, Liberals.
<P>
	This must have been a mistake, but I found that several inmates 
last year were getting UIC cheques when in federal penitentiaries 
in excess of two years. The problem was their stupidity because 
they usually mail them to an address outside the penitentiary where 
nobody can find it. These guys did not think. They sent it to the 
prison and got it from there.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	Let us not forget subsidized cigarettes. From a study we did last 
year we found that cigarettes are cheaper  inside penitentiaries. The 
difference between the cost of cigarettes inside a prison and in a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14668"> 14668 </A></B>
<P>
store on the outside is anywhere from 42 cents a pack to $1.62 a 
pack. I have had many people say that is not subsidization. 
However, when we checked with the solicitor general's department 
we found the reason they are cheaper by and large is because they 
are bought in bulk by government employees, they are stored or 
warehoused by government employees and delivered back to the 
prison by government employees. But that is not subsidization; that 
is a service provided to the penitentiary.
<P>
	Last but not least, let us not forget number 21. Ferndale 
penitentiary has one of the best nine-hole golf courses in Canada on 
their grounds. Yes, indeed.
<P>
	When the people on the outside think about all this, they wonder 
what the hell is going on in this country. When it comes down to us 
removing 30 per cent, I say that is small in proportion to what they 
get, compared to what our senior citizens in this country get from 
government. I say we should take the vast majority of that money 
to provide restitution to the victims. Or we should make them pay 
for golf. Let them buy their own darn golf balls.
<P>
	Enough is enough. This Liberal government does not listen. This 
Liberal government is at fault for most of these 21 reasons. It is 
time this changed.
<P>
	The victims in this system are virtually left on their own. I have 
gone through this with victim after victim. I want to provide one 
short case of some victims.
<P>
	There is a fellow in this country by the name of Wayne Perkins. 
Good old Wayne was in my riding. He got a young lady, 
encouraged her to go into a little building in her backyard. Once he 
got her in there he beat her over the head with a hammer, taped her 
hands behind her back, injected her with cocaine and raped her. He 
was sentenced a meagre six years. That good old parole board let 
him out shortly after three years.
<P>
	What did he do while he was on parole? This is where Angela 
Richards comes in. Innocent Angela Richards was stabbed to death. 
She was stabbed 21 times, injected with cocaine. There was the 
same MO as before. I looked at the parole report, which was 
disgusting. It said this guy was perhaps coming along.
<P>
	To this day I often wonder. When I was sitting in that sentencing 
hearing I thought there was something missing in the room. It was 
the parole board that should have been sitting there with the other 
50 of us crying and wondering what the heck happened. There is 
more to life than criminals in this country. We have to stop giving 
them a higher priority than the victims.
<P>
	It is hard to believe that in this country a victim cannot even go 
into a parole hearing and give a verbal response to why a person 
should or should not get out of prison. It is truly hard to believe 
why a victim in this country is  not advised at all times where a 
parolee is, if they want to know.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I know. It is not the Liberal way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> That is right, it is not the 
Liberal way. Bonnie Lucas in my riding found that out when her 
estranged husband went to her house, burned it down while they 
were sleeping, and she just got her two kids and herself out. The 
guy goes into the pen. She asks the parole board to tell her where he 
is, if it ever lets him out, in case he comes back, and it will not do it. 
Once again the victim is ignored in favour of the criminal. It is 
wrong, wrong, wrong. Wake up over there and do something about 
it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
compliment the previous speaker for revealing some of the aspects 
of our prison system that perhaps a lot of the Liberal members on 
the other side are not aware of. Now, having been made aware of 
that, they would appreciate what we are attempting to do here by 
making amendments to Bill C-45, which is an act to amend the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act, the Criminal Code, the 
Criminal Records Act, the Prisons and Reformatories Act, and the 
Transfer of Offenders Act.
<P>
	The first amendment that is being put forth by my colleague 
from Wild Rose is an amendment that will require offenders to pay 
restitution to the victim of an offence committed by the offender or 
to the family of the victim where the victim is killed or is unable to 
manage his or her financial affairs as a result of the offence. We are 
recommending 30 per cent of the gross of the prisoners' salaries be 
put into this type of an account.
<P>
	As my colleague from Fraser Valley West suggested, perhaps 
that is too low. I agree. I feel that for too long now and for too many 
years Liberal justice ministers have basically developed and 
created a system of law where the criminals have more rights than 
the victims. I know there are a lot of lawyers on the Liberal side, 
who when they are in court know that with the criminal's rights 
they have to be careful how they tread or the criminal gets off, 
whereas in the whole shuffle the victim's rights, the parents of the 
victim if there is a death, and the people who are suffering are often 
forgotten.
<P>
	The purpose of this amendment in a lot of ways is not just 30 per 
cent of $8 a day or 30 per cent of the GST rebate or 30 per cent of 
the compensation a prisoner gets. Perhaps it is something far 
beyond that. Perhaps it is something that is more symbolic and this 
is only a small step, as when they first landed on the moon: a small 
step for man but a large step for mankind. Perhaps this is a small 
step for justice but a big step for victims and victims' rights.
<P>
	It is a symbolic gesture. If something like this is ever accepted 
and Bill C-45 amended then perhaps judges in the future will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14669"> 14669 </A></B>
<P>
able to apply this principle. Future  parliamentarians will then 
perhaps be able to look for other ways to compensate the victims 
who have been slighted or hurt. Rather than the current system 
where victims have to sue in a civil case to get compensation or 
remuneration, if a criminal has any assets at all perhaps this would 
be the small step that would allow victims or families of murder 
victims to get some compensation.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I do not believe you were in the chair, but earlier 
during the debate my colleague from Wild Rose was the first 
speaker. He spoke in his usual loud and boisterous voice and I had 
to take out my earphone. I certainly heard him loud and clear when 
he was talking about a phone call he received a few months back 
that caused his heart to sadden. It was from a former student of his 
whose wife had been raped at knifepoint and the fully identified 
accused was allowed bail. He stated that his wife was on the verge 
of a nervous breakdown, knowing that the rapist was at large.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	This was not the only indignity to be experienced by this 
law-abiding woman. The constituent did not have the funds for 
counselling, treatment, or medical services that would reduce the 
trauma of the brutal assault. Yet the offender was receiving full 
funding out of taxpayers' dollars for whatever was needed.
<P>
	We hope this amendment will assist that constituent to receive 
these medical services to assist and overcome the trauma resulting 
from the brutal assault by the rapist. This amendment will make the 
offender responsible for paying some of that care.
<P>
	Perhaps it will help if offenders knew they would be deprived of 
30 per cent of the tax dollars they receive in prison. Once again, I 
like what my colleague from Fraser Valley West said: it is too low. 
Why are we being so nice? Make it higher. Make it 50 per cent; 
make it something that hurts them. They do not get much, and what 
they get they spend on items like cigarettes and other amenities that 
were described, which I find obscene. Take that 30 per cent to 50 
per cent away from them and have it go into a fund that is available 
for victims and their families. Those amenities and privileges 
offenders get they find very valuable while they are in prison. This 
means as much to them as an automobile means to somebody 
outside. Cigarettes or these other amenities become something they 
really need. Therefore, while it is not much in dollars and cents, it 
does have some value to the prisoners. As I said, it is symbolic. 
Hopefully the legal system can use this as a stepping stone.
<P>
	If they knew they had to pay a price even while they were in 
prison, while it may not prevent the crime of future perpetrators, 
perhaps it will make the criminal realize that crime just does not 
pay as much. When I heard the speech by my colleague from Fraser 
Valley West it almost sounded like some people have a better life in 
prison than out of prison.
<P>
	For too long victims of crime have been an afterthought in our 
criminal justice system. Offenders receive full legal and medical 
support without regard to the hardships victims of crime are 
experiencing. This amendment will give victims of crime some 
consideration through this criminal justice system.
<P>
	We have to start somewhere, and this is an opportunity to start, 
for the Liberal government to accept an amendment that is headed 
in the right direction. It is not huge. It is almost like we are 
recommending tinkering with the system by making such a small 
amount available to victims, as the Liberals do with the elimination 
of ferry services and with the introduction of these small taxes 
everywhere else.
<P>
	The amendment will inform those who have committed crimes 
that there is a financial price to pay to the law-abiding citizen. 
Criminals are responsible for crime, not society. The amendment 
will make criminals realize that the justice system now accepts that 
if you break the law you pay two prices. One price is incarceration 
and the other price is paying money earned in jail from taxpayers' 
dollars to the victim for compensation or needed medical 
treatment.
<P>
	For too long the government has talked about victims of crime 
but has done nothing for these victims. This is an opportunity for 
the government to put taxpayers' money where this government's 
mouth is. This is the opportunity for the government to finally do 
something meaningful for victims of crime. This is the opportunity 
for the government to really support women who have to try to live 
past a crime that has robbed these women of their peace of mind. 
This is finally an opportunity for the government to show 
Canadians that victims have rights and the government has a 
concern for victim suffering.
<P>
	Once this principle is accepted in the Criminal Code it will help 
set the ball rolling, as I mentioned earlier. If the criminal has any 
assets, this is an opportunity for victims to at least get some 
compensation for what they have had to suffer. In some way, 
somehow and some day soon we have to do something for the 
victims. Far too long, far too often and far too much at a high cost 
to taxpayers we are supporting criminals and criminal activities 
and their rights over and above victims' rights.

	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should support and work 
toward enabling legislation for a binding national referendum on capital 
punishment to be held concurrently with the next federal election.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, there are very few things in democratic 
politics that stir up more contention and trepidation than the use of 
referenda. There are very few issues in politics that stir up more 
controversy and emotion than the issue of capital punishment.
<P>
	That makes Motion No. 431 a motion with potentially 
far-reaching implications for Canadians. It combines the 
contention and trepidation associated with referenda with the 
controversy and emotion surrounding decisions about capital 
punishment.
<P>
	However it is important to stress that Motion No. 431 is not 
calling for a return of the death penalty as some critics would 
claim. Yes, the issue is contentious, but the underlying principle of 
direct democracy which led to the filing of the motion is one of the 
founding principles of the Reform Party.
<P>
	At a personal level, when I think back over the events of the last 
25 years that underlying principle is the very reason I am standing 
in the House today. It started for me as a teenager in New Zealand 
25 years ago when I worked on a campaign to help get elected an 
MP of the National Party in the Auckland area of New Zealand.
<P>
	It did not take long for my innocent 18-year old belief in 
democracy to be shattered by the realization that within a very 
short space of time party line politics and the power of a party whip 
could destroy everything that my candidate had stood for. It killed 
the fires of change burning within him. It killed his resolve. It made 
him afraid to represent the very people who had placed him in that 
predicament.
<P>
	I had a dream those 25 years ago that one day within these 
shackles we call a parliamentary democracy MPs would be free to 
represent their constituents and to invite them to help govern the 
country they work every day to support.
<P>
	I never dreamed that I would one day be one of those MPs. It was 
never my ambition to work for change from within the system. 
Somehow the pieces just came together, one at a time. I joined the 
party which in 1989 had barely begun. Yet it had the principles of 
direct democracy as a cornerstone of everything that it stood for.
<P>
	One of its first policy positions was to state that the people of 
Canada should have the right to make binding decisions through 
referenda on issues of personal conscience. Capital punishment is 
one of those issues of personal conscience and Reform policy 
material has always identified it as an issue to be put before the 
people.
<P>
	I submitted Motion No. 431 in April of this year, well before the 
controversial Bernardo and Deley cases came before the public. It 
was selected in the random drawing of Private Members' Business 
on May 29. In the first week of September I learned that it would be 
debated in the House today.
<P>
	The motion reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should support and work 
toward enabling legislation for a binding national referendum on capital 
punishment to be held concurrently with the next federal election.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Every poll taken over the last decade has shown a major 
divergence of opinion between politicians and the public on the 
issue of capital punishment. Like it or not, public pressure will 
continue to build until we address this divergence of opinion either 
by bringing Parliament into line with the public or the public into 
line with Parliament.
<P>
	Telling Canadians that they will not be allowed to decide is not 
going to make the problem go away. We need to place a clear 
question in front of them and allow them to make the final 
decision. All it takes is for us to agree to have an open and public 
debate followed by a binding referendum which will do the task of 
either bringing the public into line with Parliament or Parliament 
into line with the public.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately there is a small problem standing in the way of 
implementation. Motion No. 431 is not presently votable, which 
means that the House cannot make its intention clear to the 
government. Without a vote we will be failing in our duty to 
represent the people who sent us here. For this reason, before 
continuing I would like to ask the consent of the House to make the 
motion votable.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has asked for the 
consent of members to make the matter votable. He will know as 
well as anyone that it requires unanimous consent. Is there 
unanimous consent by the members present to make it a votable 
motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Having hear some members indicate no, 
the hon. member may continue with his intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not suppose 
too many Canadians will be surprised that  government members 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14671"> 14671 </A></B>
<P>
do not want to make the motion votable. The elitism of an old line 
party is well entrenched and democracy does not easily penetrate 
its protective shell. In their hearts they must know that they have 
made a bad decision. They have ensured that we will face the wrath 
of the growing number of Canadians who see their justice system in 
disarray.
<P>
	Canadians see a system unable to protect them from young 
punks who can commit crimes with immunity and hide 
anonymously behind the curtain of the Young Offenders Act. They 
see a system that releases dangerous offenders into their midst on 
bail or after minimum sentences for an outrageous crime.
<P>
	They see representatives at a meeting of the Canadian Police 
Association in Vancouver telling the Minister of Justice that over 
95 per cent of policemen want return of the death penalty. They see 
members of that same police association telling the minister that if 
he does not address their concerns they will make an election issue 
of capital punishment.
<P>
	These are well informed law enforcement personnel telling us 
there is a problem. If they are telling us there is a problem, there is 
a problem. In the meantime it looks as though the government side 
will continue to hide its head in the sand, pretending that 
everything is working well and refusing to address the concerns of 
its citizens.
<P>
	Canadians from coast to coast are sick of politicians and pointy 
headed professors telling them what to think about crime. They 
know that their streets are more dangerous than they were 20 years 
ago and all the statistics in the world will not convince them 
otherwise.
<P>
	For example, Canadians hear academics arguing against the 
return of capital punishment by claiming that the murder rate has 
decreased since capital punishment was abolished in 1976. It is 
absolutely true that there has been a slight decrease in the murder 
rate since 1976. However those same academics seem to 
conveniently forget to mention that the last hanging in Canada took 
place in 1961, some 15 years before, and that there was a sharp 
jump in the murder rate in the 15 years following the last hanging. 
In fact it almost doubled. Even now, in 1995, the murder rate is still 
50 per cent higher than it was in 1961 when the last hanging took 
place.
<P>
	The slight drop in the murder rate since 1976 probably has more 
to do with demographics, the number of young males in society, 
than it does with the abolition of capital punishment. Are we going 
to allow the public to discuss these things and to learn the truth? 
No.
<P>
	The House has let the people down again today. It has denied 
them a voice in the decision making of their government. Sadly the 
chances are that probably not many of them noticed. Their 
contempt for the system is well founded. They know that the 
outcome of virtually every vote in this place is predetermined long 
before the debate every begins.
<P>
	I will try again another time with other motions and private 
members' bills designed to give the public a voice in government. 
This issue has not gone away and neither has the pressure for 
democratic change. The system has entered an irreversible period 
of evolution that I hope will soon see a majority of MPs insisting 
on their right to represent the people who sent them here instead of 
caving in to the orders of the whip.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Did the member indicate that he wished 
to share his time with a colleague?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was my error. I 
meant to mention at the beginning of my speech that I would be 
splitting my time with the hon. member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I have never been in the chair when 
someone who is the first speaker on a private member's bill has 
divided his or her time. Is there unanimous consent to allow the 
hon. member to divide his time?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to 
share the time of my colleague from North Vancouver.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to speak on the motion of my colleague from 
North Vancouver calling for a binding referendum on the question 
of capital punishment. The motion has two very important 
elements: the use of referenda and the issue of capital punishment. 
First I would like to discuss the issue of a binding referendum.
<P>
	While the old line parties prefer a system where the average 
citizen of Canada is entitled to exercise his or her franchise only at 
election time, the Reform Party believes in a more participatory 
electorate.
<P>
	Central to the Reform Party's policies on political reform, we 
believe that the citizens of Canada should have the ability to 
directly participate in the formulating of legislation on such moral 
issues as abortion and capital punishment.
<P>
	The old line parties say that their constituents elected MPs to 
represent them in Ottawa. That is true, but seldom in the past have 
MPs from the old line parties ever faithfully represented the views 
of their constituents. Maybe, if they had, there would not have had 
to have been the Reform Party. Instead MPs used what they 
perceived as a moral superiority to disregard the sentiment of their 
constituents and voted as they saw fit.
<P>
	The previous free votes on capital punishment are typical of this 
attitude. How many of those who voted against the reinstatement of 
capital punishment voted in accordance with the views of their 
constituents? Considering the fact that the polls over the last 10 
years have consistently shown that support for capital  punishment 
hovers around the 70 per cent mark, that means the last time there 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14672"> 14672 </A></B>
<P>
was a free vote on the subject a number of MPs ignored their 
constituents.
<P>
	It is this attitude that necessitates giving the electorate a direct 
vote on the issue of capital punishment. To object to a referendum 
is to say that the people cannot be trusted to make the right 
decision. If that is the case, these same people should not be trusted 
to elect their representatives or to vote on whether or not to 
separate from the rest of Canada. As the referendum on the 
Charlottetown accord showed, the average Canadian possesses a 
wisdom that frequently escapes those whom they elect.
<P>
	I have no hesitancy in entrusting my constituents with the power 
to vote in a referendum. We put forth our position and we let the 
people decide whether they agree, like an election. Although it is 
extremely unlikely that the Liberal government will ever permit a 
referendum on capital punishment, I will nevertheless state my 
position for the record.
<P>
	I believe the death penalty should be an option for the jury to 
decide after convicting an individual of first degree murder. Once 
again I am putting my faith and my confidence in the common 
sense of the common people. If we can entrust them to decide 
whether or not we should reinstate capital punishment, we should 
also provide them with the responsibility to determine if it is an 
appropriate sentence in a particular case. I am confident that jurors 
would use this power wisely.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	One need only look at the Susan Smith trial held in South 
Carolina earlier this year. Smith was charged with murdering her 
two young sons by strapping them into her car and rolling it into a 
lake. At her trial it did not take a jury long to convict her. Then the 
jury was tasked with deciding if Susan Smith would be executed or 
would receive a life sentence.
<P>
	Despite the horrific nature of her crime it did not take the jury 
long to reject the death penalty and impose the life sentence. This is 
a prime example of how the people when given the responsibility to 
make life or death decisions will exercise that responsibility 
judiciously.
<P>
	It is my opinion that the 12 men and women who sat on the 
Bernardo trial jury should have been entrusted with that same 
responsibility. Who better than those 12 individuals, the people 
who sat through the videotapes, who listened to the testimony of 
both Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka, should have determined 
his fate? If they had had that responsibility I am not sure what they 
would have decided but I am convinced they should have had that 
option.
<P>
	However, I have little doubt about how a jury would have 
decided 14 years ago when Clifford Olson had his trial. Instead we 
have punished him by giving him a life sentence, one that is costing 
Canadians close to $100,000  a year to maintain. Thanks to a recent 
court ban, Canadians no longer are subjected to Olson's ramblings 
to the media. We no longer have to listen to his complaints about 
the quality of the popcorn he gets to eat while watching movies on 
his personal television.
<P>
	Unfortunately next year Clifford Olson gets the spotlight once 
again. Thanks to section 745 of the Criminal Code, Olson gets to 
have a jury trial next year to see if his 25-year parole eligibility 
should be reduced. Although I doubt that anyone would ever 
consider releasing this monster the mere fact that Olson gets such a 
platform is an outrage.
<P>
	Before commenting on arguments about whether or not capital 
punishment is a deterrent, I would like to state that the death 
penalty would serve a useful purpose if for no other reason than to 
dispatch the occasional monster like Clifford Olson.
<P>
	With regard to the deterrence value of capital punishment, many 
opponents point to the United States as an example of where it has 
not been a deterrent. First, look at the numbers closely. Between 
1977, the year the United States started to reapply the death 
penalty, and 1992 there were 188 executions carried out in the 
United States. During that same period there were 338,480 murders 
which means that a murderer in the U.S.A. has a 1 in 1,800 chance 
of being executed. With odds like that, how can there possibly be a 
deterrent?
<P>
	No matter which argument is used we know the Liberals are not 
prepared to reintroduce capital punishment. The residents of Surrey 
have just suffered the third tragic murder of a young girl within the 
past year. When 10-year old Melissa Deley was abducted from her 
bedroom, sexually assaulted and murdered the citizens of Surrey 
said enough is enough.
<P>
	I have received hundreds of calls from individuals telling me 
that if the federal government is not prepared to enact the laws to 
protect them then they will take whatever measures necessary to 
protect themselves. While I do not condone any form of 
vigilantism such acts are likely to occur because of inaction by this 
Liberal government.
<P>
	My constituents elected me to ensure their voices would be 
heard in Parliament so they would be able to participate in the 
democratic process. To that end I ask for the unanimous consent of 
the members present that this motion be deemed votable for 
Thursday, September 28.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion is a little different from the 
motion made by the previous member. Is there unanimous consent 
to accede to the member's wish?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There not being unanimous consent the 
member's time has expired.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion. It 
is one that has been mentioned many times in the House.
<P>
	Members opposite have pointed to capital punishment as being 
the panacea, the solution to the problems of our criminal justice 
system and the crime that exists in our communities. I certainly do 
not agree with that. I think they are on the wrong track. The job is 
much bigger than that and we should not look to a simplistic 
solution that will not have the effect society wants which is the 
reduction of crime in our communities.
<P>
	The member for North Vancouver said that the government will 
probably bring up the fact that the murder rate has gone down since 
capital punishment was abolished. He is right, I am. Before capital 
punishment was abolished the rate was 3 per cent. In 1987 when the 
last major debate on this subject took place the rate was 2.42 per 
cent. In 1994 it was 2.04 per cent. The murder rate is continuing to 
go down.
<P>
	The member talks about the Canadian Police Association voting 
unanimously in favour of reinstating capital punishment. He is 
pleased to quote the Canadian Police Association when he talks 
about capital punishment but he is not pleased to quote the 
Canadian Police Association when he talks about gun control.
<P>
	He also talks about the fact that there has not been an execution, 
capital punishment in Canada since 1951. Yet the rate was higher in 
about 1965 when the debate started than it was in 1951 and the rate 
today is higher than in 1951. He is saying that it was not doing 
away with capital punishment that decreased the murder rate, but it 
had to be something. There were three debates on capital 
punishment between 1965 and 1976.
<P>
	Funny, strange, the murder rate started to go down when gun 
control was first introduced in 1978. The fact is if we are going to 
quote statistics there have to be reasons why these things happen.
<P>
	The motion calls for a referendum at the time of a federal 
election. It has never been the policy in Canada to have a 
referendum at the time of a general election. It may be fine in 
California, but look what was brought forward in California, the 
three strikes law. A man stole a piece of pizza from a child and is 
now going to be serving 25 years because it was his third 
conviction. It did not matter that it was not a violent crime. It was 
his third offence and he is in prison for 25 years as a result of that. 
That law was the result of a referendum at the time of an election.
<P>
	In Canada we want a federal election that is going to elect the 
politicians who are going to pass the laws. We want the people to 
concentrate on that. I do not think there is an overwhelming desire 
for a referendum on  capital punishment. Members opposite may 
think there is, but I am not hearing that. I have to admit that I am 
not in favour of capital punishment. I do not think it is correct. 
Taking another life is not the answer.
<P>
	Only the victims can tell you there is nothing more excruciating 
than losing a family member or a loved one through a violent 
crime. There is no question about that. It is completely hideous and 
absolutely indescribable. However there is nothing that is going to 
bring back a life. If anything could, there is no question the 
Minister of Justice and government members would do it. That is 
not going to do it.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	What is the result of a death penalty? Half of the states in the 
United States that have reinstated the death penalty are not using it. 
In the ones that are sometimes year after year, appeal after appeal 
the death penalty is postponed. The execution is postponed and 
there are final appeals to the governor of the state.
<P>
	These are emotional roller coasters for the families of the 
victims, no question. The constant appeals, the attention in the 
press of these delays are not in the interests of the families of the 
victims. That is not the answer.
<P>
	What we need is a sound policy of crime prevention. The leader 
of the Reform Party talks about capital punishment and members of 
the Reform Party talk about capital punishment. We have to look at 
what is causing the crime. It is not going to do any good as far as 
the victim is concerned to punish the criminal. It will help society. 
It is a deterrent. It will give the family of the victim some feeling 
that society is conscious of the life that has been taken, but it is not 
going to do anything for the victim. The victim has been murdered.
<P>
	What we want to do is protect potential victims, to stop these 
murders from happening. That is one of the reasons the Minister of 
Justice and this government have instituted a safe streets policy. 
Certainly gun control is one part of it and is a good part of it. 
Sentencing policy, Bill C-41, is part of it. The DNA provision is 
another part of it. We are going to be bringing forward more 
legislation regarding DNA.
<P>
	We never hear about those things. All we hear about is the 
violence. Let us talk about how we can stop the violence. This is 
what the Minister of Justice wants to do. This is what this 
government wants to do and it is what the government is doing.
<P>
	We also want to talk about how we can deal with young 
offenders, another very serious problem. Crime prevention is an 
integral part of the safe streets policy. Crime prevention begins 
with the day a child is born. Punishment is after the fact. 
Punishment is a part of it but the most important thing is to prevent 
crimes from happening. We never hear that from the Reform Party.  
We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14674"> 14674 </A></B>
<P>
never hear discussion about how we can prevent crime from 
happening.
<P>
	The time a child can be most influenced from becoming a child 
at risk or a future young offender is from the day the child is born to 
its third birthday. We have to do more in the early formative years, 
even in the early years when a child is in school.
<P>
	We have to have the co-operation of the provinces. We have to 
have co-operation and understanding of all members of the House 
of Commons on that very important principle and basic attack on 
young offenders, on future offenders and future murderers.
<P>
	Certainly we have had great examples of hideous crimes in this 
country in the last few months. Homolka and Bernardo is one 
terrible example of hideous murders. The policy of this 
government is not to piggyback on the hideous nature of these 
crimes to sensationalize a proposal for a referendum that is not 
going to do what the people of Canada want.
<P>
	I have a very strong interest in this because Donald Marshall is a 
constituent of mine. In that crime the murder happened in my 
constituency. Guy Paul Morin is another example. We can say that 
those are only isolated incidents but they are two people who are 
still alive as a result of those isolated incidents and there are others.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	We need to find lasting solutions. That is what this government 
intends to do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member for North Vancouver moved a non-votable motion 
urging the government to hold a referendum on capital punishment 
concurrently with the next federal election. Reform members have 
outdone themselves once again. Since they realize they may be 
swept off the electoral map in the next election, they are trying to 
exercise their mandate as legislators beyond the term for which 
they were elected to this House.
<P>
	If Reform members think we will not take this seriously, they are 
wrong. Their publicity-hungry leader took advantage of the 
summer recess to try to revive the debate on capital punishment. 
Once the debate on gun control had subsided, he had to find 
something else to keep him in front of the tv cameras. Burned by 
the debate on gun control where they finally showed their true 
colours, Reform members have completely lost their sense of 
reality, trapped in neanderthal attitudes where repression is the rule 
and rehabilitation and presumption of innocence are vague 
concepts thought up by criminologists.
<P>
	The legitimacy of the penal system is largely based on its 
effectiveness and fairness. Its underlying principle is the 
presumption of innocence, a fundamental principle  of law which 
says that the accused is presumed innocent until found guilty 
following a trial.
<P>
	Wrongful convictions undermine this fundamental principle. As 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice said earlier, 
David Milgaard, Donald Marshall and Guy Paul Morin are three 
names we too often forget. Nevertheless, these individuals each 
paid an enormous debt to society, a debt they did not owe.
<P>
	In Manitoba, David Milgaard spent 23 years of his life behind 
bars before his release. He was unjustly convicted of murder. The 
Crown's principal witness perjured himself at the trial.
<P>
	In Nova Scotia, Donald Marshall served 11 years in the 
penitentiary for a murder he did not commit. Another inmate 
finally confessed. Thirty-five years old today, Guy Paul Morin paid 
a high price for a judicial error. He was falsely accused of the 
murder of young Christine Jessup. He was found guilty at his first 
trial. After nearly ten years in the penitentiary, Morin was acquitted 
thanks to considerable advances in science and DNA research.
<P>
	These three men would have been dead and buried years ago if 
capital punishment was still the law in this country. Three innocent 
men sent to the gallows, murders ordered by the government. For 
all the Clifford Olsons and Paul Bernados that roam our streets, 
there will be innocent people convicted of crimes they did not 
commit.
<P>
	In the United States, according to the Criminal Justice Research 
Centre, every year 6,000 people are wrongfully convicted of a 
serious crime. To my knowledge, there has been no similar study in 
Canada.
<P>
	The trouble with capital punishment is that it is irreversible. I 
realize I am stating the obvious, but we must admit that once the 
injection has been administered, that is it. No appeal, no new 
evidence that would reverse the conviction and no opportunity to 
review an erroneous judicial decision.
<P>
	If the conviction is, as in most cases, based on circumstantial 
evidence or even if the police manages to get an eye witness, the 
fact remains that mistakes are always possible and that a human 
life is at stake. And we cannot change our minds after the 
execution. I can see the headlines: ``Posthumously acquitted''.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	But do not, above all, conclude that I am forgetting the victim in 
all of this. His or her life has also been taken. I want to see these 
murderers tracked down and sentenced severely, made an example 
of. I am thinking of cases like that of little Melissa Deley, barely 
ten years old, who was taken away from her home in Surrey, British 
Columbia, raped and murdered.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14675"> 14675 </A></B>
<P>
	Calling for a referendum on the issue of the death penalty is 
a simplistic solution to a complex problem. Following the same 
logic, why not ask for a referendum on the budget or social 
reform?
<P>
	Since they do not form the government nor are they the official 
opposition, the Reform members are trying in every possible way 
to usurp power by sneaky moves.
<P>
	The Reform Party, especially the member for North Vancouver, 
wants to govern without being in power. Not content with 
representing a minority of the far right, for whom coercion is the 
solution for every ill, they now want to impose upon us their form 
of gang rule government. They want to pass statutes indirectly for 
which they have never received a mandate. Their hunger for power 
is equalled only by their cheap opportunism. You have to have a 
really colossal nerve to make political hay at the expense of victims 
and their families. In my opinion, calling for a referendum on all 
issues is not the way to fulfill the role of member of Parliament. Is 
this the only way the Reform Party has been able to find to divert 
attention from the only true referendum which will be held on 
October 30?
<P>
	In 1994, 596 homicides were reported in Canada, 34 fewer than 
in 1993. This was the third year in a row that the number had gone 
down. The homicide rate was 6 per cent lower than the rate in 1993, 
the lowest rate recorded in Canada in the past 25 years.
<P>
	Since we started gathering statistics nationally on homicides in 
1961, two trends have emerged. Between 1961 and 1975, the rate of 
homicides rose consistently. Between 1975 and 1994, the rate 
decreased regularly, despite yearly fluctuations.
<P>
	The transition period was therefore between 1975 and 1976. It 
was in 1976 that the death penalty was abolished in Canada. So 
much for those who contend that the death penalty is the way to 
reduce the number of homicides. Since the death penalty was 
abolished, murders in this country have decreased by 33 per cent.
<P>
	The wind of the far right blowing over the United States is 
sending breezes of repression our way. Let us have a closer look. 
Many states already have legislation making it possible for a jury 
to condemn an individual found guilty of premeditated murder to 
death.
<P>
	New York state has just joined the club and enacted legislation 
providing for the death penalty in cases of murder. Despite the fact 
that the United States has the death penalty, the homicide rate there 
has generally been three times the rate in Canada. The FBI reported 
more than 23,330 homicides last year, a rate of nine murders per 
100,000 inhabitants. To give you an idea of what theses figures 
mean, 18,390 homicides have been committed in Canada in the 
past 33 years.
<P>
	Let us be wary of handing over our criminal justice system to the 
Reformers. The Reform Party will put us back 1,000 years into the 
middle ages, when anarchy was the rule.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to commend my colleague and friend, the hon. 
member for North Vancouver, for his carefully considered motion.
<P>
	It is an honour to speak on the issue of capital punishment, which 
has created a lot of debate in the country, perhaps even as far back 
as Confederation. It is not a pleasant topic to discuss. No one 
wishes to discuss the issues of death and tragedy. However, 
Parliament ought to be the place where we can freely discuss the 
issues that most concern Canadians.
<P>
	Today in my area of British Columbia the issue discussed at 
coffee shops, in the barber shops, and in most local meeting places 
is the issue of accountability of murderers and how we as a 
community should respond.
<P>
	Canadians are fed up with our justice system. Justice has gone. 
Perhaps it is seen as merely a legal system that does not represent 
mainstream Canadian values. Constituents observe how their local 
courts operate and how they produce fear and disgust rather than 
any sense of relief that officials are minding the store and doing 
their duty on behalf of the public.
<P>
	The rationale that capital punishment does not deter really 
misses the point. It is 100 per cent effective to deter the individual 
murderer, as it would prevent the current practice where these 
kinds of criminals are released only to kill again. This happens in 
Canada.
<P>
	My reason for speaking today is simple. The people have 
spoken. It is my duty as the member of Parliament for New 
Westminster-Burnaby to make those voices heard here in the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	Reform MPs were elected because we agreed to vote the wishes 
of our constituents. That is something the Liberal government does 
not agree with. In fact, the Liberal government punishes its own 
members for doing so. The hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce 
was recently removed from his position as chair of the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. It seems that if a member 
votes differently from the pack the Prime Minister will punish 
them.
<P>
	My colleagues opposite do not agree with me that community 
representation is important. That really makes me begin to wonder 
who they represent. Do they represent the interests of those who 
elected them to sit in the House, or do they represent only 
themselves?
<P>
	I know that the hon. member for North Vancouver did not put 
forward the motion simply to cause debate in the House, nor did he 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14676"> 14676 </A></B>
<P>
do it to put himself at the front and  centre of some political column 
or controversy. The hon. member for North Vancouver put forward 
Motion No. 431 because his constituents are calling for Parliament 
to revisit the capital punishment debate.
<P>
	The majority of Canadians who support the revisitation of the 
capital punishment question did not simply wake up one morning 
and remark that we should create a death row. They are quite upset 
to see a person murdered in cold blood only to see the murderer get 
out of prison on parole a few years later. Who can blame them for 
being upset?
<P>
	Canadians have a right to a national referendum on capital 
punishment. They have a right on these types of matters to have 
policy reflect mainstream values.
<P>
	Opponents are saying that the murder rate will not decrease if the 
death penalty is reinstated, that a murderer will still commit 
murders regardless. It is not possible to make the country free of 
murder. We will never live in a sinless world. Capital punishment is 
not put forward as a panacea, and neither is it a simplistic solution.
<P>
	Canadians want one thing: they want real justice. I do not think 
that the Minister of Justice and the Solicitor General really know 
what that is. They have their thinking clouded by some misguided 
social philosophy as they go on and deride the democrats, the 
Reformers, for speaking up on behalf of Canadians.
<P>
	Let us make it specific. On September 6, 1995, Melissa Daley 
was sexually assaulted and murdered in Surrey, British Columbia. 
She was kidnapped from her own home. There was no reason for 
that to happen. It was a senseless killing. The offender should have 
been in custody at the time. The murderer hanged himself in his 
own jail cell just days later. That was not justice; that was suicide. 
The justice system failed us in this case. The system fails again and 
again.
<P>
	As is to be expected with such a heinous crime, many 
constituents in Surrey wrote letters to the editors of our local 
newspapers. In one column a citizen wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where are our lawmakers when these atrocious murders are taking place? 
Don't they hear the anguished cries of these parents for their children? Why are 
these monsters allowed to walk free while our country mourns its losses? For 
God's sake, wake up, people. The laws have to be changed to protect the 
innocent. Don't ignore what's happening because it hasn't happened directly to 
you. You could be next.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	June 29, 1987 was the last time Parliament had a chance to 
debate capital punishment. When the motion came up for debate at 
that time it was defeated by only 21 votes: 148 to 127. Amazingly 
enough the Angus Reid poll taken in 1987 showed 73 per cent of 
Canadians in favour of the death penalty. One would assume that if 
73 per cent of Canadians were in favour a similar statistic  should 
have been displayed in the House at that time-not so.
<P>
	If all MPs in the 1987 Parliament were true to the fact that they 
would represent their constituents perhaps the vote would have 
been more like 200 to 75.
<P>
	This past month notorious murderer Paul Bernardo was 
sentenced to life imprisonment for the brutal slayings of two 
Ontario ladies. There was no disputing that Paul Bernardo 
committed the crimes. The evidence was black and white and the 
jury declared him guilty of first degree murder. The psychologist 
even showed that he was sane when he performed the murders and 
he remains sane today. If he is released from prison he will likely 
murder again.
<P>
	On the witness stand observers said he showed no emotions and 
no remorse at all for the crimes. Now he will spend the rest of his 
life in a federal prison. Canadians are hopeful that Bernardo will 
not have the chance to murder again. However, they are sad he was 
given the chance to live while the innocent were not.
<P>
	Opponents of capital punishment firmly state there is no need for 
any debate because the homicide rate in Canada is decreasing. The 
opponents may be correct in this statement according to Stats 
Canada. However the category of homicide includes first and 
second degree murder, manslaughter and infanticide. At the same 
time we checked that no person either in Canada or in the United 
States has ever been given the death penalty for a non-capital 
crime; that is, only those who commit first degree murder can be 
given the actual death penalty.
<P>
	The vote on capital punishment in 1987 was not fair. The vote 
clearly did not represent the real wishes of Canadians. Members at 
that time did not consult with their constituents sufficiently. They 
simply came into the Chamber and voted for what they wanted. 
That historical action has never been accepted by the public as 
legitimate. Manipulation was rampant and every conceivable 
arcane rationalization was used by members to justify their vote. It 
was a day when the elected left their constituents behind and went 
their own way. We have suffered the consequences for the justice 
system ever since.
<P>
	That is where Reformers are different. Not only do we try and 
listen to what the masses are telling us, we endeavour to put their 
words and aspirations into concrete action.
<P>
	The motion is simple:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government should support and work toward enabling legislation for a 
binding referendum on capital punishment to be held concurrently with the next 
federal election.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Let the people speak. The Prime Minister has enough excuses to 
ignore such a plea. There would be little extra cost since it would 
concur with the next election. Individual members of Parliament 
would not have to worry about party lines. The people of Canada 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14677"> 14677 </A></B>
<P>
would  simply decide. There would be no blame on an individual 
political party since the people would be given the chance.
<P>
	Capital punishment is a special case of law making that 
transcends party politics. The Reform Party has no official position 
on the topic. However, a Reform government would be humble 
enough to bow to the will of the mainstream. Every voting citizen 
must examine their own conscience and solemnly enter that booth 
and make a choice for themselves for the kind of society they want 
to give to their children.
<P>
	My appeal today is for democracy. My appeal today is for a 
referendum.
<P>
	I now move this motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I seek consent of the members present to have Motion M-431 referred to the 
Standing Committee on Justice for further examination.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Members have heard the terms of the 
motion. Is there unanimous consent to accept the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in introducing this motion our colleagues from the 
Reform Party, the members for North Vancouver and 
Surrey-White Rock, have argued capital punishment is necessary 
to protect the public against murder and that it should be 
re-established in Canada at least as an option. They also argue we 
should have a referendum at election time to decide this issue.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	There is no doubt murder is a most serious and heinous crime, 
perhaps the worst crime we have on the books. We should do 
everything possible to reduce the rate of murder and protect the 
public from violent crime.
<P>
	Capital punishment will not accomplish that goal. There is 
overwhelming evidence that capital punishment is not effective in 
controlling murder and protecting the public. The American states 
that have brought back capital punishment, particularly the 
southern states of Texas, Louisiana and Florida, have the highest 
murder rates in the United States and much higher than countries 
such as Canada and those in western Europe which do not have 
capital punishment.
<P>
	The United States is the only county in the western world that 
has capital punishment. Capital punishment was brought back in 
those states following an American Supreme Court judgment in the 
middle 1970s. While the murder rate in those states has decreased 
in a minor way in recent years it is still much higher than in states 
without capital punishment. That we have lower rates in 
non-capital punishment states does not mean it is the result of not 
having capital punishment, but rather the  result concentrating on 
other measures to reduce violent crime.
<P>
	In Canada the rate of homicide is a little over 2 per 100,000 
population, whereas in the states of Texas, Louisiana and Florida it 
is about 10 per 100,000 population. In western Europe it is about 2 
per 100,000 population as well, with some countries at less than 2 
per 100,000.
<P>
	If capital punishment is argued as a means of protecting the 
public, it is not protecting the public in Louisiana, in Florida, in 
Texas and those other American states where capital punishment is 
there for that very reason. All one has to do is visit those states to 
find out.
<P>
	When I went to New Orleans I was told not to leave the French 
Quarter. I was told not to go out at night because there were so 
many murders in that city. It is a sad thing because it is a beautiful 
city.
<P>
	Capital punishment is not an effective means of protecting the 
public. Furthermore it is seriously objectionable on other grounds. 
For example, it is irreversible when a mistake is made and there 
have been mistakes. At least if somebody is convicted of murder 
and is sent to prison for life he or she can be released if later proven 
not guilty. Such was the case of Donald Marshall and others. In 
Britain such was the case with the Guildford four. There are many 
cases around the world in which this happens. When this happens 
they can be released from prison and given some damages, some 
compensation. Once a person is executed it is game over.
<P>
	It is objectionable in that it has always been applied in an 
inequitable manner. It has always been applied more heavily on 
minorities, on the poor, on immigrants, on the illiterate. Those who 
have had the big lawyers, the great court pleaders, these 
outstanding lawyers who cost a lot of money, have got off. Those 
who have not been able to do that have not got off. I could refer to a 
case in the United States right now but I will not.
<P>
	My colleagues from the Reform Party referred to statistics in the 
United States. Of the total number of murders committed there 
only a small percentage of those convicted, although it is a high 
number in total terms, have been executed. That points out the 
inequity of the whole system.
<P>
	If left as an option in Canada we would have gross inequities. It 
would mean one murderer in one province would probably be 
executed and one in another province for almost the same crime 
would not be executed. There would be great unevenness in the 
application of this most serious irreversible penalty.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	The motion calls for a referendum on these matters. I am not 
opposed to referendums in principle, but they are not provided for 
in our constitution as a means of legislating issues and they are not 
traditional in the  British parliamentary system. In our system we 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14678"> 14678 </A></B>
<P>
are elected to office to represent the people, certainly to consult 
with them, to consult the evidence, to look at the facts, to inform 
ourselves, and then make a decision in the best interests of the 
public. The parliamentary system is not a system by referendum.
<P>
	We have had three so-called referendums at the federal level in 
Canadian history, one on prohibition of liquor, one on conscription, 
and one on the Charlottetown accord. They were all advisory; none 
of them were binding. As a matter of fact, in the one on 
conscription and the one on prohibition the government of the day 
did not slavishly follow the results of the referendum. As a matter 
of fact, in the conscription case, although the country 
overwhelmingly voted yes for conscription, we ended up with a 
system where there was only conscription for service in Canada.
<P>
	In any case, we have no system of binding referendums in this 
country. But if we are going to decide questions by referendum 
then it should be done according to a policy and not simply on an ad 
hoc basis. A referendum cannot be called only when you think you 
are going to win the case.
<P>
	For example, would the hon. members in the Reform Party call 
for referendums on gun control or on medically assisted suicide? I 
notice that while they slavishly follow the polls with respect to who 
wants capital punishment, they ignored the popular polls with 
respect to gun control and also ignored the polls with respect to 
medically assisted suicide.
<P>
	If we are going to have referendums we have to decide by policy 
or by legislation what matters are to be decided and not simply call 
for them when we think we are going to win. That is no way to run a 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> That is government by opportunism.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> My hon. colleague says that is government by 
opportunism, and that is what it is: if you think you can win a 
referendum you hold one and you do not call for it when you think 
you will not win. For example, would this Parliament or the people 
of Canada be willing to have a referendum on the GST or 
unemployment insurance or other difficult issues?
<P>
	The Reform member spoke about keeping horrible murderers in 
prison at public expense. When we take the total number of inmates 
and divide it into the total cost of our prison system, it comes to 
about $50,000 or $60,000 a year for the most serious criminals. I 
know Reform members understand arithmetic. This does not mean 
that if one criminal is executed we would save $60,000, because 
there are fixed costs in the system. If we are really going to save 
money we would have to execute about 100 criminals a year, I 
would surmise. Then we could close a prison. Most of our prisons 
hold about 300 or 400 inmates. If we were really going to save any 
money we would execute about 100 a year to save a  decent amount 
of money. If we were to start doing that we would rank with the 
Republic of China in executions. The countries that led the world 
recently in executions were South Africa and China. We would join 
that select club if we were to simply execute people to save money.
<P>
	If we in the House are really serious about protecting the public 
from violent crime then we have to concentrate on preventive 
measures, concentrate on measures directed to the causes of violent 
crime. Capital punishment is a measure to be applied after the 
murder has taken place. It is a post factum penalty. Penalties are 
necessary in our criminal law. As I said, we should not have this 
extreme penalty because of the many objections to it. While 
penalties are necessary, they will not solve the crime problem. We 
will solve the crime problem by concentrating on measures to 
prevent crime and measures directed at the causes of crime.
<P>
	In conclusion, we cannot convince a society that it is wrong to 
take a life when the state is ready and willing to take lives.
<P>
	There are many more arguments and many more aspects to this 
debate, but we cannot cover them all in 10 minutes.

	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGRICULTURE">AGRICULTURE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
word is out: Federal goodies are on their way to Western Canada. 
Cheques for a total amount of $1.6 billion are being or will be sent 
directly to grain producers in the Prairies. This compensation for 
the loss of western grain transportation subsidies gives and will 
give western producers an unfair edge over farmers in Eastern 
Canada, especially in Quebec.
<P>
	Many grain producers are taking advantage of this windfall to 
diversify production and flood Quebec with their products. Since 
part of the compensation is paid for through taxes they pay to 
Ottawa, Quebecers may be doubly penalized. Here is an example. 
Quebec's subsidies for industrial milk are being cut by 30 per cent, 
with no compensation for dairy producers in that province: clearly 
a double standard.

	Last Friday I was in Princeville at an auction of slaughter 
calves. I met a producer from my riding, Gérald Turcotte, who 
explained in his own words how Quebec was being used by the 
rest of Canada. I will repeat what he said. Canada is so anxious 
to keep us because we pay well and do not take much money out. 
Imagine, he said, a farmer with ten Holsteins. Three are very good 
milkers: Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia. One of these cows 
eats little, is not a picky eater, requires little attention from its 
owner, is rarely sick, does not go outside the fence, is very docile, 
returns to the barn in time for morning and evening milking. In 
short, this cow is the best of the herd.
<P>
	You will understand, Mr. Speaker, that the farmer would not let 
this famous and profitable cow go for all the gold in the world. 
Quebec too is very profitable for Ottawa and the rest of Canada. 
However, it is the victim of injustice: National Defence contracts, 
research and development funding, expenditures by the department 
of agriculture in Quebec that are lower than the economic activity 
generated by the sector. Quebec is therefore not getting its fair 
share of federal investment. Since 1984, its share has been only 
15.9 per cent, despite the fact that the population of Quebec 
represents 25 per cent of Canada's population and that Quebec 
provides 23 per cent of federal revenues.
<P>
	Quebec has never received more than 19.1 per cent of the federal 
government's expenditures on goods and services. In 1992, for 
example, the federal government spent a total of $31.2 billion with 
only $5.9 billion in Quebec, which represents 18.9 per cent. This 
figure is 6 per cent less than our demographic load. I have tonnes of 
such examples.
<P>
	Yes, my friends, Quebec is very profitable for the rest of Canada. 
For the rest of Canada as it stands today. Quebec, as Gérald 
Turcotte put it so well, is a fine cash cow for Canada.
<P>
	This is why we are not being allowed to have a tool box of our 
own so that one day we in Quebec can build our future as we ought, 
pass our own legislation, sign treaties and collect our own taxes.

	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, agricultural 
subsidies have been reduced as part of a broad government effort to 
reduce the deficit. However the government has taken great care to 
ensure that all regions and sectors of the industry have been treated 
as fairly and equitably as possible.
<P>
	The western grain transition payment program and the western 
grain transportation adjustment fund will be used to partially offset 
the potential disruption that may result from the removal of the 
western grain transportation subsidy. The removal of the feed 
freight assistance program in eastern Canada and parts of British  
Columbia is being accompanied by a $62 million adjustment 
program.
<P>
	The impact of the repeal of both the Atlantic Region Freight 
Assistance Act and the Maritime Freight Rates Act in eastern 
Quebec and Atlantic Canada is being eased by a transition 
assistance program of $326 million.
<P>
	An adaptation fund of $60 million per year on average will be 
used to help meet future adaptation requirements. The government 
has set aside $17 million a year for the next four years from the 
adaptation fund to address concerns regarding the impacts of the 
reform of transportation subsidies in eastern Canada.
<P>
	The answer to the hon. member's question is yes, there are funds 
available to address eastern Canadian farmers' concerns about 
transportation reform. The government is reducing the dairy 
subsidy by 15 per cent for each of the next two years. Thus at the 
end of two years the subsidy will still be at 70 per cent of the levy, 
where it is today. The continuation of the subsidy provides 
producers with a source of funds that can be used to ease the 
transition into a more market oriented system.
<P>
	The government has ensured that all farmers, in fact all 
Canadians, are sharing equally in the responsibility for deficit 
reduction. The package of subsidy reform is fair and balanced with 
respect to different situations, different regions and different 
sectors within the Canadian agriculture and agri-food industry.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to the standing orders, the 
motion is now deemed to have been adopted.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.37 p.m.)
