</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK4">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the 
government should take into account regional unemployment rates 
when establishing or expanding government offices and agencies so 
that regions with high rates of unemployment are considered for 
any new job creation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today on my motion. 
It should come as no surprise to members of the House that the 
motion should come from me, given that I represent one of the 
areas which has had chronically high rates of unemployment for a 
long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not alone in that.  One of the privileges and I suppose 
one of the benefits of being a member of parliament is that there 
is a lot to learn.  What I have learned over the last three years 
is that the chronic rates of unemployment which affect Cape 
Breton are not exclusive to Cape Breton.  There are areas in New 
Brunswick, including certainly the region represented by the 
member for Acadie—Bathurst, which have chronically high 
unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the member who is seconding the motion, the gracious member 
for Yukon, unemployment is no stranger to her riding, as well as 
regions in the north of the country, northern Manitoba, parts of 
northern Saskatchewan, and parts of British Columbia.  In fact no 
region of the country is free from chronic high rates of 
unemployment.  As we have said repeatedly in the House, the 
disparity between the have regions of the country and the have 
not regions of the country is growing immensely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the ways, and it is a humble suggestion from me, I think 
the government could address this issue is by incorporating the 
motion into its decision making process.  The motion essentially 
says that if the government is expanding a government department, 
if it is creating a new government department, if it is expanding 
an agency or creating a new agency, part of the criteria as to 
where that agency or department would be located would be to look 
at unemployment rates in areas of the country which have 
chronically high unemployment rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appropriate that we address the motion on a Monday.  Most 
of us have come to the House this morning from our ridings.  I 
know for me, when I leave the airport in Sydney, Cape Breton, 
arrive in Ottawa and travel downtown, and then conversely when I 
go home, it is a bittersweet experience because I see the 
tremendous wealth in Ottawa, generated and created to a large 
extent because of the public service in the city in that it is 
the government capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when it had to be that way. 
There was a time when in order for departments to run 
efficiently, in order for there to be a fair exchange of 
communication, there had to be government departments congregated 
in one area, and that area was naturally the capital city.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the House a little story about what came to light 
for me.  It was given to me in a dialogue with the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans and indeed with his deputy regional 
director.  There is in my riding a radio station necessary for 
ship to shore communication operated by the coast guard.  There 
was a plan afoot to move that and centralize it in Halifax. 
Understandably the people in my riding, the people who work in 
that area, were not pleased to think about having to leave their 
homes and locate somewhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I met with the regional deputy director he told me that if 
they wanted to they could navigate the ships that come in and out 
of the gulf and the Bras d'Or lakes from an office in Ottawa.  I 
put the reverse to him and said that if they could do that with 
the technology, surely they could navigate the ships that come in 
and out of Halifax harbour and other harbours from this location. 
He began to laugh, so I asked him if I were wrong, if the 
technology were one way.  He had a sober second thought.  Maybe 
he is planning to work for the Senate or to be appointed, I do 
not know, but after sober second thought he told me I was right, 
that there was no reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans in 
one of its reports two years ago, maybe not that long ago, 
recommended that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans be 
located on either one of our coasts because there are no fish in 
the Rideau Canal.  The Department of Fisheries and Oceans had 
made some errors in calculation.  It was felt by the standing 
committee that it would be appropriate for those public servants 
to be located in the fishing communities to hear from the 
fishermen directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which coast would be chosen?  My suggestion would be, and the 
motion reads, that one of the criteria would be that the 
government would look at the areas of high unemployment.  I say 
quite frankly, to have a huge department like that locate in 
western Newfoundland would be beneficial.  I will not even be 
parochial here, as much as I would like to have it in my own 
riding.  Suppose the department were to locate in Port aux 
Basques?  Suppose it were to locate in Argentia in a community 
that right now is seeing its resource bases dry up?  These would 
be welcome well paying jobs that would provide some stability in 
that community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conversely, there may be some ridings along the northern coast 
of British Columbia, and I am not as familiar with them, that 
would be suitable for the department's location.  Would it matter 
in terms of communication?  We have the technology now.  That is 
what we are constantly told by the Minister of Industry.  The new 
technological age allows us to sit at our computers anywhere in 
the country and effectively do our jobs and run our departments. 
If the private sector can do that, if it can be done from Ottawa 
to the regions of the country, then I do not see why it cannot be 
done from the regions to the centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point that I would raise.  Some time ago in the 
1980s there was some decentralization, which is what it was 
called then, where the Department of Citizenship and Immigration 
located in my home town.  It is a good thing it did, because as 
the government divests itself of the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation, as the government withdraws from other industries 
and as we face real economic challenges, one of the bright spots 
is the employees of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration 
who are keeping the downtown core alive to a great extent.  They 
are the people who can afford to buy lunches, buy clothes and 
whatnot to keep small entrepreneurs in business.  If these small 
entrepreneurs were supplying goods to various departments they 
could benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an exchange earlier in my term with the Minister of 
National Defence.  We do have a small base in Sydney.  When it 
came time to refurbish it, two of the local small business 
entrepreneurs went to the department to try to sell furniture. 
They were rebuffed.  The furniture came from somewhere else. 
There was no spinoff in the local economy from that, shamefully, 
but had there been a fairly substantial government department or 
agency there is no question that it would benefit the 
communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do want to question that, we need only look at the cities 
in the country where the civil service and government 
expenditures laid the foundation for an economy.  I am happy for 
the people of Ottawa, but in this city today we hear constantly 
of large high tech corporations locating here.  They are doing so 
in part because there is a stable financial base here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true in Halifax in the province I come from and of 
Moncton or Fredericton, New Brunswick.  The civil service has 
provided a stable economic base for investment.  Frankly, the 
wealth being generated in some of those capital cities today by 
the private sector certainly would allow the public sector to 
move out without tremendous disruption, especially if it is a new 
agency or government department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the recent announcement by the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage of $48 million for a national war museum.  I 
have nothing against a national war museum but I do not know why 
it has to be in Ottawa. I do not know that there is any 
particular reason that expenditure of money has to be spent here. 
It provides construction and tourism jobs.  It attracts tourists 
to a particular area.  Why not look at an area of the country 
that proudly served by sending its soldiers, sailors and airmen 
over?  It could be in any particular part of the country as no 
region has a monopoly on courage.  We could look at an area with 
high unemployment, which made a significant contribution to the 
war effort, and locate that museum there.  It would serve as a 
focal point for tourism, would provide construction jobs and what 
have you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, it will be yet another expenditure in this city.  Just 
as it is completed, I suppose the the multimillion dollar 
renovations to the Parliament Buildings will take place.  I do 
not know how far they will go but there are plans to create 
boulevards in this city, all of which are government 
expenditures.  Since I have come to this city, I have seen the 
road outside my office paved three times.  People in my riding 
would give anything for one-tenth of the paving budget alone that 
is spent on government buildings here in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at how the expansion of the national capital region 
to Hull enhanced the economy in that particular area, it 
certainly shows that it can work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also point out that we in Cape Breton have been criticized 
because of the Devco expenditures.  People have said that the 
government spends millions of dollars on the coal industry.  I 
ask members to think about the following fact and what it would 
mean in their own ridings.  In the city of Halifax there is 
something like $60 million deposited into bank accounts every two 
weeks by way of civil servants' pay.  The civil servants do 
important work and heaven knows we agree with the work they do. 
However, if I had one-quarter of those pay cheques being 
deposited in my riding, it would go some lengths to offset the 
loss of jobs we are going to suffer when the federal government 
pulls out of the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that Canada's newest territory, 
Nunavut, recognized the importance of doing this kind of work. 
Nunavut stands out for having recognized the failure of the 
federal government on this front and has set out recommendations 
in a detailed plan outlining the priorities for the new 
territorial government.  It is entitled the Bathurst Mandate. One 
of the things the new government recognizes is that if people are 
going to feel connected to their government, if they are going to 
feel that they pay taxes and should receive some benefit for that 
not just in services but in economic development, then one way to 
do that is to provide those outlying communities with government 
departments.  As I have said, why should we not?  The technology 
is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nunavut is calling for the fulfilment of the commitments of 
government to deliver employment to decentralized communities. 
How better for a community to feel connected to the federal 
government and to see some benefit for the taxes they pay than to 
see the government spending some money in their own community?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Through partnering arrangements, the government does spend money 
in terms of paving, assisting provinces and in medicare.  Every 
day in the House we have debates on whether or not the federal 
commitment is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use another example, the new gun registry.  To the 
government's credit, the registry was not located in Ottawa.  The 
gun registry is a very real and tangible expression of government 
expenditures in a community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to touch on the HRDC scandal that has occupied so 
much of the House's time, but instead of arbitrary criteria, what 
I am saying in this motion is that one of the compelling criteria 
in determining where those government offices should be located 
would not be political patronage but would be in areas of high 
unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very hard to justify, in this day and age, setting up a 
government agency or a government department in a city like 
Ottawa when we have regions in the country that have, in my 
particular hometown, an unemployment rate of 21% to 22%. I will 
not just single out Ottawa.  It is also difficult to justify 
putting it in Toronto where there are predictions of a shortage 
of skilled labour.  I submit that it could be a saving to the 
taxpayers in terms of the amount of taxes the Government of 
Canada would have to pay on a building with a high square footage 
because of the crowding and the land value in certain areas.  If 
the buildings are located outside the major centres in areas of 
high unemployment there tends to be empty office buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to walk down the main street of Sydney Mines or of 
Plumber Avenue in New Waterford, I could show the government 
empty buildings that it could fill with a government office or 
agency at a fair savings to Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member has brought forth some 
good ideas with his private member's motion.  If we could use 
employment insurance, as the hon. member has decided, it would in 
fact not be used in a political way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw members' attention to what the hon. member had to 
say about the headquartering of the gun registration in New 
Brunswick.  There was nothing wrong with that in in itself.  It 
outlined the principles of the hon. member's motion.  However, 
the moment the government changed in New Brunswick there was some 
sort of threat that the office of registration should move.  That 
clearly indicated to this controversy all across Canada, that EI 
is indeed being used for political purposes, which it should not 
be, simply because people from across Canada pay into this and 
there is nothing wrong in supporting regions of low unemployment 
with government offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province that I come from many things were moved out of 
the city of Regina into the smaller cities where it could be 
handled.  Crop insurance is in Melville, and so on and so forth. 
Retirement is out of the city.  It provides employment in the 
smaller areas of Saskatchewan.  That point is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention what he had to say about having the road paved 
three times in front of his office.   When I first came here a 
chap of a French dialect said to me “Monsieur Bailey, I want to 
tell you that in Ottawa we have two seasons.” I said “Oh, 
what are they?” He said “Winter and construction.” That stuck, 
and is quite true; we do spend a lot of money here. 
I would disagree with the hon. member, however, on the site of 
the national war museum.  Aside from that, his points were very 
well taken.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I briefly mentioned the fact that when young 
people in my constituency get the chance they jump to get on oil 
rigs.  They work 12 hour shifts until the rig goes down and then 
they have to come home.  Most of them qualify for EI benefits. 
However, if they are living with their mother and dad on a farm, 
if they do not have a permit book and are not registered as 
farmers, they do not qualify. That is an injustice.  Everybody in 
here knows that.  It is a misuse of funds.  We should take 
advantage of this time in the House to tell the people in charge 
of EI that this is not a tax and should not be used as a tax. We 
need to make sure that everybody can qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague, in speaking about his own constituency, said 
that he was well aware of the high employment rate and so on.  I 
want to describe to the House a case that is before me at the 
present time of a terrible injustice for which no one is willing 
to lend support to correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware of a 24 year old young man who has spent all his 
working time on the oil rigs.  He had a very bad accident and can 
never return to the work he was doing.  EI and Human Resources 
Development very promptly and very correctly provided funds to 
this intelligent young man to upgrade his skills in order to find 
work in the future and be able to earn enough money to pay child 
support which he had always paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Human Resources Development through EI got this man into 
training and he was doing well.   However, another branch of 
government took away the funding for his training and sent it off 
for child support.  He is now not only broke and desperate but, 
quite frankly, I think he is suicidal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something wrong with government agencies working 
against one another.  This is but one case.  I know of several 
other cases.  This issue should be examined.  Many different 
departments have been approached, as well as the Minister of 
Justice, the Prime Minister and provincial officials.  No 
response has ever been received on this huge problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about new job creation.  I do not think 
anybody would argue with that if this was totally without 
political interference.  I have no argument whatsoever that we 
could move many institutions from Ottawa to other parts of Canada 
and EI would be one of them.  I do not think we should ever be 
found guilty of using this money as a political tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do have trouble knowing the tremendous profit that goes into 
general revenue from this.  I have no hesitation to agree with 
the government when it says that it needs a surplus in case of a 
shortfall but how much of a surplus does it need?  The workers 
out there now consider this to be a tax and not an insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point I want to raise relates to students. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the first paying job I ever had.  There was no EI 
around at that time.  Young people may get their first job at 
Dairy Queen or McDonald's.  When they get their first paycheque 
they see two big deductions.  One is income tax and the other is 
EI.  Income tax is taken off even though they are students, and 
they can never reclaim the EI deduction.  We encourage our young 
people to find work, but there should be a declaration of some 
type which would limit the amount of the EI premiums they have to 
pay.  It is a little disappointing for the 14, 15 or 16 year old 
who gets that first paycheque to see the amount of the 
deductions.  After all, we have $27 billion sitting in Ottawa. 
We need to look at this in a big way because it is unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to commend the hon. member for his job creation 
motion.  I would like to believe that this money would not be 
used for political purposes, but somehow I do not have any firm 
belief that would happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a non-votable motion.  It is Monday morning and this is 
a private member's motion.  Who cares.  However, before we 
dismiss it totally I would say that there is meat in this motion 
which should be considered by both sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope hon. members opposite and on this side of the House 
realize that corrections can be made to Canada's employment 
insurance system.  They should listen and pay heed to the private 
member's motion and to some of the serious problems that I have 
brought forward this morning.  I would hope that anyone watching 
today would pay heed as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the hon. member for Sydney—Victoria for his job 
creation motion and inform him that, in principle, we on the 
government side of the House are not opposed to the intent of 
Motion No. 268.  The government is already doing exactly what he 
proposes we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's vision has always been of a strong and vibrant 
country where prosperity is shared across all regions.  That is 
why we continue to be committed to a job creation strategy that 
focuses on helping the private sector to grow.  This in turn 
fuels job creation in the private sector, which is exactly what 
we all want to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While all federal organizations support the government's job 
creation priority, Western Economic Diversification Canada, 
Industry Canada, the Economic Development Agency of Canada for 
the Regions of Quebec and the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency play a key role in advancing our jobs and growth agenda. 
These organizations work in partnership with other levels of 
government, associations and the private sector to help 
entrepreneurs establish new businesses and help existing 
businesses grow and prosper.  The member for Sydney—Victoria did 
recognize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the national level, these organizations work together to 
increase Canada's share of global trade.  They work to improve 
the conditions for investment in the Canadian economy.  They 
promote improvements to Canada's innovation performance and help 
build a fair, efficient and competitive marketplace for 
businesses and consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the regional level, these organizations have programs in 
place that are tailored to specific regional needs.  At the same 
time, these programs support broader objectives, such as targeted 
job creation, export promotion, improvements in the business 
climate and access to financing and technology information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the local level these organizations partner with communities 
and associations. 
One of their partners is the network of over 250 Community 
Futures Development Corporations that are spread right across 
this country.  These grassroots organizations, supported by a 
voluntary board of directors and a small paid staff, deliver 
programs to establish or expand local businesses, which in turn 
create new jobs in the community.  As for the operations of the 
federal government itself, we have offices right across the 
country which represent a significant presence in each and every 
region.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that, in principle, the government is not opposed to 
the intent of the hon. member's motion.  Indeed, when the 
opportunity presents itself to expand federal operations in the 
region, we have done exactly what the member proposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Summerside experience, for example, is an excellent case in 
point.  In this instance we worked with the provincial government 
to offset the impact of the closure of CFB Summerside.  We 
established a new GST centre, while the provincial government 
transferred Holland College's Police Academy to Summerside. 
These moves were followed by extensive and diversified new 
private sector activity in conjunction with the establishment of 
Slemon Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that, in practice, areas of high unemployment are already 
one of the considerations when there is to be an expansion or new 
establishment of government offices.  The reality, however, is 
that today expansionist governments are effectively extinct.  I 
can empathize with the concern that we, as a government, need to 
do everything possible to create new jobs and opportunities for 
our citizens.  At the same time, I believe that all members 
appreciate the fact that today bigger government is not the 
answer to new job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why instead of a strategy of government job relocation 
or creation our government has chosen to focus on a different 
strategy.  Instead of moving existing government jobs or 
expanding government activity, our approach has been to help 
create brand new jobs in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent Cape Breton experience is another case in point. 
Instead of taking government jobs from one area and relocating 
them, the government chose to work with the provincial government 
and the private sector to help create new jobs.  As a result of 
these efforts, EDS Canada recently announced that it will 
establish a contact centre that will help create up to 900 new 
full time jobs in Sydney over the next four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to say that our approach is working, not just 
in Atlantic Canada, but in every region of the country.  Our 
approach is helping to create new jobs.  These new jobs continue 
to be created month after month after month.  According to 
Statistics Canada, April marked the 27th consecutive month that 
the Canadian economy produced job growth.  In real terms this 
growth has fueled the creation of 115,000 new jobs in the first 
four months of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of our focus on job creation can also been seen in 
the unemployment rate, which remained at 6.8% in April.  This 
level is the lowest in almost a quarter century.  In fact, we are 
now a full 4.6% down from the 11.4% unemployment rate which we 
inherited just after taking office in October 1993.  The translation 
is, we have reduced the unemployment rate by over 40% 
since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes to show what our commitment and determination, coupled 
with the right policies, at the right time can achieve—more new 
jobs for more Canadians.  These increases add up to a significant 
number of new jobs.  As of today over 1.9 million new jobs have 
been created since we took office in 1993.  I have no doubt that 
our jobs and growth strategy will continue to help Canadians in 
all regions, just as we will continue our focus of creating more 
jobs and lowering unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada reports that Canada is on a run of economic 
growth that is the longest it has ever measured—18 straight 
quarters of GDP growth.  Moreover, the composite leading index, 
that is, the indicator of projected economic growth over the next 
three months, rose 1.1% in March, almost doubling economists' 
expectations of a .6% gain.

working.  Even more important is the fact that more Canadians are 
working as a result of our efforts.  We have helped to create new 
jobs.  We have helped to create a climate of growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister's budget 2000 will keep the growth and 
momentum going and help to make Canada the place to be in the 
21st century.  Budget 2000 continues our efforts to put forward a 
balanced approach to creating new prosperity and enhancing the 
quality of life of all Canadians in all of our regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our approach is one of balanced budgets and lower public debt, 
as well as lower taxes, especially for middle and low income 
Canadians and families with children.  Our approach is one of 
smart, strategic investments and initiatives that will boost job 
creation, productivity and our standard of living.  Our approach 
includes initiatives to strengthen our health care system, 
promote knowledge and innovation and ensure the quality of our 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government's record of prosperity and job creation is 
strong.  The member does not have to take our word for it.  Look 
at the agencies that monitor these situations.  We are working to 
ensure that every region benefits from the new economy and new 
job creation.  Our vision for the future is clear.  We want our 
citizens to be skilled and knowledgeable.  We want our businesses 
to be successful and competitive.  We want our country to remain

considerable interest to the member who has just spoken.  It is 
a good thing that he only had ten minutes, because, had we let 
him go on, we would have ended up with a shortage of unemployed 
people in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would perhaps be a good idea to look closely at the NDP

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
into account regional unemployment rates when establishing or 
expanding government offices and agencies so that regions with 
high rates of unemployment are considered for any new job 
creation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if the member is aware of the scope of his motion. 
I was involved in the 1993 and 1997 election campaigns and I 
saw the Liberals opposite waving about the famous red book, 
which, the second time round, had rather a warmed over look 
about it. However, the government did not object. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is being asked today to honour its promises and 
do what it has always promised in the regions.  The member who 
spoke before me gets around this when he says that unemployment 
dropped by 40%.  This is why I was saying we will end up with a 
shortage of unemployed people.  The member should have said that 
40% of the 12% it had been, and it is still high, unfortunately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 20 RCMP investigations are under way in management at Human 
Resources Development Canada.  I did not invent that figure.  It 
was in the papers again this morning: all sorts of

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister explained her terrible boondoggles by saying that 
there were pockets of unemployment in the regions and that the

pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, in response to a simple application for a name

is preparing to outsource the building of its Candu reactors to 
someplace in Asia, Vietnam or a neighbouring country?  I learned 
this last week when doing research on various government 
agencies, at which time I discovered that it has been five years 
since Atomic Energy Canada submitted its five year plan to 
parliament for approval, as it supposed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been going on for five years, under the supposed 
pretext that there is restructuring going on.  As well, there 
are preparations under way for signing agreements with Vietnam 
and Cambodia, I believe, for production of Candu reactors over 
there.  This is totally against the very principle of the motion 
by the hon. member from Nova Scotia and the totally gratuitous 
statements made by the Ontario member who spoke before me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A total of $12 billion of Canadians' hard-earned dollars has been 
invested in Atomic Energy Canada at a time when there was no 
hope of any clear benefit from the production of Candu reactors. 
Time has passed and the interest has built up.  If Atomic 
Energy of Canada were to pay back capital and interest to the 
Government of Canada, the total would be impressive, so much so 
that the figures might seem unrealistic.  The interest that 
would normally have been paid back to the government was 
therefore written off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a little like the government telling Canada Post “I 
transferred assets to you when I created Canada Post, so now I 
am entitled to dividends.  I want to be reimbursed”.  This is 
why André Ouellet, the President of Canada Post, pays the 
government dividends every year. 
Last year, he handed over $200 million in dividends to the 
government and he will likely hand over the same amount, maybe a 
bit more, this year, because Canada Post Corporation is doing 
quite well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government require Canada Post Corporation to hand 
over dividends, but not Atomic Energy of Canada?  For the simple 
reason that taxpayers are the ones who are going to be paying 
dividends to the federal government through Canada Post 
Corporation.  They are easy to overtax and shove around because 
they do not answer back or, if they do, it is just part of the 
general background buzz, and no one pays any real attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when Atomic Energy of Canada gets ready to contract out the 
building of its Candu reactors, there might be a slight 
possibility of some small benefits, rather than the already 
considerable capital losses and interest loads associated with 
this kind of project.  But no, the government is going to 
contract this out to another country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how this government treats Canadians who, election after 
election, want to see the government's actions produce some 
economic benefit.  Generally, the parties that take office hold 
out the promise of tremendous post-election economic growth in 
the form of job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, for instance, Marieville is located in one zone, 
because Canada has been carved up into zones for the purposes of 
the transitional jobs fund.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you have less than 12% unemployment, no business in your 
riding or your region is eligible for the transitional jobs 
fund.  Marieville, a pretty town in my riding, is a major 
centre.  The region is almost 100% agricultural.  The people not 
working in the farming community come into the major centre. 
The town of Marieville itself has perhaps 22% or 24% 
unemployment.  However, neighbouring villages have almost full 
employment.  There are family farms and small family businesses 
linked to the field of agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marieville is being penalized, because it is in an area with 
less than 12% unemployment. 
If we isolated Marieville, it would be a pocket of unemployment 
in the opinion of the Minister of Human Resources Development 
and the Prime Minister.  He considers these pockets when they 
are in his bailiwick, which is Saint-Maurice.  He considers them 
such all the more since the RCMP is considering them as well, 
because it went rooting around there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do these famous pockets not count elsewhere?  Perhaps 
because the elsewhere did not elect someone in the party in 
power.  What bothers me and what the member for Nova Scotia is 
right in saying is that this business is unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from those around Ottawa, in Ottawa itself, or in Ontario 
in the case of many, Canadians do not feel they are getting fair 
benefit from the government's economic activities. 
The government generates activity, for example for document 
printing or for jobs for public officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although not necessarily for the same reasons as the Canadian 
Alliance, the Bloc Quebecois, for its own reasons and after 
considering all that I have said, feels it has to make the 
government see things as they are.  It has to say to the 
government “You do not do what you should be doing unless you 
get a push from behind”.  It takes motions such as the one by 
the member for Sydney—Victoria to say to the government “If you 
are unfair, rotten to the core, do not give people that 
impression.  Try to at least appear to be fair”.  That is what 
we want.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to participate in the debate on Motion No. 268.  This motion 
would see the federal government take into consideration regional 
unemployment rates when establishing or expanding government 
offices and agencies so that regions with high rates of 
unemployment would be considered for any new job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate my colleague from Nova Scotia the 
member for Sydney—Victoria for drawing the government's 
attention to the serious unemployment problem which exists in the 
maritime provinces. The member would likely agree that the 
Liberal government has done little if anything to stop the tide 
of our young and brightest Atlantic Canadians who are being 
forced to relocate to other parts of the country in search of 
employment.  Even the Prime Minister has failed to recognize the 
serious brain drain problem in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was indicated in the comments by my colleague from across the 
way who spoke earlier that everything is rosy.  In certain parts 
of the country unemployment rates are low, but I can assure my 
hon. colleague that the unemployment rates are very high in the 
Atlantic Canada ridings, and more specifically the riding of West 
Nova which I represent.  Unemployment in seasonal work is very 
high.  The amount of seasonal jobs are high as well which causes 
a lot of unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue which is important in West Nova is the brain 
drain. The last census showed that over 2,000 people have left 
the riding.  These people are between the ages of 18 and 35.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a population of approximately 70,000, West Nova cannot 
afford to lose 2,000 of its brightest inhabitants.  It is time 
the federal government did something about this problem before 
more of our young people decide to leave. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can certainly sympathize with the hon. member for 
Sydney—Victoria.  All Canadians are aware of the many 
difficulties that have plagued Cape Breton Island over the past 
decades.  Unemployment is at an unacceptable level. Therefore it 
is paramount that the government do something to assist future 
economic development in that area as in most areas of the 
Atlantic provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party recognized the serious 
problems facing Atlantic Canadians.  That is why in 1987 the 
Progressive Conservative government of the day announced a new 
direction for regional economic development policy in Canada. 
That Progressive Conservative government was responsible for 
creating the western economic diversification program and the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that earlier my colleague opposite seemed to speak 
in very positive way of those things which the Progressive 
Conservative Party put forward and which the present government 
has adopted as its own.  It is interesting that when things look 
bad, government members point the finger at us.  They would 
probably point the finger at Sir John A. Macdonald if they 
thought they could get away with it.  But when it is an issue 
that has worked well for parts of the country, they take it as 
their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the very important components of these two new agencies 
was precisely the moving of government's regional development 
decision making out of Ottawa and closer to the people it serves. 
This policy helped to address some of the concerns referred to 
by the hon. member for Sydney—Victoria in the motion he has put 
to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously much more needs to be done to help Atlantic Canada. 
The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency was given a legislated 
mandate which in part reads “to increase opportunity for 
economic development in Atlantic Canada and more particularly, to 
enhance the growth of earned income and employment opportunities 
in that region”. In many instances ACOA has achieved those 
goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency has enabled many small 
and medium size businesses in the Atlantic provinces to create 
jobs that otherwise would not exist.  Its involvement in the 
region's economy has resulted in an important net positive 
contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite its success, there have also been some publicized 
failures.  These failures have been harshly criticized for some 
of their business decisions and rightfully so.  Overshadowed by 
this criticism is the fact that there have been countless success 
stories throughout the Atlantic provinces; companies such as 
Tri-Star Industries in Yarmouth which, with the help of ACOA, is 
now exporting ambulances throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are problems with ACOA.  Improvements must be made to 
ensure that Canadian taxpayers are getting true value for their 
investment.  However, unlike the reform party, I do not believe 
in running away from the problem and turning our backs on 
Atlantic Canada.  Let us work together to make necessary changes 
to ACOA so that Atlantic Canadians can benefit from this agency 
and ultimately create new long term jobs for our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the reform party calls for the disbanding of ACOA, it fails 
to recognize the fact that most chartered banks in Atlantic 
Canada are quite reluctant to support a small business venture 
unless it is willing to provide between 30% and 50% of its own 
equity.  Unfortunately most aspiring entrepreneurs are unable to 
meet this demand.  Without ACOA having taken a chance on 
individual projects, many would not have gotten off the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Sydney—Victoria has introduced a motion 
calling upon the government to focus greater attention on regions 
with high rates of unemployment when establishing or expanding 
government offices and agencies.  Unfortunately the opposite 
appears to be happening.  Already the federal government has made 
huge cuts in the federal civil service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a moment to speak to the comments made earlier by my 
hon. colleague on the Liberal side. 
He said that job creation was going very well. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking specifically of my part of the country, the riding 
that I represent, West Nova.  We have seen many jobs in Yarmouth, 
for example, being pushed off to more centralized locations in 
other parts of the province.  These are jobs that are valuable 
and needed in an area where unemployment is too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue which I think is very important is the CBC, the 
links it provides and the potential removal of local broadcasting 
centralized in Toronto.  This is another issue in which the 
government seems to lack the foresight and the intention.  I 
would stress that it should keep pushing to make sure that local 
broadcasting can remain in local areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the weekend the Right Hon. Joe Clark, leader of the PC Party, 
made a commitment to all Atlantic Canadians that our party would 
be working hard on their behalf to help them achieve their 
maximum potential.  As the member for West Nova and a proud 
Atlantic Canadian I will do whatever is necessary to help us 
achieve that goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  If the hon. member for 
Sydney—Victoria, I should advise the House, speaks now he will 
close the debate and exercise his five minute right of rebuttal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank members of the House who participated in the debate for 
their thoughts and for their ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because I only have five minutes I want to comment on the 
remarks of the member for Hamilton West.  I will concentrate 
there first because I am not sure he understood the importance of 
the motion.  He spoke about the accomplishments of his government 
in terms of reducing unemployment.  Again, I do not want to be 
political and I do not want to be critical for the sake of being 
critical.  There are areas in the country where government policy 
has worked extremely well, but there are areas in the country 
where it has not worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As much as Toronto, Ottawa and perhaps Vancouver have unlimited 
growth, it very difficult in regions of the country to pick up 
national newspapers that talk about the unprecedented growth and 
the economic strength of the country and walk out to the main 
street of our downtown and see boarded up buildings and young 
people leaving our communities because the unemployment rate is 
20%, 21%, 24%, and, heaven knows, in some of the native 
communities it is 75%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there is economic growth and that growth is important to 
help carry the regions which do not have the growth, we do not 
want to be carried any more.  We want to be self-sufficient and 
make a contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that they appreciated the intent and were doing 
what the motion says.  Then he went on to talk about the private 
sector.  If that is the belief then all government departments 
should be sent out of this city and the private sector should be 
the sole engine of growth in Ottawa.  Give us the $60 billion of 
the Department of Human Resources Development and put it into the 
main street in my hometown.  I would be happy with it.  Take the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans and put it somewhere in 
Newfoundland.  Take the Department of Transport and put it in 
western Canada.  Let the private sector be the sole engine of 
growth in this city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to get too angry.  When we hear that in other 
regions of the country there is a temptation to say the 
government does not care.  It says that we should do as it says, 
not as it does.  I want to make very clear that if the Liberal 
Party and the member support the intent of the motion, we would 
look forward to receiving some of the things that could be 
located in our area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member from Bras d'Or has written to the Prime 
Minister and suggested that the Canadian Tourism Commission be 
located in Cape Breton.  The government keeps telling us that 
tourism is the way to do that yet there is no sign of it.  When 
this commission is created it would not even be missed in this 
town, but it would be a centre of good jobs and some money 
located in the community I represent.  Then if someone wants to 
open a little coffee shop or a restaurant, he or she knows there 
will be some people there who will spend some money.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for West Nova touched on the CBC.  I think that is a 
prime example.  There is talk of centralizing, of cutting 
regional broadcasting across the country and centralizing the 
whole operation.  Centralizing it where?  In Toronto where the 
government's policies are working, where there is low 
unemployment, where a centralized broadcast is not needed.  One 
of the conditions for the CBC to get some of its licensing was 
that <I>Newsworld</I> would be run and operated out of Halifax. 
There was a commitment to the intent of this motion but now we 
see that being cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been through this in the smaller centres.  We dealt with 
cuts to CBC and the loss of a regional broadcaster and a local 
suppertime news hour 10 years ago when we lost it in Cape Breton 
and it went to Halifax.  Now we are being told it will go from 
Halifax to Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC is a crown corporation and the government does not have 
a complete hands on approach, but surely it would say that its 
intent and in the spirit of the motion, if the regional 
suppertime news hour has to be cut—and I do not think the 
government could justify it—that it should be located somewhere 
in western Canada in an area where there is high unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did a show with Ralph Benmergui one time and that is what he 
said to me.  He talked about Devco and I asked him how many 
people were employed in his building in downtown Toronto by the 
government and paid by taxpayer dollars.  I would like to see a 
little more decentralization.

</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, it is with some disappointment that I am 
here at report stage dealing with amendments which I hoped would 
give some kind of clout to the piece of legislation before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was quite apparent through numerous witnesses at committee 
and numerous comments by committee members that there was much 
fear out there with regard to having a monopoly carrier in 
Canada.  There was a lot of concern from airline travellers, a 
good number of them members of parliament who sat around the 
committee table, and a good many who had horror stories and 
complaints about the way things were already being done since 
December 1999 and January of this year when the merger started to 
show the first signs of how things would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all the talk among committee members and witnesses I was 
initially getting the impression that we would actually see the 
committee put some strong rules in place to control this monopoly 
carrier, to control prices throughout Canada and to provide 
service to communities. 
In spite of all that talk, all that huff and puff, we have before 
us a piece of legislation that is fairly lacking.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hoped that by making some amendments we could at least have a 
bit of meat in the bill to give the Canadian Transportation 
Agency some chance at dealing with a monopoly carrier and to give 
the Competition Tribunal an opportunity to do something.  We 
listened to these two bodies that appeared before us indicate 
that they did not have the rules in place to put the clamps on a 
monopoly carrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the amendments in Group No. 1, I have moved three 
amendments which I believe would certainly give the opportunity 
to provide that.   I will take this opportunity to emphasize 
Motion No. 1 which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every licensee who contravenes subsection (2) is guilty of an 
offence and is liable (a) on summary conviction, to the 
suspension of its licence for a period of up to five years and a 
fine of not more than $25,000; or (b) on conviction on 
indictment, to the suspension of its licence for a period of up 
to five years and a fine of not more than $50,000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the exact similarity, but it was intended that this 
amendment would deal with the situation similar to the one 
involving InterCanadian in the last part of 1999 when it withdrew 
service in a matter of a day or so and a lot of travellers were 
left stranded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think everyone has recognized that in the case of 
InterCanadian there were some real serious financial problems. We 
have rules in place to address that, but a discussion took place 
about situations where a carrier just says to heck with it, does 
not abide by the rules that are in place, does not give the 
required time limits to withdraw service, and goes ahead and 
withdraws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line was that we have rules which say the carrier 
should not do it, but there is no penalty to emphasize that it 
was not okay for the carrier to withdraw the service and start up 
somewhere else.  There should be some kind of penalty in place. 
If a carrier has the means to continue the service and the means 
to give reasonable notice, it should do it.  This amendment would 
give the legislation some clout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had numerous witnesses who appeared before us at committee 
saying that they wanted to know the rules when they got into the 
game.  They did not want to go before the CTA and find out that 
it will do it this way or that way.  They wanted to know upfront 
what the rules were.  That was the indication for the first 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment in Group No. 1 is in relation to the 
Canadian Transportation Agency having to wait to get a complaint 
before it could review a situation.  When we have an agency such 
as the Canadian Transportation Agency and we want it to have the 
power to deal with issues, we should accept that maybe it could 
look at a situation and say that it is not right.  It should be 
able to go in and investigate.  It should not have to wait a 
period of three or four months until unsuspecting consumers get 
up in arms, ask that something be done about it, and realize they 
have to put in a complaint.  We have a qualified group of people 
at the Canadian Transportation Agency.  Let us give them the 
authority to intervene and investigate on its own initiative 
should it see the necessity to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 4 refers to when the agency may want to review the 
pricing.  We heard a whole pile of complaints come across the 
committee table from all members about how terrible the price 
gouging was and about how terrible Air Canada was being already. 
What was the result of the committee?  It wanted to give it six 
months and if it appeared there was a problem the committee would 
review it. 
Boy, did that ever put a lot of meat in the bill; let us give 
them six months and we will see how things happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it recognizes that the agency is qualified and should be 
able to review.  It knows all the different fares involved in the 
airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most passengers do not know the number of fares involved.  They 
do not know what applies in certain instances but the agency 
does. We need to give the agency that opportunity.  We need to 
give it something to go by.  Again this reflects what the 
witnesses said, that they want to know the rules before going in. 
If they know the rules ahead of time, and they know that if the 
increases are above a certain point and there can be an 
investigation, at least it is going to put the clamps on those 
airlines which may decide to raise their prices to heaven knows 
what. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the three motions in Group No. 1. I am not going to go 
on about it.  Members know what has been happening; certainly the 
committee members know.  Over the weekend the government should 
have had a little insight into the fact that the bill has not 
given any clout whatsoever to the Competition Bureau or to the 
CTA in regard to addressing the problems that are going to be.  I 
would hope it would see fit to put some rules in place in the 
legislation so that we are not reviewing some whimsical idea of 
what we think may happen with Air Canada or any other monopoly 
carrier.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to deal with the 
amendments from the New Democratic Party.  I understand the 
reasoning in putting the amendments forward but we believe the 
three amendments should be defeated, notwithstanding the 
sentiments that I understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 mixes the questions of licensing and penalties for 
offences.   I remind hon. members that section 174 of the Canada 
Transportation Act already provides for penalties for 
contravention of section 64 as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every person who contravenes a provision of this Act or a 
regulation or order made under this Act, other than an order made 
under section 47, is guilty of an offence punishable on summary 
conviction and liable 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) in the case of an individual, to a fine not exceeding 
$5,000; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) in the case of a corporation, to a fine not exceeding 
$25,000. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion insofar as it provides for penalties would overlap 
and be inconsistent with section 174.  At the very least we would 
need to provide that section 174 does not apply to any offence 
covered by subsection 2.1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, section 65 provides that in cases of failure to comply 
with section 64 the agency may direct the reinstatement of the 
service, which is considered the most appropriate remedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 removes the time limit during which the agency can 
act on its own motion on review of prices on monopoly routes. 
The government is of the view that such time limits are 
appropriate to cover the transition period.  As we move to a more 
healthy and stable airline industry, the government has given 
itself the latitude to extend the period of time for an 
additional two years if competition is not developed and there 
remains a significant number of monopoly routes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member may be able to make the case that during the 
statutory review of the Canada Transportation Act which must 
begin July 1, this period could be extended even further. 
We are open to that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we debated this in the department, I was very insistent 
that we put this clause in to allow the agency on its own motion 
to review the monopoly prices and have the power to roll back and 
not just wait for complaints.  We have to have a proactive Canada 
Transportation Agency.  We have seen in recent weeks some of the 
inherent dangers.  Notwithstanding all the best intentions that 
Air Canada may espouse, the fact is that when one has 80% of the 
market, there is a tendency to try to push the envelope a bit 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of monopoly prices, we want to make sure that 
small communities are protected.  Even though I believe we are 
going to get a lot of competition in the months ahead, there is 
no question that some of the smaller communities are vulnerable 
because they may not be as attractive to competitors. Therefore, 
the only way we can help the people in those communities is to 
put this particular clause in play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This in effect is going to have a two year life. If toward the 
end of next year we believe that is not going to be enough, then 
I would certainly, if I am still Minister of Transport at that 
time, be open to bringing forward amendments to the Canada 
Transportation Act to entertain extending this motion on its own 
motion authority for the CTA.  The hon. member has made a valid 
point. Even though I think the transition period will deal with 
these issues, we cannot ultimately let the power lapse if indeed 
it is required.  I hope that will help the hon. member even 
though she probably will not withdraw her motion at this stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also think that Motion No. 4 should be defeated.  The current 
process puts the onus on the carrier to produce a fair rate that 
is reasonable in the opinion of the agency.  The effect of this 
motion would allow the agency to fix prices where certain indices 
have been met.  That goes a bit too far in terms of reregulation. 
The government prefers to have the agency retain the discretion 
it would have under the provisions of Bill C-26 as they currently 
read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this was debated in the department a balance had to be 
struck.  If we accept the amendment, we are going further down 
the road to adopting the 1987 psychology with respect to the 
Canada Transportation Act which really reregulates the whole 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though I think my friends in the NDP and others make valid 
points that base airfares have grown unconscionably in the last 
10 years, the fact is that advance booking fares and all the 
other fares one can get with layovers are reasonable. We cannot 
forget that about 90% of the travelling public use that kind of 
method.  The number of people travelling by air today 
proportionate to the population is significantly greater than it 
was before deregulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something which may confuse hon. members and others is that for 
10 years there was a duopoly with Canadian Airlines and Air 
Canada. Everybody talked about it being a competitive environment 
but it was not.  The two carriers knocked themselves over the 
head each and every day putting on too much capacity, but the 
base fares were the same. If Air Canada had a seat sale, Canadian 
Airlines was ready to have one within a few days and vice versa. 
It was a duopoly.  I would not say it was a cartel but it was a 
duopoly and it was unhealthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I travel to Toronto two or three times a week.  Before the 
merger, if a person travelled on an economy or business class 
ticket, the ticket was interchangeable between Canadian Airlines 
or Air Canada.  There was no price break. There was no real 
competition for the business traveller.  We have to be serious 
about competition. Some of the measures in the bill, especially 
on predatory pricing and the powers given to the commissioner, 
will deal with competition in a very strict fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised to hear the member say that the bill needed more 
teeth.  This has to be the toothiest bill that has come forward 
in a long time with respect to regulation of a private sector 
company. 
In fact, it is even toothier as a result of what the hon. members 
and our colleagues did in committee, and I think with good 
reason.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that even though we wanted this bill 
through earlier, the delay in getting it to this stage in the 
House has turned out to be a bit of a blessing in disguise.  We 
have seen some of the effects of the consolidation of Air Canada 
and some of the things we do not like about it.  There have been 
a lot of good things, but we have seen some of the negative 
things.  That is what led hon. members to convince me and my 
colleagues in the government to come forward with another 
commissioner at the CTA.  That alone gives much added protection 
for the consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the powers dealing with the Competition Bureau, 
there was another amendment that came forward from the bureau 
which helped to toughen up the act.  This regime is as tough as 
we want it to get without going back to the old days of 
reregulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With great respect for my hon. colleague, while the three 
motions obviously have merit, they should be defeated.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will probably speak not only to 
Group No. 1 but also to Groups Nos. 2 and 3 so I do not take up 
the House's time later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not surprised that the New Democratic Party has come up 
with an attempt at report stage to reregulate the industry. 
Those attempts were made during the committee hearings.  With all 
due respect, the committee did not support it on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the committee of which I was part. 
It did a super job of reviewing the legislation, at times under 
some stressful situations. It did a good job in looking at the 
legislation and bringing forth some amendments through the 
committee process which, as the minister said, have dealt with a 
number of issues that have identified themselves since the merger 
began in the spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the amendments proposed by the New 
Democratic Party on the Air Canada public participation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great difficulty with government at any time interfering 
with the private entrepreneurial spirit of an individual.  I do 
not think the government has the right to limit how many voting 
shares a Canadian can have in a Canadian company.  Again I am not 
surprised the New Democratic Party has put forward an amendment 
to try to take that back a step rather than move forward in 
taking government out of the operations of and interference in a 
Canadian company.  It will certainly not get support from us to 
do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little disappointed the government also was not prepared 
to take the big step and remove itself from interfering in a 
Canadian company and the operations of such.  I do not think it 
is the role of government to determine what kind of ownership a 
Canadian has in a Canadian company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not surprised that the New Democratic Party challenged the 
foreign ownership and wanted to get rid of any suggestion that 
Air Canada might at some time have the foreign ownership 
component raised.  It wanted to limit it to the 25%. It is 
somewhat ironic and a little hypocritical that the New Democratic 
Party is totally supportive of the automobile industry which is 
100% owned for foreigners.  It does not seem to have the same 
problem with the automobile industry that it does with the 
airline industry.  It is curious that what is good for the 
automobile industry, the NDP does not consider to be good enough 
for the airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have problems with the proposed amendments in that they want 
to penalize people for withdrawing a service that has proved to 
be uneconomical.  They are putting extra burden on a company that 
may decide to try a new route in a smaller community.  Looking 
down the road, that company may have some serious financial 
penalties addressed to it if it chooses not to continue that 
service because it is uneconomical.  We are not going to 
encourage competition by laying the heavy hand on business people 
who are willing to take a risk and try a new route.  We certainly 
cannot support the intentions of those amendments which the 
member has brought forward.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister mentioned the amendments to the legislation which 
offer the teeth to control the monopoly of Air Canada.  We would 
suggest that the teeth which the government has put in the 
legislation are enough.  I do not think we want to interfere any 
more than we have.  We have given cease and desist powers to the 
competition commissioner, powers which are quite extreme in the 
entrepreneurial world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The competition commissioner has also been given a broader 
predatory behaviour designation, which gives him some 
flexibility.  That is a good move because we are not always able 
to identify when we are dealing with legislation what might 
happen in the future which is predatory in nature.  We support 
the government in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that more controls to re-regulate the industry 
certainly will not move us forward into the 21st century, but 
will move us backward.  Therefore, the Canadian Alliance will not 
be supporting the amendments put before the House by the New 
Democratic Party, which is no surprise to my colleague.  We 
believe that the government has a role to play only in trying to 
get a monopoly to understand that it has a responsibility to the 
travelling public.  We feel that the teeth in the legislation are 
enough to hold that company accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look forward to the legislation passing and to controls being 
put on Air Canada to help it through this transitional period. 
There are protections to the travelling public in this 
legislation.  The ability of the new commissioner in his position 
in the Canadian Transportation Agency to act as ombudsman for 
complaints will be an added factor.  We are somewhat disappointed 
that there is no means for that individual to actually resolve 
the problems, but at least he can identify where the problems 
exist and through the other means that the government has can see 
that resolutions are fulfilled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned before, we will not be supporting the amendments 
to this legislation and we look forward to the report stage going 
quickly so we can get on to the third reading of the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this weekend, when I was preparing my speech, I asked 
myself the following question: what is the significance of a 
bill such as the one before us this morning? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By definition, a bill is nothing more or less than an instrument 
of compromise.  It is similar to a collective agreement, where 
the parties have opposing interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I became an MP, I worked in labour relations for 16 years 
and I often drew the following comparison. 
Putting the employer and the union together is like putting two 
scorpions in the same jar to propagate the race. Ultimately a 
compromise and an agreement have to be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today represents this sort of compromise 
between diverging interests.  It is certainly true, for me as 
the Bloc Quebecois representative on the Standing Committee on 
Transport as well as for all the members of my party, that it 
would have been or would be good to improve some parts later on, 
because, by definition, a bill is above all an instrument that 
is perfectible, or capable of improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when it is a question of the sort of situation we have 
had for over a year, with a major carrier experiencing serious 
financial difficulties, we had to define a new legal framework 
for the advent of a so-called dominant carrier.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, there was Air Canada, which has acquired 
Canadian International, and on the other a whole gang of others 
directly or indirectly involved in this restructuring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were the regional and local carriers, the employees' 
unions, the travel agents, and consumer groups.  Each of these 
many groups was profoundly convinced that the situation needed 
organization and regularization. We ought therefore to have a 
game plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to just give the speech I intend to give on third 
reading.  I will have an opportunity to come back to that. 
This morning, what I want to do is comment on the first group of 
amendments introduced by my NDP colleague for Churchill who is, 
I might point out in passing, a highly professional colleague 
who has followed the committee's deliberations most seriously 
and always comes up with reasonable opinions.  Although 
sometimes the concerns she has expressed differ from ours, I 
wish to thank her for her contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to get off on a diatribe on this, but I do wish to 
say that my party engaged in a serious exercise around the 
proposed amendments to Bill C-26.  I respectfully submit to my 
colleague from Churchill that they impose a framework which we 
consider far too rigid, paralyzing or constraining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, it is true that we had to set new rules based 
on the fact that one company, Air Canada, was becoming a 
dominant carrier. However, we also had to ensure quality 
services, with the emphasis on frequency of flights, on time 
departures and arrivals and affordable airfares for people from 
all regions, particularly those of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people, who have to transit toward major centres, often 
use small local and regional carriers. One of the main concerns 
of the Bloc Quebecois members who represent Quebec regions was 
to ensure that these regional and local carriers could discuss 
on an equal footing with the new giant created by Air Canada, 
which accounts for 80% to 85% of the Canadian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, the amendments proposed by the member for 
Churchill are much too constraining, rigid and almost impossible 
to apply. For these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will oppose 
three out of the four motions: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3, with which we agree, would amend clause 4 of the 
bill, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(6) The Agency may make a finding...on its own motion within 
two years after the date this subsection comes into force. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion proposed by the hon. member for Churchill seeks to 
remove the two year restriction, by stating that the agency can 
make a finding immediately. We agree with this motion, which 
also has the effect of removing the power of the governor in 
council to extend for two years the period within which the 
agency may make a finding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, with respect to the amendments in Group No. 1, the 
Bloc Quebecois will vote against Motions Nos. 1, 2 and 4 
proposed by the New Democratic Party, but will vote for Motion 
No. 3.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise on this subject as we near the end of 
the great debate about the airline mergers and the changes to the 
Canada Transportation Act and the Air Canada Public Participation 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to compliment the member for Churchill for her amendments 
proposed in Group No. 1, which include Motions Nos. 1 through 4. 
Certainly she has been a very attentive and effective critic and 
member of our committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, we are going through a really interesting 
transition as these two airlines come together and we see other 
airlines either starting up or expanding.  Obviously we have a 
work in progress.  Everything we do as a government and all the 
legislation we pass must be flexible to allow these things to 
happen.  Even we have been surprised, and certainly Air Canada 
has been surprised I believe, by some of the new proposals that 
are on the table for regional airlines, discount airlines and 
expansions.  There is a lot of entrepreneurial interest in the 
aviation industry, which certainly surprised me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the effective merger of Air Canada and Canadian Airlines 
we have seen a lot inconvenience to consumers, confusion, 
overbooking, delays, scheduling problems and all those sorts of 
things, which I think were a surprised to Air Canada and 
certainly have been a surprise to consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Air Canada is dealing with so many issues, such as 
scheduling aircraft, union negotiations and slots at airports, I 
believe that it underestimated the impact on consumers.  I 
believe this is a transitional issue.  I believe Air Canada will 
fix it.  I believe the will is there and that Air Canada really 
understands how serious it is and how big the problem is.  Again, 
I detect the will to fix it and I am confident it will be 
corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the future perhaps a dominant carrier would not recognize the 
effect on consumers, so we need Bill C-26 to protect those 
consumers from a dominant carrier or monopoly situation that 
would not address or care about consumers.  That is what we are 
here to talk about today in the amendments put forth by the hon. 
member for Churchill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe and our party believes that the government's position 
should be one that encourages competition in every way possible, 
one that encourages the entrepreneurial instincts which we see 
are alive and well in the industry.  If there is one thing that 
impressed me throughout the debate and throughout the discussions 
and the presentations by so many organizations, it was the 
entrepreneurial instinct in the aviation industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are airlines in Canada that I had never heard of, and I 
was really impressed with them.  I think the government should 
encourage these new companies.  It should encourage new routes 
and it should encourage new ventures.  That should be part of 
everything it does, to create the infrastructure and the 
framework to encourage the entrepreneurial instinct to provide 
competition for the dominant carrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, we have to provide protection for consumers in 
a monopoly situation because without competition they are without 
protection.  There is no choice.  If people are unhappy with the 
airline and they are travelling back and forth from Atlantic 
Canada, if they are unhappy with the flights, with the treatment, 
with overbookings or delays, there is no place to go.  We cannot 
go to airline <I>B</I> any more.  There is no competition.  I 
believe that Air Canada is striving as quickly as it can.  I 
think a big indication of its will to fix the problems is the 
recent announcement that it will appoint an ombudsman, a proposal 
which it flatly turned down about two weeks ago.  It did not 
think it was necessary.  It did not think there should be an 
ombudsman.  However, it announced last week that it will appoint 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has put in place a complaints commissioner through 
the CTA, which was an excellent move.  I had proposed an 
amendment to the bill to bring in an ombudsman.  The minister's 
amendment, as much as I hate to say it, was better than my 
amendment.  It had more teeth in it.  I applaud him for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are dealing with the amendments put forth by the member 
for Churchill, which I will summarize briefly. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT21"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT21"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1245

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 establishes penalties in the event that an airline 
does an early pullout on a route.  It sets the penalties between 
$25,000 and $50,000 maximum, depending on the circumstances. I 
see the point and the argument of that but my position and my 
approach would be to encourage entrepreneurs and competition. I 
believe this motion does a little more than is necessary.  I do 
not believe the CTA needs these powers. It takes away some 
flexibility.  It sounds like re-regulation.  We in this party 
want to stay away from that as much as we can, while at the same 
time protect consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 seems to define the terms of monopoly.  It appears 
to deny a dominant or monopoly carrier the right to defend itself 
in the designation of the Canada Transportation Agency of a 
monopoly.  I do not think that is right.  It should have the 
right to defend itself or at least express its opinions or 
concerns about any decision the CTA makes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 takes away the time limit provided in the bill to 
two years, plus an optional extension on that.  Again, I do not 
think we need that.  The bill provides enough time and 
flexibility by the CTA to deal with this issue.  I would think 
that a four year period would give plenty of time to deal with 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understand Motion No. 4 correctly, it defines the 
thresholds where CTA would act.  It kind of ties down the CTA. 
This is a work in progress that is changing day by day.  We see 
fundamental changes on behalf of the dominant carrier. Air Canada 
is now changing the rules and adapting as fast as it can to many 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fundamental change of direction on the ombudsman 
point of view.  Two weeks ago it said that it did not want an 
ombudsman, that it was unnecessary.  Last week it announced that 
it would have its own ombudsman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a work in progress.  I think it is important to leave 
the flexibility in this for the airlines and for the Canada 
Transportation Agency and the Department of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there are some motions that we could support, and I can 
see the arguments back and forth, overall, because of the way 
they are grouped, we will be voting no on this group of 
amendments.  I do respect the member for all the good work she 
has done on her amendments here today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to speak to these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP, as my colleague already stated, is not content to have 
a powerless complaints commissioner and a vague promise to look 
at pricing in the future.  The time to protect what we have is 
right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example of pricing.  The price of a regular 
ticket to fly down east from the Yukon is $4,000.  The minister 
mentioned that there are ticket sales.  Everyone I know does book 
in advance, as do I over the summer, in order to get the cheapest 
flights available, but that was when we had some choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian Airlines has always had a monopoly in the Yukon. From 
time to time, other carriers have come in during the summer 
months to address the tourist season.  Right now everyone is 
facing less choices, less chance of a flight, less room on the 
flight and less flights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian Airlines will not be putting its third flight in over 
the summer.  However, many people have accumulated points.  A lot 
of people in the north do that because it is a way to get 
themselves and their families out of the north for a holiday. 
Since they are down at the very bottom of the pecking order, it 
gets more and more difficult to get a flight out of the Yukon on 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people come to me when there is a death or an illness 
in the family and they have to get back east. They are looking at 
$4,000 for a ticket and have to pay that up front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The north also has to deal with the Medivacs that fly to 
treatment centres in Vancouver or Edmonton.  There is generally 
an escort, depending upon the seriousness of the condition.  If a 
nurse is required, then the nurse travels with the person who is 
ill and a family member cannot go.  Sometimes there are 
allowances.  If the illness is not serious, a family member can 
go with the person and stay with him or her at the hospital. 
This is really critical for elders and seniors who become very 
disoriented and cannot make their way around.  If they have to go 
out for cancer treatment and stay for a long time, they have to 
make their way back and forth from the hotel and deal with all 
the consequences of the illness.  Most family members cannot 
afford to fly to and be with that person.  Even a bargain ticket 
costs anywhere between $600 to $1000.  A regular ticket from 
Whitehorse to Vancouver is $1600.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of a young woman who needs dialysis treatment every 
second or third day.  She is living in Vancouver completely 
isolated from her community of Haines Junction.  No one can 
afford to fly out to see her.  There is no dialysis treatment in 
the Yukon.  These stories go on and on.  Since I have been MP in 
the Yukon, the prices of flights have gone up by at least $800. 
People cannot count on the transportation system to get them out 
in an emergency or during a family crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one is fortunate enough to plan his or her travel months in 
advance sometimes it will work out.  I was talking to an elderly 
woman who tried to arrange a flight three or four months in 
advance.  Some flights no longer exist today which means a delay 
of three to four days for her to get back to the Yukon.  Flights 
into remote communities are limited by time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has said that the government should not be 
involved at all in any business.  We are talking about 
transportation over a huge country.  It is absolutely critical 
for the government to be involved and for the Canadian people to 
have a say in the transportation policy through their government 
and through their elected members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not have the ability to travel from one end of this 
country to the other, there is no sense thinking we are a part of 
this country.  It is a three day drive to get out of the Yukon. 
If we need to get out of the Yukon because of illness, an 
emergency or even to take a holiday to Vancouver or Edmonton, it 
is at least a three-day drive.  It would take a week to 10 days 
to drive across the country to visit family on the east coast. 
Transportation is critical to all areas of our lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that a duopoly was unhealthy in this country. 
I happen to agree but at least we had some choice.  Even as a 
member of parliament, I had some choice on which flights I could 
connect with to get back home or get down here.  I have to travel 
a day in either direction to be at work.  If a duopoly was 
unhealthy, how healthy can a monopoly be?   I have no idea what 
we will be facing when it comes to price changes.  It is nothing 
that I look forward to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Canada Transportation Agency should have the power 
to review fare increases on its own without waiting for action on 
some other front.  It should have the permanent ability to act on 
pricing.  The minister did hint that if he was still minister he 
would extend it.  I do not think as a government or as a people 
we should be depending on perhaps a promise to think about it. 
Before we go any further, we should have concrete guidelines and 
rules set out that people can actually count on and know what 
they are facing as much as we can know when heading into this 
next century.

</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, Motions Nos. 5 and 6 in Group No. 2 have 
been up for much discussion during the whole airline merger 
debate.  They specifically deal with the ownership of shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5 deals with the 10% ownership share in Air Canada. 
We all know why the 10% was initially put into the first Air 
Canada Public Participation Act legislation.  It was to ensure 
the broad ownership of shares within Air Canada and to ensure 
that Canadians had an opportunity to be very involved and to give 
a chance to people throughout the nation to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6 deals with the 25% ownership rule.  I propose to 
keep the Air Canada share ownership limit at 10%.  The new 
legislation changes it to 15%.  I want to entrench the foreign 
ownership limit, currently at 25% in the legislation.  As was 
indicated by the member from the Canadian Alliance, they do not 
care one way or another if foreign companies literally own 
everything in Canada.  They make no bones about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, I do care.  I care that Canadians have control 
over crucial elements in society; over transportation that needs 
to be provided to all of Canada, not just Vancouver, Toronto, 
Calgary, Edmonton and Halifax.  We are talking about the whole 
country.  We want to make sure that we have control over 
companies that benefit from the opportunity of providing a 
service in Canada.  As a result, we believe that in a crucial 
industry such as our air industry there should be limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now the Minister of Transport and cabinet have the power 
to increase the foreign ownership cap up to 49%.  The New 
Democratic Party is not opposed to increasing foreign investment 
in Canada but we think the decision should be made in 
consultation with parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that members of the Canadian Alliance 
are always saying that everything should come to parliament and 
that the government should not be doing this or that.  In this 
particular case, because it is allowing foreign ownership to take 
over everything, they do not care if it comes to parliament.  Let 
the governor in council order it up to 49%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entrenching the 25% limit in the legislation would require 
another act of parliament in the future to change it, 
guaranteeing that it would be voted on and that all Canadians 
would have a say as to whether or not they wanted to see 
ownership of their airline either increased to 49% or increased 
to 100%.  At least Canadians would have a say through their 
members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 will increase Air Canada share ownership from 10% to 
15%.  We propose leaving it at the 10% which was formerly in the 
legislation.  Raising this to 15% opens the door for a 
non-hostile takeover attempt.  Many industry stakeholders have 
expressed concerns about allowing Air Canada to fall under the 
sway of a dominant shareholder.  We agree with stakeholders that 
the public interest is best served if Air Canada remains under 
the control of a broad cross-section of Canadian shareholders not 
a single dominant shareholder.  This motion would close the door 
to that dominant shareholder scenario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, it is of real importance to recognize that Canadian 
taxpayers over the years have been very supportive of Canadian 
Airlines and Air Canada. 
As a result, I do not think we should ever look at Air Canada or 
Canadian Airlines, or any company that has had much support from 
Canadian taxpayers, the same as any other, just up for sale, 
willy-nilly to whomever.  Canadians do have a real interest in 
the corporation and should have a say over what happens.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak to the second group of 
motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5, in effect, would negate the point in the bill to 
increase the shareholder limit from 10% to 15% in the Air Canada 
Public Participation Act.  Without doubt this was certainly one 
of the two pivotal issues that came to the fore during this 
entire restructuring, the other being the use by the government 
of section 47 of the Canada Transportation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, the superior court in Quebec made a ruling 
about one of the private sector proposals put forward by Onex 
Corp.  The court said that technically it was against the law, 
and the inference was that it should not proceed.  Onex decided 
not to appeal the decision and, as a result, the remaining 
private sector option, the Air Canada offer, which has been 
implemented in the last few months, was the one that came 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some issues as to whether it is a good idea to have 
limits on individual shareholder participation in these 
companies.  When Canadian National and Air Canada were 
privatized, as well as some other crown corporations, it was felt 
that by having a shareholder limit of 10% or 15%, as in the case 
of Canadian National, this would somehow dissuade a foreign 
takeover.  We could understand this in the case of Canadian 
National because 65% of the shares of Canadian National are owned 
by people outside Canada.  Obviously there is a 25% foreign 
ownership limit on Air Canada, and on Canadian airlines in 
general.  Therefore, the argument that there could, in effect, be 
a de facto foreign takeover is really not valid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The limit could increase to 20% or 25% and have foreign equity 
and voting control, but still remain Canadian controlled.  This 
happened with American Airlines when it injected money into 
Canadian Airlines some years ago.  It had 33% of the equity and 
25% of the voting shares.  That it had to be kept at 10% to 
prevent a foreign takeover became a very emotional issue during 
the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not kid ourselves.  This kind of rule makes it very 
difficult for outside groups to exercise normal business 
behaviour and vie for control of companies.  This protects 
existing management.  It entrenches existing management and 
existing directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada argued very strenuously that it would not want it to 
go above 15%, and the government reflected upon that.  Both 
committees of the Senate and the House wanted the limit to go up 
to 20%, but the government took the view, given all of the 
turmoil created with the section 47 process, which I think was 
very valid because it did find private sector solutions, that Air 
Canada should be allowed to digest this acquisition without the 
fear of a third party coming along and staging a raid on the 
company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the government agreed to increase it to 15%. 
Air Canada is in agreement with that.  I do not think it should 
be debated at this point in time.  It will be for politicians in 
the future to decide whether the arguments remain valid. 
Certainly, for the next 18 months to two years during this 
restructuring process, this is something we should put aside.  It 
was a very difficult issue to deal with, a very emotional issue 
to deal with and as a result I think we should vote this down.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, Motion No. 6 should be defeated because its purpose 
is to negate the government decision to bring the provisions of 
the Air Canada Public Participation Act in line with the Canada 
Transportation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Failure to implement the proposal in Bill C-26 is to make it 
possible to increase the limit on foreign ownership by regulation 
for all of the industry except Air Canada.  The motion means that 
it would continue to take an amendment of the act to increase Air 
Canada's limit on foreign ownership, an unfair burden on a 
national carrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this should be rejected.  I would hope my friends in the 
New Democratic Party would understand that this is something that 
was agreed to with Air Canada as part of the deal.  I know they 
have strong feelings for 10%, but I would ask them before they 
force a recorded division to reflect upon this because the 10% 
clause has been raised to 15% with the agreement of Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is for us as parliamentarians to disagree with 
a deal that has been negotiated between the Competition Bureau 
and Air Canada to put this matter to rest.  It is not as if Air 
Canada is asking any one party in the House to carry its cause. 
In fact, I think that when the president of Air Canada came to 
the committee he made it quite clear that he accepted 15% and 
would live with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that these two motions should be rejected.  With 
respect to Motion No. 6, if my friends in the New Democratic 
Party are concerned that somehow there is a Trojan horse, I have 
said consistently that it is not our intention to increase the 
foreign ownership of the airlines beyond 25%.  We already have 
the statutory authority to go to 49%.  We do not intend to do 
that because we believe, Canadians believe and I know that the 
New Democratic Party believes that one of the cardinal issues we 
have to face is the growing foreign domination of our economy, 
and we do not want that to happen with the airlines.  We are in 
agreement with the NDP on that point.  However, as I have 
mentioned, if we fail to make the change in clause 17 we would 
not even be allowing Air Canada the benefit of having the 25% 
foreign ownership that others are entitled to.  I think we have 
to treat Air Canada with some degree of fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a question about losing control.  Neither of these 
amendments would do anything.  They would not change the fact 
that the Air Canada regime will have some stability throughout 
this re-organization process.  Certainly, with respect to the 25% 
issue, members of the committee, in fact members on my own side 
have said that it should be raised to more than 25%.  I have 
discussed it with cabinet and we believe it should remain at 25%. 
We are not playing games.  We will not raise it to 49% next week. 
I would ask my friends in the New Democratic Party, once again, 
to continue their great co-operation on this matter and agree to 
allow this particular vote to pass on division so that we do not 
unduly delay the bill any further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day that the bill does not get dealt with gives licence to 
the monopoly tendencies of Air Canada to push the envelope. 
Notwithstanding what it may say, it is natural that when a 
corporation has that much authority it likes to test it in the 
marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to get this bill to the other place so that it can deal 
with it.  Right after the break it should be in place.  Then the 
competition commissioner can start to use the cease and desist 
powers, which will give absolute comfort to all those new 
entrants who come into the market.  I want to talk about that at 
third reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to the second group of motions presented 
by my colleague from the New Democratic Party, the hon. member 
for Churchill, to the Standing Committee on Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to do is to quickly remind the minister, and 
everyone else—I hope no one will think we are suffering from 
collective amnesia—that the Bloc Quebecois position on this 10% 
rule on individual share ownership was that it was a major 
point, in order to avoid having an individual or a group of 
individuals take over control of Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this 10% rule had been introduced when Air Canada was 
privatized in 1988, we were convinced, and we still are, that 
this rule would still be meaningful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of our audience, I would like to dispel any 
ambiguity.  The Bloc Quebecois would be in favour of Air Canada 
taking over control of Canadian International, rather than the 
bid from Mr. Schwartz, representing Onex, that friend of the 
Liberals and Liberal bagman.  It has been discovered that 
Mr. Schwartz had made a considerable contribution to the Liberal 
election fund in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will remind all hon. members that the Bloc Quebecois was not 
at war with either Mr. Schwartz or Onex.  The Bloc Quebecois 
position was clear at that time.  We felt, and still do, that 
the Onex bid to acquire Air Canada was illegal, and this has 
been confirmed by a Quebec superior court decision. 
Although the package was wrapped up earlier at a meeting with 
the Minister of Transport, we believed that the Onex offer was 
illegal.  We had nothing against Mr. Schwartz or Onex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois even introduced a motion on an opposition day 
asking the government to not increase the rule of 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier in my remarks on the first group, a bill 
is a set of compromises.  We think that the amendment proposed 
by my colleague in the New Democratic Party to maintain the 10% 
rule is reasonable.  We support her proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to say to the government that the compromise in Bill 
C-26 of having 15% individual ownership is also satisfactory. 
If the government had followed the lead of the Liberal majority 
on the Standing Committee on Transport, which wanted to increase 
the figure to 20%, the question would be different.  Twenty per 
cent of the individual shares of Air Canada gave effective 
control, whereas 15% does not and ensure sufficient protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the second motion in this second group, I inform my NDP 
colleague that we will be favourable.  Unlike our Canadian 
Alliance colleagues, we opposed the fact of raising the figure 
for foreign participation in controlling Air Canada shares 
beyond 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is odd to see Quebec sovereignists like us defending Canadian 
sovereignty against the Americans.  This is why, although the 
Liberal majority on the committee encouraged it to go as high as 
49%, we are happy to see that the bill limited everything to 25%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the minister is keeping for himself in the residual 
powers, the option of increasing it by order in council with the 
support of three ministers of the crown.  We feel that 25% 
foreign control is enough to maintain Canadian and Quebec funds 
in the new Air Canada.  For all these reasons, we support the 
two amendments moved by our NDP colleague.

unnecessary.  The bill already states that the Official Languages 
Act would be respected.  Personally, I think that is all that is 
required.  The motion is redundant. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did 
not want to get up and unduly delay any activity in the House, 
but I have had the privilege and the honour of being the chair of 
the Standing Committee on Transport.  I also have had the 
privilege of being a member of the Standing Committee on 
Transport since 1988 when I was first elected.  I spent five 
years in opposition and when we became the government in 1993 I 
was chairman and had the privilege of being the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Transport, three of them, and then 
chairman of the transport committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an understanding of where the opposition is coming from 
in the hope that its motion at report stage of the bill would be 
successful. However I must appeal to the members of the New 
Democratic Party. If they had talked to the employees of the 
airlines, both Air Canada and Canadian Airlines, then certainly 
they would understand that they are making it increasingly 
difficult for Air Canada to meet its commitments to all the 
employees not just of Air Canada but also of Canadian Airlines 
where there are 16,000 people working.  By rolling back from 15% 
in the agreement of December 21 to 10% will limit the airline's 
ability to generate the revenue it must in order to support its 
employees and to meet its commitment to keep those employees 
employed. This is about saving 16,000 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any delay will also trigger a chain of events. By asking the 
House to delay the vote until tomorrow means we must return 
tomorrow night to vote on this amendment and then our House 
leaders will have to find another day for third reading debate. 
Then we will have lost a week.  I am sure it is not the intention 
of the New Democratic Party to lose a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that any amount of delay will delay the oversight 
ability that is built into the bill.  That is what is important. 
It is important for the travelling public.  It is important for 
the employees of the airlines.  It is important for the regions 
of the country to be served.  Therefore we do not want to do 
that.  I would hope that the NDP would see the advantage of 
moving on, and thereby would not call a vote that we would have 
to carry to tomorrow night, but to move along to the next motion 
and if need be, pass that motion on division.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to these amendments.  As I said earlier, 
this has been a very interesting debate all the way through the 
several months we have been involved with it.  We have seen many 
changes and a lot of transition. 
We are seeing transition every day.  This is a work in progress. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party believes that the flexibility must be left in the 
system to change direction as things change. We have seen 
dramatic changes and surprises all the way through the debate, 
especially since the airline merger itself.  Some of us thought 
that this would put a lot of the problems to bed. Instead it has 
initiated all kinds of new changes, new challenges, new airlines, 
new proposals, new entrepreneurs, new routes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, flexibility is very much a part of our position on the 
bill. It has to be in there for the Department of Transport to 
make changes as things unfold and as situations change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Motion No. 5 to change the Air Canada public participation 
act, if I remember correctly the committee passed a motion to 
increase the ownership limit to 20%.  Then the government rolled 
it back to 15%.  The NDP motion now is to roll it back even 
further to 10%.  As luck would have it during the debate in 
committee on the most practical and appropriate percentage, I 
proposed 15% and the Minister of Transport took my advice and put 
in 15% exactly what I recommended.  He is to be credited with his 
good judgment and his good consultation powers in consideration 
of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be hard-pressed to support the amendment if I had 
proposed it in the first place.  Even though it was defeated at 
committee, the minister in his wisdom saw fit to bring it back, 
so I am afraid I have to stick with the 15%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the foreign ownership limit of 25% in Motion No. 6, I also 
agree that the power should be left to the governor in council. 
Again it is flexibility in the system.  The government has the 
power to change that if at some time in the future it feels it is 
necessary.  It does not have to come back to the legislature.  It 
can be changed after consultation with the industry and as things 
unfold.  This is a work in progress.  The government has to have 
the flexibility to change because we are all getting surprises as 
this merger takes hold and things evolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to support the bill as it was originally put 
forward.  We will not be voting in favour of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is certainly not the intention of the NDP to hold up this 
legislation, although one has to show some amusement at the 
crocodile tears the member from Hamilton was about to shed in 
great quantities.  Imagine after all this and the NDP members 
want to hold up things for a day so they can vote on their 
amendments. This will put a chain of events in motion.  Heaven 
forbid, we would not want to be responsible for the catastrophe 
the member from Hamilton was about to predict should we not be 
co-operative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we have made our point both in terms of the moving of 
the amendments and the arguments that were put forward on behalf 
of those amendments by the hon. member for Churchill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the minister.  It was a plea for flexibility. 
However I have to preface my remarks by saying that in the 
interest of getting this regime into practice, into law so that 
we can see if it works, to see if some of the things that we are 
worried about actually need the kind of fixing that we say it 
will, why should we trust the Liberal government?  Maybe we 
should trust the Minister of Transport, but why should we trust 
the Liberal government when it comes to questions of foreign 
ownership? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are the people who as far as I am concerned 
perpetrated one of the greatest acts of economic sabotage, 
treason, that I have ever seen in Canadian history with the sale 
of the Canadian National Railway. They are the people who want us 
to trust them when it comes to questions of foreign ownership, 
the people who did something which has now resulted in a national 
railway that was once owned by the Canadian people is now owned 
60% by American shareholders. 
And the Liberal government has the nerve to stand and say “Trust 
us when it comes to foreign ownership”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Are you talking about Doug Young? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  I do not even want to talk about Doug 
Young because I do not want to spoil my day, nor that of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that they have seen the light.  I hope they 
have because if they had not seen the light soon, there would be 
nothing left to sell off to the Americans.  In fact, many people 
in this country not just on the left but even within the 
corporate community are saying that this has not turned out the 
way they thought it would.  Head offices are moving. We do not 
have the same kind of economic infrastructure that we used to 
have.  Maybe all this free trade and lack of protection from 
foreign investment is not working out the way we thought it 
would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the ghost of Walter Gordon, not the ghost of Tom Kent 
because he is still around, but the ghosts of others asking what 
has happened to the Liberal Party.  If the kinds of things the 
minister said in the House today are to be taken seriously, we 
hope that perhaps there is a bit of a turnaround over there, but 
we do say that it comes late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Prime Minister say the other day?  It was not the 
Minister of Transport; perhaps he has said these kind of things, 
but I hope not.  The Prime Minister says the kinds of things that 
give us the anxiety that all this will be done, this monopoly 
situation, in the name of creating a context in which in two, 
three or four years from now the government, whether it is a 
Liberal government or whatever kind of government—but of course 
an NDP government would not be saying it—will be saying that now 
we have to allow American airlines to operate more fully in 
Canada in order to compete with this monopoly that people are 
complaining about.  In fact people are already complaining about 
it in many respects in terms of regional service, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just could not let it pass, the irony of having the Minister 
of Transport and others on the government side saying “Trust us 
when it comes to questions of foreign ownership” because they 
are the ones who did the dirty deeds that not even the Tories did 
in nine years of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember Harvie Andre saying that he wanted to privatize the 
CNR in 1979 and all through those years the Tories never did it. 
Who criticized them for nine years in the House?  I listened to 
all of it.  The Liberals.  And then what did they do?  They 
out-Toried the Tories, not just in terms of privatizing the CNR, 
but they became an uncritical cheerleader for every free trade 
agreement that came along.  We had to watch that we did not talk 
to the Liberals for too long or they would want to sign a free 
trade agreement with us even if we had nothing to trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is the beginning of something new, that would be nice, 
but I am not going to put any money on it.  I rest with those 
words in the interests of seeing this bill get to the other place 
and into force so we can see what needs to be done and we can 
begin this new era in Canadian air transportation and see what 
else needs to be done.  I am sure this bill will not be the final 
word having been drafted by Liberals as it was.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, first I would like to offer my sincere 
congratulations to a group of workers from the airline industry 
who have been fighting since 1976 to make sure francophones in 
Canada have equal opportunities in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring of course to a group called the Association des 
gens de l'air du Québec, which was created in 1976, following a 
battle that begun in 1975, to allow a francophone pilot, in his 
cockpit, to speak French with an air traffic controller in an 
airport control tower or in an air traffic control centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that the association won its fight, because 
it was proven that having two francophones speaking French to 
each other does not jeopardize air safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will also recall that two anglophone unions, CALPA and 
CATCA, fought tooth and nail against that measure. I remember 
they both fought hard. But the government of the day agreed to 
amend the act to allow two francophones to have the right to 
speak to each other in their language.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We Bloc Quebecois members often hear it said in the House that 
this country, Canada, is ours, that as francophones, we can 
express our views, that we have the same rights as anglophones. 
This is constantly being pounded into us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember how, three days before the last referendum, in 1995, 
many western Canadians made the trip to Montreal's Place du 
Canada, having paid $99 return for a Canadian Airlines charter 
from Vancouver, to tell Quebecers that they loved them and urge 
them not to leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:  </B>I love you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> The Minister of Transport is professing his 
love for me. 
How perfect; he is shouting to me from across the floor that he 
loves me.  If he wants to prove that he loves me or that he 
loves francophones, he should vote in favour of my amendment.  I 
extend my hand to him—and I know that he is a reasonable man.  He 
has a French-sounding name.  We know that the name of the 
Minister of Transport, which I cannot say in the House, is 
Huguenot in origin, and that some of his ancestors are French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, I think that the battle fought by Les Gens de l'air in 
1976 is again deserving of support.  I know that when the 
minister and the Canadian Alliance member address the House 
later on, they are going to make a short statement saying that 
they do not agree with the amendments. 
In any case, I heard my Alliance colleague's comments in the 
second group of amendments by the NDP.  I am familiar with these 
amendments and I know that the Minister of Transport will be 
open and sensitive to these amendments and accordingly perhaps 
agree to our amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the House to go a bit further.  I recognize that the 
government has made an effort in Bill C-26.  But I think that 
francophones should be given an equal chance, as the figures are 
not very eloquent.  I do not know if the House is aware, but I 
inform it that today and at the end of 1999 and in early 2000, 
Canadian International had 1,258 pilots.  Of this number, there 
were only 71 francophones, representing 5.8% of the pilot 
population. 
If it is acknowledged that francophones represent 24.8% of the 
Canadian population there should be something like 24.8% 
francophone pilots with our airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from an editorial in <I>Le Soleil</I> of January 31, 1985. 
Although it was in 1985, it still is relevant.  It was written 
by Roger Bellefeuille, and reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Francophones are entitled to their fair and reasonable share in 
what used to be known as Trans-Canada Airlines.  Quebecers want 
to go off with the others, but not in second class seats. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these remarks on an amendment that I am putting forward on 
official languages, I call on the common sense of the president 
of Air Canada, Robert Milton. 
He is an American working in Montreal who respects Canada's 
linguistic duality.  I know that he is working to learn French 
and that he is very sensitive to the place francophones occupy 
in Canada and in his airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on Mr. Milton, and say to him “When you, Mr. Milton, the 
president of the major airline that Air Canada has become, put 
your fist on the table and make a commitment to promote the 
employment of francophones, I want you to know that doing so 
carries a certain weight.  To remind you of this, I am going to 
quote two of your predecessors”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote Claude Taylor, and then Pierre Jeanniot.  Let us 
look at what Mr. Jeanniot had to say at the fifth convention of 
the Association des Gens de l'Air, in April 1980: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for Air Canada to be a truly Canadian company, we 
believe that Air Canada employees of both official language 
groups should reflect the community, the province and the 
country, both in their numbers and in their representativity 
within Air Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were the words of former Air Canada President Jeanniot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now let us look at what Claude Taylor, Air Canada President in 
1981, had to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada acknowledges its vital role in maintaining national 
unity.  This means, essentially, that its role is to bring 
Canadians closer to one another, to make it possible for them to 
meet each other, to communicate, to come to know each other, to 
understand what it is to be a Canadian.  This is the area in 
which, in my opinion, we have had our greatest successes, the 
ones of which we are the most proud. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two, both of whom have headed a major airline, Air Canada, 
acknowledge linguistic duality.  This bill, in my opinion, 
offers us the opportunity to confirm it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is not all that rosy at the present time.  I have 
already painted a picture of the situation with Canadian 
International. 
Let us now look at the francophone representation at Air Canada 
overall.  In 1998, the percentage of francophones was at the 
same level as in 1978, with only 17% of all Air Canada employees 
speaking French.  In 1998, the percentage for pilots was 15.8%. 
The number of French-speaking pilots required at Air Canada has 
not therefore been reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I am calling upon the government to think seriously 
about the legislative amendments we are proposing in order to 
give our bill a little more teeth, so as to lend more weight to 
French in hiring, in maintenance manuals, to make more room for 
living and working in French within Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not mean to say that there is any ill will.  What I do mean 
is that it would be a good idea for a president, in this case 
Mr. Milton, to put his foot down and say “Now listen, there are 
24.8% francophones in Canada; our francophone new graduates 
deserve to be given a chance”.  The Cegep in Chicoutimi trains 
excellent pilots.  I would point out in passing, that it costs 
$100,000 a year to train a young francophone man or woman.  I 
think they are entitled to the hope of one day joining the ranks 
of Air Canada personnel.  I trust that the government is going 
to think about this and pass our amendment with respect to the 
Official Languages Act.

Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in this debate on the 
amendment proposed by the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans to Bill C-26. I 
appreciate the arguments raised by the hon. member and I want to 
alleviate his fears by saying that I like him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the outset, this government has clearly established that 
Canadians must be able to count on their national carrier to 
serve them in the official language of their choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with safety, that is one of the two fundamental concerns 
that must be met, as we prepare to restructure our airline 
industry. Considering that our linguistic duality is an integral 
part of Canada's identity, that position should come as no 
surprise to anyone.

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments proposed by the hon. member opposite can be 
summarized as follows: to directly impose on Air Canada's 
subsidiaries the provisions of the Official Languages Act on the 
language of work, part V, and the representation of linguistic 
minorities. part VI; to create for Air Canada and the 
subsidiaries that it controls a requirement to submit reports to 
the Treasury Board regarding their employee population; to allow 
the Commissioner of Official Languages to investigate complaints 
relating to delays in complying with part VI in the case of 
subsidiaries controlled by Air Canada; to impose on the governor 
in council an obligation to consult the linguistic group 
adversely affected before making a decision regarding the 
measures to be taken if a subsidiary controlled by Air Canada 
fails to comply with part VI; to require Air Canada to make 
available certain documents in both official languages, one year 
after the coming into force of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Briefly stated, the government's position on these amendments is 
that they are not necessary, that they represent an unreasonable 
extension of the guidelines in the Official Languages Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to explain our reasoning. 
One of the main purposes of the Official Languages Act is to 
ensure that Canadians can receive services in the official 
language of their choice from federal institutions and be 
represented within those institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada is no longer a federal institution per se but, in 
order to maintain existing linguistic rights, the Act to 
incorporate Air Canada stipulated that Air Canada would continue 
to be fully subject to the Official Languages Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 creates a precedent by extending the obligations of an 
entity subject to the Official Languages Act to its 
subsidiaries. 
But this precedent was created within the framework of an entity 
that is no longer a federal institution per se.  It is only 
through legal assimilation that Air Canada remains subject to 
the Official Languages Act.  Other private air carriers are not 
subject to the Official Languages Act and therefore do not have 
the same legal obligations as Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enforcing parts V and VI could impose considerable obligations 
on private sector entities, which are not now and never were 
subject to the Official Languages Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, Bill 
C-26 already creates an important precedent by extending Air 
Canada's linguistic obligations with respect to its 
subsidiaries, in particular by ensuring that they comply with 
part IV, a key component of the Official Languages Act.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada is fully subject to the Official Language Act and 
there is therefore no need to include in Bill C-26 any provisions 
requiring Air Canada to translate its working tools or to report 
on the composition of its personnel.  If there are any problems 
relating to the application of Air Canada's obligations, they 
should be solved by other means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to Bill C-26, which sets out and extends the obligations 
of Air Canada—an entity which is already subject to the Official 
Languages Act—the proposed amendments would have the effect of 
creating linguistic obligations for entities which have never 
been explicitly subject to that legislation.  This would 
establish a major precedent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, if we concentrate on the essential question of 
services to the public and require Air Canada to ensure that its 
affiliates provide the services Canadians expect to receive, we 
feel that this is a responsible way for government to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion by my colleague across the way must be rejected and I 
trust I have given the underlying reasons for so doing.  Since 
we still have a few minutes until the end of the debate, I must 
point out on behalf of the members on this side of the House 
that we sincerely and strongly support all the provisions of the 
Official Languages Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been a member of parliament for 17 years, and I had the 
honour of being here at the same time as the great 
parliamentarians of that period, not only the current Prime 
Minister, the hon. member for Saint-Maurice, but also Mr. 
Trudeau, Mr. Marchand, Mr. Pelletier, Mr. Lalonde and all the 
others, including members from the other side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first came here, in 1974, the leader of the Créditistes 
was Réal Caouette, a great Canadian political figure, and the 
former leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, John 
Diefenbaker, was still here. So were Mr. Stanfield, Tommy 
Douglas, Ed Broadbent and many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though some members of parliament do not accept the reality 
of two official languages in Canada, all the parties strongly 
support the spirit of the Official Languages Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the eighties, I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader 
of the Government in the House and I had the opportunity to take 
part in the constitutional debate. What was remarkable was the 
fact that all the members and all the parties in the House 
supported not only the enshrinement of fundamental rights in the 
Canadian Constitution, but also the enshrinement of the Official 
Languages Act itself. That act is truly part our Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the member opposite and all the other members 
of this House that rejecting the motion proposed by the hon. 
member must not be perceived as rejecting the spirit of the 
Official Languages Act, because we in fact strongly support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As most of us know, countless Canadian parents face the daily 
struggle of balancing work and family life.  Today approximately 
70% of married Canadian mothers work outside their homes.  Up to 
60% of them return to work six months after the birth of their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies, as well as leading academics, have found that in the 
first year of their lives children benefit greatly from increased 
contact and stimulation by their parents.  A strong relationship 
makes the children more creative, secure, sociable and curious 
individuals.

have in raising their children and understands the need to 
balance work and family life in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons the government has proposed to extend parental 
benefits to give parents the choice of staying at home for up to 
one full year.  This will provide flexibility for mothers and 
fathers in the labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Helping families to provide a supportive environment for their 
children is not only a worthy social goal, but increasingly a 
national economic imperative.

the ITER reactor project comes through, billions of dollars in 
economic benefits will once again go to Ontario.

members of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada 
demonstrated to Canadians this past weekend in Quebec City that 
we are the only truly national alternative to the Liberal

vision for Canada's future in the next federal election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past weekend also demonstrated to cynics of other political

put forward new, bold, progressive ideas, ideas that will appeal 
to all Canadians from coast to coast to coast.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby—Ajax, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the week of May 15 to 21 marks the fourth annual North American 
Occupational Health and Safety Week.  Each year this special week 
gives us extra opportunity to promote awareness of the importance 
of preventing injury and illness in the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Workplace accidents take a tremendous emotional, physical and 
financial toll on many Canadian workers and their families.  On 
average three workers are killed every working day.  Every nine 
seconds someone is injured on the job.  An investment in 
occupational safety and health is an investment in the well-being 
of workers and in the economic health of Canadian business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fitting that this year, the 100th anniversary of the 
labour program, the theme is “Work Safely for a Healthy 
Future”.  The aim is to encourage young workers to become aware 
of the critical importance in working in a safe and healthy 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many special events are being held throughout this week in 
Canada, Mexico and the United States to bring attention to 
workplace safety issues.  I hope hon. members will join me in 
wishing the participants a very successful week.

enthusiasm that I have not felt for quite some time.  Canadians 
are coming out of political hibernation and taking a new interest 
in politics.  Why?  The Canadian Alliance is filling the 
leadership vacuum in this country.  For far too long true 
leadership in government has been missing.  Canadians have been 
deliberately lulled into complacency by a Liberal government 
satisfied with the status quo, and distracted by a seatless 
leader who does not know which battles to fight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These days are over.  True leadership is not measured by where 
one stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where one 
stands in times of challenge and controversy.  Those times are 
upon us.

discuss and, most importantly, to determine the course of their

lead Canadians to their full potential.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we cannot help but be intrigued at 
the government's view of ethics.  Patrick Lavelle is a long time 
friend and confidant of the Prime Minister, and friendship has 
its privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Lavelle was handpicked to head up the Export Development 
Corporation.  While that is a lovely little job in its own right, 
it is even better for Patrick because he has a personal stake in 
companies that receive EDC assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that conflicts of interest are always overlooked for 
friends of the Prime Minister? 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my hon. friend is overlooking the fact that Mr. Lavelle 
is a part time appointee to the board of directors where he 
serves as chair.  He was chair at the time that EDC put into 
effect its code of ethics.  I understand that Mr. Lavelle has 
complied with this code of ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, I understand the EDC board has never considered a 
matter related to any of the organizations Mr. Lavelle has an 
interest in.  Part time board members are not subject to the 
compliance measures of the conflict of interest code, but they 
are fully subject to its principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that deals with the matter, contrary to the unwarranted 
assertions of my hon. friend. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, not exactly.  I do not think 
Canadians who are forking out cash are really pleased with that 
answer.  He talks about a part time chairman.  Too bad they were 
not just giving out part time cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely amazing that when Patrick Lavelle is not 
chairing EDC board meetings, which he does as the minister just 
said, he sits on the board of the Canadian Bank Note Company and 
Slater Steel and he has stock options in both of those.  Wouldn't 
you know it, the Canadian Bank Note Company and Slater Steel both 
got millions of dollars in assistance from EDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is public money being used to finance private business deals 
for friends of the Prime Minister? 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my friend's assertions are completely unwarranted.  As I 
have already said, I am informed that the EDC board has never 
considered a matter related to any of the organizations in which 
Mr. Lavelle has an interest.  Why does she not stick to the 
facts? 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

particular meetings but I do not think that it looks good or 
smells good for the government, and the minister knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Patrick Lavelle oversees the management of millions of dollars 
of public money, period.  He also sits on the board of two 
private companies that do business with that same public money. 
He is in a massive conflict of interest and the government is his 
accomplice.  Why? 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my hon. friend is wrong in alleging a conflict of 
interest.  I have been advised that Mr. Lavelle complies with the 
EDC's code of ethics.  I am advised that Mr. Lavelle complies 
with the conflict of interest code for government appointees.  I 
repeat, the board of directors does not deal with any matters in 
which Mr. Lavelle has an interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend is wrong.  If anything smells, it is my hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.

put his name on the letterhead and it seems to go to the right 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the EDC was in the news for giving untendered 
contracts to friends of the Prime Minister.  This week we find 
out that a deal between the Canada Bank Note Company and India 
went sour.  Guess who picked up the $3.5 million tab?  EDC, of 
course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does that matter?  It is because Patrick Lavelle, the 
chairman of EDC, is also a director of the Canada Bank Note 
Company.  Mr. Lavelle says it is not a lot of money.  He does not 
get involved unless the amount of money is $20 million or more. 
Apparently somebody else looks after the petty cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that friends of the Prime Minister keep getting bailed 
out with public money? 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I challenge my hon. friend to put facts on the table in 
the House and outside the House which indicate that Mr. Lavelle 
was personally involved in the matter in question.  I challenge 
the hon. member to do that or to stand revealed as not having the 
ethics that he wants from others. 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the largest oil company in Brazil needed a loan guarantee, 
René Fugère, a good friend of the Prime Minister and currently

appointed to be chairman of the EDC has a personal financial 
interest in companies that receive millions of dollars from the 
EDC. The biggest corporate donors to the Liberal Party are the 
biggest beneficiaries of EDC financial assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that so many recipients of EDC support just happen to

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister solemnly told this House that, indeed, invoices had

on the existence of invoices. These invoices were not in the

were still not able to get these invoices. We asked the minister 
to table them, but she did not. No one has ever seen these 
invoices.

by this parliament that will ensure that there is competition in 
the air industry.  It is the law that is passed by this

should know that Transport Canada has the most outstanding air

</I></B></P><P align=left>On bill 11 the health minister says that we should wait for the

before the proclamation of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not have to wait for this government's commitment to

there were serious concerns in relation to the principle of 
accessibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened since April 7?  Who got to this minister?  If

health care?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will tell the member what has happened since that letter was 
sent.  We asked the Alberta government to amend bill 11.  Indeed, 
allowing charges for enhanced services in private for profit 
facilities in combination does create a circumstance that we feel 
imperils the principle of accessibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta did not amend the act.  That danger is still there.  For

Certainly, Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is correct. The 
regulations for sulphur in gasoline have been in effect in 
California for some four or five years. Costs have been minimal. 
They have been in effect since the beginning of the year in New 
England.  Again, in an area with a gasoline market larger than 
Canada as a whole, costs have been about half a cent per litre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is we are talking about approximately 30 lives lost 
prematurely as a result of the level of sulphur in gasoline and 
the resulting emissions and air quality that comes from it.  We 
wish to reverse that.  We wish to cut down on those deaths. We 
will continue to put in place the regulations that industry has

last week the government invoked closure to stifle debate on Bill 
C-11, the government's bill which dismantles Devco.  This week it 
plans to ram the bill through committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The company and the unions right now are in arbitration which 
may compromise the evidence which comes before the committee. 
Will the minister show good faith and write to the committee 
asking that it postpone hearings until the arbitration is

to Cape Breton to hear from the citizens in that community?

legislative process with respect to Bill C-11 to be put off until 
sometime in the fall. Quite frankly that is not in the public 
interest and particularly is not in the interest of Devco in Cape 
Breton. That would mean that the ability to find private sector 
owners to secure the business and to secure the jobs for the long 
term would go off into never never land, leaving a huge cloud of 
uncertainty over at least 500 jobs in Cape Breton.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the $175 million for grain roads was specifically 
tied to grain transportation reforms and will help producers in 
western Canada overcome some of the problems which arise as we go 
to a more competitive system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget the Minister of Finance announced over $2 billion 
for infrastructure and $600 million for highways.  Some people 
say that is not enough.  In a perfect world we would have much 
more money, but this is a start.  It means we can now start 
reinvesting in national highways.  I think that is a very good 
start and who knows, more money may come in the future.

<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in the debate this 
afternoon as we wind down on this very important piece of 
legislation.  This bill is designed as a federal response to the 
restructuring of our two major airlines and to deal with the 
consequences as far as the rest of the Canadian airline industry 
is concerned, as well as travellers and shippers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank members of the Standing Committee on 
Transport.  I have to say that this has been one of the more 
salutary efforts I have been involved with in the House, in the 
sense that there has been remarkable co-operation on all sides. 
There has been good, sharp, intense debate.  Amendments came 
forward which received the acceptance of members of the other 
side, which helped to strengthen the legislation and clarify some 
things.  I am extremely happy to have had that co-operation from 
members of the committee and I thank them publicly. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put on the record my thanks to all of them.  I know 
what long, and late, hours they put in to move this bill forward 
as quickly as they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second reason for being pleased is that the prospects for 
passing this bill sooner are looking brighter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of this House, I am sure, understand the importance of 
bring this bill into force, and I have no doubt the other House 
will be of the same view. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to deal with a few of the important points of the 
amended bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law at present provides the authority for the process to 
approve the airline acquisition deal between Air Canada and an 
Alberta numbered company and Canadian Airlines.  This bill 
provides the mechanisms and the enforcement tools necessary to 
ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the deal, 
which are the commitments made to me by Air Canada and to the 
undertakings negotiated between Air Canada and the competition 
commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill expands the powers of the Competition Act to ensure 
new protection against anti-competitive behaviour by the operator 
of a domestic air service that would impede or discourage the 
development of new services by other Canadian carriers.  This is 
extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been much made in recent weeks about the need for 
competition.  I have met with charter carrier officials and 
people from other airlines in Canada.  I can assure the House 
that there is a willingness to step in and provide the necessary 
competition.  But the people want some assurance of stability, 
some clarity of the rules and the knowledge that Air Canada would 
not use its pricing might, its capacity, to drive other airlines 
out of business.  That is why this bill is so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not only brought in predatory pricing provisions through 
a clause that was developed by the Competition Bureau, we have 
actually toughened up that particular aspect of the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill brings increased protection for consumers and new 
obligations to ensure that communities can make the case for the 
retention of services when carriers are considering reducing 
service, or withdrawing from a market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill ensures that travellers and shippers will be able to 
deal with Air Canada and all its subsidiaries, current and 
future, in the official language of their choice, where there is 
significant demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made a small comment on the importance of these amendments 
with respect to the Official Languages Act and its application 
to subsidiaries of Canadian Airlines International.  This is a 
notable change in our policy, because Air Canada used to be a 
crown corporation, and now it is a private sector company.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before commenting on what is new and improved in the bill as 
amended, I would like to say a few words about what is not in the 
bill.  There is nothing in the bill which would change Canada's 
policy regarding Canadian ownership and control of our airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the lack of support for the policy by some editorialists 
and columnists, the government will maintain its policy.  I know 
that members in my own party sought to increase foreign ownership 
from 25% to 49%.  We have that statutory authority now, but we 
fixed it at 25% because we believe that the airline industry must 
be controlled by Canadians.  That has been clear throughout this 
debate, through letters to the editor, e-mails we have received 
and polling.  There was a poll done by Maclean's and CBC in 
December which showed that 83% of Canadians believe that we have 
to maintain a strong Canadian identity in this new century and 
that Canadian ownership of business in Canada should be even 
greater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask why we would want to arbitrarily increase the 25% 
limit when many other countries around the world keep that limit 
themselves.  The Americans do not allow foreigners to have more 
than 25% ownership in any U.S. carrier.  Hon. members will 
remember a few years ago when Air Canada owned 25% of Continental 
Airlines.  It was a very good investment by the former president 
of Air Canada, which reaped great benefits for Air Canada, but it 
could not hold any more.  It could not, in effect, control 
Continental Airlines.  Why should we dilute our control and yet 
allow the U.S. to maintain its 25%?  And not just the U.S., but 
other countries in the world.  We must maintain solid Canadian 
control, effective Canadian control, of our airlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to other issues of competition, we have been held 
up to some criticism by editorialists who believe that we should 
allow foreign carriers to come into the country.  Again, I have 
spoken with Canadian carriers, the WestJets, the charter carriers 
and others, and they believe that they can fill the void. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed in the clippings today from transport statements made 
by Mr. Kinnear, the president of Canada 3000.  I met with him 
last week and what he said to me privately he said publicly, that 
is, now that they know what the regime will be they are going to 
acquire more planes.  And not just that charter company, but 
other charter companies will be doing the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the naysayers in the media and some of these great 
experts we see who pop up from academia should perhaps wait for 
18 months to see what the Canada 3000s, the Air Transats, the 
Royals and the Sky Services can do.  We know that CanJet, the 
airline being proposed by Mr. Rowe, a prominent businessman from 
Halifax, is going to get off the ground.  He has made public 
statements in the last few weeks.  That will be an exciting 
development.  He wanted to see what kind of bill we were bringing 
in.  He wanted to see what kind of regime he would have to deal 
with.  He wanted to know that the competition commissioner would 
have real power to deal with Air Canada, which, notwithstanding 
its protestations about competition, has 80% of the market and 
naturally would try to push the envelope.  I think we have seen 
evidence of that in the last few weeks.  There was so much 
evidence that members of the committee became quite annoyed at 
the president of Air Canada and took him to task when he appeared 
before the committee.  As a result, the bill was toughened up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the bill has gone through the House and will be going 
to the Senate—and hopefully will receive expeditious approval 
after full debate in the Senate—companies like CanJet and 
WestJet and the charters will know the regime and they will want 
to plan for extra capacity.  I am quite excited about the new 
discount carrier that Mr. Rowe will be basing in Halifax and 
Toronto because that will provide discount competition from the 
hub in Toronto.  We now have discount competition by WestJet from 
Hamilton serving eastern Canada.

months Air Transat, Canada 3000 and Royal Airlines provided 25% 
of the capacity between Toronto and Vancouver.  There was choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems is that there is not a choice for the 
business traveller.  It is to be hoped that an airline will come 
along.  I have heard certain things where there will be other 
entrants into the market whereby there will be real competition, 
full service competition, not just in the charters, not just for 
those people who want the cheapest seat possible, but competition 
for those companies that want some real choice for their 
executives travelling across the country.  That will come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes me so annoyed in this whole debate is that somehow 
people think we can just flick our fingers after we announced on 
December 21 the historic deal of putting these airlines together 
and brought in a bill in February and somehow competition would 
emerge overnight.  As Mr. Kinnear of Canada 3000 said in the 
newspaper on the weekend, he has four A319s on order to lease but 
they cannot get into service until next summer.  There is a 
backlog of new aircraft orders around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not like flicking our fingers and getting immediate 
certifications of planes, training crews and having a total 
competitor to Air Canada overnight.  That is why I keep talking 
about 18 months to two years to give the marketplace time to sort 
itself out.  If it does not, I can tell the House categorically 
that the government will not hesitate to bring in foreign 
carriers to compete with Air Canada because ultimately we have to 
make sure the travelling public has a good deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not happy with the kinds of prices we have seen in the last 
10 years.  As I said earlier at report stage, the duopoly of 
Canadian Airlines and Air Canada was not competition at all. 
People are lamenting the demise of Canadian Airlines as the end 
of competition.  The fact is there was very little price 
competition.  What they were doing was bashing themselves over 
the head with extra capacity all around the country with flights 
departing at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember going down to the Deputy Prime Minister's riding 
about a year ago.  I was booked on an Air Ontario flight to go to 
Toronto.  Then I found out that there was a Canadian regional 
flight that was leaving a half hour earlier.  I had about three 
minutes to get a ticket and get on it, and I did.  I ran to that 
plane.  It was a 19 seat Beachcraft.  Do hon. members know how 
many people were on it?  Yours truly.  I was the only one on it. 
Do hon. members know how many people were on the Air Ontario 
flight?  There were six people on a 50 seat Dash-8.  That is the 
kind of ludicrous competition that we had.  It was not 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyway, let us not talk about the past.  We are wasting time 
talking about the past.  Let us talk about the future.  We have 
made Air Canada strong.  It has new roots.  It is now the world's 
10th largest airline.  It will do battle with the best in the 
world, British Airways and Cathay Pacific.  The U.S. carriers are 
not even in Air Canada's league.  They are not in Canadian 
Airlines' league.  We had two of the best carriers in the world. 
They won awards for service.  Now we will turn them loose as a 
combined entity under the Air Canada banner right around the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New services have been announced.  I was present in Toronto a 
few weeks ago for the new non-stop service by Air Canada to 
Tokyo.  There will be other new markets to Asia, to Australia and 
to other parts of Europe.  This is great for Canada, because we 
not only have a good product.  We have a strategic advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the open skies agreement with the United States we attract 
the biggest market in the world to come through the Canadian hubs 
of Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax.  We will 
sup up a lot of that traffic which knows that they get a poorer 
product on U.S. carriers.  They will go on Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada will be happy.  It will make lots of money.  There 
will be competition on the international routes because if people 
do not like Air Canada's prices then all those foreign carriers 
still come into Canada and there is competition on the 
transborder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where we are really concerned is for those people who do not 
have competition in Canada.  That is why the bill is particularly 
strong with respect to monopoly pricing on routes where there is 
no competition.  Is it likely that we will have competition in 
some smaller communities in the country?  No, it is not.  We have 
to make sure that Air Canada does not gouge the travelling 
public.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have amended the Canada Transportation Act, to 
ensure that the Canadian Transportation Agency has that power. We 
are giving it on its motion the authority to go after Air Canada 
and say “Listen, justify your price.  Roll it back”.  We are 
not just going to wait for any member of the House or a member of 
the travelling public to go in there and say “We have a 
complaint and would you deal with it over the next few months?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Transportation Agency will be monitoring these 
prices on a daily basis.  With modern computers it will be 
monitoring all the prices, not just the full, economy and 
business class fares but all the various excursion fares, to make 
sure that Canadians get the best opportunity. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We clearly share the view that there should be a federal 
official who can deal with consumer complaints.  I believe we 
have found a formula which will not create a new bureaucracy but 
will provide for the mediation of complaints where no other 
remedy exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Making the proposed air travel complaints commissioner a member 
of the Canadian Transportation Agency complements the other 
complaint handling mechanisms which the agency said it wanted to 
put in place to gather complaints, including those from persons 
who want to register their views. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know members of the committee were a bit frustrated when they 
gave their report and I gave the government's response because 
they wanted an ombudsperson.  We had some real reluctance in this 
regard because we did not want to set up yet another bureaucracy 
to deal with the complaints about service and pricing.  On 
pricing we have the mechanisms in the Canadian Transportation 
Agency.  On predatory behaviour and predatory pricing, we have 
given new powers to the commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In putting our heads together over at the department we asked 
why we could not have this person whom the committee wants to 
oversee the merger and to make sure that complaints are dealt 
with.  Why do we not give the individual real teeth?  That is why 
we are doing something quite extraordinary.  We are naming a new 
commissioner of the Canadian Transportation Agency.  Again this 
does not seem to be out there in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Transportation Agency is the quasi-judicial 
regulatory body over transportation in the country.  If we name a 
new commissioner who specifically will have the mandate to deal 
with airline restructuring, that is an extremely powerful 
individual.  It is an individual who can subpoena documents and 
haul in the executives of Air Canada to ask them what is going 
on.  This individual can demand mediation and use the full powers 
of the office.  If that were not enough, the individual can refer 
matters to the full commission for adjudication, refer matters to 
the Competition Bureau for its adjudication, or refer matters to 
the courts for ultimate arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that Air Canada would want to run afoul of the 
Canadian Transportation Agency, the regulatory body.  I am sure 
it will co-operate now.  To its credit, Air Canada has named its 
own ombudsperson.  The fact it has done this is an admission of 
the fact that not everything has gone that well with the merger. 
By and large, the macro issues have been managed quite well, but 
a lot of what people may refer to as the smaller issues in terms 
of consumer-customer complaints have not been handled properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a customer the other week, along with some members of the 
Reform Party going back to British Columbia and some colleagues 
of mine from Winnipeg and Windsor.  We saw firsthand some of the 
problems.  We cannot dismiss a small complaint when as a result 
of a mechanical problem on one plane with a capacity of 135 a 
larger plane was brought in with a capacity of 180 and the 
airline tried to squeeze in 230 people on that 180 seat plane. 
No wonder there was a lot of irate passengers.  Plus, there was 
the fact that the flight from Winnipeg had a mechanical problem 
and it was three hours late.  As well, there were not enough 
ticket agents on duty because there were some off sick.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These may seem like small things to some.  I note that on Bay 
Street they say that we are not taking note of all the big things 
that have gone well.  The air service exists solely for the 
Canadian travelling public.  It does not exist for the stock 
market.  It does not exist solely for the shareholders of Air 
Canada.  It exists for the benefit of passengers.  That is why we 
have not apologized one whit—neither have the members of the 
committee, no matter what party in the House—for defending the 
rights of the Canadian consumer, not the rights of the air 
carrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The modifications we have in this bill are quite strong and they 
will deal with many of the problems that will have to be 
addressed as the merger goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the exit provisions.  There were some modifications 
required because some of the carriers like the charters came to 
us.  WestJet came to us and even Air Canada asked if it was 
particularly fair going from 60 days to 120 days.  We have shown 
some modification there.  We have made it easier for the WestJets 
of the world to go into a new market and not have to stay there 
for 120 days and lose their shirt if they are not going to make 
any money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think people will forgive me in the House if I blow the horn 
of the government.  If we do not do it ourselves no one else will 
do it, certainly not if we read some of the editorialists across 
the country.  We have found through government action by using 
section 47 last fall a private sector solution.  It was a bit 
messy.  It was a bit annoying for some people.  Anyone who 
follows the business world knows that mergers and acquisitions 
are messy at the best of times.  The difference here is that the 
government instigated the whole process through section 47.  We 
had to adjudicate it in the end and come forward with regulation 
in parliament, which is what we have done through this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious, having done that, we would get knocked around in 
the process.  However there is no one that can convince me that 
we were not right in bringing this whole matter to a head.  If we 
had not done so, we would have had a failure of the second 
airline in the country.  We brought forward a regime that came 
forward with a private sector solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people said that we should have let Canadian Airlines go 
bankrupt.  There were columnists in national newspapers saying 
that.  These guys sit at their typewriters or their computers and 
do not think about the 16,000 people working at Canadian 
Airlines.  They do not think about the thousands of travellers 
across the country who would have been inconvenienced.  I tell 
the House that the government was not going to let the travelling 
public down.  We were not going to let the workers of Canadian 
Airlines down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we did the deal on the Tokyo route on December 20, Canadian 
Airlines had two days cash left.  I did not know whether it would 
meet the payroll for Christmas.  All these great observers said 
that we should let the marketplace find its ultimate way and let 
these people be out of work.  It is government, parliament, 
members of parliament no matter on what side of the House, who 
would have had to pick up the pieces.  It is all right for people 
to make great pronouncements, but when men, women and children 
would have been affected, disrupted, that would have been a 
tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was not the capacity in the country to deal with it.  Air 
Canada could not have picked up the load.  U.S. carriers could 
not have come in here even on temporary permits to pick up the 
load.  The charters could not pick up the load at Christmas. 
Everyone was stretched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the only solution.  Not everyone likes the deal that 
was negotiated between the commissioner of competition and Air 
Canada, but in the failing firm scenario he had to deal with it 
the best he could do.  I would like to thank him publicly for the 
work he and his staff have done in helping all of us bring this 
new regime forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deal has resulted in the taking of the number one airline in 
the country, the number two airline in the country, 41,000 
people, 350 aircraft serving hundreds of destinations in Canada 
and around the world.  We did not have to put up a nickel of 
taxpayer money to bail out Canadian Airlines.  The taxpayer has 
not been asked to fork out a nickel.  There was no bankruptcy. 
There was no tragedy.  There was no heartache. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some slight disruption, depending on the day.  We 
would not call it slight.  I did not call it slight the other day 
at the Ottawa airport.  However, the next day when I came back it 
was okay and things have improved this week.  That is why I asked 
for time for the airline to get its act together. 
I asked for time for competition to develop because there will be 
competition, Canadian competition operated by Canadians.  It will 
give the pricing and the flexibility that Canadians want.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the commissioner will be making an announcement today or 
tomorrow about his negotiations on the sale of Canadian Regional 
Airlines.  He got a very big extraction out of Air Canada as part 
of the deal.  Canadian Regional is not an inconsequential player. 
It has 53 planes, 28 of them jets, albeit old jets.  It flew to 
many communities across this country and even to a few in the 
U.S.  Under the deal that was negotiated by the commissioner, 
Canadian Regional Airlines must be offered for sale.  That is 
about to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from the Reform Party was taking me to task the other 
week in question period about the delay in this airline being 
offered for sale.  However, as I said at the time, it has been 
very difficult to put a value on Canadian Regional Airlines 
because it was part of the overall Canadian Airlines 
International.  We did not know what amounts should be assigned 
for marketing, maintenance, sales and all the rest.  That has now 
been done.  A third party is being retained to sell that airline. 
If it is not sold, Air Canada gets to keep the airline.  I cannot 
believe there are no entrepreneurs out there making an offer for 
Canadian Regional Airlines.  If that is the case, there will be 
more full service competition to Air Canada in the months ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In looking back at the last nine months, I must say that it 
has not been easy.  It seems that anything I have been involved 
with in my career as a politician has not been easy.  However, it 
is not all the knocks taken on the way; it is how a certain issue 
ends up.  This is ending up, I think, good for Air Canada and for 
its shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that if we were Air Canada shareholders, 
having bought shares when the Mulroney government privatized it 
in 1988, watching the stock market go through the roof in the 
last few years, at $6 a share when all this began last year 
having been floated at $8, we lost money.  Today the shareholders 
are laughing.  The share price is at $16 or $17.  It is rumoured 
to be going even higher.  We have done the shareholders of Air 
Canada a favour, despite all the hand-wringing of last fall about 
the poor shareholders and how they would be sacrificed.  The Air 
Canada shareholders are happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as Canadians are happy.  We are going to have the world's 
tenth largest airline, an airline that is fully bilingual in the 
service that it provides to the travelling public, and an airline 
of outstanding quality, of dedicated employees, of new aircraft, 
one of the newest fleets in the world, and it will be Canadian. 
We should all be proud of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also helped all those employees who would have been 
thrown out on the street.  The people at Canadian Airlines will 
be protected for two years.  Any redundancies have to be provided 
with full packages.  The communities that Canadian Regional was 
servicing at the time the deal was consummated on December 21 
must continue be served by Canadian Regional.  Those employees 
will be needed.  They should have no fear if a new owner comes 
along.  The alternative would have put people out of work and put 
families under pressure at a difficult time of year.  We see a 
positive aspect there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Communities are protected in the bill.  For three years Air 
Canada has to give service.  The same goes for Canadian Regional 
if it is sold.   It is all right for guys like me who come from 
Toronto because we have service coming out our ears.  It is the 
same for the hon. member from the Reform Party who comes from 
Vancouver.  We are lucky.  We have lots of service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from the NDP comes from Churchill, a small community. 
There is not much service in that area or in areas like that.  My 
parliamentary secretary, who has done an outstanding job here, is 
from Thunder Bay, another small community.  The Thunder Bays of 
this world will all be protected in this particular regime.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  Thank God for Hamilton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I hear my friend 
from Hamilton West, the committee chair and the former 
parliamentary secretary, waxing eloquently about Hamilton. As a 
Torontonian I am happy that we can finally get those people from 
Hamilton to keep quiet about their airport because they have air 
service.  They will have scheduled service and more flights will 
go in there.  It is now the biggest cargo operator in all of 
Canada.  Let us not have any more crocodile tears about Hamilton, 
I say to my colleague from Hamilton West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all these benefits:  the communities are protected, the 
employees are protected and an international airline is growing. 
The only thing we have not yet been able to do, but which I 
believe sincerely will be done, is to get the kind of competition 
forward that will ensure that Air Canada has to really be on its 
toes.  I have told the media that it should not keep on talking 
about cabotage but that it should call up the executives of the 
charter carriers, WestJet, Mr. Rowe of CanJet and others and ask 
them if they want cabotage.  They will say “No, my God, no. 
Please give us a chance to compete”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in Canadian entrepreneurs.  I cannot believe some of 
the drivel that has been written about the need to bring in the 
Americans to somehow rescue us from the lack of competition. 
Nothing can be done overnight but, as we can see from the plans 
of the charters and others like WestJet, there is new equipment 
coming on and new entrants will be coming into the market.  There 
will be competition and it will be Canadian competition.  It will 
be competition of which we can all be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, thank you very much for your rapt attention.  If 
you think that I have been somewhat strong-minded in my views 
today, you are absolutely right.  It is at this stage of the 
debate that I can actually say what has been on my mind for 
months.  This is an accomplishment not only of this government in 
its air transportation policy but it is an accomplishment of 
parliament.  It shows how members of all parties can work 
together for the benefit of Canadians and how all of us can have 
such a dramatic effect on public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again thank all my colleagues who took part in the debate: my 
parliamentary secretary; the chairman of the standing committee, 
the member for Hamilton West; Senator Bacon, the chair of the 
Senate committee where the bill will now go; the people at the 
Competition Bureau; the hard-working staff at Transport Canada 
who have hardly had a day off since last August; and my own 
personal staff.  It was not an easy task.  It was often tough but 
we did the right thing and it will benefit all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I too am pleased to see the end of 
this debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to recognize the contribution by not only 
the Transport Canada people but by the committee members who sat 
for hours before Christmas and again just recently.  Everyone put 
a lot of time and effort into finding the best solution to 
dealing with the reality of a monopoly air carrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does have a role in this situation.  It was 
interesting to hear the minister talk about what happened and why 
we reached this situation where we had to deal with the merging 
of two airlines.  It was critical last fall when we found that 
one of our major air carriers was failing and days away from 
having to shut down its operations.  It was prudent that the 
government stepped in to try to prevent a bankruptcy from 
happening.  I also believed that the interruption to the lives 
not only of the employees but of the travelling public would have 
been incredible had a major airline like Canadian Airlines 
actually shut down its operations overnight.  There was a role 
for government.  It recognized that and stepped to the plate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legitimate role for government is in safety, environmental 
issues, labour and competition issues, more specifically, 
anti-competitive issues. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT56"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT56"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1540

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe it is up to the government to get back into 
regulation; to regulate the prices, the routes and that sort of 
thing.  I am pleased the government has not gone that route. 
Attempts were made today to put in more regulation, but I am 
pleased to see the government and parliament has stayed away from 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best thing the government can do is encourage competition. I 
listened to the minister with great interest about his hope that 
Canadian air carriers will step in and be able to provide that 
competition.  I hope so too but airplanes do not come cheap.  It 
takes a lot of money to run an airline and, as in most things, 
the capital available in Canada for this kind of investment is 
limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see what is wrong with opening the doors and allowing 
foreign capital to come in to hold up or bolster Canadian 
airlines.  We have done it with other industries and they have 
been successful.  They have offered Canadians good high paying 
jobs.  On more than one occasion I have used the automobile 
industry as an example.  We have tens of thousands of Canadians 
working in the automobile industry.  They have good paying jobs 
and good working conditions.  They are working in Canada under 
the Canada Labour Code labour relations but the companies are 
foreign owned.  The automobile industry is 100% foreign owned but 
it provides a lifestyle for tens of thousands of workers that I 
think is beneficial to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure that if we can do it for one industry, whether it 
is the automobile industry, forestry industry or whatever, that 
it cannot happen in the airline industry where it is a highly 
capitalized industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be concerned about competition and should 
not be afraid of opening it up.  We can have a Canada only 
airline that is fully owned by foreigners but which still 
operates in Canada, hires Canadians in good paying jobs and with 
security, operates under our regulations, buys our gas, pays our 
taxes and contributes to our Canadian economy.  Just because it 
may not be owned by Canadians does not mean it will not benefit 
our country.  I am not afraid of opening the door to more foreign 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister made comments about being concerned about the 
travelling public, the consumer.  I would have to say that 
probably the number one concern of all the committee members was 
about the Canadian consumer who uses air travel.  Because of the 
size and regional disparity of our country, many people have no 
choice but to use Canadian air carriers.  We were very concerned 
about making sure that the service to Canadians would be there 
and that it would be at a price they could afford not at prices 
out of their reach.  We were concerned that the airline, the 
monopoly carrier, be held to its commitment that it had made to 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are some shareholders of Canadian Airlines who do 
not see the benefits.  The minister was saying that the 
shareholders of Air Canada have seen great increases in their 
share prices and that they have benefited from it.  The 
shareholders of Canadian Airlines do not have the same benefit. 
Basically their shares were taken up at nominal value.  Yes, the 
trade-off was that it it it went bankrupt the shares worth 
nothing, but some of those shareholders are the employees of 
Canadian Airlines.  Those employees, who gave up 10% of their 
salary for a number of years to help Canadian Airlines, have 
taken a real hit in all this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of our concern has to be that government has a role to play 
in labour relations.  We have two labour forces that have to 
merge.  There are some unhappy situations between those two 
labour forces.  I would suggest that maybe one of the legitimate 
roles of government is to help those two labour forces 
accommodate that merger.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are questions about seniority lists which are causing 
great concern.  Maybe the government should take a more active 
role in trying to resolve some of those disparities between the 
labour force of the old Canadian Airlines International and Air 
Canada.  I hear from both sides that they are expecting and need 
some intervention.  Perhaps government is the one to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government does have a role to play.  With all due 
respect, it has done the job fairly decently.  There is still 
room for it to move as far as the competition issue is concerned 
and not be afraid of foreign competition or foreign investment 
coming in. I for one feel that Canadians can rise to the occasion 
and that Canadians will step up to the plate to make sure they 
are in the game.  If we really want full competition and 
consumers to have choices, we need to encourage that competition 
to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to move on to the role of Air Canada, the now monopoly 
airline company which is offering services to Canadian 
travellers.  I want to tell it that at second reading I agreed 
with the government that Air Canada needed the transition time, 
that it was reasonable to give it two years to make the 
transition. I had assumed that Air Canada would be magnanimous in 
the way it would deal with this issue. I thought Air Canada would 
realize that it had a tremendous opportunity to be number 10 in 
international carriers. I thought it would realize the potential 
that was there and that it would be a little more gracious about 
how it handled this transition period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry to say that it seems to have chosen a different 
route.  It has chosen to take a hardball, hard-nosed attitude not 
only toward the travelling public, but toward the system, toward 
its competition, toward the creditors who had invested and lent 
money to Canadian Airlines International, and in particular 
toward its rivals, people who may be the competition, other air 
carriers in Canada, which the minister is trusting to step up to 
the plate and become the competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada with its huge monopoly, control and more important, 
its influence, is sending a message that it does not want to 
assume the responsibility in a gracious manner and that it is 
going to play hardball.  I am concerned with the way it is 
treating the competition or people who thought they had a 
relationship, agreement or understanding with Air Canada prior to 
the signing of the document.  I see that American Airlines may be 
taking Air Canada to court because of the reneging on a deal it 
thought it was code sharing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Service contracts with Canada 3000 have been cancelled with 30 
days notice.  I am not saying it should be held to contracts 
which are not profitable or realistic.  I am saying that Air 
Canada should have realized the position it is in, the 
sensitivity of the airline industry right now.  It should have 
been a little less willing to go in with a heavy hand and should 
have done some of the negotiating in a more sensitive manner.  I 
have not seen that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw where Air Canada, taking advantage of a situation with 
its size and ability to add capacity, went after WestJet, another 
potential competitor that the minister is relying on to develop 
competition against Air Canada.  It was another instance where 
Air Canada sent a very strong message in a very hard-nosed way 
that it is not going to tolerate any kind of competition from 
anyone.  After having reduced its capacity on the Toronto-Moncton 
route, it increased its capacity and lowered the fares to make it 
impossible for WestJet to establish a market there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have concerns.  I am sure there is a lot of testosterone in 
the Air Canada boardroom going into overdose levels. 
There have been some poor strategic and operational decisions. 
This has been handled very poorly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada has not done a good job in communicating to the 
travelling public what the expectations should be.  It has not 
told the travelling public that they can expect to wait in long 
lines, that they can expect airplanes to be cancelled, luggage 
lost and all the rest of it. Maybe it should not say to the 
Canadian travelling public that it is not able to meet its 
requirements and needs.  At least it could have explained to 
Canadians that it is going through a transition period and that 
there is going to be a period of time when there will be 
interruptions in services and inconveniences.  It could have done 
a better job in communicating with the people on whom it depends 
to buy its tickets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the overcapacity issues. Both airlines were not 
doing as well as they should have been because they were 
competing nose to nose and were flying half empty planes.  I 
appreciate that.  However, I have problems when the first thing 
Air Canada did was reduce the overcapacity in western Canada by 
removing aircraft and moving them east.  It has sent a message to 
western Canadians that in the total picture they are not as 
important as the other people in the country.  There may have 
been a reason that some of it happened, but I have to ask how is 
it that Air Canada did not feel that there was not a need for 
some of the aircraft to be relocated in the western area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use an example of a flight from Fort St. John to Prince 
George which used to take half an hour.  This is in northern 
British Columbia.  People who wanted to go to Prince George, a 
larger centre with better hospital care and the whole bit, used 
to fly from Fort St. John to Prince George.  Now, in order to get 
to Prince George from Fort St. John, they have to fly from Fort 
St. John to Vancouver and then turn around and fly from Vancouver 
back north to Prince George.  It now takes six and a half hours 
on one flight and four and a half hours on the other, when it 
used to take half an hour.  That is the kind of interruption and 
inconvenience that is being placed on people because of the 
transfer of the equipment from western Canada to eastern Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other concern people in the west have is because equipment 
has been moved it prevents adding on routes or adding on more 
frequency to destinations during the height of the tourist 
season.  A number of communities depend on convention travel and 
large conventions.  They are having trouble getting bookings now 
because they cannot get the people who attend these conventions 
from Vancouver to their location.  Whole markets are dissipating 
because of the change in the flight availability. It is having a 
detrimental result. Even though it might make economic sense to 
the air carrier, it has a negative effect on the western region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have trouble when I hear that everything is going well and 
that it is only a matter of time.  It will only go well if the 
corporate entity of Air Canada assumes the responsibility that 
has been placed with it and it takes on that responsibility in a 
way that understands the need of Canadians to use air travel.  It 
is not that we want to, it is that we have to.  The distances 
between communities mean for the most part that we depend on air 
travel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government feels that Bill C-26 is the answer.  I do not 
disagree that it is a good step in the right direction. The 
government's response in giving more powers to the competition 
commissioner to put in place cease and desist orders so that he 
can immediately stop predatory behaviour before it has an effect 
on the competition is a good thing. 
It is a good thing the minister and his department in their 
wisdom have recognized the need to have an ombudsman or in this 
case a commissioner to deal with and investigate complaints from 
the travelling public and make recommendations as to how they can 
be resolved.  Those are good things.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important thing for the Canadian travelling public is 
choice.  If we are going to control prices and service and if we 
are going to make sure that Air Canada assumes its corporate 
responsibility, there has to be competition.  We have to ensure 
that Air Canada through its influence does not keep the 
competition from developing within Canada. We must allow others 
to come in with their capital and assist Canadian companies to 
form competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister mentioned that British Airways will be the 
competition internationally.  That is only if British Airways 
decides to stay in Canada.  The domestic part of its ticket has 
increased three times.  It may be that British Airways and some 
other international carriers who come to Canada cannot afford to 
stay. This means that Air Canada not only would have control of 
the total domestic market, it may be conceivable that unless 
someone leaves Canada and in my case goes to Seattle, they may 
not have a choice of using foreign carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real solution is competition.  I would like to think that 
the government will not stand in the way of looking at how we 
provide competition if Canadian players are not stepping up to 
the plate in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fallacy to think that Americans are bad guys, that 
Canada is a loser if we use foreign investment money.  We do it 
all the time.  Companies do it all the time.  They use money from 
other sources in order to enhance their ability to grow and 
provide services for people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that the government will consider opening up the 
contributions for foreign investors from 25% to 49%. If put at 
the 49% level, the company is still considered to be controlled 
by Canadians.  When we have bilateral agreements with other 
countries, it is important to have a Canada owned airline. 
Forty-nine percent would ensure that it is a Canadian controlled 
company and would meet the bilateral agreement requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only would we have competition, but the competition would be 
able to meet the occurring international growth.  As the minister 
explained, Air Canada will become the 10th largest international 
carrier and I think that is great.  Canadians will benefit by 
having a strong international carrier, a strong Canadian airline. 
I want to reinforce that the strong carrier should not be able to 
influence those things that happen in the airline industry 
outside of the company itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In discussions with various witnesses before the committee we 
heard not only of the difficulties facing WestJet but also the 
difficulties facing Canada 3000. The implication was that because 
of Air Canada's volume of flights, because of the 80% to 90% 
control of the market that Air Canada has and because of its 
buying power, it has a lot of influence on those who provide 
services to airlines. I am thinking specifically of airport 
authorities.  When the largest customer is putting pressure on 
for the best and most of everything, it is pretty hard for the 
entity to refuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really want competition, be it international or domestic, 
good service from airports and good locations in airports must be 
available to the competition.  The dominant carrier should not 
always get the best space.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from a number of potential airline competitors to Air 
Canada that they are always relegated to the back corners of our 
international airports.  I think that is something that we may 
have to look at; not to implement regulations, but to have the 
understanding that the most important thing in our country is 
ensuring that competition can come in and can grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this legislation is a good step.  It will help Air 
Canada through this transitional period by ensuring that it 
understands what is expected of it.  The bill will hold Air 
Canada to the agreement it made with the competition 
commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping that as time progresses—hopefully not too much 
time—the government will understand that competition, no matter 
where the money comes from, is healthy and that we should not be 
afraid of foreign competition, whether it is from the United 
States, Britain, Holland, Japan or wherever the money might come 
from.  If it can assist our airline industry to be vibrant and to 
provide choice for consumers, that is the most important thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need to have choice.  Canadians need to be able to 
decide what airlines they want to take.  The services from 
Vancouver to Ottawa have been reduced.  The number of direct 
flights have been reduced.  I do not have a choice.  Only Air 
Canada flies direct from Vancouver to Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important that we have choice, that the Canadian 
flying public have choice.  I urge the government to consider 
removing that barrier to increasing competition.  Also, as I 
mentioned earlier in my debate, the government may want to look 
at assisting in the labour relations issues of the two companies 
which are now before Air Canada.  Perhaps that is a legitimate 
role for government to play.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I could begin my speech by congratulating the members 
of the Standing Committee on Transport for working many hours, 
just before the Christmas holiday. They heard many witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could begin by congratulating the public servants at the 
Department of Transport for having worked hard on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not use that approach for the simple reason that we 
parliamentarians just did our job. People elected us through a 
democratic process. Personally, I was re-elected on June 2, 1997 
to represent my constituents in parliament and to do the job of 
a parliamentarian. Part of that job is to pass bills. These 
bills must be reviewed in committee before finally being passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to boast about having worked hard. We just did our 
job. Transport Canada's officials just did their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin my presentation by having a kind thought for the 
workers, for those in the airline industry who have been 
suffering for over 18 months. I am thinking in particular of the 
employees, pilots, flight attendants, ticket agents and 
maintenance people at InterCanadian. 
We are talking about more than 1,000 direct jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that governments, both federal and provincial ones, 
try to attract industries and create jobs—and I say this very 
objectively, because we want those whom we represent to have 
worthwhile jobs—we should have a kind thought for these 1,000 
workers, and the members of their families, who lost their jobs. 
Over 600 of them were in Quebec and the rest in the maritime 
provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My thoughts are with them and I am sorry that, with the 
restructuring that is going on, their company has not been able 
to stay in business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could also talk about the Air Montreal workers. This company 
had to suspend its operations lately. They were to resume on May 
15, but it seems that the suspension will be much longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My thoughts also go out to Canadian International Airlines 
employees who have been under stress for years, worrying about 
the financial survival of their company. They have invested 
money in the company and they have accepted salary rollbacks to 
invest in their company and save jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My thoughts go out to Air Canada employees also, who had their 
share of worries with the Onex takeover proposal. I remember 
that last fall, when I boarded a plane in Quebec or Montreal, 
they were wearing a stop Onex button. The situation was 
stressful for everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am tempted to say that this bill was expected, and I would 
add, without any hint of partisanship, that it is the reason why 
all parties in the House agree to dispose of it quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No party has tabled 930 or 430 motions in amendment this time, 
although such things can be done in a democracy. Even if we want 
to deal quickly with a bill, members of parliament have the 
right to move amendments. Everybody could see that, in this 
case, we were ready to move this bill swiftly through the House, 
and that is what we have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has been asking the federal government since 
1993 to stop subsidizing Canadian International Airlines at the 
expense of Air Canada, Quebec and Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the elections held on October 25, 1993, the then leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois, Lucien Bouchard, asked me to be transport 
critic for our party. I can remember some of the questions I put 
to Doug Young, the Minister of Transport at the time and now the 
newest member of the Canadian Alliance, who had a lobbying firm 
in Toronto and was making big bucks thanks to contracts he got 
from the Liberal government. I am sure business with the 
Liberals is not as good since he switched over to the Canadian 
Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, Doug Young has not changed. 
I knew him and I am very glad to be able to call him by his name 
in this House because he got what he deserved. The people of 
Acadie—Bathurst got rid of him. The people not only in his old 
riding but throughout the country do not like anyone who is as 
arrogant or, as we say back home, “baveux”, as Doug Young was. 
He was both arrogant and insulting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as arrogant was David Dingwall, who was also defeated. His 
Nova Scotia constituents sent him packing and now he is doing 
very well as a lobbyist in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember a question I put to Doug Young at the time, when I 
was criticizing the Liberal government for its lack of fairness 
in allocating international routes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister why Air Canada, which has its head office 
in Montreal, could not have access to the growing markets in 
Hong Kong and Japan. He told us that Canadian was experiencing 
financial difficulties and we had to help the company, which was 
normal since a lot of jobs were at stake. That answer was 
clearly aimed at winning votes. I said at the time and I will 
say again that, in 1993 and around that time, this government 
showed incompetence in allocating international routes and 
discriminated against Air Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason why the position of the Bloc Quebecois has 
been clear since 1993. Seven years later, we are finally getting 
what we were asking for. 
We, in the Bloc Quebecois, were saying that Canada should have a 
flag bearing national carrier for international routes, just as 
Great Britain has British Airways, France has Air France, Greece 
has Olympic Airways, and I could name many more, except of 
course for Japan and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were in agreement with having a national carrier and real 
competition on the Canadian domestic market, the trans-border 
market and the regional market. Seven years later, the bill 
before us is an answer to the position the Bloc Quebecois has 
been advocating since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have been asking the federal government since 1993 was 
to act to put an end to the duopoly that forced regional 
travellers to pay extravagant prices for service that was 
totally inadequate. 
We demanded that the federal government be more open regarding 
the implementation of the Official Languages Act in air 
communications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August of last year, the federal government undertook to 
change the rules of the game to allow Onex and American Airlines 
to take over the two Canadian national carriers, without giving 
any guarantee about competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, I have to be critical of my colleague, the Minister of 
Transport. I recall very well that in August 1999, our party 
asked that the Standing Committee on Transport be called in as 
soon as possible, because of preoccupying allegations in the 
press. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today, the Minister of Transport showed aggressiveness 
in his comments about the media and editorials. The minister was 
drawn and quartered by the media, especially the English 
language media. 
The French language media refrained from commenting. I read 
those editorials and the minister was rather roundly criticised, 
so I understand that he may have wanted to get even with the 
anglophone media, in particular those of Toronto, especially as 
he is the minister responsible for that area. He seized the 
opportunity to get even with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, it is no use to say “If the Minister had done this or 
if he had done that”, but in the case of this bill which is 
timely and the passing of which we do not want to delay, if the 
minister had been more responsive, if he had not listened to the 
government leader who refused, who played hide and seek with us, 
who did not want to call the Standing Committee on Transport 
because he knew that the House would be prorogued, that there 
was going to be a new speech from the throne, in other words if 
it had not been for all that hide and seek we were drawn into 
all summer long, I believe that the situation might have been 
solved much more rapidly. Who knows, InterCanadian might not 
have ceased operations on November 28 last. This has to be 
pointed out. 
That is where I must criticize the lax attitude of the federal 
government, especially the transport minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also tell the minister we know of his ties with his good 
friend Gerald Schwartz and Onex; the minister cannot deny that 
Onex president Gerald Schwartz is a generous contributor to the 
Liberal election fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I blame the minister for trying, in the middle of the summer 
holidays, to pitch us a fast ball, as we would say back home. In 
baseball terms, he tried to pitch a curve ball outside the home 
plate, the empire called a strike for a third out in the ninth 
inning. However, things did not go as planned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition was keeping a close watch. The four opposition 
parties formed an ad hoc committee which met here, in the House 
of Commons. We told the government “You do not want to convene 
the transport committee, we will form our own committee”. We 
heard witnesses with the co-operation of the four opposition 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader called it a masquerade, backroom or 
barroom discussions, but whatever it is called, it gives us an 
inkling of how he perceives democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, if the Minister of Transport had managed to convince the 
government House leader to convene the committee as soon as 
possible during the summer, perhaps we would not be here today, 
on May 15, reviewing this important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the points the Bloc Quebecois insisted on, and I believe 
it is in the bill, but I want to confirm it, was the respect of 
the 25% foreign ownership limit and the 10% limit on individual 
share ownership in Air Canada. We indicated to the transport 
minister that the increase of 10% to 15% of the limit on 
individual share ownership in Air Canada did not represent a 
major problem for our party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee as well as through the amendments we put forward at 
report stage, the parliamentary action of the Bloc members has 
been to insist that a series of concrete provisions be included 
in the bill to protect the regions and the small carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, we were in agreement with the commitment made by Air 
Canada on December 21 that no layoff would result from the 
merger between Air Canada and Canadian International. 
That is reflected in the bill. That is why we cannot criticize 
it. We insisted that no regional route be abandoned by Air 
Canada or its subsidiaries for the next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I talked about the consideration of bills. We are 
members from various political parties, with different 
interests, coming from different regions and, in my case, with a 
different language and culture. 
A bill is basically a tool of compromise. It is like the 
collective agreement signed at the end of the collective 
bargaining process, where labour and management have to 
determine the working conditions for the next three, four or 
five years. Ultimately, a compromise must be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The compromise we have before us is not completely satisfactory 
to me. Many things in life may not be completely satisfactory; 
as much as I strive towards sainthood and would like to get 
canonized as a saint at the end of my life on earth, I do not 
always behave accordingly. When I take stock of my life, I will 
say that it has not been fully and completely satisfactory.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one aspect where I would like the government to show a 
bit more open-mindedness, even if the minister has told this 
House that more restrictive measures had been adopted, and it is 
the enforcement of the Official Languages Act. I raise it again 
because this is the last opportunity I will have to do so in 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the minister to know that the air transportation 
workers intend to pursue the issue with the Senate. Do not 
forget that Senator Joyal defended the air transportation 
workers 25 years ago, and it is very likely they would testify 
before the Committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that Air Canada could improve its record as far as the 
use of the French language is concerned. 
Once again, I call upon Air Canada president Milton. He is a 
serious, reasonable person. He is not an adventurer. I believe 
that he has displayed tact in the debate over the restructuring 
and merging of Canadian International and Air Canada. He has 
proven himself to be a good manager, and I would like to 
congratulate him on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to put his foot down and make a much stronger 
commitment to increasing the number of French-speaking employees 
in all groups of employment at Air Canada. This company, as well 
as others, is considered as a stronghold of Canadian unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen Via Rail change its logo. Trains now have a great 
big maple leaf on the front. There is also a maple leaf on the 
tail of all Air Canada planes. This is to tell all Canadians 
“This is your country. 
Whether you speak French or English, wherever you live, this is 
your country”. In principle that sounds fine and dandy, but I 
would like to see it applied in real life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the 1,258 pilots at Canadian Airlines, is it normal or 
acceptable that, as of today, only 71 of them speak French? With 
francophones representing 24.8% of the overall population in 
Canada, is it normal or acceptable that only 17% of all Air 
Canada employees speak French? Is it normal or acceptable that 
only 15.8% of Air Canada pilots speak French? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all his power and business acumen, surely Mr. Milton can 
summon the vice-president of human resources and tell him “Look, 
with 24.8% of the population of Canada speaking French, since we 
now are a dominant national carrier, the tenth biggest company 
in the world, we must hire francophone workers”. By the way, 
these French speaking employees are all bilingual. I do not 
think there is one French speaking employee at Air Canada who is 
not bilingual. We have to remember that we are talking about 
bilingual francophones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a commitment from Mr. Milton would give hope to young men 
and women who are currently studying at the CEGEP in Chicoutimi. 
Hon. members will probably wonder why I am suddenly talking 
about the CEGEP in Chicoutimi. Let me point out that the CEGEP 
in Chicoutimi is the only CEGEP to have a flying training 
school.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are young people from every region in Quebec and even from 
elsewhere who come to the Chicoutimi CEGEP flying training 
school. 
It costs $100,000 a year to train a pilot at the school. Is it 
normal and acceptable, considering the strong demand on the 
aviation market, that 22% of graduates from the Chicoutimi CEGEP 
flying training school do not succeed in finding a job as a 
pilot? There must be something wrong. 
I do not want to start saying things because people will send me 
letters, faxes or e-mails to tell me that I am crying murder and 
expressing that mistreated francophone feeling again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has nothing to do with that. It is a matter of respect. If 
people say to us francophones that they love us, as they 
certainly will three days before the next referendum, “we love 
you and we do not want to lose you”, like the theme of the 
Centennial campaign in 1967 that said “Canada, stand together; 
understand together”, then they should prove it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add that I think Air Canada should make an 
effort to hire InterCanadian pilots who were laid off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Transport is listening carefully so I would like 
to ask him the following question: Does he know how many pilots 
of InterCanadian have been hired by Air Canada recently? There 
were many pilots. Of the 1,100 employees, I believe that there 
were between 325 and 400 pilots. Only three InterCanadian pilots 
were hired. Most of InterCanadian's pilots were francophones. 
With a bit of good will, Air Canada could encourage the hiring 
of InterCanadian's francophone pilots who are competent but 
presently out of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the Official Languages Act I would like, before 
concluding, to draw a comparison between the percentage of 
francophone employees at VIA Rail and the percentage of 
francophone employees at Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>VIA Rail is a transportation company that operates from Halifax 
to Vancouver—it provides rail transportation while the other one 
provides air transportation—and has to provide its service 
through the different provinces. 
Air Canada should know that the percentage of francophones at 
VIA Rail is 39.3%. VIA Rail is a crown corporation. Of course, 
the government has never heard us complaining that there were 
too many francophones at VIA Rail. Their percentage is 39.9% and 
at Canada Post it is 23.8%, which is equitable proportionally 
speaking. When I say that francophones account for only 17% of 
employees at Air Canada, it shows there is room for improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a look at complaints under the Official Languages 
Act. In 1998, there were three complaints against VIA Rail 
compared to 98 against Canada Post. The same year, there were 
251 complaints against Air Canada. 
This shows that if the Official Languages Act were applied more 
rigorously to Air Canada, this carrier might be forced to abide 
by the act. There were three complaints against VIA Rail in 1998 
compared to 251 against Air Canada. This is totally 
unacceptable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect I would like to point out to the House is the 
merger of seniority lists. The minister, and we, as 
parliamentarians, may be powerless in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague of the Canadian Alliance spoke about this earlier. 
I think there should be a little more good will or good faith 
among parties, and Air Canada management should show leadership 
and say “Wait a minute. Is it normal and acceptable that a 
Canadian Airlines International pilot with 22 years of 
experience should be placed at the bottom of the seniority list 
of Air Canada pilots?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to salute the determination of my friends, the 
regional pilots, mainly those of Air Alliance, now Air Nova, who 
believed for many years in the one employer theory. They thought 
in good faith that they could be included at their seniority 
rank on the list of Air Canada pilots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, a decision was made, confirming the opposite. I 
greatly sympathize with regional pilots, especially those of Air 
Alliance and Air Nova, who thought it was legitimate for them to 
think they would fly other planes than a Dash-8 or a Beechcraft 
1900, and I do not intend here to discredit the reliability of 
these aircraft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a pilot, but apparently, when you are a pilot, you 
expect to start flying small bush airplanes, then bigger 
aircraft and, perhaps, after 28, 30 or 32 years in your career, 
a Boeing 767 or 747 or an Airbus 330. 
It is perfectly legitimate for a young pilot to think about 
flying a bigger plane one day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way we can force those who chose to continue flying 
Beavers or Piper Aztecs to fly bigger planes, but I think that 
regional pilots simply wanted respect and recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call once again on the goodwill of the management of Air 
Canada to try to resolve this issue of the amalgamation of 
seniority lists.  I call on the management of Air Canada and Mr. 
Milton to give serious thought to giving the new Bombardier 
regional jets, 50-seaters, to the unified regional carrier that 
will be born of the amalgamation of Air Ontario, Air British 
Columbia and Air Nova.  Mr. Randell said before the committee 
that there would be a new amalgamated unit with a new name.  I 
would like Air Canada management to give serious thought to 
allocating the RJs to Air Canada's regional pilots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that Bill C-26 will require Air Canada to provide 
independent regional carriers with the same services it provides 
its subsidiaries to enable them to serve the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also recognize, on behalf of my party, that this bill gives 
new powers to the competition commissioner and the Canadian 
Transport Agency to prevent Air Canada or any other carrier from 
using anti-competitive practices or from imposing unfair prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is provided in the law, but we must keep an eye on how the 
dominant carrier will apply the law.  We wanted an ombudsman, as 
the minister said, and the government responded by providing a 
complaints commissioner.  Let us say that it is a borderline 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to respond to one thing the minister said earlier 
in his speech.  Perhaps this is the advantage of speaking after 
someone else: I can criticize what he said, but he cannot 
criticize what I say because there is no questions and comments 
period. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that an ombudsman was too bureaucratic and 
complicated a structure.  I am disappointed in the minister.  He 
went through all the problems of the armed forces when he was 
the Minister of National Defence, and the government's response 
to these numerous problems was to appoint André Marin as armed 
forces ombudsman, the person to whom soldiers could take their 
complaints.  I have never heard members of the armed forces 
complaining about the bureaucracy of the ombudsman.  On the 
contrary, he has a role to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister had wished, he could have agreed to what all 
members of the committee, except the Liberal majority, agreed—the 
creation of an ombudsman. 
Once again, I do not wish to criticize for the sake of 
criticizing.  I wish to be constructive.  The minister has 
responded by creating a complaints commissioner.  This is very 
interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In passing, I wish to congratulate Air Canada on appointing an 
ombudsman.  Air Canada's management probably knew that the 
committee was pushing for this.  It is interesting to see that 
our concerns as parliamentarians were noted by the dominant 
carrier.  Air Canada decided to appoint an ombudsman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we will have to keep a close eye on how this 
legislation is actually enforced, on a daily basis. 
I repeat that the Bloc Quebecois will be voting in favour of 
Bill C-26 at third reading, so that it can be passed quickly and 
real competition made possible, so that small local and regional 
carriers are protected as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize that we must pass this bill as quickly as possible, 
once again in order to protect the regions, regional users and 
companies with regional operations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
inherent that at least someone takes the time to remind the House 
and Canadians why we are in the position today of dealing with 
legislation to address a monopoly air carrier in Canada.  Quite 
frankly we got here as a direct result of deregulation within the 
air industry in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agreed with numerous witnesses, as was done many times in the 
past when deregulation came up, that it was not the answer.  I 
want to read a couple of statements made by some of those who 
appeared before committee.  This one is from the Federation of 
Canadian Municipalities which stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the air transportation system was deregulated in 1987, 
Canadians expected the introduction of new and special service 
operators to the marketplace, which would increase competition 
and bring better and less expensive services...by 1993 the 
industry was dominated by two major airlines competing for market 
share on every major route.  This cutthroat competition 
undermined the financial stability of both airlines— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Labour Congress stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unregulated market has hurt Canada's two airlines without 
delivering efficiency or higher quality service. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are two very different groups with the same perspective. 
All those great promises of deregulation just did not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deregulation has been a public policy failure for consumers, 
shareholders and workers.  The consequences of deregulation have 
been a crisis in 1992-93, in 1996, in 1999, and now in 2000.  We 
are still dealing with it.  We are dealing with layoffs, job 
insecurity.  We saw poor working conditions, wage freezes and 
cuts, chronic overcapacity in the domestic market and massive 
cost increases.  The overall cost of flying went up 76% since 
1992.  Gosh, we have to love that deregulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ticket prices outpaced increases in the consumer price index 
even with seat sales factored in, declining levels of services 
particularly in small communities and poor investment returns for 
both the airlines. 
Competition at any cost without modern regulations was not the 
answer. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deregulation was the root cause of the crisis in the airline 
industry.  The solution could have been effective modern 
regulation, not overregulation and too many price controls, aimed 
at protecting the public interest and ensuring that Canada's 
airlines could coexist and compete effectively in the global 
market.  Modern regulations could have seen a flexible approach 
and the use of government powers selectively to ensure that 
airlines compete fairly and live up to the public trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Profitable high traffic routes such as Toronto, Montreal and 
Ottawa will naturally attract competition among carriers.  These 
routes do not need government regulation to ensure adequate 
service.  The government needs to play the role of referee to 
ensure fair competition and prevent damaging anti-competitive 
behaviour such as the predatory pricing in excessive capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, low traffic routes between smaller 
communities are not guaranteed to attract service.  In these 
cases effective regulations would have been essential because 
reasonable and affordable service is a social and economic 
necessity.  The government has many tools at its disposal to 
address this point.  Will the bill accomplish that?  I do not 
think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deregulation and unhealthy competition have led to the monopoly 
situation.  What do we do to make sure the monopoly air carrier 
does not go crazy on us?  What can we do?  First, we need to 
recognize that the bill can only work in areas where it does not 
contravene the agreement made between Air Canada and the 
competition commissioner and okayed by the transport minister. In 
essence, it will not address all the difficulties and all the 
problems that numerous people have talked about and brought 
before committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill gives the force of law to Air Canada's commitment in 
this agreement.  However, everybody has acknowledged that Air 
Canada has been acting irresponsibly and is worried sick over 
what Air Canada will do.  Were there any efforts by the 
government or the official opposition party to put anything 
concrete in the bill?  Heavens no.  We do not want to interfere 
with the entrepreneurial spirit.  We do not want to interfere 
with the opportunity for Air Canada to make a buck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile the comments made by my colleague from the alliance 
party shocked me.  I think it is the first time she said it.  I 
listened to her talk about protecting workers, protecting small 
communities and maintaining service, but she supported nothing in 
the legislation that would have done those things.  I actually 
heard that colleague make a statement that will probably go down 
in Canada's history.  She said that we have to deal with more 
than the economic issue.  Quite frankly, I think she said it just 
for the sake of saying it because she wants to put it in a 
householder or a ten percenter that will head out west where they 
will lose a pile of jobs and where Canadian regional employees 
will not get the same benefits as other employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that Canada's airline industry is vital to 
the economic and social well-being of hundreds of communities 
across Canada.  That reality goes beyond the concerns of airline 
shareholders who focus mainly on the bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There certainly are some things in the bill with which I agree. 
There is no question.  There is no question that we need to have 
legislation in place, especially in the situation with a monopoly 
carrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one area of concern with regard to new carriers coming 
into business.  We extended the length of time that carriers 
would have to give notice.  We okayed it as a committee to go to 
120 days.  There was concern that it would hinder new entrants. 
Nobody argued with the fact that we did not want to hinder new 
entrants.  The NDP does not want to hinder new entrants coming 
in.  We recognize that when we want to try out markets we need 
some time.  The additional changes that went into the legislation 
now before us such as the 120 day extension to apply to new 
carriers is an excellent move.  It will give some opportunity for 
competition.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to see something happen in the area of an 
ombudsman; however, I am not thrilled with the fact that it is 
termed a temporary complaints commissioner.  For the benefit of 
the minister, I have to admit that I am pleased the position will 
fall under the auspices of the Canadian Transportation Agency. 
However, I wonder about the credibility of how that person will 
be seen when it is termed a temporary complaints commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The complaints we were hearing were not minor little complaints; 
people had serious concerns about the way they were being treated 
within the airline industry in Canada.  I do not consider them to 
be temporary little complaints.  Quite frankly, it would be great 
if the complaints would end and we had a system that operated 
smoothly.  My guess is that we will probably just leave it all to 
the monopoly carrier appointed ombudsman to look after all of the 
little complaints and we will shuffle them off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that it would be great if it were operating 
so efficiently that the temporary airlines commissioner would not 
be needed.  That would be wonderful.  However, I am not convinced 
that the complaints will end, especially if the indication we 
have as to how things will operate is what Mr. Milton has been 
indicating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My committee colleagues are great.  To the benefit of them all, 
the majority of them spent a lot of time on committee matters. 
They listened to witnesses.  They asked good questions of the 
witnesses.  Quite frankly, the comments I heard from my 
colleagues were not the same as the bottom line that came down on 
paper.  There were concerns about the labour issues, the 
ombudsman and price gouging.  What was the final result?  Let us 
give it six months and see if we need to review it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was this horrible person we have been dealing with.  Let 
us face it, there is one thing we can credit Mr. Milton for.  A 
survey was done a number of years ago that asked Canadians who 
they least trusted.  Lawyers and politicians were at the top of 
the list.  The only one who is probably least trusted now is 
Robert Milton, so we should give him credit for that at least. 
Through all the discussion on the airline merger he made promises 
that no workers would lose their jobs.  I heard him promise 
Canadian Airlines employees that everything would come together 
and there would be a smooth transition.  Everything would be done 
for them.  What we have listened to is nothing but problems with 
Robert Milton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will we do with this legislation?  We will hit him with a 
wet noodle.  That is all this legislation will do to Robert 
Milton.  If I am wrong, so be it.  I hope I am.  I hope and pray 
that something in this legislation, between the CTA and the 
Competition Bureau, will come together, but it does not appear 
that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were worried about price gouging.  Everybody complained.  We 
heard of a situation on the Hamilton-Moncton route.  It was just 
horrible what he had done.  My goodness, the legislation is not 
even there yet.  He does not even have the full rein and already 
he is doing these things.  Will nobody bother to put in place 
something to stop him?  We will wait six months and review it. 
That is disappointing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I honestly had hoped that my colleague from Winnipeg—Transcona 
would be around to hear this.  Prior to question period we were 
having a discussion on some of the amendments, one of which 
concerned the 25% foreign ownership limit.  We agreed that we did 
not want to delay the bill.  We were not necessarily happy as a 
caucus allowing things to pass on division, but we accepted the 
reasonableness.  We did not want to delay the bill.  We want to 
get things moving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Winnipeg—Transcona said that the Minister of 
Transport really is committed to the 25% foreign ownership limit. 
The minister stood here and said that absolutely we are not going 
to increase it.  Had my colleague from Winnipeg—Transcona been 
able just a short while after question period to listen to the 
minister's comments, he would have heard him say that if we do 
not get competition we will raise it. 
It did not take all of two hours before it happened.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not convinced that there is a real commitment not to raise 
the foreign ownership regulation.  Again, this would be one of 
those times when I would be happy to say “This is great.  It 
worked.  It is not going to happen”, but I am not totally 
convinced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note the things that are not in the 
legislation.  As I mentioned, the legislation deals only with 
particular things and not necessarily everything that came up as 
a concern.  The committee heard the concerns of the labour force. 
The legislation was not able to address any of the labour 
related issues.  The legislation does not deal with how to bring 
the two working groups together.  Again, we had thought that Mr. 
Milton would be very magnanimous.  Quite frankly, we know that is 
not the case.  I would hope that we would go beyond all the talk 
in committee and make sure that something is put in place so that 
we see the swift resolve of the labour issues.  Otherwise we will 
be dealing with an airline industry in constant crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the labour issue is related to seniority, which everyone 
recognizes is the key issue to be dealt with, that is not being 
dealt with.  Even if agreements have been reached, the issue of 
seniority has not been dealt with.  It will be left to 
negotiations a couple of years down the road.  As far as I am 
concerned, that does not address the problem, which is a result 
of this legislation and a result of a monopoly.  It is being 
delayed for someone else.  That is what is happening with that 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that we could assure the employees of Canadian 
Airlines and Air Canada, and any others who might be affected, 
that if there are issues as a result of this merger they will be 
given consideration and that there are persons within the 
Canadian Industrial Relations Board designated to deal with this 
swiftly so that it does not become a continuing crisis in the 
airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in the bill to address the very serious issue 
related to this monopoly carrier and the merger; that is, the 
issue related to employees.  None of us wanted to see either 
side, whether it be Canadian Airlines or Air Canada, lose out.  I 
would hope that no one on the committee saw one side or the other 
as having enough, even though Air Canada ended up being the 
owner.  I would hope no one saw that.  It certainly was not what 
was indicated to us by Mr. Milton or any other parties involved. 
There was an acceptance that these two companies would come 
together and the workers would be protected on equal terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the bill gives protection to small and medium 
size communities.  There will be rules in place for a couple of 
years, which could be extended, but I do not plan to leave my 
small community in three years.  I do not know how many other 
Canadians do.  There are a lot of Canadians who want to know that 
they will have service for quite a long time.  They want there to 
be some obligation for a carrier which is given a monopoly route, 
or other companies which have advantages to fly within Canada, to 
provide services to those communities.  The bill certainly falls 
short of doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other area which is notably missing concerns a passengers 
bill of rights.  I recognize that falls outside the scope of the 
bill and would probably be best dealt with another way, but I 
want to make a point of mentioning it because it was an issue put 
forward by witnesses at committee on numerous occasions.  The key 
players in our airline industry, the passengers, are the 
forgotten ones.  It is like the airlines are saying “We just 
want your money.  Go ahead and complain, but we do not 
necessarily want you to have the right to some of these things”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key things which passengers had concerns about were flights 
being cancelled without notice; people getting to the airport 
only to find they were on a totally different plane; or getting 
on the plane after waiting an hour, perhaps due to a delay, which 
we can all accept happens due to mechanical reasons or the 
weather. 
Passengers can accept that, but they want to know as soon as 
possible how long the delay will be and when they will be able to 
get going.  Often they want to know what the delay is for, for 
their own comfort.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How many times have members of the House boarded a plane after 
waiting an hour or an hour and a half and no sooner does the 
plane back away from the gate we are left waiting another hour on 
the tarmac?  We are hostages on the plane.  We cannot go back. 
That is a serious concern for passengers.  Those are just some of 
the issues that come up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though it seems as if this should be something we could 
deal with in the bill, I want Canadians to know that I recognize 
it is outside the scope of the bill.  We have had discussions 
with the people who wrote the legislation.  We have to look at 
other ways of addressing those concerns and go at it from a 
different angle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have ensured that there would be protection for all 
regions of Canada and that service would be provided.  I am not 
convinced that will happen.  Again, this may play out one way or 
the other in the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I felt that Air Canada having to divest itself of Canadian 
Regional was not a good thing.  I know that in a lot of those 
smaller and medium size communities Canadian Regional was often 
the other carrier, but Canadian Regional was often the only jet. 
I am not convinced that any carrier buying in will be able to 
continue service.  I am greatly concerned that those communities 
will have no jet service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Transport reflected on the fact that small and 
medium size communities do not have the best choice of service. 
He mentioned the Churchill area.  I would hate to think that air 
carriers in my riding are giving the perception that there is no 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I live in Thompson and I know that we have better opportunities 
than some other areas.  We are one of the larger centres in the 
Churchill riding.  The carriers that go into that area, Canadian 
and Conair, as well as a lot of smaller carriers, have been 
excellent.  Those carriers are not making huge profits.  I would 
not want to risk that service simply because something cannot be 
worked out with another carrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that note I will end.  Again, I am not convinced that the 
bill will do the job.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for Churchill has 
made a very thought provoking presentation.  There is no doubt 
that we could continue for a very lengthy period of time helping 
her to have a better understanding of many of the issues she 
presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the clarification of the listening public, there are a lot 
of problems that we have to deal with in this transition period. 
We have a major airline dealing with over 2,000 flights per day. 
Naturally, it will meet and have to deal with a great number of 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest news is that there was a 30% jump in the number of 
people travelling by air in the month of April.  That kind of 
sudden increase or surge in the number of passengers normally 
happens in June, which is another problem that this new dominant 
carrier has to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really puzzling.  We have a representative in the House of 
Commons who strongly believes in supporting the labour factor in 
our country.  The government, with its agencies, did everything 
in its power and did the right things to save 16,000 jobs at one 
of the major carriers, but not once has a word been mentioned 
about the salvation of those jobs by the measures which this 
government implemented.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think there is 
any question that jobs were not supposed to be lost.  Promises 
were made that no jobs would be lost.  Nobody would lose their 
job for two years.  Everything would be hunky dory. However, we 
have not seen this all play out yet.  If they do not lose their 
jobs that is great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that had there been some regulation in 
the area of capacity some time ago, we would not have gone 
through crisis after crisis in the airline industry.  It happened 
because we were afraid of the word regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be the first to admit that nobody wants over-regulation. 
We recognize that we have capacity regulations on international 
routes.  We have a very profitable international service.   Why 
would we not think that by having some regulation in the area of 
capacity we would not have saved these jobs anyway?  The hon. 
member will have to forgive me for not thanking him for saving 
the jobs that would probably have been lost as a direct result of 
the deregulation that the government put in place. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to say that this has been ongoing now for some months.  I 
really feel fortunate to have been involved with this because it 
has been an extremely interesting process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were thrown into the middle of this airline merger when 
Canadian Airlines was presented a proposal to be bought out and 
then merged with another airline.  It was an interesting process 
and we met some incredibly interesting people. We dealt with some 
complex issues.  As a committee we went into the process truly 
amateurs with very little knowledge about the background of the 
industry, the participants or the issues. However, we were 
educated by dozens and dozens of people from corporations and 
groups who made presentations to our committee.  Every 
presentation was beneficial and taught us something.   By the 
time the committee process was done we actually had a pretty good 
handle on it.  We were able to participate and add something to 
the debate and to the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dynamics of the committee were really interesting in that I 
do not think I have ever been on a committee where, although 
there was some partisanship, everybody took a sincere interest in 
trying to find answers to the problems.  The government committee 
members were just as aggressive as anybody in grilling the 
witnesses.  The chair was certainly aggressive in his treatment 
of the issue.  He knew what he was talking about. He took the 
time to understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the member for Hamilton West is very humble and would 
be embarrassed to hear me say this, he actually did a good job in 
running the committee.  I do not think we could call him a good 
friend to anyone on the committee, but he ran the committee hard. 
He kept it focused, on track and did a good job, which is what 
the chairman is supposed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a little interpretive licence here.  The minister 
was caught off guard when this whole issue unfolded and evolved 
before his very eyes.  A lot of us were watching to see how he 
would handle it and to see if he could find a way out of the mess 
that really was not of his doing.  He had limited tools to work 
with because there are only certain things the government, a 
minister or the department can do.  If the companies at the 
centre of this issue were not prepared to invest money or make 
these decisions, and if the shareholders would not back up the 
decisions, then the minister was limited in what he could do.  It 
was interesting to watch those dynamics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to meet Kevin Benson, Robert Milton and even 
Gerry Schwartz who came before the committee.  They all did a 
great job considering that their job was to represent their 
shareholders.  Their job was not to represent the public 
interest.  That was our job. I learned a lot from each and every 
one of them.  I will never forget the experience as we went 
through this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a puzzle to deal with, at least I found it to be a 
puzzle. 
Where does the Canadian Transportation Agency fit?  Where does 
the Transportation Safety Board fit?  Where does the Department 
of Transport fit?   Where does the Competition Bureau fit?  We 
had to learn about all these issues and try to fit each one into 
a slot where they could be effective and produce the desired 
results. Of course, there were surprises because every day 
something would change.  It was almost like the politics in our 
party, it changes every day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Absolutely always for the better.  There 
is still ongoing changes.  There are some fundamentally profound 
changes even as we speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I remember correctly, just a short time ago both Air Canada 
and the minister were opposed to the idea of an ombudsman.  Now 
the minister has come back with a very strong ombudsman, a 
complaints commissioner, which, in my interpretation of it, has 
teeth.  Last week Air Canada announced it was going to have an 
ombudsman.  Two weeks ago it wrote me saying that it was not in 
favour of that.  We can see how this whole process is still 
changing as we speak and will continue to change as problems 
develop and challenges arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that we are in a transition period which 
has caused a lot of problems for consumers and for all of us when 
we travel.  I understand that we are in a transition.  I know 
that the Air Canada and Canadian Airlines merger is faced with 
problems.  I can only imagine the problems Air Canada has to deal 
with in trying to reorganize and reschedule 2,000 flights a day, 
negotiate contracts with its unions, negotiate the sale of the 
Canadian regionals, arrange for all new schedules and accommodate 
the communities and politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that Air Canada has underestimated the 
impact this would have on consumers.  I think it is getting that 
message very clearly, as evidenced by the announcement late last 
week that it was going to establish an ombudsman in addition to 
the Canadian Transportation Agency complaints commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all seen and heard about the overbooking, the delays in 
scheduling, the line-ups and all that sort of thing.  We have all 
experienced them ourselves.  I am hopeful that these are 
transition issues that will soon be resolved.  I believe Air 
Canada has the will to resolve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our job, the minister's job and the department's job, was to 
come up with legislation to manage this merger even though we 
could not really tell the shareholders of Air Canada or Canadian 
Airlines what they had to do.  We could not tell them to invest 
money here.  We could not tell them to do certain things, nor 
could the Department of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this bill is the best reflection of what we can do. We 
have all had a crack at making amendments in order to improve or 
change it.  It is not exactly what I wanted but overall it is not 
a bad compromise.  I think we have all had a chance to influence 
it.  Even then, it has to remain flexible because of the ongoing 
changes and the fact that it is a work in progress that will 
continue to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party's view is that the government's role 
should be to create an atmosphere that will encourage competition 
and encourage the incredible entrepreneurial instinct that we saw 
at committee from so many people who were anxious to get into 
aviation business and expand it.  If there was one thing that 
surprised me, it was the number of small aviation companies in 
Canada that wanted to become big ones.  Our job was to create an 
atmosphere where they could develop and grow and not be squashed 
by the dominant carrier before they even had chance to start.  I 
think we have done that.  We have given the appropriate agencies 
the power to protect those new companies and the existing 
companies in expanding into new routes and regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time as encouraging competition and the 
entrepreneurs in the industry, we also had to protect consumers. 
Consumers have no protection if they have no place to go. If the 
line-up is too long and the dominant carrier does not want to do 
anything about it, too bad.  If there is overbooking and the 
dominant carrier does not want to do anything about it, too bad. 
We cannot go to plan B or another airline until some of those 
smaller airlines are big enough to really present themselves as 
competitors.  So, we have this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the job of the government—and the committee saw it as 
a responsibility—is to create protection for consumers.  We have 
done that.  A dominant carrier left unleashed could do a lot of 
damage to consumers, competitors and regional airports if it 
wanted to. 
Without the legislation that we have before us today, a lot of 
the things we have come to take for granted in the aviation 
industry would be trampled and disappear very quickly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the travel agents who made presentations to our committee 
made a good case in pointing out how powerful the dominant 
carrier is.  They sell something like 80% of the tickets.  If 
there is only one airline, that airline could determine how it 
will treat the independent travel agents.  We have addressed that 
in the bill and it is a good way to address it.  Their problems 
and concerns have been met and they will find themselves in a 
good position to deal with many of their issues.  They have to do 
it but we have given them the infrastructure and the tools to get 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One concern I had, coming from the Atlantic region, was the 
future of small regional airports.   We have a convergence of two 
government policies.  One is the divestiture process and the 
other is the merger process of the airlines.  They have come 
together to create some problems for small airports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the smaller regional airports have an extremely hard 
time making ends meet simply because they do not have access to 
alternative revenues.  The major airports with hundreds of 
thousands or millions of passengers travelling through the 
airports every year can have all kinds of alternative sources for 
revenue, such as liquor stores, lobster shops, rent-a-cars, you 
name it.  They can have an entire business community and shopping 
mall with a captive market.  The small airports with 200,000 
passengers or less do not have the traffic to sustain those shops 
and businesses that would generate alternative revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regional airports are already having a hard time making ends 
meet.  What will happen when we merge the airlines and the number 
of flights are reduced?  The smaller airports depend entirely on 
landing fees and terminal fees for their revenue.  They were 
having a hard time even with revenues from two airlines. When the 
two airlines merged, the number of flights in some airports were 
reduced dramatically and their revenue was reduced dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the divestiture process, where the airports were turned 
over to the communities, and we have the merger process which has 
made their situation even more difficult.   I believe the 
Department of Transport and the minister at committee 
acknowledged that smaller airports were having a hard time making 
ends meet and that this problem would have to be revisited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our challenge was to arrive at a balance between regulation or 
re-regulation and private enterprise and protecting consumers.  I 
think we have done that with a minimum of re-regulation and a 
maximum of flexibility in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Transportation Agency, the minister and the 
department have put some flexibility into the situation so that 
we can address the work in progress as it unfolds and as we get 
more surprises, which we will continue to get.  I believe we have 
the right balance and I am well pleased with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As new issues come up, these departments have to be able to 
address them.  By locking them in too tightly and not knowing 
what the future holds would be a mistake at this time because we 
are all still learning and it is an evolving situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also quite excited about competition.  From my view I see a 
lot of exciting competition in the business.  I do not think Air 
Canada will have a cakewalk.  I think it will face competition 
faster than it thinks, faster from the chartered airlines, the 
WestJets, the CanJets that will be starting up and the smaller 
airlines that are already in the planning stages.  There may be 
start-ups that we do not even know about it yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there will be competition, especially on the main 
lines.  The challenge will be on the regional routes and the 
feeder routes.  Even on those, I believe competition will filter 
down and Air Canada will have more competition than it has 
bargained for.  Eventually I do not think it will have the 
monopoly that it thought it would have or that some of us thought 
in the beginning it would have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sense a tremendous entrepreneurial spirit out there that is 
anxious to get into the business, to take a crack at this and to 
provide service to the regions and the main lines.  This looks 
very promising to me.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the controls the dominant carrier will have is access, 
access to airports, access to slots, access to counters and 
things like that.  That had to be addressed because it is 
definitely a problem which already has raised its ugly head since 
the airline merger.  Some new airlines have been stalled, delayed 
or redirected because the dominant carrier perhaps used more 
powers than it should have. We have put protection for that into 
the legislation. We have also put into the legislation new powers 
for the Competition Bureau and the Canadian Transportation 
Agency. All of these issues can be dealt with on an ongoing 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently Air Canada lowered its rates; as soon as WestJet 
started flying from Moncton to Hamilton, Air Canada reduced its 
rates from Moncton to Toronto. Right away the process was put in 
place to object to that.  Hopefully that will be resolved in a 
satisfactory way for everybody.  We could not outline every 
single possible permutation and combination in the initial 
legislation.  The flexibility is there to adapt as things change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have come up with many avenues for consumers to file 
complaints.  I do not recall the exact number but the Canadian 
Transportation Agency had something like 70 or 80 complaints last 
year.  My office has received 70 or 80 complaints in the last 
month, so there is something wrong with the access people have to 
complain about airline service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister's complaint commissioner under the CTA is well 
publicized and if people are made aware of the process, that will 
be the answer.  People need access to a complaint system and a 
conflict resolution system and that will be the complaints 
commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also Air Canada has committed to establishing an ombudsman and 
working with members and the public to make sure it deals with 
the complaints as fast as it can. In my experience, when there is 
a complaint at the senior level at least, it is dealt with and 
the problem is solved in a sincere manner.  However, when there 
is a 1-800 line with 10 recordings and people have to push two 
for this and four for that, they get so frustrated they do not 
file a complaint. I am confident that will be resolved and people 
will have a way to make sure their complaints are filed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers have the CTA.  The transport department will deal with 
certain issues.  There is the complaints commissioner, the Air 
Canada ombudsman and the Competition Bureau.  Among those avenues 
surely consumer complaints will be dealt with in a timely 
fashion.  If not, we can bring this back to committee and take 
another crack at it.  I do believe consumers now will have the 
tools they need to work with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as ownership rules go, I agree with the legislation.  In 
the former legislation the maximum amount of Air Canada that 
could be held was 10%.  The committee recommended 20%.  I 
recommended 15% and the minister went with my recommendation, for 
which I am honoured and flattered.  He did go with 15% which is a 
good compromise and a balance that satisfies most everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foreign ownership limit is to remain at 25%.  Again, 
flexibility is built into the system.  If things change and 
evolve and if change is necessary, there is flexibility for the 
minister and the government to change the 25% maximum foreign 
ownership.  That is appropriate.  It should not be locked in at 
any amount.  The flexibility should be there and as things 
change, it can be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all, the Conservative Party will be supporting the bill. We 
are grateful for the opportunity to participate in it actually. 
It has been a very interesting experience for me.  I very much 
appreciate the opportunities I have had to meet the people 
involved and hear the problems and issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we have come up with a balance for consumer protection 
and incentives for competition to provide the entrepreneurial 
instinct with lots of nourishment.  Certainly things will 
continue to evolve and we will continue to have to adapt but all 
in all, it is a fair resolution considering we do not have all 
the tools.  The minister and the department probably do not have 
all the tools they would like to have to control this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides a guideline for the companies involved to 
follow. 
It also provides penalties if they do not follow the rules.  It 
provides lots of rules which the airline industry has to follow 
to protect consumers.

<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the member and members of the committee seemed to 
put a lot of confidence in the airline ombudsman who will deal 
with the difficulties and questions that arise as a result of the 
consolidation that has taken place in the airline industry in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A while back the official opposition tried to institute another 
ombudsman, the first nations ombudsman, to try to bring some 
accountability to first nations undertakings.  The House deemed 
that such an officer would not really be effective or necessary 
in relation to aboriginal affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that the office of ombudsman for the airlines was not a 
creation of the airline executives or I am sure we never would 
have had it. Yet the minister of Indian affairs seems to think it 
has to be the chiefs who create an office of ombudsman if ever 
there were to be such a thing with Indian affairs.  It occurred 
to me that there was quite a bit of hypocrisy evident in such a 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving on, I would like my hon. colleague's comments on another 
aspect of competition.  It concerns not prices, not frequency or 
anything like that but that little word innovation which often 
comes to light when people are in competition with one another. 
In other words, how can we attract customers?  How can we best 
serve customers?  How can we make things happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I was interested in as a business traveller 
was that Canadian Airlines made provision for computer plug-ins. 
It seems a small thing but when we are on a long flight and we 
want to do some work we end up doing work somewhere between 
Toronto and Winnipeg.  That is not necessarily the full extent of 
a lot of our trips.  That is just one small example of 
innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the Competition Act, I wonder what my hon. colleague 
thinks is now going to drive innovation.  We know that business 
class subsidizes seat sales and will continue to do so, but how 
is that going to work with respect to innovation in airline 
travel?  Will we see many changes in the future or are we going 
to be stuck with what we have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
intervention.  There are going to be two ombudsmen.  One is the 
Canadian Transportation Agency's complaints commissioner.  That 
is a unique position because he has the power to demand 
documents, demand testimony and hear witnesses.  It is almost a 
quasi-judicial body.  He has the power to get the information 
which is probably more than most ombudsmen have.  He also has the 
power to make his reports public.  He will report to parliament 
through the minister and he also has the ability to go public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the airlines are consumer driven companies. Bad PR 
from an ombudsman is not something they will want to get.  If the 
ombudsman is successful and effective and he makes a report in 
the media that an airline is not doing something right, I am of 
the opinion the airline will act very fast to correct it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada announced last week that it is going to establish its 
own ombudsman.  I believe it is going to try to intervene even 
before consumers get to the official government complaints 
commissioner.  It is going to try to get the complaints first so 
it can deal with them. I am confident that one or other of those 
programs is going to work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we are going to see more innovation than ever.  The 
best example is WestJet, one of the newcomers to the industry. 
WestJet has an innovative pay plan.  It has innovative policies 
as far as its employees are concerned.  It has a uniform airplane 
plan which is simple but really works.  This makes WestJet one of 
the most profitable airlines in North America based on its 
capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of having two giant airlines that are struggling, we are 
going to have many smaller airlines doing exactly what the member 
is asking about.  They will be using their entrepreneurial 
instincts to innovate, to come up with new ideas and ways to get 
a market share from the dominant carrier.  We are going to see a 
lot more innovation than we ever did before. I am optimistic that 
the small companies and entrepreneurs are going to come alive 
under this umbrella.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
my colleague from Cumberland—Colchester spoke very eloquently to 
the legislation, almost to the point that I did not know whether 
he was sitting on this side of the House or the other side. He is 
taking a lot of credit from the committee's perspective and I 
really appreciate that.  I not only appreciate it but I have a 
lot of good things to say about the competency of my colleague 
and I will follow his lead on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one question on something which was not touched on during 
his speech but may well have been touched on at committee.  I am 
talking about cabotage.  The minister talked about it. There is a 
possibility that cabotage may well drive the necessary 
competition to ensure that airlines treat their customers 
properly and fairly with respect to airfares and service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my colleague tell me if cabotage was discussed?  That 
would be reciprocal cabotage, not only cabotage within Canada 
with American airlines but reciprocal cabotage with Canadian 
airlines being able to service multiple points in the United 
States.  Was that ever discussed?  Was it ever an option? It is 
obviously not in the legislation.  Could it be put in the 
legislation at a future date if the ombudsman as well as other 
areas of control do not work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Madam Speaker, I often wonder what side 
of the House I am sitting on too, because last week the media had 
me over on that side for about three or four days and then they 
had me over here for a few days.  Now I am back over there for a 
day or two but I am not going anywhere because I like it right 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's question about cabotage is a good one.  Cabotage is 
a control a government has to prevent other airlines from 
operating in its country.  It is a common regulation. Countries 
do not allow airlines from other countries to operate in their 
countries.  It is a kind of tariff.  I would not support Canada 
lowering its tariffs on our airline industry without other 
countries reciprocating and allowing us access to their markets 
as well.  I would not support lowering tariffs for Americans to 
ship products into Canada if we could not ship exactly the same 
product into the U.S.  My point is that I do not think we should 
allow cabotage unless it is reciprocal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not do that yet because from what I have seen, I 
believe there is a tremendous entrepreneurial instinct and effort 
in Canada in the aviation industry.  It is extremely exhilarating 
and exciting when I listen to the new aviation companies that are 
on the frontier of the whole industry. They are exciting and 
aggressive people who are anxious to compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see how good Canadians do before we start talking about 
cabotage.  I would not consider cabotage unless it was 
reciprocal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to point out today the effort that has been made by a 
number of critics, in particular our member for 
Cumberland—Colchester.  He has proven that he does his homework 
on behalf of his constituents and on behalf of our party.  He is 
the best transport critic on the hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that the Minister of Transport 
has been here all day listening to the debate. That is a 
testament of how all ministers should treat bills when they are 
brought forth in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order.  I understand there have been consultations among 
the parties for one speaker per party.  Therefore it would take

question on third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The Chair is not

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Madam Speaker, I was not too well

submit to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B>  Madam Speaker, I regret that 
the Chair was not informed of this arrangement between the

that will upset the apple cart, so to speak, at this late stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I have to give the 
hon. minister the same answer.  Nothing about an agreement to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Perhaps we could ask for unanimous consent of the House 
to deem third reading complete at this point.  If there was an

control its own destiny on that point.  I would ask you, Madam 
Speaker, to ask the House for its unanimous consent for third 
reading to be completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  My answer has to be

</I></B></P><P align=left>I apologize if the message did not get to you, Madam Speaker, in 
particular.  I thought that message would be passed on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  At this point I will

that does not bother me at all and I will agree not to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It is the choice of

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SPECIES AT RISK ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK200">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 11 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-33, an act respecting the protection of wildlife species 
at risk in Canada, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure today to 
speak to Bill C-33, an act respecting the protection of wildlife 
species at risk in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that when I first heard that legislation dealing with 
species at risk was to be tabled in the House, I thought that it 
was a particular bill aimed at protecting hon. members on the 
government side.  With the creation of the new Canadian Alliance, 
the real species at risk in this place will be Liberal members of 
the House.  Of course I was later told that it was actually to 
protect species at risk concerning wildlife, so I was happy to 
modify my speech slightly to be able to deal with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance knows that all Canadians care about 
protecting species at risk and indeed about protecting and 
preserving the environment as a whole.  A majority of Canadians 
agree that the fragile balance of our ecosystems must be 
protected and preserved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I want to talk about the path to protecting species at 
risk.  In doing so I should like to focus my discussion on what 
caring for species at risk should look like, because there are 
different views held by many Canadians on how this can best be 
achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my remarks today I will address the deficiencies which the 
Canadian Alliance sees within the government's approach in Bill 
C-33, as well as some of the measures we support.  In doing so I 
will highlight the credibility gap from which the Liberals suffer 
on protecting species at risk.  I will also outline some of the 
Canadian Alliance solutions for protecting species at risk and 
demonstrate how our plan to protect species at risk is balanced 
and accommodating, as well as practical and workable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purposes of Bill C-33 are the following:  to prevent species 
indigenous to Canada from becoming exterminated or extinct, to 
provide for the recovery of endangered species, and to encourage 
the management of other species from becoming extinct.  These are 
noble and worthwhile objectives, but they are ones which the 
Canadian Alliance supports just as most Canadians do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already mentioned how much Canadians care about 
protecting species at risk.  Recent polling confirms this point. 
However we know that simply caring is not enough.  We know this 
from other life experiences as well.  Let us consider how loving 
parents show their care and love for a sick child.  There is no 
substitute for proper medical care.  In a similar way, simply 
loving our unspoiled wilderness and indigenous species is no 
substitute for a workable plan to ensure the preservation of the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is important to emphasize from the outset that on 
the issue of protecting species at risk there is a number of very 
concerned and caring stakeholders who, although they may come 
from very different perspectives, are equally concerned for the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue should not be about which individuals or groups care 
more about protecting and preserving species and their habitats. 
Rather, it should be about how various stakeholders, landowners, 
conservation groups, governments, and the public at large can 
work together to express their care for species at risk through 
co-operative efforts in a way that will allow for species and 
their habitats to truly be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the role of government?  It is to build bridges rather 
than walls between stakeholders.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of government in protecting species at risk is a very 
important one.  I must say that I believe the role of government 
fundamentally is to empower stakeholders to work together. 
Within the next few minutes I will discuss how I believe this can 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, first let me say what I believe the role of government 
is not.  It is not to wield power over stakeholders.  Government 
is only one of many stakeholders and we must not lose sight of 
this fact throughout the debate.  The House would do well to 
recognize that the vast amount of resources, knowledge, energy 
and will to protect species at risk actually lies outside the 
government within and among stakeholders, landowners, scientists, 
conservationists and the public.  Regrettably, I believe that the 
government and the minister have seriously confused what their 
real role should be in creating a workable plan to protect 
species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not yet realized that its real role is to 
build bridges between stakeholders, not walls.  This is the real 
task of government on the issue of species at risk, one which the 
government has left undone.  In the species at risk act the 
Liberals have introduced a piece of legislation that will do more 
to polarize and divide stakeholders rather than to bring them 
together.  In the next few minutes I will expand on a number of 
problematic areas the Canadian Alliance sees with the species at 
risk act and what our solutions to these problems are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I should like to turn the attention of members to the most 
critical element that must appear within any workable species at 
risk legislation which the government has virtually ignored. What 
should our caring for species at risk look like?  Why is respect 
for property rights central to this legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I affirm that the Canadian Alliance is committed to protecting 
and preserving Canada's natural environment and endangered 
species and to sustainable development of our abundant natural 
resources for the use of current and future generations. 
Furthermore, we maintain that for any endangered species 
legislation to be effective it must respect the fundamental 
rights of private property owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that any action plan to protect species at risk must 
be based on respect for the species who inhabit our waters and 
lands and respect for those who own those waters and lands.  I 
will return to this point in a moment when I highlight the major 
flaws within the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem of enabling legislation to protect species at risk 
is that in recent days we have been hearing common complaints on 
a number of bills about a disturbing trend in the way the 
government is enacting legislation.  I am referring to the kinds 
of enabling legislation the government has become known for 
introducing.  It is the kind of legislation that allows for 
regulations to be developed after legislation has been passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that these regulations are never scrutinized by 
members of parliament or by committees.  Instead, it is a way for 
the government to slip an agenda through the back door.  This 
kind of approach to legislation is a disgrace to democracy 
because issues that ought to be dealt with and which could be 
improved are never properly dealt with.  Yet this is exactly the 
approach which has been taken within the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework for recovery and action plans are outlined along 
with the broad and sweeping powers the federal government will 
have to protect endangered species or habitat throughout 
subsequent order in council regulations.  The real nuts and bolts 
will appear only after the legislation has been passed. 
Subsection 1(4) reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Governor in Council may, on the recommendation of the 
Minister...make regulations defining any term or expression for 
the purpose of this Act or the regulations— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is the House to know what we are passing when the government 
essentially has a blank slate upon which to write in whatever it 
wants after the fact? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second issue is that of compensation.  The implications of 
this style of legislation and governance are becoming 
increasingly more troublesome, particularly in dealing with such 
fundamental issues as property rights to which I alluded a few 
moments ago. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is painfully obvious that the government has missed this 
point altogether.  How is this obvious?  This government has 
devoted only minor sections of the entire bill to issues of 
utmost importance to landowners, namely, compensation for land 
expropriated for the purpose of species or habitat protection or 
recovery and voluntary stewardship initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has offered no clear formula for compensation 
within this bill.  Compensation, like the majority of other 
important issues in the bill, will be dealt with through order in 
council regulations following its passage, as I just mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has tried to pretend that he is dealing with the 
issue by appointing a distinguished resource economics expert to 
provide advice regarding compensation for affected landowners. 
Still the minister refuses to recognize the centrality of this 
one issue to the success of any species at risk legislation.  The 
minister fails to see that compensation for expropriated land, if 
not at fair market value, is simply not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister would only set out the above principle within 
the legislation, the appointment of this resource economist would 
probably be largely unnecessary.  Furthermore, if the government 
would commit to a fair market value principle this legislation 
would most likely enjoy the support of a majority of landowners. 
Instead, by stubbornly ignoring the rights of property owners, 
the minister has isolated an entire group of stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this point it was interesting to hear the minister's view on 
the issue the other day when the parliamentary secretary spoke to 
the bill.  She stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the federal safety net is used to protect critical habitat 
on private land there will be provisions to compensate for 
unexpected losses caused by unforeseen restrictions on the normal 
use of that land.  The compensation provisions, however, will not 
create perverse incentives to inhibit voluntary habitat 
protection measures in hopes of receiving future compensation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of government would make this kind of outrageous 
statement?  What is so perverse is that a government would show 
this much disdain for the property rights of Canadians; that a 
government would show this much disrespect for landowners, who 
are already committed as stewards of their lands and whose 
families have in many cases been stewards of the lands for 
decades and even centuries, in many cases before the birth of 
Canada or the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Landowners have no intention of lining up at the cash register, 
as the minister said so arrogantly a few months ago.  Does the 
minister really think that is what landowners want?  On the 
contrary, landowners want nothing more than to continue to own, 
use and care for their lands.  It is this government that is 
creating perverse disincentives for landowners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message the minister is sending by not providing a fair 
market value guarantee is that landowners cannot be sure they can 
trust a minister or a government which refuses to guarantee that 
their fundamental property rights will be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has this backward.  Co-operation among stakeholders 
is unlikely unless landowners are assured that any land 
expropriated for species or habitat protection or recovery will 
be expropriated at fair market value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also see that this legislation is virtually silent on the 
issue of stewardship initiatives.  Bear in mind, this is from a 
minister who is very fond of talking of stewardship, agreements 
and partnerships in the press conferences he holds.  Again, the 
parliamentary secretary said in the House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this legislation to be effective all affected stakeholders 
must be engaged.  Reality and experience dictate that to get the 
job done we need landowners, conservation groups and other levels 
of government working together. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We completely agree. 
The question is, how will the government achieve this?  The 
government is certainly not telling us how in this legislation. 
What is its approach?  This is a government that talks about 
stewardship and voluntary incentives at the same time as it talks 
about forcefully taking control of lands.  In doing this the 
Liberals are sending a clear message that they do not 
fundamentally believe in the goodwill of Canadians.  There is 
nothing in Bill C-33 that builds on voluntary stewardship 
initiatives.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to my fourth point.  While the species at risk 
act is heavy on punitive measures, search and confiscation, 
through the establishment of enforcement officers along with 
threats of fines and imprisonment, it is light on doing anything 
to promote meaningful voluntary stewardship initiatives, which 
have so far been very successful.  The majority of producers and 
landowners believe that the government could achieve more through 
co-operation with farmers and ranchers than through threats of 
punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now turn to an area within this legislation which has become 
the subject of considerable controversy.  I am referring to the 
role of the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in 
Canada, COSEWIC.  The bill also provides for the establishment of 
the Canadian endangered species conservation council, which is to 
be comprised of the ministers of the Environment, Fisheries and 
Oceans and Canadian Heritage, together with their provincial and 
territorial counterparts.  The primary role of COSEWIC is to 
provide general direction on the activities of the Committee on 
the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance believes that the general functions of 
COSEWIC in its relationship to parliament are sound and should be 
supported.  COSEWIC will function as an independent, arm's length 
scientific body, will develop reviews and annual assessments on 
the status of wildlife species and will report and provide advice 
to the minister and the Canadian endangered species conservation 
council.  While COSEWIC will provide guidance to parliament with 
respect to determining species protection priorities, it is 
impractical to suggest that COSEWIC should have the final say in 
the funding of those priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who would suggest that this view is inconsistent 
with the position of policy based on sound science.  However, 
since COSEWIC has no real taxation powers, it therefore has no 
real tax revenue or spending authority.  I want to make it clear 
that the Canadian Alliance supports an independent scientific 
listing body such as COSEWIC to provide guidance to parliament to 
determine priorities for protecting specifies at risk.  At the 
same time we recognize the role of parliament as a spending 
authority in recovery planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to return for a moment to the concept of 
stewardship initiatives to protect species at risk.  I have 
already mentioned that in its current form Bill C-33 is heavy on 
punitive measures, yet very light on doing anything to promote 
meaningful voluntary stewardship initiatives, which have so far 
been very successful.  It is a sad fact that punitive and 
aggressive environmental laws have often replaced the commitment 
to co-operation with feelings of antagonism and mistrust among 
stakeholder groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no better example of this failed approach to 
environmental protection than in the area of species and habitat 
protection legislation.  The United Stated Endangered Species 
Act, 1973, for instance, destroyed the essential relationship 
between private landowners and conservation groups.  When the 
freedom to manage their property was subsequently taken from them 
once the conservation objectives had been achieved, no longer 
were farmers and ranchers prepared to nurture the survival of 
species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said this before, but I must emphasize this point.  As a 
result of that legislation conservationists lost a valuable 
working relationship with private landowners.  Landowners often 
lost their property and their livelihoods and species at risk 
lost the partners they relied up to survive.  I believe it is 
important that Canada learn from this unfortunate U.S. 
experience.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. endangered species act also places a disproportionate 
share of the financial burden of habitat protection on private 
landowners and has caused these landowners to lose substantial 
portions of economic use of their land.  In the face of such 
disincentives, U.S. landowners have begun to take measures to 
ensure their land is unencumbered by endangered or threatened 
species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for any Canadian species at risk act to be effective, 
we must recognize that if protection of species and habitat is a 
common good then it must also be a common responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the most remarkable conservation success 
stories of this century were achieved through the willing 
co-operation of private owners.  If voluntary stewardship efforts 
are important to the federal government, existing programs in 
support of private conservation should be enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I have discussed the path toward protecting species at 
risk.  As I said at the beginning, this debate over the proposed 
species at risk act is not about who cares more about the 
environment.  Caring is only what motivates us to work together 
to find solutions.  This is a debate about what policies can best 
accommodate the needs of stakeholders involved and provide the 
best incentives for all Canadians to become active stewards of 
the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping that throughout the process of this debate, 
especially as we get into the committee stage where we have the 
chance to really address the bill and hear from a number of other 
stakeholders that I have addressed throughout my speech, the 
government will consider in strengthening the parts of the 
legislation to bring all stakeholders together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope and it is the hope of the Canadian Alliance that 
in general, as was mentioned, the particular legislation on 
endangered species is a theme in legislation that can be embraced 
by Canadians across the country.  It is something that most 
Canadians would like to see put in place.  As I mentioned, it 
becomes an issue of fairness.  It should become an issue of 
trying to put legislation in the House that brings people 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said on occasions prior to this debate that we often see 
legislation introduced in the House by the government that is 
weak and that divides Canadians.  Here is another perfect example 
of that.  Even in talking with conservation groups and talking 
with a number of other stakeholders who want to see the 
legislation embraced by all parts of society, they all agree the 
commitment the government has made not only in its Speech from 
the Throne but throughout discussions on environment in the past 
comes up very weak, especially when we look at the funds 
allocated to the environment in the particular area of endangered 
species and in other areas of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot stress the point enough that when it comes to putting a 
balanced approach in the legislation, legislation that can 
succeed in including all stakeholders, compensation has to be the 
key.  It is something that environmental groups want to see, 
especially when it comes to building effective recovery plans 
that involve private landowners and other groups involved in 
dealing with and managing land.  It is about putting aside proper 
compensation, especially for private landowners who will through 
the goodness of their hearts and in the goodness of pushing 
forward a successful endangered species recovery agenda, to 
ensure that they are compensated effectively in that sort of 
equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the only thing that is missing from the particular 
legislation, especially when it comes to bringing those groups 
together.  I mentioned at the top of my speech and later about 
how particular types of legislation are introduced in this place 
that divide Canadians and divide stakeholders.  I wish the 
government would listen and start to make the changes that could 
bring all these groups together.  When I talk to the various 
stakeholders there is no question that they seem to be all on the 
same page and they want to see the same things.  They want to see 
results in protecting endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was mentioning, I hope we get to committee stage and look 
at ways that as Canadians in this place we can create legislation 
that is good, legislation that can be improved and legislation 
that can bring various stakeholders together.  I hope we have the 
spirit that all stakeholders want, the spirit to bring people 
together and through treating people fairly achieve that goal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes in committee and even in this place we tend to get our 
backs up and revert to partisan politics.  But I am confident 
there is nothing partisan about endangered species and nothing 
partisan about protecting endangered species.  As Canadians in 
this place especially in showing leadership to the stakeholders 
who want to be involved with this process, we can make changes to 
this legislation which I am confident will make everyone happy 
and have a unified voice in moving forward with endangered 
species issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that final note, it is the hope of the Canadian Alliance to 
have a plan that truly protects species at risk.  I hope that in 
this place we will show that leadership and that the minister and 
the committee will show that leadership as we get to the stage to 
make amendments to this legislation to make it stronger.

am pleased to rise to speak at second reading to Bill C-33, the 
Species at Risk Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before starting my remarks, I would like to briefly put the bill 
in context. Biodiversity as a whole is the result of the 
evolution of the earth over 4.5 billion years. This evolutionary 
process created a wide selection of living organisms and natural 
environments on our planet. Together they form the ecosystems we 
know today, and each one plays a specific role in the food chain 
and contributes to the biological balance of the planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, for some years, scientists have been warning about the 
disappearance of certain species in increasing numbers, as well 
as the rise in the number of species facing extinction or 
extremely vulnerable species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decrease or degradation of the biological diversity concerns 
us all and could have unpredictable consequences for our 
environment. Over the past few years, in Canada, as elsewhere in 
the world, efforts have been undertaken to try to slow down this 
process. Starting in the 1970s, international conventions were 
signed limiting the trade of certain animal and vegetal species 
in order to protect them from extinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cases in point include the 1971 Convention on Wetlands of 
International Importance Especially as a Waterfowl Habitat, 
better known as the RAMSAR Convention. The Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and 
Flora, more commonly known as CITES, was  signed in 1973. In 
1979, there was the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory 
Species of Wild Animals.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SPECIES AT RISK ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK207">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-33, an 
act respecting the protection of wildlife species at risk in 
Canada, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, let me 
continue from where I was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, at the Rio summit, many nations of the world, including 
Canada, signed the Convention on Biological Diversity and made 
the commitment to adopt or maintain the necessary legislative 
and regulatory provisions to protect species and distinct 
populations at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Soon after that, in their red book, the Liberals promised to 
ensure long term protection of species that live on our planet. 
In 1995, the current Minister of Canadian Heritage, then 
Minister of the Environment, introduced a first bill in that 
spirit. That bill gave rise to an incredible amount of protest 
and criticism, mainly from environmental groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main objections to the bill had to do with the fact 
that the legislation would only apply to federal territories. 
Only four provinces, including Quebec, had a law on endangered 
species. Environmental groups argued that it was essential that 
the federal government legislate for the whole country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, the federal government laid before the provincial and 
territorial environment ministers a Canadian Accord for the 
Protection of Species at Risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1996, the ministers 
responsible for wildlife approved the accord in principle. Even 
though he signed the agreement, David Cliche, Quebec's Minister 
for the Environment, issued an independent press release, in 
which he said clearly that he could not remain indifferent to 
the fact that this accord opened the door to overlapping between 
federal and provincial legislation, and that a close eye would 
have to be kept on events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few weeks later, the federal government, through the then 
Minister of the Environment, Sergio Marchi, introduced Bill C-65, 
an act respecting the protection of wildlife species in Canada 
from extirpation or extinction, which was the forerunner of Bill 
C-33 now before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether this government is responsible or not, but 
I do know that at the time it was criticized by the provinces 
for the very broad powers it was assuming for the protection of 
wildlife species. Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, 
Newfoundland, New Brunswick, the Yukon, and the Northwest 
Territories expressed deep concerns about the concept of 
cross-border species and the powers defined in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many criticized the minister's about-face when he introduced his 
bill and said the exact opposite of what he had stated a few 
weeks earlier—funny how this government keeps doing this—about 
wanting to improve harmony between the provinces instead of 
imposing standards. The Liberals let Bill C-65 die on the order 
paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are now bringing this issue back on the forefront, by 
introducing a so-called improved bill. Improved how? Improved 
with regard to provincial jurisdictions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to 
indicate that some federal legislation, like the Fisheries Act 
or the National Parks Act, allows the federal government to step 
in to protect some species, but there is no federal legislation 
directly dealing with that specific purpose.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If passed, Bill C-33 would be the first Canadian legal 
instrument directly concerned with the protection of endangered 
species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since pollution and migratory species know no boundaries, 
co-operation is required at the international level, as it is 
also, on a lower scale, at the national level. Canada federalism 
calls for co-operation between the provinces on this issue, since 
this is an area of shared jurisdiction in Canada. It is 
important to protect endangered species in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that close to 70,000 known species have their 
habitat in Canada, many of which are found only in Canada. The 
Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, or 
COSEWIC, has designated 340 wildlife species as at risk in 
Canada. This organization established in 1978 is composed of 
representatives from every government agency, province and 
territory, as well as four national conservation agencies. It is 
the main player in the protection of species and it is 
responsible for establishing an index of the endangered species 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The COSEWIC indicated that, of the 340 wildlife species 
considered at risk in Canada, 12 are now extinct, 15 are 
extirpated species or no longer exist in the wild in Canada, 87 
are endangered, 75 are threatened and 151 are vulnerable, which 
means that there are concerns about these species. 
Of the 97 species whose status was reassessed in recent years, 
26 are now closer to becoming extinct. This was one of the 
findings in a guide to the Species at Risk Act published by the 
Government of Canada and released by the Department of 
Environment on April 11, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say that without appropriate legislation, be it 
federal or provincial, without enforcement measures and adequate 
resources, the COSEWIC initiatives are insignificant and their 
impact is limited. With the increase in the number of species 
facing extinction, the problem is serious. Consequently, we must 
adopt effective measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But does Bill C-33 really provide an additional protection that 
is enforceable? Will it really do something to improve the 
protection of our ecosystems and of the threatened species that 
are part of them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the issues involved here, according to 
the Bloc Quebecois.  Despite the summary indication in the 
preamble about the shared responsibility for protecting 
endangered species, the bill's wording does not reflect this. 
It does not reflect reality, i.e. the fact that the main thrust 
of habitat protection is provincial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything in fact suggests that the minister holds the power—and 
I say power advisedly—to impose his vision of protection on the 
provinces when he deems it necessary.  In other words, his 
legislation will take de facto precedence over existing 
provincial legislation, even if the habitats fall solely under 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 10 stipulates that the minister “may—enter into an 
agreement—with respect to the administration of any provision 
of this Act”.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More precisely, in the section on general prohibitions, it is 
clearly stated in clause 34(2) that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Governor in Council may, on the recommendation of the 
Minister, by order, provide that sections 32 and 33 apply in 
lands in a province that are not federal lands— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, it is indicated that if the minister deems that 
the law of a province—clause 34(3)—or of a territory—35(3)—does not 
protect the species, he must recommend to the governor in 
council that an order be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granted, clauses 34(4)(<I>a</I>) and 35(4)(<I>a</I>) provide that “Before 
recommending the Governor in Council make an order under 
sub-section 2, the Minister must consult the appropriate 
provincial minister”. However, the bill only refers to 
consultation. The bill seems to say implicitly that in the case 
of disagreement, the opinion of the federal government will 
prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, through clause 36, the bill forces the provinces who 
identify some species as threatened species not listed as 
endangered species by COSEWIC to apply the same restrictions to 
their own species as those imposed on designated species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By doing so, the federal government is assuming the right to 
impose its own way of protecting species. Members of the Bloc 
are not convinced that constraints and fines would always be the 
avenues privileged by a province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the recovery strategy, the terminology chosen also 
raises concerns in regard to the jurisdiction of provinces in 
that area. Clause 39 reads that “to the extent possible”, the 
recovery strategy must be prepared in co-operation with the 
provincial minister. I repeat, “to the extent possible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Action plans referred to in clauses 47 and 48 raise a similar 
concern. More particularly, the whole part of the bill  dealing 
more directly with the critical habitat, namely clauses 57 to 
64, allows the government to establish codes of practice and to 
impose national standards or guidelines, even if the federal 
government has no control over most of the territories concerned 
and no power over the management of resources on those lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does the bill give broad discretionary powers to the 
Minister of the Environment, but it does not respect the 
division of powers as stated in the Constitution and as 
interpreted over the years. This bill truly interferes in an 
area under provincial jurisdiction and excludes the provinces 
from any real and direct input into the process. Existing 
legislation is totally ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the protection of species can only be effective 
if habitats are also protected, but it is the responsibility of 
the provinces to manage these issues in co-operation with the 
various stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the minister supports, theoretically, the shared 
responsibility between the federal government and the provinces 
with regard to the protection of species, in reality, first, he 
disregards the division of powers and the provinces' 
responsibility with regard to the management of habitats and the 
protection of species; second, he ignores existing legislation; 
and, third, he assumes very broad powers with regard to the 
protection of species.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By acting this way, the federal government is going against true 
environmental harmonization between the various levels of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say a few words about the position of environmental 
groups and industry. Most environmental groups are opposed to 
the bill proposed by the Minister of the Environment. Those who 
should be his allies in any attempt to improve the protection of 
wildlife species find this bill totally useless and even 
dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, there has been much protest and criticism since the 
minister introduced his bill. Most stakeholders find the bill 
too weak. 
Even organizations representing the industry feel that the bill 
will not provide greater protection for species or specify the 
appropriate approach to protecting species living on a site under 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association and 
of the Mining Association of Canada indicated that the government 
“could have taken a much stronger approach concerning federal 
land and natural areas, where constitutional jurisdiction is not 
challenged”. It must be noted that, in its present form, Bill 
C-33 is a bit scary for the representatives of certain 
industries, who believe that the compensation issues are 
insufficiently defined, as the representative of the Canadian 
Pulp and Paper Association said. As for the representative of the 
Mining Association of Canada, he said that the fines and legal 
proceedings were excessive in cases where a species was not 
deliberately killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the main problem that seems to be raised by all 
environmental groups is the fact that the decisions on the 
designation of species will be taken by the minister and his 
cabinet, and not by scientists. This has led many activists, such 
as the president of the Canadian Campaign for Endangered Species, 
to state that Bill C-33 was a “dismal failure” and that it will 
not ensure the protection of Canadian species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others, like one of the lawyers of the Sierra Club, made more 
qualified statements, but still denounced the weakness of the 
legislation and described as disgraceful the fact that such a 
discretionary power with respect to the designation of species be 
granted to politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is being criticized for resorting to a piecemeal 
approach dictated by cabinet, instead of a set of gentle 
measures promoting negotiation, but supported by compelling 
legal measures if an agreement cannot be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ignoring the issue of the division of responsibilities, 
environmentalists maintain that the federal government can and 
must get involved to legislate over all the lands, including 
provincial lands, to adequately protect migrating species. They 
add that only protecting the natural habitat of these species is 
not enough and that the whole critical habitat must be 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now outline the Government of Quebec's position on Bill 
C-33. 
As soon as the federal Minister of the Environment introduced 
his bill, his Quebec counterpart, Paul Bégin, said that the 
proposed legislation was just another example of useless 
duplication for Quebec. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1825"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the Quebec minister indicated that Bill C-33 introduced 
by the federal government sought not only to create a safety net 
for endangered species and their habitat on federal lands, but 
also on the whole Quebec territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned earlier, while it may be appropriate for the 
federal government to legislate to protect migrating species, 
but this government has no constitutional authority regarding 
the management of habitats on provincial lands. 
The Quebec government cannot accept that the federal government 
infringe upon areas of provincial jurisdiction and dictate to 
Quebec how to protect its ecosystems when Quebec already has its 
own legislation protecting endangered species and their habitats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bégin said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Quebec has always behaved in a responsible and appropriate 
manner regarding the protection of the most threatened fauna and 
flora species and intends to keep on exercising its authority in 
this matter. We will never accept an umbrella piece of 
legislation covering all the initiatives in this area. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was quoting from the press release regarding the federal 
legislation on wildlife species at risk in Canada released by the 
Quebec government on April 11, 2000 and which was issued by the 
office of the Minister of the Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government believes an act such as Bill C-33 would be 
acceptable if it excluded any species or habitat under provincial 
jurisdiction and applied to a province or territory only if this 
province or territory had explicitly asked that it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government would not need to resort to such a 
provision since it passed its own legislation on the issue in the 
1980s. Indeed, Quebec passed an act respecting threatened or 
vulnerable species in 1989, and it has its own act respecting the 
conservation and development of wildlife as well as fishery 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These three acts give Quebec the means to identify species at 
risk, designate them legally as threatened or vulnerable 
species, protect their habitat, and implement recovery plans to 
adequately protect endangered species and habitats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to state the position of the Bloc Quebecois. Since 
species are disappearing more rapidly, the problem is serious, 
and we must take effective action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But does Bill-33 really provide additional protection? Will this 
bill really improve the protection of ecosystems and of their 
endangered species? We think that the answer to these two 
questions is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
hon. member, but she will have 14 minutes to complete her 
remarks the next time the bill is called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 6.30 p.m. this House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
