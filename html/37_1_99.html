	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak once
					 again on behalf of Canadian farmers regarding the removal of 2% and 5%
					 strychnine which was very effective in controlling the tens of millions of
					 dollars of damage caused by gophers to farmers' crops and to livestock every
					 year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue was first brought to my attention almost
					 immediately after I was elected in 1993. At that time, the government was
					 moving toward the removal of this product and many farmers were concerned. Many
					 municipal politicians brought the issue to my attention. I wrote a letter to
					 the minister of agriculture regarding the issue at that time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My involvement in trying to get the 2% or 5%
					 concentrations of strychnine restored to farmers has been a long term one
					 indeed, spanning about 7 years now. I have had motions and bills and have done
					 what I have been able to do to force the issue. I would like to say that I have
					 perhaps had some success because at least this past summer there was an
					 emergency registration of this effective strength of strychnine in Alberta and
					 certain parts of Saskatchewan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously the issue has been pushed enough by municipal
					 politicians, reeves of counties, councillors, my colleagues from across the
					 prairies and farmers themselves to let government know they cannot afford these
					 losses. I would suggest that these tens of millions of dollars in losses a year
					 have been the final straw for some farmers and have led them to go out of
					 business. It has just been one thing too many that they have had to fight and
					 one loss too much. As a result, I have no doubt that some farmers have been
					 driven out of business and have lost their farms as a result of this order. It
					 is extremely serious.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote a letter to the minister of agriculture back in
					 1994 asking why the product, which was so effective in controlling Richardson's
					 ground squirrels, commonly referred to as gophers, had been taken away from
					 farmers. I told the minister it would cost a lot of money and would cause
					 serious damage. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later on I did get an answer to the letter but the
					 answer was not really substantial. Through the House, I then put a question on
					 the order paper for the production of papers and I did receive information on
					 the removal of the product. What astounded me was how little there was in these
					 papers. It was a stack of papers an inch thick but extremely few complaints
					 were made and yet the government decided to remove the product.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking logically that could not have been the reason
					 the government made the decision to follow through on the removal of the
					 product, I assumed there must have been studies done by the department which
					 led to this decision being made. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order I put on the order paper reads as
					 follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assumed that the complaints certainly would not have
					 sparked this so there must have been studies done. What we are debating today
					 are the studies that must have been done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did get an answer from the government and I was asked
					 to withdraw this motion. The answer reads as follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small> No studies were done on the effect
						  (economic impact) on Canadian farmers, of the withdrawal of the registration of
						  the concentrated strychnine solutions (2% and 5%) used by farmers to mix their
						  own 0.4% end-use products.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the parliamentary secretary will stand up
					 today and ask why we are debating this when there have been no
					 studies.</p>


	<A NAME="T1110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1110)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is it is incomprehensible that this
					 decision, which has done so much harm to Canadian farmers, would be made based
					 on extremely few complaints and without study. Why would a government do this?
					 I believe that there has to be more and that I have not got received all the
					 goods.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage the House to support the motion and I
					 encourage the government, in a very open way, to come up with the information
					 that actually led it to make this decision. The explanation is certainly not in
					 the papers I received.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will start with a letter I wrote in February 2000 to
					 the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, following other letters I wrote. My
					 letter said the banning of the concentration of strychnine effective enough to
					 kill gophers resulted in millions of dollars of losses for farmers who were
					 unable to control the gopher population.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked to be provided with the following information.
					 First, I asked for a clear comprehensive explanation as to why an effective
					 concentration of strychnine needed to be banned. As part of the explanation, I
					 asked to be provided with copies of documents and studies which were used as
					 scientific evidence that this effective concentration of strychnine needed to
					 be banned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I asked for studies that were done to show the
					 effect that the banning of an effective concentration of strychnine would have
					 on farmers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I asked who specifically was responsible for
					 making this decision to ban this strychnine because it was never clear from the
					 information I received.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, I asked how much money farmers had lost due to
					 crop losses, since the banning of an effective concentration of strychnine left
					 them unable to effectively control gopher populations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response to that was less than complete and did not
					 give an answer to the questions. I was left with information I received before
					 under a request for production of papers. Under the request, I a got a thick
					 stack of papers from the agriculture department that handled the request until
					 it was shifted to the health department. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go through a summary of what was in the stack of
					 documents that led to this decision, unless there is more. That is what I am
					 asking for from the government. I want it to tell me what more there is on its
					 decision to ban that effective tool for farmers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following complaints were found in the material.
					 There were complaints logged with Agriculture Canada by the Association for the
					 Protection of Fur-Bearing Animals. That consisted of five letters with the
					 names removed of course, to Agriculture Canada, and they concerned wolves.
					 There are no wolves in most areas in prairies where strychnine is used, so is a
					 little difficult to see the connection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were other letters from Sheila Burgess and Cindy
					 Hunter to Agriculture Canada, again mainly concerning the welfare of
					 wolves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the letters referred to the same magazine
					 article. In other words, it seemed that these letters were written mostly as a
					 result of this article which said that the strychnine used to control
					 Richardson's ground squirrels or gophers was killing the wolf population as
					 unintended targets. There were also concerns expressed that strychnine should
					 not be banned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the information in the stack of papers that
					 I received, that was what I got. The decision to ban strychnine was based on
					 that, unless the government was not forthcoming in the information it sent to
					 me. It is one or the other.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also concerns expressed that strychnine
					 should not be banned. It was not a lot, but this was done in about 1995 or
					 1994. It was quite early in the process. Letters from the reeve of the rural
					 municipality of Hamiota, the vice president of the eastern region of Able Pest
					 Control, that made the product, and my first letter of 1994 were included in
					 the documents. There was also a letter from the administrator of the rural
					 municipality of Shellbrook, Saskatchewan.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no complaints made to provincial
					 governments, at least there were no complaints which were included in this
					 material. Maybe there was some reason why the agriculture department did not
					 include complaints from provinces. I would not know what that would be. That is
					 what I received.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems the decision to remove this important tool,
					 which has caused farmers tens of millions of dollars in losses every year, was
					 based on that. I believe the tens of millions of dollars would be an extremely
					 low estimate of the damage done to farmers. I have a lot of reasons for
					 believing that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some farmers have taken the time, along with some
					 provincial government officials, to prepare an estimate based on examining
					 their particular pastures or their crops. They have looked at the damage done
					 and have put a dollar figure to it. The numbers for these individual farmers
					 were astounding, and I am talking about a lot of loss for particular farmers.
					 These farmers have been left without an effective tool to control gophers.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, a study looked at the effectiveness of
					 premixes of strychnine which were available still through municipalities or
					 through various retail outlets. That chart showed that these premixes were very
					 ineffective. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One study showed that only 11% of the gophers were
					 controlled through use of this premix product. Another showed that even with
					 three consecutive applications of this premix product, it only controlled about
					 50% of the gophers, leaving 50% to continue to do the damage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess people who have not been involved in this would
					 not understand all of the labour that goes into each application of strychnine
					 to control gophers. It is extremely labour intensive. To do one 60-acre pasture
					 could take a full day of heavy physical work. Many farmers have hundreds and
					 thousands of acres infected now because of the removal of this
					 product.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The damage is enormous. The reason for removing this
					 product is hard to understand. I am asking today for the government to provide
					 information that it has not provided because there must be more. I do not
					 believe that any governmental department would remove a product based on this
					 information. There has to be more. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to see from the government is the
					 production of all the information that led it to make that decision because it
					 is an important issue to farmers who have crop losses due to not having this
					 product. It is an important issue to cattlemen who have animals injured due to
					 gopher holes and the badgers digging in after them. Animals have suffered from
					 broken legs and that type of damage. Horses have had to be put down because
					 they have broken a leg in one of these badger or gopher holes. Also people have
					 sustained injuries because of this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this results from the removal of a product.
					 There just has to be more. I ask the House to support my motion. Most of all,
					 what I am really asking for is to have this product returned to farmers. All
					 the work I have done has been done for that reason. Let us bring this product
					 back so farmers have access. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had an emergency return of this product last summer.
					 Let us just deal with this, say yes, that we will return this to farmers so
					 they can deal with this serious gopher problem and that we will do it before
					 next summer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farmers have told me that they are more than willing to
					 take a half day course, if they have to, on how to use this product safely.
					 However, many do not understand why they would have to because they have used
					 it safely for decades with really very little evidence of any non-target
					 species being harmed.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I really want is the return of this 2% or 5%

					 Secretary to the Minister of Health, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Lakeland has
					 questioned why Canada's then regulatory body, Agriculture Canada, did not carry
					 out impact studies prior to its withdrawal of liquid strychnine concentrate
					 from the market in 1992.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is, no significant economic impact on farmers
					 was anticipated as a result of restricting access to liquid strychnine
					 concentrate products. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no impact study done at that time would have
					 uncovered any evidence that farmers' economic well-being would be adversely
					 affected. Farmers would continue to have the same level of pest control to
					 combat ground squirrels, commonly known as “gophers”, after the liquid
					 strychnine concentrate was withdrawn as they had when it was
					 available.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a reasonable assumption to make, because there
					 were similar, yet safer ready to use products available on the market, ones
					 that offered an equivalent or greater amount of strychnine compared to bait
					 prepared from liquid concentrate products.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only several years after the discontinuation of
					 liquid strychnine concentrate that evidence began to emerge that there were
					 problems involving the effectiveness of the ready to use baits.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in 1992 it was reasonable for the government
					 to expect that the withdrawal of liquid strychnine concentrate would not pose
					 an economic hardship on farmers, beyond some slightly increased costs to
					 strychnine users who previously had used their own grain for bait formulation.
					 It was also reasonable, and in keeping with its responsibility for safeguarding
					 the health and safety of Canadians, and their environment, for the government
					 to take action on liquid strychnine concentrate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strychnine is, after all, a highly toxic product that
					 has been associated with poisonings of non-target species, including pets,
					 wildlife and possibly humans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's expectation that the discontinuation
					 of liquid strychnine was a reasonable and prudent step was based on the
					 Department of Agriculture's two years of consultation, through the Western
					 Forum and the then Canadian Association of Pesticide Control Officials, with
					 agriculture and wildlife control officials in Alberta, British Columbia,
					 Manitoba and Saskatchewan. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During that consultation period, no serious economic
					 effect on the farm economy of the west was foreseen as a result of the
					 disappearance of liquid strychnine concentrate; if there had been, then an
					 economic impact study would undoubtedly have been done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was explained to the hon. member for Lakeland and
					 this House during the debate on Motion No. 13 held on September 19, it has been
					 verified through analysis that the concentration of strychnine found in today's
					 ready to use products is very similar or actually greater than that found
					 previously in baits prepared on the farm by mixing the liquid strychnine
					 concentrate with farm available grain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the strychnine present in the ready to use bait
					 has been clearly shown to be of a concentration adequate for the control of
					 gophers, it was suggested that other factors, such as baiting procedures,
					 environmental conditions affecting the bait itself and lack of palatability
					 might be responsible for poor performance of the ready to use strychnine
					 baits.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To investigate these factors, the PMRA in 2000 and 2001
					 granted research permits to Alberta Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, or
					 AAFRD, to assess the efficacy of various baits against gophers. These baits
					 included those made from 2% strychnine concentrate, the standard ready to use
					 bait made with oats, and bait made from more palatable substances such as
					 canary seed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bait freshness and the type of bait seem to be
					 important considerations in achieving good bait uptake and successful gopher
					 control. Plans for a definitive comparison study to settle the question of
					 whether a freshly mixed canary seed bait would be the most effective bait are
					 currently being discussed with the provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the gopher problems in some parts of Alberta and
					 Saskatchewan became so serious this past summer that the provincial governments
					 requested emergency registrations to allow them to use the liquid strychnine
					 concentrate, the PMRA granted these registrations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindful of the risks associated with liquid strychnine
					 concentrate, the registrations were for one season only, and the availability
					 and use of the concentrate was highly restricted. An access program was put in
					 place that allowed only agricultural fieldmen, in Alberta, or pest control
					 officers, in Saskatchewan, to sell and distribute the liquid strychnine
					 concentrate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 16, the PMRA will meet with Alberta and
					 Saskatchewan pesticide regulatory officials to review the further results of
					 research and to assess the program that allowed restricted access to the
					 strychnine concentrate during this summer's emergency registrations of
					 strychnine.</p>


	<A NAME="T1125"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1125)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officials will discuss whether the access program
					 worked, whether it provided reasonable availability, while mitigating any
					 possible adverse effects of using liquid strychnine concentrate. Another topic
					 to be discussed at this meeting will be the use of currently registered
					 alternative products to strychnine.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the government has taken a justifiably
					 cautious approach to making the liquid concentrate of strychnine available,
					 given the nature of this poison. Strychnine has a very high acute toxicity. It
					 acts quickly on the central nervous system,often causing violent convulsions
					 which eventually lead to death through respiratory failure. And there is no
					 effective antidote for this poison.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is not alone in having taken action on
					 strychnine. All above ground uses of strychnine have been prohibited in the
					 United States since 1988. It is illegal to use strychnine for pest control in
					 most European countries and its use is prohibited by the Berne convention on
					 the conservation of European wildlife and natural habitats.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I would like to refer to a concern that
					 several members raised in their speeches during the September 19 debate on
					 Motion No. 13. They wondered why a product that utilizes ammonia to control
					 gophers cannot be made available to farmers as quickly as possible as an
					 alternative product to strychnine. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may be interested to know that a pre-submission
					 consultation has taken place between the PMRA and the potential applicants in
					 order to help the applicants submit a complete and correct application to
					 register their product. As a next step, the agency is now considering exactly
					 what type and how much information will have to be generated in order to
					 support the registration of a pest control product based on ammonia. Although
					 ammonia is a widely used commodity already registered under the Fertilizers
					 Act, the PMRA must, under the Pest Control Products Act, ensure that a product
					 presents no unacceptable risk to health or the environment before it can be
					 registered for use as a pest control product in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want the hon. member from Lakeland to be assured that
					 the Canadian government has acted in consultation with affected provinces and
					 stakeholders in the matter of restricting the availability of liquid strychnine
					 concentrate for use in the formulation of strychnine baits on farms. With their
					 co-operation it has moved to protect the health and safety of Canadians and
					 their environment, and is equally committed to finding the means to help
					 resolve the problem of gopher infestations in our western farmers'
					 fields.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address request P-3 for
					 the tabling of documents, submitted by the Canadian Alliance member for
					 Lakeland, which reads as follows: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That an Order of the House do issue
						  for copies of all studies that were done prior to the banning of the 2% and 5%

						  would have on Canadian farmers.</small></td>

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us first look at the background for this issue.
					 Strychnine is a pesticide that helps, among things, control gophers that attack
					 crops in western Canada. It seems that the product used by farmers is effective
					 provided it contains 2% to 5% of strychnine. However, this product is also
					 criticized because of its harmful effects on water, air and soil. Moreover, it
					 is said to also threaten the health of animals that are not pests and of human
					 beings. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1992, the federal government restricted, through
					 regulations, the use of liquid strychnine by Canadian farmers. Now, they can
					 only use a concentrated premixed liquid version of the product that contains a
					 maximum of 0.4% of strychnine. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance member for Lakeland is very
					 interested in this issue. He tabled Motion No. 13, which was debated in the
					 House for one hour. That motion asked the government to compensate farmers for
					 damage done to livestock and crops by gophers resulting from the banning of
					 effective concentration of strychnine, thereby removing the ability of farmers
					 to control gophers on their lands.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 28, 2001, he tabled Bill C-321, an act to
					 amend the Farm Income Protection Act (crop damage by gophers). I am taking this
					 opportunity to say that the French translation should be revised. While we
					 could write the term “gaufre” with the letters “ph” instead of an “f”, it would
					 be best to choose a more appropriate term. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the English term “gopher” was translated in
					 French by “gaufre”, which is “a crisp pancake cooked between two hinged metal
					 pans with a grid pattern” and which is often eaten with maple syrup but, I
					 might add, without strychnine. We are a long way from the ground squirrels
					 called gophers, which are rodents causing the same damage as our groundhogs in
					 Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, our colleague, the hon. member for Lakeland,
					 is asking that certain studies that the federal government has in its
					 possession be made public. These studies, which were done prior to the
					 strychnine ban, could reveal that the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food
					 banned this pesticide knowing the devastating effect that such a measure would
					 have on western farmers' crops, yet took no steps to compensate
					 them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois therefore supports this request for
					 documents. The government that has been running this country since 1993 suffers
					 from acute secrecy syndrome. And the debate over this request is an opportunity
					 for me to highlight the federal Liberal government's chronic lack of
					 transparency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day, democracies are tempted to take the secret
					 way out. These democracies, which are accused of being slow, view secrets as an
					 easy way to speed things up, as a sort of pragmatic art, which cuts short
					 futile discussions. The temptation is understandable. What is less
					 understandable is that so many democrats fall victim to it, because democracy
					 loses its meaning the moment it loses its transparency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government, which promised during the 1993
					 election campaign to be transparent in managing the affairs of the state,
					 probably has the worst dirty habit of hiding things in the entire political
					 history of this country. These are a few examples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like it if the hon. member for Joliette could
					 tell us himself how many times he had to rise in the House to ask the
					 government to make public the FTAA texts. It took us a long time to get
					 them.</p>


	<A NAME="T1130"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1130)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the multilateral agreement on investment, the MAI,
					 was involved, once again no documents were forthcoming. It took a leak via the
					 Internet, originating with the government of France and certain individuals
					 with a strong interest in the matter, before we could finally get our hands on
					 a document, and it was absolutely abominable. Negotiation of this agreement had
					 to be abandoned. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Canada-Costa Rica free trade agreement,
					 which we have just experienced, that most recent agreement, namely Bill C-32,
					 we were again asked to pass it without seeing the texts. We are presented with
					 them, but once again we are confronted with a fait accompli. Once again, we are
					 being asked for a blank cheque. We were not consulted at all on the discussions
					 relating to the agreement. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going back a little in time, hon. members will recall
					 the sad story of the contaminated blood. After creating a commission of inquiry
					 into contaminated blood, the federal government did its utmost to stop the
					 commission from unearthing the full story and naming names. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us also recall the Minister of Finance's budget
					 surplus. Once again, there was a whole set of secrets that had been
					 systematically concealed since the government found the path to a balanced
					 budget. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us recall the secrecy surrounding the location of
					 transgenic crops in Canada. Ottawa refuses to reveal the location in one or
					 more provinces where there are experimental GM wheat crops. The Canadian Wheat
					 Board has attempted to obtain a list of these from the Canada Food Inspection
					 Agency, but to no avail.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us recall the Access to Information Act, which is
					 nothing more than a toothless watchdog. This act, which is supposed to
					 guarantee access to any document of public interest is as full of holes as
					 Swiss cheese, and totally ineffectual against the Liberal government's
					 propensity toward secrecy. This is why there are complaints from both
					 journalists and MPs, both in opposition and in government. Even the information
					 commissioner is very concerned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal member for
					 Ancaster--Dundas--Flamborough--Aldershot decided he had had enough of the way
					 the present government was treating the Access to Information Act. He feels it
					 is far too easy for the government and departmental officials to conceal
					 information of a public nature. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the bad example comes from the top. In his annual
					 report published in March 2001, Information Commissioner John Reid said that he
					 himself no longer had access to certain documents considered secret. According
					 to the report, the Prime Minister and his closest advisers and ministers keep
					 on ignoring the Access to Information Act. Worse still, the member for
					 Saint-Maurice will not allow the commissioner to see his agendas and has gone
					 all the way to the supreme court to prevent Mr. Reid from doing so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sort of attitude at the top encourages the entire
					 bureaucracy throughout the country to make the commissioner's life difficult by
					 putting up fierce resistance to requests, said the same report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister fell back on this “secret way out”
					 when he refused to testify regarding the demonstration staged in Vancouver for
					 the arrival of the president of Indonesia, thus putting a lid on an essential
					 element of the investigation--whether or not the order to the police to use
					 force came from his office. Doubt breeds mistrust, and all politicians are
					 paying the cost of this lack of transparency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois finds it unacceptable that the
					 government is behaving in this way, when it had promised the public
					 transparency. The member for Lakeland is calling for the release of documents
					 which would, to a certain degree, compromise the previous government, because
					 the decision was taken in 1992. It would not cost much to release the
					 documents, but it would fulfill one of the 1993 election promises regarding
					 transparency.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise again to speak to the issue of
					 Richardson's ground squirrels, commonly referred to as gophers in the farming
					 communities of Brandon and Souris in southwestern Manitoba</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke to this issue shortly after it was put on the
					 floor as Motion No. 13 under private members' business. At that time I
					 suggested and received agreement from most members on this side of the House
					 that all private members' business should be votable. Had Motion No. 13 been
					 made votable it would probably not have precipitated the issue returning to the
					 House in this form.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the member for Lakeland for bringing it
					 forward under Standing Order 97 as a motion for the production of papers. It is
					 an issue that he obviously sees as being very important, not only in his
					 constituency but particularly in Canadian agriculture. It is a way to bring
					 forward the issue again to hold the government accountable and to have a vote
					 on a particular motion for the production of papers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member has indicated the government has
					 demonstrated that there are no studies and papers to be tabled and therefore
					 the member should withdraw his motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it interesting that a decision of this magnitude
					 could be made when hundreds of scientists involved in these types of decisions
					 with the federal government have not put forward any justification for making
					 this change. I have the order that was put into place on December 22, 1992.
					 There are some backgrounders that indicate why the change was necessary. It
					 went from a 5% strychnine solution down to a 0.4% solution, which has been
					 proven to be terribly ineffective if not useless.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the order, but I am sure there had to be in
					 some way, shape or form a justification of why this order was put forward. That
					 is all the member is asking for. He is asking the government under production
					 of papers to give us the studies that were put forward and used as background
					 information to make this final decision. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that difficult as was mentioned by the member
					 from the Bloc. It seems we have grave difficulty in trying to get information
					 out of the government on this side of the House. I do not understand why the
					 government is afraid to give this information out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very simple matter. It is not that difficult.
					 Let us see the backgrounder and the reasons justifying why that decision was
					 made. Let us vote for the motion for the production of papers and let us see
					 the studies. If in fact the studies support the final decision, the member
					 would be the first to stand in his place and accept that. However, how can we
					 accept that when we do not have any understanding of the decision making
					 process of government scientists?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to information is a tool that we use. I use the
					 analogy between access to information and the motion for the production of
					 papers before us. We depend on access to information to generate information
					 from the government. When we get information it is censored to the point where
					 it is useless. A government must be open and transparent to generate the
					 confidence of the people which it governs. I find that the accountability and
					 transparency of the government are becoming eroded day after day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a suggestion for the government. This is not a
					 matter of politics but a matter of understanding why decisions are made. The
					 government should be more forthcoming with information, and this is a prime
					 example. Everybody should stand in their places when the vote is called and
					 make sure this motion for the production of papers is voted on favourably, so
					 the government will come forward with the necessary documents.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the member for bringing the motion forward. The

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming from western Canada, I do not think anybody can
					 understand the real issue with respect to a gopher population that is out of
					 control. It seems to propagate the Richardson's ground squirrel or gopher
					 population in areas where we have had drought this year. Farmers are looking
					 for an alternative method to control this terrible rodent infestation.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of those methods is and always has been a 5%
					 strychnine solution. Unfortunately that is not available to farmers right now.
					 Until we come up with something more environmentally friendly and more
					 effective in controlling the pest itself, we have to look at other
					 alternatives. That is why the member has been very vocal in his support of this
					 issue. I thank the member once again for bringing it forward. </p>

					 (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I support my colleague from Lakeland in
					 his request for information on the studies of strychnine that led to the ban of
					 the 2% and the 5% varieties of strychnine poison used against the Richardson's
					 ground squirrel or gopher.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent the weekend in Ottawa and in my area of the
					 city I noticed a tremendous number of squirrels. The little fellows were
					 gathering nuts and burying them. I did not get that close to them, but I want
					 to compare them to Richardson's ground squirrels or gophers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulips were planted this weekend on Parliament Hill. If
					 each one of those little Richardson's ground squirrels ate a tulip it would be
					 a problem in the city of Ottawa. If we look at one pasture in Saskatchewan or
					 Alberta gopher holes are as close as the tulips that were being planted.
					 Members should imagine the kind of devastation that is created for a farmer,
					 rancher or whoever owns a property where gopher holes are as close to each
					 other as those tulips.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member talked about badgers. Badgers move in
					 and create huge holes that cause extra problems because wildlife falls in them.
					 There are fawns, antelope, horses and cattle with broken legs. This creates
					 economic problems for the farmer or rancher.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Lakeland is only asking for
					 information from the government proving that studies were done before
					 strychnine was removed. All that we have received are seven letters. The
					 government removed a product from the market, which is causing great hardship
					 to Alberta and Saskatchewan farmers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada and the provinces compensate
					 agriculturalists if they have waterfall damage or if deer and elk cause
					 problems on their farms. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerns have been raised regarding the impact on other
					 wildlife and the use of strychnine. A fox, wolf or coyote would have to consume
					 40 to 50 gophers or poisoned animals at one time to be affected. There are also
					 concerns for birds picking at the gophers. They would have to consume
					 approximately 5 to 15 animals. Any of the birds at home could not consume one
					 gopher let alone 5 to 15 of them to be affected. I have concerns about that.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want the studies and the information. The hon.
					 member for Lakeland wants to know what kind of studies were carried out by the
					 government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Richardson's ground squirrel has become an epidemic
					 on the prairies. The gopher or the Richardson's ground squirrel is very well
					 known. The mascots of the Saskatchewan Roughriders are gophers. Gainer and
					 Leonard are the most popular thing on the field in Saskatchewan right now
					 because our football team is having a hard time, but we love the gophers.
					 Gainer and Leonard can be pests at football games because they tend to sneak up
					 behind people and scare them, and they make a lot of noise when we score a
					 touchdown. However the real pests are a great concern to Saskatchewan farmers.
					 </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. parliamentary secretary to the Minister of
					 Health said that there are products on the market to control these pests. There
					 are no products at all on the market to control the Richardson's ground
					 squirrel, therefore we are asking for help. There is no proof that non-targeted
					 animals have died because of the use of strychnine. The information from the
					 hon. member for Lakeland showed that the animals that lost their lives were
					 targeted by criminal activity. If there is scientific, absolute proof, we would
					 like the government to release those findings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We looked at the economic problems that a gopher can
					 cause. We said that 123 gophers, and this has been studied, can consume up to a
					 tonne of feed, which translates into damages of $15,000 to $16,000 per quarter
					 of land. Total losses to farmers are reaching into tens of millions of dollars
					 in Alberta and Saskatchewan. It is a huge problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In studies that were done by the Alberta Cattle
					 Commission, and this was another thing that the hon. secretary brought up, in
					 regard to the use of strychnine, the commission used test markets and the
					 values that they were supposed to use. There were eight tests. In one test, it
					 was as low as 11% effective. That is what they were doing in Alberta. For the
					 highest number ranchers had to do three applications of the strychnine mixture
					 and the result was 75%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine planting those tulip bulbs on a quarter section
					 of land or 160 acres or tens of thousands of acres like a lot of our ranchers
					 have and going into a field with a little bucket of strychnine and oats and
					 dropping it down a gopher hole over and over. I should have counted how many
					 people were planting tulips out in front of the building this weekend. Imagine
					 one farmer or his family out covering let us say 10,000 acres with a bucket of
					 oats. It just does not work. We are not getting effective and real progress
					 from the government in getting help for western Canadian agriculturalists.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are asking for information, and that is what the
					 hon. member for Lakeland is asking for. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farmers in Unity, Saskatchewan, have created a
					 gophinator which will look after the gopher problem. It uses anhydrous ammonia,
					 which farmers apply right across Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan every
					 spring. It is a fertilizer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I went out with my cultivator in the spring and
					 cultivated my pastures with an anhydrous tank behind my cultivator I could get
					 rid of the gophers, but who wants to cultivate pastures? One just does not do
					 that. It is not natural. If the gophinator could be patented and used properly,
					 that would be done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just asking for the people in the House to approve
					 the hon. member for Lakeland's application for information. That is all we are
					 asking for. On behalf of farmers and ranchers in Alberta and Saskatchewan, I
					 ask that the House do that.</p>

					 my riding and we have had quite a number of people address it. Like all
					 problems, though, attention is required if we are to see any
					 solution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last session of parliament I was privileged
					 to lay upon the Table petitions from my constituents and from a number of
					 others in Saskatchewan. There were approximately 300 signatures on the one I
					 had. According to an article in the <i>National Post</i>, farmers sent Ottawa a
					 petition of 5,000 signatures in total asking that they be allowed to use
					 concentrated liquid strychnine to battle an annual gopher infestation. The
					 animals have been causing trouble on Saskatchewan farmlands in growing numbers
					 since 1992 when Ottawa restricted the sale of the poison.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an interesting quote from the article. “The
					 poisons being purchased are just not effective”, says Sinclair Harrison, a
					 Saskatchewan farmer. “It makes the gophers sick but it does not kill them. We
					 don't want to see anything suffer”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is Sinclair Harrison a farmer, he also happens

				  </b>

	The hon. agriculture minister made that statement. He
					 is also on record as saying that he has no evidence of this affecting the
					 Canadian economy because of the restrictions on strychnine. This is highly
					 debatable, as we are finding out today, because it has a great impact on our
					 Saskatchewan farmers. That is evident.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course strychnine poison is perhaps not the only
					 solution. The gophinator has been mentioned and I was interested to hear that
					 the hon. member across the way mentioned that they had to test to see if there
					 would be harmful effects from injecting anhydrous ammonia into the soil. It is
					 interesting to me that we can inject anhydrous ammonia into the soil to raise
					 our food, but when it comes to using it for pest control we have to make sure
					 it is okay. I do not get the logic. I do not really understand it but I guess
					 that is the way some people think.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some other chemicals or drugs that would kill
					 gophers, such as anticoagulants. They may be effective if repeated doses are
					 applied in a certain minimal length of time, that is, within two or three days.
					 Perhaps that would be better, but as my hon. colleague has pointed out who
					 wants to go back to all those holes over and over to make the necessary
					 applications? If we examine the evidence I believe we will discover that
					 strychnine is in fact the only truly effective way to control these
					 pests.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each province has regulations for the use of
					 strychnine. We seem to be so worried about where it is going and what it may do
					 but these regulations are already in place. In Saskatchewan the sale of
					 strychnine is restricted to pest control operators, farmers or persons
					 authorized in government approved pest control programs. Only those people are
					 able to get it at all. They are held accountable and responsible. It seems to
					 me that there is a lot more accountability and responsibility placed upon the
					 people who would use strychnine for gopher poisoning than there is upon people
					 who use a lot of other things that are a lot more dangerous for the general
					 population of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vendor of these products maintains a record of
					 sales and has the name, address and signature of the buyer along with the
					 quantity purchased. Detailed records are kept by the Saskatchewan Association
					 of Rural Municipalities, of which Sinclair Harrison, as I mentioned, is the
					 president. In Saskatchewan alone there are around 250 pest control officers,
					 one pest control officer for nearly each of the 297 rural municipalities, and
					 they are quite well trained in the use of strychnine.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one of the problems with the strychnine
					 poisoning method is that to be most effective it must be used at a certain time
					 of the year, pretty well no later than mid-March. As cute as these little
					 gophers are, they do not all come up out of the ground at one time. The first
					 ones up are the males. They stick their heads up, look around and see what is
					 on the horizon for the new spring. They come up one to two weeks ahead of the
					 females. The females begin to awake from hibernation and stick their heads up
					 and poke around. When the level of female gophers is high enough, that is when
					 the chemical needs to be put down. It needs to be put down early in the year,
					 before we have hundreds more little gophers later on. There can be five to ten
					 gophers in a litter. For effective control, it must be done at a certain
					 time.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are having trouble at the municipal level in getting
					 the supplies on time. There needs to be a distribution system that would get
					 them there on time. This would include strict control methods as to how they
					 are stored, proper training for those who use them and those kinds of things.
					 These things need to be done. There is no reason we cannot be prepared and have
					 that ready.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government needs to have some sort of assigned
					 mechanism in place and enter into talks with the municipal governments on how
					 these kinds of things can be put in place and controlled. The government needs
					 to talk to cattle organizations and various farm organizations to reflect their
					 concerns and implement appropriate measures to control the increasing costs
					 gophers are afflicting on our farm economy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no direct pipeline held season after season to
					 handle these kinds of things. Nonetheless these are problems that can easily be
					 addressed. They need to be if that is the only way we have of controlling the
					 gopher population. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems the government would want to know what the
					 effects of the restriction on strychnine are. We are asking that this
					 information be put out. If we need to find other solutions then the government
					 should know that. This is a drastically increasing problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague mentioned gophers popping out and
					 taking down all the tulip bulbs. I was here a few days ago when we had the
					 memorial service for the police officers and firemen who lost their lives. I
					 was wondering what would happen if the front lawn contained the population of
					 gophers required to get all those tulip bulbs. Let us think of all the holes.
					 How many of those firemen and policemen would have been injured, like our
					 cattle are, by falling into the holes as they marched through the parade
					 grounds blowing their bagpipes?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this issue is of grave concern to western

					 they are paid for it. If they lose their crop because of water fowl they are
					 paid for it. This year on the prairies more crops were lost to gophers than any

	moved that Bill C-37,
					 an act to facilitate the implementation of those provisions of first nations
					 claim settlements in the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan that relate to
					 the creation of reserves or the addition of land to existing reserves, and to
					 make related amendments to the Manitoba Claim Settlements Implementation Act
					 and the Saskatchewan Treaty Land Entitlement Act, be read the second
					 time and referred to a committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the House on
					 Bill C-37, the claim settlements (Alberta and Saskatchewan) implementation act.
					 I welcome the opportunity to inform hon. members about the intent of Bill C-37
					 and explain how it fits into the government's broader aboriginal
					 agenda.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that the recent Speech from the
					 Throne committed the government to strengthening Canada's relationship with
					 aboriginal people, supporting aboriginal governance and bringing the benefits
					 of prosperity to aboriginal communities. We are also implementing the pledges
					 made in “Gathering Strength--Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan”, Canada's
					 response to the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal
					 Peoples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-37 is another important step in these ongoing
					 processes, one of many we will take in collaboration with aboriginal people and
					 other stakeholders in the coming months and years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed legislation addresses a number of goals
					 set out by the government including, most fundamentally, fulfilling our
					 historical obligations to aboriginal peoples to live up to the promises that
					 have been made not only by our government but by others before us going back
					 200 years or more.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-37 is about strengthening the capacity of first
					 nations governments to make decisions about their lands and communities. It
					 would give them additional tools to pursue economic development opportunities
					 that would generate jobs and income for first nations people. In this way Bill
					 C-37 would protect and enhance the rights of other parties and lead to
					 partnerships between first nations communities and private sector interests
					 throughout the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the proposed legislation is somewhat technical
					 in nature, its objective is simple: to facilitate the transfer of lands to
					 reserve status in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Our goal is to improve existing
					 processes which lead to uncertainty and missed opportunities for all parties
					 and which can be unnecessarily time consuming and cumbersome.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. members will be familiar with the rationale for
					 the legislation from the debate respecting part 2 of the Manitoba Claim
					 Settlements Implementation Act which was passed by the previous parliament.
					 Bill C-37 would essentially extend the Manitoba process to the other two
					 prairie provinces. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put the issue into perspective, hon. members should
					 be aware that the Government of Canada has numerous outstanding commitments to
					 provide additional reserve lands to first nations in Alberta and Saskatchewan.
					 These commitments have arisen out of two types of settlement agreements. Treaty
					 land entitlement settlements are intended to address historical injustices
					 involving more than 30 first nations in Alberta and Saskatchewan that did not
					 receive all the land they were promised when they signed treaties. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has also made commitments to expand reserve
					 lands as part of 13 specific claim settlements in Alberta and Saskatchewan,
					 most of which deal with alleged wrongs over the administration of first nations
					 lands or assets under the Indian Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has been working to implement these
					 settlement agreements for the past several years. We are making progress but it
					 is clear to everyone involved that we need quicker and better ways to add lands
					 to reserves. A million hectares, or 2.5 million acres, are yet to be added to
					 reserves as a result of claim settlements in Alberta and Saskatchewan. More
					 reserve expansion commitments are on the horizon as we continue to negotiate
					 treaty land entitlements and specific claims in both provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two principal reasons for the current backlog
					 in reserve expansion commitments. First, in all provinces but Manitoba, thanks
					 to the Manitoba Claim Settlements Implementation Act, creating reserve land
					 under claim settlements requires an order from the governor in council. First
					 nations have suggested that the process be streamlined. We agree with this
					 objective. </p>


	<A NAME="T1210"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1210"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1205"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1210)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More significant, however, is the need to accommodate
					 existing third party interests when processing land selections. Canada's
					 additions to reserve policy require that any such interests be either bought
					 out with the agreement of the third party or somehow accommodated in a manner
					 acceptable to Canada, the third party and the first nation. Only then could the
					 land be transferred to Canada and granted reserve status.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-37 addresses both these issues as the Manitoba
					 Claim Settlements Implication Act has done in Manitoba. First, Bill C-37 would
					 empower the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development rather than the
					 governor in council to grant reserve status to lands selected by Alberta and
					 Saskatchewan first nations under claim settlements. This would replace the
					 current process of obtaining an order in council and would shorten the time
					 needed to approve additions to reserves. This would in turn allow any economic
					 benefits associated with the lands to be more immediately realized by first
					 nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, and more important, Bill C-37 would streamline
					 the way third party interests such as leases or mineral rights are dealt with
					 in lands selected for additions to reserves under claim settlements.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes proposed in Bill C-37 would essentially
					 allow first nations in Alberta and Saskatchewan to agree to continue an
					 existing third party interest or negotiate a new one on such lands before the
					 lands became part of a reserve or were purchased. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not possible under the Indian Act. Although the
					 Saskatchewan Treaty Land Entitlement Act provides a pre-reserve interest
					 granting power by way of what is called a designation, under that power first
					 nations can only agree to continue existing interests. They cannot accommodate
					 new development proposals that may arise while the land is being processed into
					 reserve status. Moreover, this power can be used only in relation to treaty
					 land entitlements and not to specific claims. It can be used only when the
					 first nation has already purchased the land. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pre-reserve designation power contained in Bill
					 C-37 does not, I repeat, does not, have these limitations. The improved
					 pre-reserve designation power could be used for all Alberta and Saskatchewan
					 claim settlements and not just treaty land entitlements. It would give first
					 nations access to a broader range of land that has development interests or
					 potential. Because these lands could be selected and acquired more quickly, any
					 third party interest associated with them would contribute more quickly to
					 economic and social progress in the community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes would obviously benefit first nations.
					 However I would ask hon. members to consider the issue from the other side of
					 the fence, so to speak. The new approaches set out in Bill C-37 would provide a
					 higher level of commercial certainty for all concerned parties, not only first
					 nations but private sector developers, land owners and people, companies or
					 institutions that hold interests in land in Alberta and
					 Saskatchewan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-37 would enhance protection for third parties by
					 bridging the gap between non-reserve and reserve status for lands, thereby
					 avoiding potential interruption of access to or use of the lands. In other
					 words, the proposed legislation would provide businesses and investors in
					 Alberta and Saskatchewan with certainty of tenure for any third party interest
					 they might hold in lands to be added to a reserve.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-37 would also provide the certainty, stability
					 and predictability first nations and businesses needed to negotiate new
					 commercial arrangements and economic development partnerships. This is clearly
					 a win-win solution to the legal uncertainties and delays inherent in the
					 current process for adding lands to reserves.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new mechanisms to deal with third party interests
					 and the ministerial authority to grant reserve status are the major thrust of
					 the proposed legislation but I would like to bring a couple of additional
					 points to the attention of the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is that individual first nations will
					 be able to elect whether or not to adopt the provisions of Bill C-37 in
					 relation to their claim settlements. For existing settlement agreements, all
					 that will be required is a simple resolution by the first nation council to opt
					 into the new processes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Settlements negotiated after the legislation comes into
					 effect will need to state explicitly that the first nation wishes to adopt the
					 provisions of Bill C-37.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, it is important to note that this opt-in
					 provision will apply only on a settlement by settlement basis. In other words,
					 any first nation that has both a specific claim settlement and a treaty land
					 entitlement settlement must make a separate election for each settlement
					 agreement and is free to make a different election in each case. In this way
					 maximum freedom of choice is afforded to individual first nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I noted earlier, Bill C-37 is modelled on the
					 recently enacted Manitoba Claim Settlement Implementation Act. During the
					 process of developing the current legislation, we saw an opportunity to bring
					 needed minor improvements to the language of the previous bill. Bill C-37
					 therefore proposes to amend the Manitoba Claim Settlement Implementation Act to
					 make these language improvements so that the two bills remain consistent with
					 each other.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments are minor in nature, either
					 removing a grammatical ambiguity or bringing precision to the post-reserve
					 administrative regime that would apply to third party interests.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments have the support of the aboriginal
					 association representing Manitoba first nations most effected, namely the
					 treaty land entitlement committee of Manitoba which represents the 20 first
					 nations that are party to the 1997 treaty land entitlement framework agreement
					 for that province.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Bill C-37 proposes related amendments to the
					 Saskatchewan Treaty Land Entitlement Act of 1993. One amendment would ensure
					 that any agreement, past or future, to release the province of Saskatchewan
					 from its obligation to provide unoccupied crown land as part of a treaty land
					 entitlement settlement is expressly confirmed by the Saskatchewan Treaty Land
					 Entitlement Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. members may know, this obligation dates to the
					 natural resources transfer agreement negotiated between Canada and Saskatchewan
					 in 1930. Saskatchewan was released from this obligation respecting certain
					 first nations in 1992 under the terms of the Saskatchewan treaty land
					 entitlement framework agreement and the Nekaneet treaty land entitlement
					 agreement, and this release was recognized in the 1993 Saskatchewan Treaty Land
					 Entitlement Act. We are simply extending this legislative confirmation to any
					 similar releases, whether given before or after the coming into force of this
					 act, which are concluded as a result of post-1993 treaty land entitlement
					 settlements in Saskatchewan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-37 would also amend the Saskatchewan Treaty Land
					 Entitlement Act as it relates to the pre-reserve designation power I mentioned
					 earlier. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have noted, Bill C-37 would provide a similar but
					 improved mechanism for granting a third party interest in land before the land
					 has been set apart as a reserve.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to the Saskatchewan Treaty Land
					 Entitlement Act would establish clear rules for determining which mechanism
					 will apply depending on the first nations' opt-in decision I alluded to
					 earlier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make it clear that Bill C-37 would not give
					 effect to any claim settlement in Alberta or Saskatchewan. Nor does Bill C-37
					 create new institutions of government, new regulations or new financial
					 obligations for Canada.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal here is simply to ensure that claims
					 agreements, including those that may be negotiated in the future, can be
					 implemented more quickly and efficiently.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing contentious about this proposed
					 legislation. In fact it was developed in close consultation with the affected
					 stakeholders. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlying principles for the bill were first
					 discussed with first nations in Alberta in 1997 when Canada was negotiating
					 treaty land entitlement agreements with the Alexander First Nation and the Loon
					 River Cree First Nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that Bill C-37 has since
					 specifically been endorsed by both of these Alberta first nations whose treaty
					 land entitlement settlements included commitments by Canada to recommend such
					 legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the level of support for the proposed approach in
					 Alberta, our government seized the opportunity to make the same mechanisms
					 available to first nations in Saskatchewan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that end, we initiated discussions with the
					 Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations and the government of Saskatchewan in
					 December 1999, and again we received a very positive response. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To broaden the consultation process, a draft of the
					 proposed legislation was distributed in February 2000 to all Alberta and
					 Saskatchewan first nations which currently have claim settlements with reserve
					 expansion commitments to implement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governments of both provinces as well as Alberta
					 treaty organizations and the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations also
					 received this draft. An updated version was sent out in April of this year to
					 all these same stakeholders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some minor improvements have been made to Bill C-37
					 based on feedback received from these stakeholders. I am pleased to say that
					 the proposed legislation now has the full support of all parties from the
					 provincial governments of Alberta and Saskatchewan to first nations and their
					 treaty organizations in both provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I noted earlier, the minor amendments to the
					 Manitoba Claims Settlement Implementation Act are also supported by treaty land
					 entitlement first nations in that province. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between them, the Manitoba Claims Settlement
					 Implementation Act and Bill C-37, will cover fully 97% of existing reserve
					 expansion commitments under claim settlements across Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are proceeding with the legislation in Alberta and
					 Saskatchewan for the same reason we went forward in Manitoba: we know a better
					 process is needed and there is strong consensus among stakeholders in these two
					 provinces that this approach is reasonable, responsible and
					 effective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-37 would benefit first nations in Alberta and
					 Saskatchewan and would benefit third parties that hold interest in land
					 selected for additions to reserves under claim settlements in these two
					 provinces. It would also move Canada forward in fulfilling our outstanding
					 commitments to aboriginal people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the right solution for everyone and I trust we
					 can count on the support of hon. members from all sides of the House in voting
					 to send the legislation to committee for review.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to hear the minister
					 announce the bill. I wish we would have had a little time to take a look at it.
					 It was introduced last week and now it is Monday and it is here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is incumbent upon the minister to make sure
					 people understand the different terminology in the bill. I come from a rural
					 area where there are at least seven first nations. People understand the term
					 reserve but, other than the first nations people, they do not understand the
					 terms specific claims, additional land and so on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister mentioned that Bill C-37 had the consent
					 or approval of the government and provincial governments. I want to say
					 something about the bill that will need to be mentioned in committee. Does the
					 bill have the understanding and support of local governments? In the past we
					 have run into some real difficulties, as the minister knows.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us say that 10 sections are added to a given
					 reserve. The taxes from those 10 sections would no longer be available to the
					 local government which would have that many fewer dollars to put toward road,
					 schools and so on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister should be cognizant of this if he wants
					 clear passage and total acceptability of the bill. We need to do some work with
					 the local governments. I know that in Saskatchewan it is the Saskatchewan
					 Association of Rural Municipalities and the municipal governments at the places
					 from which the land is being extracted. We have a problem there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have another problem. As most members know,
					 Saskatchewan and Alberta were not added to Confederation until 1905. While the
					 minerals in other areas remained with the land or purchaser thereof, in
					 Saskatchewan the minerals remained for the most part with the crown. I believe
					 the hon. member mentioned 1930. One of the difficulties we have, even in my
					 constituency, is that the minerals on lands in the eastern portion belong to
					 the crown. As immigration and settlements moved west after 1905, the minerals
					 went with the land when it was purchased.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conceivably we would be adding 10 sections of land to a
					 current day reserve. Under the previous owner the minerals belonged to the
					 crown. The property owner did not have the minerals. As the property is moved
					 to a reserve the minerals will go to the crown and there could be some problems
					 with that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some real concerns but not about the expansion.
					 I agree with the minister, I think most people in general want the treaties to
					 go forward, to get them out of the way and, for lack of a better word, to get
					 on with the show. Let us make this happen but in doing so let us make sure we
					 notify all partners and that everybody is aware of what is going on. That is
					 very necessary.</p>


	<A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To draw an analogy, my constituency had its first
					 anthrax scare way out in a rural area in a village with maybe 20 people.I do
					 not want to get into the details but they have never been told anything.
					 Nothing has gone out as to what to do, who to call or what to expect. There is
					 a lack of government information and explanation, a lack of printed government
					 policy, a lack of PR with the newspapers, particularly in the area concerned.
					 Those things are imperative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the minister will take my advice. As he goes
					 into the specific land claims and the addition to the reserves, he would be
					 well advised that people in that area have an understanding. Once there is an
					 understanding there is more apt to be agreement with what is going on. That is
					 necessary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will let the bill go to committee. We will support
					 it at this point. However I am quite sure that when the bill gets to committee
					 there will be a lot of questions. We will be asking questions not just on the
					 part of the first nations, but also on the part of local government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something has to be clarified. The first nations people
					 want to be called first nations. The result of mammoth research and, I believe,
					 the 1988 booklet was that they want to be called first nations. Throughout the
					 bill the minister refers to first nations, but the word Indian is still being
					 used. They no longer want to be called Indians. Throughout the Indian Act,
					 which we are going to look at, that word is used. Both terms are being used. We
					 should not be doing that. Let us be consistent in using one term. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let us hope that in committee we will allow
					 enough time to carefully look at not only the first nations people but other
					 people who are affected. We must carefully look at the rural municipalities or
					 other landowners who lose property or have the property consumed and what their
					 rights are and what provisions will be given to local governments so that they
					 may carry on their work. In the past in settling land claims the relationships
					 between the parties have soured in many of the rural municipalities in my
					 constituency and they remain that way today. Let us hope we can avoid that in
					 the future.</p>

					 (Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to rise to speak in this
					 debate. Bill C-37, the claim settlements (Alberta and Saskatchewan)
					 implementation act, which the House is currently considering, is, as its name
					 indicates, intended to facilitate the implementation of territorial agreements
					 reached between the federal government and the first nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is very technical and does not bear the usual
					 characteristics of the initiatives of the Minister of Indian Affairs and
					 Northern Development, which tend to be rather controversial or at least to
					 cause some flurry. In fact, the minister appears to want to assume his
					 responsibilities fully and demonstrate the leadership needed to ensure the full
					 development of the first nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a hard time understanding why the Bloc Quebecois
					 would oppose quick passage of this bill, since the minister is finally
					 proposing constructive action in support of the first nations. The position the
					 Bloc Quebecois has taken on the bill is very much in keeping with the party's
					 line on the first nations' right to self-government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, in fact, recognize the minister's, or rather the
					 department's, openness. It seems now to be giving greater consideration to the
					 real needs and deep aspirations of the first nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, Bill C-37 facilitates the implementation of
					 land claim settlements, which we know are the result of long and difficult
					 negotiations designed to bring about greater self-government and increased
					 accountability for first nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to point out that the legislative
					 measure being discussed today is limited exclusively to the results of the
					 negotiations in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Incidentally, similar legislation was
					 adopted one year ago concerning Manitoba. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-37 will considerably reduce the time required to
					 grant the lands negotiated real reserve status. Aboriginal people in these
					 areas would be able to use the legislation to accelerate the land transfer
					 process. This is a key element of the notion of self-government, as it would
					 allow first nations to benefit sooner from the natural resources on their
					 lands. Their economic space would be strengthened and everything seems to
					 indicate that the legislation would have a positive effect on these
					 communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, while supporting this bill and hoping to
					 see it adopted speedily and efficiently, I would like to express my desire to
					 see the recommendations of the Erasmus-Dussault report, made public in 1996 at
					 a cost of $50 million, adopted as quickly as possible to deal with the problems
					 plaguing the first nations in a comprehensive manner, as opposed to limiting
					 ourselves to a piecemeal approach.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government must not limit itself to bills such as
					 this one, which deals with a specific part of the problem, but it must develop
					 a comprehensive policy and a clear direction to ensure that the recommendations
					 made by the Erasmus-Dussault royal commission be implemented as quickly as
					 possible.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, as the NDP caucus critic for aboriginal
					 affairs, I am pleased to join the debate regarding Bill C-37. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome any measure that will speed up the
					 implementation process of the many outstanding claims and treaty land
					 negotiations that are under way. We recognize that in both the provinces of
					 Alberta and Saskatchewan there is an enormous backlog and an enormous level of
					 frustration on the part of aboriginal peoples, first nations communities and
					 other interested third parties in the tedious and painfully slow negotiation
					 process that has been under way for decades, if not centuries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize that Bill C-37 very closely resembles the
					 Manitoba act of a similar nature which was passed only last year. As a member
					 of parliament from Winnipeg I did seek advice from those parties that are
					 affected by the Manitoba settlement claims process. We got a positive report.
					 People are generally satisfied that what was implemented in Manitoba can and
					 should serve as a model for the other two prairie provinces as they address
					 very similar issues. I understand it will. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We note with interest that the minister for aboriginal
					 affairs pointed out that Bill C-37 addresses 97% of all the outstanding treaty
					 land entitlement negotiations and specific claims settlement negotiations which
					 are currently underway. We welcome that. If we can clear up 97% of the
					 unbelievable backlog, then when those administrative and bureaucratic details
					 are put behind us we can look forward to the day when aboriginal communities
					 can take real steps toward true self-government as contemplated in the
					 recommendations of the royal commission on aboriginal peoples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aboriginal affairs critic for the official
					 opposition failed to point out any of the specifics in the bill. It is
					 incumbent upon somebody in the House to deal with some of the substance and to
					 comment on the actual details surrounding the bill. I would have hoped that
					 someone in the official opposition would have read the briefing book and would
					 have gone through some of the specific details which people in the rest of the
					 country are very interested in.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For people who may be watching and for aboriginal
					 communities who realize that this is their day to have this issue dealt with in
					 the House of Commons, I would like to go through some of the details of the
					 bill. On behalf of aboriginal communities I will explain to the general public
					 what we are talking about when we introduce a bill that would result in the
					 addition of lands to reserves. I look to the manual that was provided to all
					 members of parliament which explains quite clearly under what circumstances the
					 federal government would seek to add to the land mass of reserves or to create
					 new reserves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of non-aboriginal people may feel that this
					 process was finished and done with at the turn of the century. Most of these
					 treaties were signed between 1874 and 1906. However, there are circumstances
					 under which for two reasons these lands are expanded by creating new reserve
					 lands or allocating new pieces of land to existing reserves. One is to meet
					 with the entitlement issue. The Indian Act specifies that based on the size of
					 a family or the size of a community a certain amount of land will be allocated
					 to that first nations community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are historic shortfalls. Some go right back to
					 the day of the original signing of the treaty and some because the size of the
					 community has grown and the land mass of the reserve no longer meets the needs
					 of the size of the community. These things need to be addressed. It could be to
					 address social concerns or another reason that is cited is to improve the
					 geographic integrity of a reserve. </p>


	<A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these reserves were put together and mapped out
					 in a period of time when there was less understanding as to what the ultimate
					 usage would be of the first nations community, whether it was a geographical
					 barrier like a river or a mountain range or a social or a cultural barrier like
					 the development of industry in certain areas of a reserve. Those were not
					 accommodated between 1874 and 1906, and now there are good arguments why they
					 should be accommodated. That is another rationale under which we would improve
					 the geographic integrity of a reserve by changing its physical and geographical
					 shape.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes there is a need to compensate the first
					 nations communities for the public takings of reserve land. For instance, if a
					 bi-pole hydro-electric line was slated to go through reserve land, there would
					 be a loss of land usage directly underneath those wires and for a right-of-way
					 on both sides of those wires. This may constitute hundreds of thousands of
					 acres on that reserve property. We believe it would be only fair to compensate
					 that equal amount of land with usable land. This is another reason why we may
					 see a situation and why we believe there are righteous claims made to the
					 federal government to justify the expansion of existing reserves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the rationale is to fulfill Canada's legal
					 obligations under a court order or the terms of a claim settlement with the
					 first nations relating to such matters as treaty land entitlements and specific
					 claims. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the question from the member from the
					 official opposition who asked if non-aboriginal people in the community
					 understood why it was necessary to introduce legislation that would contemplate
					 expanding reserves and even creating new reserves, the rationale is cited in
					 the briefing book should he have the time to read it. That would be useful for
					 everybody concerned. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only should I point out what is in the bill in
					 terms of what enabling measures it gives the minister, but I should also point
					 out, for the comfort level of other people and of third parties who are
					 affected by these expansions of reserves, what is not affected in the proposed
					 legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, to answer many of the questions raised by the
					 critic from the official opposition, perhaps for his behalf and for the sake of
					 people with legitimate concerns and to raise the comfort level of those who may
					 criticize the expansion of aboriginal and first nation communities, such as
					 rural municipalities, private property owners, third parties and non-aboriginal
					 people who are affected by the expansion of a reserve, let me cite some of the
					 things that are not affected by the legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the bill would not automatically ratify any
					 claim settlements. It would simply put in place the enabling measures or a
					 process by which those settlements may be settled in a reasonable, fair period
					 of time instead of the undue lengthy, tedious process that we have come to
					 accept as the norm. The purpose of the bill is not to ratify these settlements
					 but to facilitate the process by which the reserve creation commitments of
					 these settlements can be implemented. That should address at least one of the
					 points that was raised by the hon. member.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question that legitimately should be asked
					 about the bill, and one thing that we can put to bed right now, is that no
					 expropriation of private land or interests is contemplated by the bill or
					 enabled by it. It does recognize that there are third party claims to land that
					 we may seek to make a part of a reserve. Sometimes there is competing and
					 compounding third party claims to resources or even the actual ownership of
					 land which we seek to use to expand reserves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the legislation does nothing to actually
					 expropriate any private land ownership. Third parties can take comfort in the
					 fact that we as the opposition party in the House of Commons recognize that
					 this is neither the intention nor the result of this legislation. In fact, we
					 will find within this legislation specific protection of third party interests
					 that did not exist before. Before we had to be subject to the vagaries of the
					 settlement in the courts, now there some accepted and predictable processes
					 under which a claim or a legitimate objection, as a third party, will be dealt
					 with. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also point out that nothing in Bill C-37
					 deals or interferes with the taxation of on-reserve third party interests,
					 which is another legitimate concern that could be and should have been raised
					 by any critic of the bill. Having read the bill and the briefing books, we are
					 satisfied that the bill does not affect first nations' ability to tax
					 on-reserve third party interests. If it did, we would have to vote against the
					 bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I point these things out only because they are
					 predictable things that should and probably will be raised by people who
					 present before the committee or the general public who may be concerned that we
					 are taking steps in the House to expand the reserve system and to settle
					 outstanding treaty entitlement and specific claim settlements in the provinces
					 of Alberta and Saskatchewan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are used to hearing opposition to any steps that may
					 move forward the legitimate aspirations of first nations communities to achieve
					 self-government. It is a common theme that we in the NDP caucus have been
					 opposing for a number of years. We hope that people in the House of Commons can
					 set aside their biases and prejudices for or against, as is the case of the
					 official opposition, aboriginal first nations' self-government. We hope they
					 can see that the bill is not threatening in any way. It is an enabling measure
					 which would clean up a bureaucratic backlog of outstanding claims, and having
					 put those issues to bed, would allow us to deal with the more salient and
					 pertinent issue of true aboriginal self-government. We all look forward to the
					 day we can move on with that as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the background information that was given to us
					 is helpful as well. We recognize that Bill C-37 is advantageous in another way
					 that was not pointed out by the official opposition. We note that the bill will
					 facilitate the selection by first nations of commercially viable lands rather
					 than simply lands that are encumbered by other interests. In other words, it
					 could be looked upon as an economic development tool. For those who are always
					 saying that aboriginal communities must become more self-sufficient, that they
					 must promote business and that they must get more with it regarding the
					 economic realities of Canada, the bill could enable first nations communities
					 to access lands that have economic development potential. This is a real plus
					 which we have not heard raised here before.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not saying that the only way we can expand the
					 reserve is by choosing land that borders or is close to the reserve which is
					 completely unused, unclaimed or undeveloped. It may result in choosing land
					 that has economic activity on it. We would then have to negotiate some kind of
					 compensation for the third party using the land. The land would then be
					 transferred within the first nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, in Manitoba we find that the steps to
					 enable the process to move along more quickly has been quite a satisfactory
					 experience. We have no hesitation in recommending a similar model for the
					 provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. I believe that 30 first nations will
					 benefit in the province of Alberta and as many as 16 in the province of
					 Saskatchewan, and 97% of the outstanding entitlement and specific claims can be
					 remedied and settled under this enabling process. That in itself is reason
					 enough for us to support it at second reading to go to committee.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to congratulate the Minister of Indian
					 Affairs and Northern Development. Under his steady hand and leadership, he has
					 been able to bring this bill forward and make the kind of inroads and efforts
					 that are required in this all important area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very important area that deals exclusively
					 with reserve land proposals that arise under claim settlements, either existing
					 or in the future both in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. As such, it
					 is very important not only in those two provinces, but it sets the right tone
					 across Canada. The minister and the government need to be congratulated because
					 it underscores our commitment to do the right things in this very important
					 area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the opposition is saying right now to the minister
					 that he did a good job, I too want to add to that. I think it is excellent and
					 really well worth noting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would the member opposite scope out as being the
					 most important aspect of the bill? He referenced his own province and other
					 areas in the west. If we listened closely to what the member said, it was very
					 wise. Could he expound a little further on that and give us more insight?

					 Winnipeg Centre.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, as uncomfortable as I am with that kind of
					 introduction, I do not mind speaking a little longer about a bill in which I
					 see a lot of good qualities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take the hon. member's question seriously, the most
					 important single thing that Bill C-37 could do is alleviate the backlog of
					 unsettled claims that exist on the two prairie provinces so that we could use
					 our energy and resources in a more positive way and take serious concrete steps
					 toward the larger issue of aboriginal self-government. In other words, the
					 sooner we rid ourselves of these bureaucratic, almost nuisance claims, where we
					 have lawsuit piled upon lawsuit waiting for resolution. Ten, twenty or thirty
					 years go by, generations go by before first nations communities can avail
					 themselves of the land to which they are entitled by court order. However with
					 third party complications they simply cannot address it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be the first single biggest advantage that I
					 see. In Manitoba we are managing to cut through some of that bureaucratic
					 backlog that has piled up on people's desks. If we can accomplish that for the
					 30 first nations in Alberta and the 14 first nations in Saskatchewan, who
					 support the bill and endorse this process, that in itself would be progress,
					 and I support that.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, just so that we do not get too carried

					 some balance, I certainly agree that the bill before us today addresses a

					 very common concern that has been voiced by first nations about the amount of
					 bureaucracy, paperwork and process that these issues have had to go
					 through.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we also need to recognize that there are many
					 other issues that need to be addressed within first nations governance and

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member is very knowledge on this issue as our
					 critic for aboriginal affairs. Could he comment on whether he thinks there are
					 any aspects of this bill that could applied, for example, in British Columbia
					 where I know there have been a lot of issues around the treaty negotiation
					 process and claims process. Does the hon. member think there are other things

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Vancouver East for
					 the opportunity to expand on that point somewhat. Had I had more time in my
					 original speech, I would have pointed out that we have some reservations about
					 the bill. One aspect of the bill we are critical of is a recurring theme that
					 we see in much of the legislation introduced by the government. It expands and
					 enhances the powers of the minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is such a recurring theme that I cannot think of
					 one piece of legislation in the four years I have been in the House of Commons
					 in which the Liberal Party, the government party, has not sought to expand the
					 discretionary authority or discretionary power of the minister. I remind
					 ministers and others that they will not always be ministers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if I have no personal problem with the current
					 minister of aboriginal affairs having expanded authority because there might be
					 a sense of trust there, God forbid we could look at a day when the official
					 opposition might be the government and the powers of people vehemently opposed
					 to aboriginal self-government might have been expanded. They might use that
					 power in a way that we would not be satisfied with at all. We have to consider
					 that as the powers of the current minister of aboriginal affairs are
					 expanded.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dealing with a situation where the official
					 opposition is on record saying things like the famous quote of the aboriginal
					 affairs critic for the Reform Party about living on an Indian reserve being
					 like living on a South Seas island being supported by a rich uncle. That was
					 the attitude we heard put forward by the Reform Party, now the Canadian
					 Alliance. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be accurate because I do not want to
					 misrepresent what the member for 
					 Athabasca actually said,
					 but he said that we should not say we did not defeat those people just because
					 we did not beat them in a war, that they are in fact vanquished; otherwise we
					 would not have been able to force them on to these godforsaken little reserves
					 they live on. That is the tone of the comments we get from the Canadian
					 Alliance, from the official opposition, when it comes to aboriginal
					 issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I caution the government and the ruling party. As it
					 enhances the powers of the minister perhaps they should be sunsetted just in
					 case there is a change of government some day and that authority or that power
					 could be abused.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if I am out of time, but the hon. member
					 asked me about the British Columbia experience. We have been dealing with the
					 occupation of lands in the Sun Peaks area in the interior of British Columbia.
					 We have met with the aboriginal leadership in the interior and the Kamloops
					 band in that area. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many outstanding issues will not be affected or
					 enhanced or even improved in any way, shape or form by this legislation, but we
					 hope the sentiment expressed in the legislation will have a desirable effect on
					 other outstanding issues in other provinces.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, some of the last comments made by the
					 member for Winnipeg Centre seem unfortunate. I certainly have no idea how
					 dredging up things from years and years gone by, probably taken out of context,
					 has anything to do with building and being positive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first ever Reform Party member elected to the
					 House of Commons in 1989 I remind the member for Winnipeg Centre that I taught
					 school on a reserve at Frog Lake. I had several native foster children in my
					 home. I was a lighthouse for the Reform Party. I tell him that there is sweet
					 nothing to be gained by this kind of behaviour and debate in the House of
					 Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell him exactly what the Canadian Alliance
					 position is in its policy paper. It states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Our position in land claims
						  negotiations will be to ensure respect for existing private property rights,
						  affordable and conclusive settlement of all claims, and an open and transparent
						  process involving all stakeholders.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that not what the NDP just said? Is that not in some
					 measure what the government is trying to do right now? That is what we should
					 be discussing right now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of members of the Canadian Alliance, the
					 official opposition, as someone who has represented them for quite some time,
					 and on behalf of every member of the House of Commons, it is foolish to even go
					 down that path. Shame on them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me get to the bill at hand, Bill C-37, and talk a
					 bit about some of the pros and cons in that legislation. Obviously there is a
					 history in this regard. The minister talked about it earlier this morning. If
					 we had any choice it would have been to have the bill longer because there is
					 so much to study in it. It was just brought in last week. I know that it was to
					 be debated this coming Thursday, but because of Bill C-33 respecting the
					 Nunavut water board and tribunal this bill is coming into the House earlier
					 today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So keen was I to make sure that I did get something to
					 say about it, I travelled on the all-nighter last night so I arrived here at
					 about 8.25 this morning. I am glad to be here while we are participating in
					 this debate. I am also glad that we can change our flights around.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the history in this regard, the minister
					 alluded to the Manitoba land claims agreement and made some changes to that as
					 well. That came in, in 2000. To be able to make changes to that legislation to
					 tighten it up, to make it more efficient and more streamlined, as the minister
					 said, is a good thing. With the ongoing land claim settlements we need to be
					 able to make sure they are swiftly and positively resolved. If this bill is in
					 any way able to do that it is a good thing, not just for first nations but also
					 for third party stakeholders. The minister talked about them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is a balance. We always need to be able to come up
					 with some sort of a balance that we can strike with regard to the stakeholders,
					 whether in oil, gas, minerals or whatever, on reserve land or on future reserve
					 land, as the minister talked about. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look for a few moments at some of the general
					 observations of the bill. Native reserve claim settlements normally require the
					 accommodation of existing third party interest. That is there
					 already.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before land can be set apart for reserve creation or
					 expansion the existing third party interests on that piece of land must be
					 cleared either by buying out that land and cancelling it, or by accommodating
					 the interest in a manner agreeable to Canada, the particular first nation and
					 the third party. Only after that can the land be transferred to the government
					 for reserve purposes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again that process looks like it is a good one, but of
					 course the trick is how lengthy that process can be become. I think my
					 colleague said that it could go on for years and years, sometimes even a
					 generation for sure. Usually the additions to the reserve process takes between
					 one and three years, but all kinds of outstanding land claim settlements can go
					 on for many years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully Bill C-37 will speed up that process. It
					 would allow a first nation to consent to the creation of interests on land
					 proposed for reserve status rather than waiting until after the land has been
					 purchased by the federal government and granted reserve status.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look at the timelines on it, give checkmarks and say
					 that is a good thing.</p>


	<A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1300)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to look at some of the pros and a few of the
					 cons in the particular bill. We need to draw a column. It seems to me we all do
					 that in our lives when we have a decision to make. We look at the pros and the
					 cons. Then we weigh them off against each other because life is obviously just
					 a series of tradeoffs and balances. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the pros are that Bill C-37 would allow the
					 minister to set lands apart for reserve creation expansion rather than doing
					 this by the more time consuming order in council. Not only will this hasten the
					 settlement of outstanding reserve claims, but with the large numbers of reserve
					 creation orders expected in the future this will also avoid taxing the order in
					 council process. I am sure that gets to be fairly lengthy on its
					 own.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could flip that pro into a con and say that as with
					 so much legislation, as the member for Winnipeg said, the minister seems to get
					 a great deal of power regardless of who is in power. We have to make sure that
					 there are checks and balances on the power of the minister. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the minister would agree with that. We have
					 both sat in the House for many years. It would be a pity to think that he would
					 become omnipotent or something like that. I am sure he would never want that to
					 happen. We have to make sure we balance out the pro with the con in that
					 regard. Yes, it does give the minister more power, but let us make sure that
					 there are checks and balances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The predesignation provision allowing a first nation to
					 consent to third party interest on land proposed for reserve status will
					 significantly reduce the time required for Saskatchewan and Alberta to fulfill
					 their reserve expansion commitments. Dear knows this whole process goes on and
					 on. Perhaps the bill can hurry that process along, again making sure that all
					 aspects are taken into consideration and that all stakeholders and third
					 parties, regardless of what their interests are, are not getting the short end
					 of the stick or shafted in any way on either side.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A speedier implementation process would encourage on
					 reserve economic activity benefiting the first nation and provide commercial
					 certainty for the third party that has an interest in proposed reserve land
					 during the transfer process. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a smart thing it is to have economic development
					 on reserves. Hopefully the idea of complete dependence on government is waning
					 across the nation. For first nations and reserves to be totally dependent on
					 government is not a happy situation for anyone. None of us like to be
					 completely dependent. If this in any way gives economic self-sufficiency or
					 economic development for reserves across the land, it would certainly be seen
					 as a good thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation accommodates existing third party
					 interests to give the first nations the opportunity to welcome new interests
					 during the reserve creation process. It is interesting that while the bill is
					 before the House we are talking about the pipeline in the Northwest
					 Territories. That is also important. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the kinks have not been worked out of it. That is
					 for sure, but as we are watching this process evolve right now there are
					 private oil companies which are taking in the aboriginal community in a
					 one-third profit sharing idea. That whole idea of economic development cannot
					 hurt anyone for sure. It is interesting that those events are going along a
					 parallel track to make sure that third party interests really are considered
					 and yet they are able to share the benefit of using native lands as well.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will give the first nations a chance to select
					 commercially viable lands for reserve expansion rather than simply those lands
					 which are already cleared of existing interests. Again, that appears to be a
					 benefit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a couple of concerns. I have already mentioned
					 the explicit one, not total but certainly more power for the minister. We need
					 to make sure we keep that in check.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we support facilitating a quicker resolution
					 of first nation claim settlements, we have concerns regarding the effects of
					 the legislation on third party stakeholders with interest on proposed reserve
					 lands. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just mentioned the pipeline through the north coming
					 down into Canada. Alaska also wants to get in on that. However, to make sure we
					 are not all on one side or the other, there needs to be a balance. As I have
					 said many times in my remarks as well as in the past, we need to make sure that
					 there is concern for both sides here, that we do not just take off our glasses
					 and say we want this side or that side to benefit. It needs to be mutually
					 beneficial. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the only way in life it works. To me it is the
					 only way this piece of legislation can work. We have to work together and make
					 sure we get the aboriginal community as well as the third party stakeholders to
					 the table. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes
					 or pull a quick one and say to them that they have missed their chance, because
					 we know these things always have ramifications. Sooner or later those concerns
					 will come up, or there will not be any goodwill for third party stakeholders to
					 even work with the government or to believe that a piece of legislation like
					 this will really help them. We want to make sure that the third party
					 stakeholders feel they are being listened to, that they, as well as the first
					 nations, are being given not just the benefit of the doubt but the benefit of
					 the whole situation, because I know that many of them over the years have had
					 concerns that they have been railroaded or whatever.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the minister has a huge responsibility to live
					 up to. I know there are frustrations across the country right now and he faced
					 frustrations this summer. These surely are difficult times for him to be
					 working through. I know he will realize how important it is to strike that
					 balance. We in the official coalition are in the opposition now, but sooner or
					 later, as the member said, someone else will be in government and we want to
					 make sure that there are reasonable and rational processes in place, as well as
					 transitions that would take place for any government of the day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the minister understands that because when he
					 and I first started in the House we were sitting in the opposition corner. The
					 opposition coalition wishes him well with this. I suppose if we can give any
					 advice or caution it would be to make sure that he deals with this sensitively
					 on both sides of the issue. I know it is a tough tightrope to walk but at the
					 same time I do believe it is important. If he does not, obviously down the road
					 he will end up with problems far more serious than those he is facing
					 now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition coalition gives qualified support. We
					 say to the government that we want to move ahead with these land claims
					 settlements and we trust that this Alberta-Saskatchewan land claims agreement,
					 which is modelled after Manitoba's, will go well, that it will go speedily and
					 that we will see some true benefits both for the first nations and the third
					 party stakeholders.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the House on Bill C-37,
					 claims settlements (Alberta and Saskatchewan) implementation act. I am pleased
					 to have this opportunity to speak in support of this proposed
					 legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first glance this may appear to be a somewhat
					 technical bill, with limited scope and applicability but first impressions can
					 be deceiving. The reality is that the changes proposed in this legislation--as
					 minor as they may appear--will have a big impact on first nations communities
					 throughout Alberta and Saskatchewan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. members should know that Bill C-37, when it
					 becomes law, will make a difference in the lives of first nations people and
					 communities. It will make a difference to landowners, developers and people who
					 live and work near existing reserves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is so important about this proposed legislation?
					 After all, the existing process for adding lands to reserves works, does it
					 not? It is a little slow and cumbersome but the job gets done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is the approach we wish to take, then yes, the
					 current process does work, but it hardly works well. In fact, it is severely
					 impeding progress in resolving outstanding settlement commitments that have
					 been made to first nations in Alberta and Saskatchewan--some of which date back
					 a decade or more.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state for the record that this in not the
					 approach this government intends to take. We are not prepared to accept the
					 status quo because first nations deserve and want better, and Canadian
					 taxpayers as a whole deserve a more efficient process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government intends to move quickly in fulfilling
					 Canada's commitments to aboriginal people. This is really what Bill C-37 is all
					 about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Gathering Strength”, our response to the report of the
					 royal commission on aboriginal peoples, included a number of specific
					 commitments. Notable among these was a pledge to honour Canada's treaties
					 signed with aboriginal people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This goes to the very heart of Bill C-37 because the
					 key objective of this proposed legislation is to implement better, more
					 expeditious ways to meet our reserve expansion commitments, most of which arise
					 out of treaty land entitlements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps some history is in order to help put this issue
					 into perspective. As members will know, between 1874 and 1906, the Government
					 of Canada signed several numbered treaties with first nations in Alberta and
					 Saskatchewan. As a general rule, these treaties required Canada to allocate
					 reserve land to a first nation based on its population--generally, the first
					 nation was to receive a certain acreage for each family group.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one reason or another, many first nations involved
					 in this treaty making process did not receive the full amount of land promised
					 to them. In some cases, the shortfall can be blamed on inaccurate counts of
					 band members; in other instances, not enough land was set apart when a reserve
					 was first surveyed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of the cause, there is no question that
					 insufficient amounts of reserve lands were provided to some first nations.
					 Therefore, while some of the treaty land entitlement obligations were fully
					 satisfied long ago, many first nations in Alberta and Saskatchewan did not
					 historically receive their full land entitlement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These century old injustices must be resolved and our
					 government has been tackling the problem with renewed energy over the past
					 several years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treaty land entitlement settlement agreements have been
					 signed with six first nations in Alberta. In Saskatchewan, a treaty land
					 entitlement framework agreement is in place covering most of the affected first
					 nations, and several others have signed individual agreements. In total, 36
					 first nations in the two provinces are encompassed by these agreements.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly the will exists on all sides to move forward on
					 this issue. Appropriate resources have been earmarked for these settlements by
					 the governments of Canada, Alberta and Saskatchewan. First nations have been
					 identifying lands they would like to add to their reserves. However, despite
					 the best of intentions and the full co-operation of all parties, this is where
					 progress has bogged down.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost invariably, the lands being selected by first
					 nations have existing third party interests. Under the terms of claim
					 settlements, these interests must either be cleared or accommodated in a way
					 that is satisfactory to everyone involved before the lands can be added to a
					 reserve. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, with the exception of the Manitoba Claim
					 Settlements Implementation Act and, to a lesser extent, the Saskatchewan Treaty
					 Land Entitlement Act, existing federal laws simply are not geared to
					 accommodating third party interests with any degree of certainty or
					 timeliness.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the current additions to reserve process
					 create a classic catch 22 situation. Third party interests must be addressed
					 before lands can be granted reserve status. But with the exceptions I just
					 noted, first nations can only agree to permit a third party interest on land
					 that is already part of a reserve.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end result is that processing selected lands into
					 reserve status takes a great deal of time and energy, which is one reason why
					 settlements signed some time ago are not yet fully implemented.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-37 will address this situation by providing for
					 more efficient and commercially certain ways to accommodate third party
					 interests. Essentially, a first nation will be able to consent to such an
					 interest--either existing or new--before lands have been granted reserve
					 status.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent experience has shown that the sooner third-party
					 interests can be resolved, the quicker lands can be added to a reserve, and the
					 quicker first nations can begin to reap the economic benefits associated with
					 those lands.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that the catalyst for Bill
					 C-37 was a commitment by Canada to recommend such legislation under treaty land
					 entitlement settlements concluded in 1998 with the Alexander First Nation and
					 the Loon River Cree First Nation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the proposed legislation is fulfilling
					 commitments to specific first nations, while at the same time addressing
					 longstanding issues of concern for more than 30 other first nations in Alberta
					 and Saskatchewan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-37 extends beyond the scope of treaty land
					 entitlement agreements. With the approval of first nations and the affected
					 provincial governments, the legislation has been crafted in such a way that it
					 may benefit any other existing or future claim settlements containing reserve
					 expansion commitments in both provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Canada also has reserve expansion
					 commitments arising out of specific claims settlements in Alberta and
					 Saskatchewan. Although these commitments involve significantly less land than
					 treaty land entitlement settlements, they present the same implementation
					 difficulties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to emphasize that the bill is not being forced
					 on any first nation in Alberta or Saskatchewan. It would apply on a per claim
					 basis, and only when the affected first nation agrees to opt in to its
					 provisions. First nations that wish to continue to add lands to their reserves
					 using existing processes will be free to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, let me say once again that Bill C-37 is an
					 implicit part of this government's commitment under “Gathering Strength” to
					 address Canada's historical obligations to aboriginal people and to pave the
					 way for their greater economic self-reliance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would also strengthen the capacity of first
					 nations governments to make decisions about lands selected for addition to
					 reserves under claim settlements in a way that is effective, timely and
					 accountable to their membership.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-37 would help Canada move beyond historic
					 grievances with first nations people while ensuring that past agreements were
					 honoured and fulfilled. It is a positive step into the future, a step that is
					 supported by first nations in Alberta and Saskatchewan and by the governments
					 of these provinces. It clearly deserves the support of this House as
					 well.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will begin by answering the questions
					 from the opposition parties. I think I can deal with virtually all of them,
					 which I hope will speed the process through committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was of course delighted to hear the member from the
					 coalition talk about the futility of dredging up the past. I eagerly look
					 forward to seeing how the Alliance and the coalition bring that sentiment into
					 question period today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP and the Bloc were basically in support of the
					 bill and outlined some of its good points. Several questions came up, mostly
					 from the official opposition, and I will address some of those points. The
					 first point was about providing the public with more and better information on
					 some of the concepts. My colleague from the NDP did a very good job of that.
					 For people who may not have been aware of them, he explained some of the
					 provisions in the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition member mentioned that one definition
					 that is not covered is specific claims. Just so members know, these are items
					 that come up over and above the regular treaty obligations, which may have come
					 up over the years as isolated incidents that do not hold up under the Indian
					 Act and that we have to deal with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point the member for the official opposition
					 mentioned was related to municipal claims. He specifically mentioned SARM, but
					 SARM has been involved along the way with these claims and has been dealing
					 with the government in a good working relationship. SARM is quite familiar with
					 the claims. Although it is not an issue in Alberta, there have been claims by
					 municipalities, school boards and other taxing authorities for alleged loss of
					 tax revenues due to establishment under a claims settlement. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However in Saskatchewan the tax loss issues were dealt
					 with in two ways. For Saskatchewan, the treaty land entitlement framework
					 provides that Canada and Saskatchewan shall contribute equally to a fund which
					 is to be used to compensate rural municipalities. It also compensates school
					 boards for tax losses experienced as a result of reserve expansions under that
					 agreement. For the specific claim settlements which the member for the
					 opposition mentioned, tax loss is largely the responsibility of the government
					 of Saskatchewan by virtue of a bilateral agreement signed in 1999 between
					 Saskatchewan and Canada. This is well in hand. I hope the member will be happy
					 that it has been dealt with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point he raised is related to mineral claims.
					 He is right when he says that in some cases mineral claims will revert to the
					 crown for the benefit of the first nation. That is good because that will help
					 first nations economic development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all I can remember of the member's points. If
					 there were any others perhaps the member could bring them up in question
					 period, because if all the questions have been dealt with hopefully the bill
					 will go quickly through committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a point brought up by the NDP and the
					 coalition that related to the powers of the minister, in particular the powers
					 to allow the minister to make these decisions as opposed to having an order in
					 council. This was requested by a number of first nations and also will speed up
					 the process of this administrative function so that they can get on with their
					 economic development with these third party interests.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I want to comment on relates to the
					 pipeline. It was mentioned by the coalition. Because the Alaska gas pipeline
					 would go through my riding, I am delighted that this was raised. There would be
					 great benefits for aboriginal people through employment and perhaps in taxes in
					 different parts of the north, but in the Northwest Territories and Yukon there
					 are different legal regimes, different treaty regimes, so it is not that
					 relevant to those areas.</p>


	<A NAME="T1325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1325)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if it goes through Alberta through the natural
					 gas pipeline which would bring Alaskan gas from Prudhoe Bay through Alaska and
					 the Yukon, and if it happens to go through a reserve, it could possibly apply
					 and once again would help first nations speed up their economic development
					 with those added assets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important legislation not only for the first
					 nations in Alberta and Saskatchewan but for all residents of those provinces
					 and indeed for all Canadians. I would like to take a few minutes to explore the
					 issues of how changes proposed in Bill C-37 would foster economic development
					 in the affected first nations communities. I want to focus on this because it
					 is a fundamental argument in favour of the proposed legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think hon. members on all sides of the House would
					 agree it is vitally important that aboriginal communities from coast to coast
					 to coast have opportunities to become more fully engaged in the Canadian
					 economy. A strengthened aboriginal economy would help to address the many
					 difficult issues that face first nations and Inuit communities across the
					 nation. That is not to say that progress has not been made already. I can cite
					 dozens of examples of successful aboriginal companies. In fact, there are more
					 than 18,000 aboriginal owned businesses in Canada, ranging from small home
					 based enterprises to multimillion dollar companies that do business around the
					 world. Many of these are located on first nations reserves where they not only
					 provide essential goods and services but are a vital source of employment and
					 revenue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aboriginal community is diverse and vibrant.
					 Aboriginal businesses operate in all sectors of the economy. They include
					 resource industry firms, transportation and construction companies and retail
					 and service outlets. They include manufacturing operations, management
					 consultants, computer companies, arts and crafts enterprises and environmental
					 and cultural tourism businesses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, more needs to be done to foster economic
					 development in aboriginal communities, particularly on reserves. Despite the
					 progress that has been made over the past couple of decades, aboriginal people
					 continue to be among the most economically disadvantaged of all Canadians.
					 There is still far too large a gap between the employment rates among first
					 nations people and among other Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First nations still face special barriers to economic
					 development, including legal obstacles, lower levels of education and lack of
					 business experience and capital. These barriers are affecting social conditions
					 in reserve communities. They are affecting families and children, and the
					 effects are not positive ones.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does all this have to do with Bill C-37? In my
					 mind, having a sufficient land base upon which to engage in economic activity
					 is the key to achieving prosperity in first nations communities. Since the
					 claim settlements that would be facilitated by this proposed legislation
					 concern reserve expansion, these settlements are an incredibly important
					 vehicle for supporting aboriginal economic development. Treaty land entitlement
					 and specific claim settlements do more than address past wrongs of first
					 nations people. They pave the way for a better economic future by providing a
					 secure land base and, in some cases, a financial package that can be used by
					 the claimant group to fund economic development activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As consideration of the bill progresses, we will hear
					 repeatedly of the legal and technical obstacles in the current additions to
					 reserves process, which are impeding progress in implementing settlement
					 agreements. These obstacles have resulted in an enormous backlog of commitments
					 to add lands to reserves in Alberta and Saskatchewan, a backlog that is certain
					 to grow unless action is taken to address some of the basic underlying
					 problems. This is the objective of Bill C-37.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed legislation would expedite and facilitate
					 the additions to reserves process in two ways: first, by authorizing the
					 minister rather than the governor in council to confer reserve status on lands
					 and, second, by introducing new and better ways to accommodate third party
					 interests in lands that are being converted to reserve status under claim
					 settlements in Alberta and Saskatchewan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to consider three ways in which these
					 elements of the bill would encourage economic activity in reserve communities.
					 First and foremost, the proposed legislation would demonstrate to investors and
					 others who engage in activities on lands proposed for reserve status that
					 transactions can be concluded with greater predictability for both the first
					 nation and third parties.</p>


	<A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1330)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. members can appreciate that certainty and
					 stability are prerequisites for economic development. Regardless of whether an
					 activity would be taking place in a reserve community or in downtown Edmonton
					 or Regina, Bill C-37 would provide businesses and investors in Alberta and
					 Saskatchewan with certainty of tenure for any third party interest they might
					 hold in lands to be added to a reserve. It would also provide the certainty
					 businesses need to negotiate new commercial arrangements with first nations
					 communities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important is that the changes proposed in Bill
					 C-37 would significantly reduce the amount of time needed to process lands into
					 reserve status. Dealing with third party interests under the current process is
					 problematic and time consuming. Sometimes it takes up to two years or more.
					 This would all change if Bill C-37 becomes law. Because lands would be selected
					 and added to reserves more quickly, the lands themselves and the revenues
					 generated from any third party interests preserved on them would contribute to
					 more immediate economic and social progress in the community. In fact, the
					 pre-designation powers included in Bill C-37 would allow first nations to begin
					 to enjoy these economic rewards even before the selected lands have been
					 granted reserve status.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I support the bill 100% because making the
					 accommodation of third party interests easier would give first nations access
					 to a broader range of land that has development interests or potential. I think
					 the member from one of the opposition parties mentioned that positive
					 point.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, these changes would facilitate the
					 selection by first nations of commercially viable lands rather than lands that
					 are simply unencumbered by existing interests. As first nations acquire better
					 lands we can expect to see increased economic activity in these
					 communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this proposed legislation may appear to be
					 minor in the overall scheme of government activities, I do not think we should
					 underestimate its impact. The vast majority of land selections under claim
					 settlements in Alberta and Saskatchewan would be affected by one or more third
					 party interests, whether that be a right of way for an access road, resource
					 rights or a leasehold. Bill C-37 would have the potential to come into play for
					 virtually every one of these claims. With the likelihood of even more
					 settlements in the years ahead, the legislation's importance to the additions
					 to reserve process in Alberta and Saskatchewan would only increase over
					 time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously I am very supportive of the proposed
					 legislation. I believe Bill C-37 would contribute to improved quality of life
					 in first nations communities throughout Alberta and Saskatchewan. It would
					 contribute to a growing economic base to support first nations self-government
					 and it would help first nations communities further distance themselves from
					 economic dependency on government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-37 is yet another step the government is taking
					 to live up to its commitments in “Gathering Strength”, including our commitment
					 to support strong communities, people and economies. It is another step toward
					 a better future for aboriginal people in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these important benefits in mind, I would
					 encourage hon. members to support the proposed legislation so it can proceed
					 quickly through the House and to the other place.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, as a new member, I would like to know is
					 why this particular member always asks me questions. I remember the first time
					 I made a speech he asked me a question about farming and I am probably the
					 least likely riding in the country to have farms. I thought he was on my side
					 but this is a particularly good question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have answered most of the questions that the
					 opposition parties brought up. They made some good points. They supported
					 things and brought up some concerns. I tried to elaborate on those points and I
					 am anticipating that the bill will go through committee very quickly,
					 especially since I happen to be on that committee. We are dealing with a number
					 of other serious issues and complicated bills some of which are coming from my
					 riding in the Yukon.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important point for people to understand is
					 that because the land will be transferred to a reserve there could be economic
					 considerations. As all the parties have said, it will be very beneficial for
					 first nations. Hopefully most of this land has some good economic potential.
					 Rather than waiting for the long protracted process of getting approval to do
					 things and getting the certainty for the land, the businesses and the first
					 nations can start right away and keep it economic.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That will help both the business and the first nations.
					 From the first nations’ side, this land is in limbo because of all sorts of
					 bureaucratic steps. For the businesses, especially if they already have
					 interests on that land, they can continue to get quick revenue from that land
					 without an interruption and without the uncertainty. They will just have a new
					 landlord and they can continue to take in funds.</p>

					 addresses a number of commitments and goals consistent with the government's
					 aboriginal agenda. It would affirm and honour treaties which are a cornerstone
					 of Canada's relationships with aboriginal people. It would help foster economic
					 development in first nations communities throughout Alberta and Saskatchewan so
					 that the communities can become more self-sufficient and
					 sustainable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, there are a number of areas in your riding
					 and mine, and in the ridings of many members on both sides of the House, that
					 would benefit from extension of the act to all provinces. That may be something
					 we will see within a short space of time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would facilitate the process by which Canada is
					 living up to its commitments to the first nations people. It would accomplish
					 all this primarily by ensuring that better means exist to recognize and
					 accommodate third party interests in lands selected for additions to reserves
					 in Alberta and Saskatchewan. In other words, the powers being accorded first
					 nations under the proposed legislation do not come at the expense of any
					 individual, business, institution or government, and that is often the sticking
					 point in some of our negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the opposite is true. Bill C-37 would provide
					 the certainty of tenure that third parties with existing interests need. The
					 minister has stated that this is truly a win-win situation for the current
					 backlog of current reserve expansion commitments in Alberta and Saskatchewan.
					 At the present time there is close to a million hectares, which is 2.5 million
					 acres, of land being considered for this very purpose.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a good solution for first nations because the
					 pre-reserve designation and permit granting powers provided for under the
					 legislation would allow them to select and acquire the best lands available,
					 regardless of encumbrances, instead of taking what is left over and the worst
					 lands available. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First nations would be able to enter into better
					 agreements with third parties and more quickly which means that the economic
					 benefits of land ownership will flow to communities sooner rather than
					 later.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, developers, investors and others who have
					 third party interests in lands selected by first nations to fulfill a treaty
					 land entitlement or specific claims agreement, would also benefit from the
					 commercial certainty provided by Bill C-37.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to focus on the issue of accommodating third
					 party interests for two reasons: first, it has been the main stumbling block to
					 moving more quickly in meeting Canada's reserve expansion commitments in
					 Alberta and Saskatchewan; and second, I know the protection of third party
					 interests is an important consideration for hon. members on all sides of the
					 House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister has advised us that Canada currently has a
					 commitment to add a million hectares. More such commitments will be made as
					 additional claims are settled. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land to fulfill these commitments is typically
					 contributed from unoccupied federal or provincial crown lands. Alternatively
					 the land may be purchased by the first nations on a willing seller, willing
					 buyer basis. Herein lies the problem: the vast majority of land being selected
					 by first nations for additions to reserves has existing third party
					 interest.</p>


	<A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These interests may range from rights of way and hydro
					 line easements to mineral permits and leases, timber licences, commercial and
					 residential leaseholds for tourism, recreation, vacations, et cetera.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of the nature of the interest, it must be
					 accommodating in some way that is satisfactory to all parties: Canada, the
					 first nation and the interest holder. This is one of the key issues that must
					 be addressed under the federal additions to reserves process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, as we have heard already, with the
					 exception of the recently enacted Manitoba Claim Settlements Implementation Act
					 and the 1993 Saskatchewan Treaty Land Entitlement Act, existing federal laws
					 were not designed with the requirements of the additions to reserves process in
					 mind. In other words, they are not geared to accommodate third party interest
					 in a way that is either commercially certain or commercially
					 expeditious.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current provisions of the Indian Act, for
					 example, a first nation can only consent to the creation of interest on reserve
					 land if the land is already part of the reserve. This does not include land
					 that is being merely proposed for reserve status. Of course first nations, like
					 any land owner, can grant leases on land they own privately, but if a first
					 nation wanted to transfer such land to Canada to be made into a reserve, any
					 third party interests on the land could not legally be carried forward. They
					 would have to be terminated and then reinstituted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land must exist as reserve land before leases or any
					 other third party interests can be voted on by the membership of the first
					 nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this means is that a third party must surrender
					 its interest in land, even if only temporarily, before the land can be added to
					 a reserve. In exchange, the first nation at present is only able to offer the
					 promise or undertaking that it will vote to re-grant that interest once the
					 reserve is created. At the snail's pace that some negotiations move, that could
					 be a long wait and someone might lose interest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most interest holders are understandably reluctant to
					 do this because it puts their future rights at risk. As a result, the addition
					 to reserve may be effectively stalemated and the affected first nation may have
					 to abandon its preferred choice of land and accept land that has far less
					 development potential.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manitoba first nations have been released from this
					 cumbersome process under the Manitoba Claim Settlements Implementation Act,
					 providing the additions to reserves commitment arises out of a land claim
					 settlement. The situation has also been addressed to some extent in
					 Saskatchewan where the Saskatchewan Treaty Land Entitlement Act of 1993 allows
					 first nations to consent to the granting of interest on lands that do not yet
					 have reserve status.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However experience since 1993 has taught us that this
					 power under the Saskatchewan Treaty Land Entitlement Act has not proven as
					 advantageous as it could have been since it is limited to the granting of
					 existing interest. It can only be used in treaty land entitlement situations,
					 not in specific claim situations, and it can be only used when the first nation
					 has already purchased the land. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such limitations have been avoided in the wording of
					 both the Manitoba Claim Settlements Implementation Act and the provisions of
					 the present bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-37 would essentially extend the pre-designation
					 powers now available in Manitoba to first nations in Alberta and Saskatchewan.
					 Under this proposed legislation, a first nation will be able to consent to a
					 third party land interest either existing or new during the reserve expansion
					 process and indeed even before purchasing the land itself. In this way first
					 nations will be free to then purchase the land knowing the encumbrances have
					 been settled in advance and where they will not present a hurdle to reserve
					 designation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, Bill C-37 borrows from a variety of
					 existing federal legal mechanisms for granting third party interests but
					 adjusts each in minor ways to facilitate their use when applied to additions to
					 reserves. The effect will be to provide first nations and third parties with
					 commercial certainty in their deal making while land is being processed as
					 reserve land. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new approach will help avoid situations where the
					 first nation is forced to negotiate the buy-out and closure of an ongoing
					 viable operation simply to clear the land of encumbrances, thereby forgoing any
					 future revenues that might have been derived in terms of royalties or rents, or
					 the holder of that third party interest is asked to risk temporarily
					 surrendering that interest while a parcel of land is being processed into
					 reserve status.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill will give developers and investors, both
					 existing and potential, the assurances they need to enter into agreements with
					 first nations. At the end of the day, both parties, the first nations community
					 and the holder of the interest, will benefit from these business
					 arrangements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. members can appreciate that these proposed changes
					 are designed to make the additions to reserves process as smooth and simple as
					 possible for all parties in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Bill C-37 will put real
					 estate transactions related to reserve expansions on a level playing field with
					 non-reserve transactions in these two provinces. At the same time it will
					 provide clear-cut legal mechanisms for protecting third party interests in land
					 selected for addition to a reserve. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, it is important to acknowledge that
					 the first nations with claim settlement agreements in Alberta and Saskatchewan
					 will not automatically be bound by this new legislation. First nations will
					 have complete flexibility in deciding whether to opt into these
					 provisions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure hon. members that Bill C-37 will not impose
					 any additional restrictions or requirements on land owners or third party
					 interest holders. No land owner will be forced to sell property to a first
					 nation to fulfill a claims settlement agreement nor will a third party interest
					 holder be forced to enter into agreements with first nations. Both these types
					 of transactions will continue to take place on the basis of a willing buyer and
					 a willing seller. The bill simply allows agreements to be put in place where
					 both parties desire it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is clearly a good piece of legislation. It will
					 protect third parties while giving way for new partnerships with aboriginal
					 communities. It deserves the support of hon. members and I urge them to join me
					 in voting to send Bill C-37 to committee for review.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, as Halloween approaches it is important
					 for all Canadians to give a little more to ghosts and goblins wearing bright
					 orange boxes around their necks this year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Nations International Children's Emergency
					 Fund, or UNICEF, has been helping children of the world for over 53 years. In
					 countries around the globe UNICEF provides much needed food, money and other
					 supplies for children and their families in the worst possible need.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Afghanistan, for example, there are nearly five
					 million victims of the Taliban who without assistance will become a
					 humanitarian disaster when the cold, hard Afghanistan winter sets
					 in.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Halloween I would ask all Canadians to be
					 particularly generous when neighbourhood children with UNICEF boxes knock on
					 their doors. Ignorance and poverty breed hatred, and hatred is the true enemy
					 in this campaign.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this year Canada Post will celebrate its

					 fairly and give them the right to collective bargaining in order to obtain
					 decent working and living conditions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will agree with me that 20 years' of service in

					 even minimum wage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why I hope Canada Post will begin its 21st year
					 on the right foot by giving these employees the right to collective bargaining
					 as an expression of its gratitude.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will shortly be introducing a bill in this regard,

	Mr. Speaker, pursuant to

					 report of the Canadian delegation to two very special meetings held in
					 Washington in June and July of this year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of these meetings was to impress upon our
					 parliamentarian friends in the United States the harm they were doing with
					 respect to our forestry industry, particularly softwood lumber, which is one of
					 our most important industries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also to impress upon our friends in the United
					 States that this is just one natural resource which goes along with our other
					 natural resources such as mining, electrical power, oil and natural gas, and
					 that we cannot look at one natural resource in isolation of another.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that on such short notice the
					 committee staff with whom I work, Carol Chafe, June Dewetering and John
					 Christopher, were absolutely superb. As Canadian parliamentarians we can be
					 very proud of the people we have assisting us in the House of
					 Commons.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to stand again to speak
					 to Bill C-35. As was mentioned the debate on this bill began last Thursday.
					 When I approached the table today I was told that I had 14 minutes left unless
					 I was speaking French and then I would have 15 minutes. I will attempt to do
					 this in English and I should be done in 14 minutes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does a number of things. One of the main
					 thrusts of the bill is the implementation of part of the Hughes report. This
					 summer we went through the Hughes report that dealt with the APEC inquiry. It
					 made many recommendations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the recommendations dealt with the RCMP. It
					 recommended the requested statutory codification of the nature and extent of
					 police independence from government with respect to two different areas: first,
					 the existing common law practices regarding law enforcement and, second, the
					 provision and responsibility for delivery of security services at public order
					 events. Bill C-35 intends to implement the last part of the Hughes report but
					 not the former part.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RCMP Commissioner Zaccardelli dismissed the key
					 recommendations saying that there was no need in his opinion for statutory
					 recognition of police independence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians must have confidence that the RCMP can do its
					 job. That includes investigating the government in suspected cases of
					 wrongdoing without fear of interference or reprisal. APEC is not an isolated
					 incident. There are other examples, such as the airbus affair, that suggest the
					 government may have improperly interfered with or instructed the RCMP.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of books chronicle the politicization of the
					 RCMP, such as Paul Palango's <i>Above the Law</i>, and Stevie Cameron's <i>On
					 the Take</i>.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 1997 the federal government reached a $2
					 million out of court settlement with former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in
					 what we call the airbus affair. It has been almost five years and Canadians
					 have never learned the truth as to who was ultimately responsible for this
					 libel suit. No one was ever held accountable for the Liberal government's
					 suspect political intervention into a criminal investigation of national and
					 international importance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who may not remember, I will refresh their
					 memory. In 1995 a letter of request was sent to Swiss authorities signed by
					 justice department lawyer Kimberly Prost on behalf of the justice minister.
					 Contained within this letter was a false accusation. It stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>This investigation is of serious
						  concern to the Government of Canada as it involves criminal activity on the
						  part of the former Prime Minister.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 4, 1995, Roger Tasse, Mulroney's lawyer,
					 contacted the justice minister via telephone to apprise him that they were in
					 receipt of the letter written to the Swiss authorities. According to news
					 reports Tasse pleaded with the minister to water down the language and send a
					 new document to Switzerland. The minister refused. Furthermore in a letter
					 dated November 8, 1995, to the justice minister Mulroney's lawyer
					 stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>In light of the most important,
						  unjustified and highly damaging statements contained in the request made to the
						  Swiss authorities, we urge you to personally review the matter and to direct
						  your department to withdraw the request already made and to present, if that is
						  the wish of the RCMP, a new request that is more respectful of basic rules of
						  fairness and decency.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The justice minister again refused to withdraw the
					 letter. That resulted in a $50 million lawsuit by Brian Mulroney. Even the
					 former RCMP commissioner was concerned that the lawsuit would jeopardize the
					 criminal investigation. He stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>I have been very concerned about the
						  potential impact on the criminal investigation of a long and very public civil
						  process.</small></td>
</tr>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister again refused to withdraw the letter. A
					 civil suit proceeded and at the very last moment the justice minister made an
					 out of court settlement with an apology. This cost Canadian taxpayers $3.4
					 million. However the letter containing the false accusation was not withdrawn.
					 The court decision indicated that the request letter was invalid as it had
					 followed an improper process. Rather than withdraw the letter the former
					 justice minister appealed the decision.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this case may be old news but to date Canadians
					 have never been given answers. This matter has not been resolved. Nor has
					 anyone been held responsible except for RCMP Staff Sergeant Fraser Fiegenwald.
					 We have been left with the impression that Staff Sergeant Fiegenwald who
					 allegedly leaked this information to author Stevie Cameron was responsible for
					 the entire airbus scandal including the $3.4 million that this fiasco cost
					 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts as far as I understand them do not support
					 this perception. However the government did nothing to dispel it, especially
					 after Fiegenwald was conveniently allowed to retire from the force just before
					 a code of conduct proceeding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cloud hangs over the RCMP as a result of airbus and
					 all the many unanswered questions. It is negatively affecting its reputation. A
					 cloud also hangs over the Prime Minister, the former justice minister and the
					 former solicitor general as their involvement in this matter still remains
					 suspect. Although it is not too late to lift this cloud by allowing the truth
					 to be known, I am sure the government will never allow an investigation into
					 this affair.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997 a motion was brought before the standing
					 committee on justice and legal affairs. The motion originated with my party and
					 had the support of the Bloc, the NDP and the Tory members of that committee. It
					 called for an examination of the facts pertaining to airbus. Not surprisingly
					 the motion was shot down by Liberal members of that committee, particularly the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very condemning of the Liberal government when we
					 talk about airbus and it brings up the rancour of many on that committee

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, what the article is saying is that the
					 chances of that happening with this federal Liberal government are next to
					 nothing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely imperative that every member of
					 government, up to and including the Prime Minister, is subject to the laws of
					 the land. The public must be confident that the federal government is not above
					 the law. I thereby call upon the Liberal government to immediately bring in
					 legislation clearly defining the role and independence of the RCMP in law
					 enforcement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also call upon the government to properly and
					 effectively respond to the Hughes report and all of its recommendations, not
					 bury the truth as is customary for the government. Repeatedly the government
					 has, when convenient or necessary, held back or shut down inquiries. We do not
					 need to go back to all the different inquiries that it has brought these types
					 of things into and then forgotten about. We know about the blood scandal and
					 the Krever report. We know about the defence minister shutting down the Somalia
					 inquiry. We know about all the other inquiries that have come forward and that
					 the government has put a lid on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the bill we again call on the government
					 to make changes and to put some of them in the RCMP Act, not just in the
					 bill.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to talk to Bill C-35,
					 an act to amend the Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act. My
					 distinguished colleague, the hon. member for Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough,
					 has covered much of the law enforcement aspects of the bill and the member for
					 Saanich--Gulf Islands has addressed the international trade issues on behalf of
					 the opposition coalition. I will, relatively briefly, bring up a few issues
					 that are of concern to me.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, some people refer to this as a housekeeping
					 bill. I have a hard time accepting it as a housekeeping bill. This would affect
					 a lot of different aspects of the way we do things, who does what, who is
					 allowed to do what, the actions of the RCMP and so on. Although it would really
					 correct or update our domestic laws to meet our international commitments, it
					 does define a new or a more explicit role for the RCMP and in that way I find
					 that it is a little more than just housekeeping.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I understand the philosophy and the purpose of
					 the bill, I think it would create a double standard. It is a slippery slope
					 that the government is getting on, it seems to me, where it would be
					 establishing two sets of rules. It is saying that Canadians would be subject to
					 the law of the land but foreigners often would not. It would expand that level
					 of immunity and quite dramatically extend who would qualify for the immunity.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the bill, new organizations and new groups that
					 are not clearly defined would qualify for immunity from certain aspects of our
					 laws. In the other bill we have before us, the terrorism bill, Bill C-36, I
					 notice a line which states that foreigners might not necessarily have to follow
					 the rules of the firearms control act. I find this a little strange because
					 Canadians obviously have to abide by these laws. It seems like the government
					 is going from one bill to another and establishing a dangerous precedent, so we
					 would have one set of rules for Canadians and another set for many foreigners.
					 This would go far beyond what we have done before in allowing different groups
					 and organizations to be recognized for these benefits.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern is that the government had an
					 opportunity here to address the issue of foreign diplomats who commit crimes or
					 offences while under the influence. We are all very much aware of the awful
					 tragedy that happened in Ottawa when a Russian diplomat ran over two
					 pedestrians, killing one and severely injuring the other. Nothing has happened
					 about that. There has been no accountability. This person had a long record of
					 alcohol offences. Nothing was done to prevent the accident and nothing has been
					 done to hold this person accountable. He was whisked away to Russia very
					 quickly. When our government demanded an investigation and accountability, the
					 Russians said if we wanted that we would have to pay them to send their
					 investigators from Russia to Canada to investigate it. I did not see a lot of
					 commitment on behalf of that foreign government to address this concern that
					 outraged many Canadians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be a long time before we have another
					 opportunity to address these issues. The bill could have done that but it
					 definitely does not. It does not address any of those issues that raised a lot
					 of concerns. It just seems so unfair. People were outraged about the accident.
					 Again, the bill, which reorganizes the Foreign Missions and International
					 Organizations Act, could have dealt with that but did not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly Canada has to encourage organizations to come
					 to Canada to have their meetings, like the G-8, APEC and so on, and perhaps
					 some of the immunity aspects have to be extended to them. Previously these
					 immunities have been extended only to organizations and nations with which we
					 have treaties, not just organizations that are non-structured or mobile and
					 move around. This makes me wonder what other organizations would qualify for
					 this immunity from taxes and our laws and who could actually commit crimes and
					 not be held accountable. It is just a little scary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that we have to be in a position to attract
					 these organizations. We are a well respected country and an appealing country
					 for these types of meetings, being relatively safe and secure. We have to be
					 able to provide the amenities and competitive immunities.</p>


	<A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1530)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it seems to me that the bill goes a little too
					 far and is not defined enough on who could qualify for these issues. For
					 instance, it is not clear about interparliamentary meetings and things like
					 that. Under the bill would all these members be immune from criminal
					 prosecution or taxation et cetera?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the bill would change the process for
					 allowing someone with a criminal record to come to Canada. Currently the
					 minister has to provide a minister's permit to allow a person who has a
					 criminal record to come to Canada. The outstanding example of this is Nelson
					 Mandela. Not one of us in the House, I think, would ever question Nelson
					 Mandela's right and privilege to come to Canada, speak with us and meet with us
					 in parliament, but he has a criminal record and he required a minister's permit
					 to allow him to come here. That would no longer be necessary because the permit
					 would be issued under the Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act
					 and would no longer require the minister's permit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another part of the bill that was dealt with by the
					 hon. member for Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough was the RCMP aspect. It is a
					 very important aspect because it very clearly defines who would be responsible
					 when international guests are here. Many people in Canada were outraged about
					 the violence and protests during recent meetings in Vancouver and Quebec. There
					 always was confusion about the chain of command, about who ordered the police
					 to do what and when, whether it was political, RCMP, local or provincial police
					 or what. The bill would correct that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would remove that question and would allow a lot of
					 us to have a little more peace of mind when we are inviting meetings to Canada.
					 I hope it would help us and help them if there would be just one police
					 department involved with the protests. We hope they would better understand the
					 rights of protestors to protest and demonstrate. They do have a right to
					 protest and demonstrate, but with the confusion over who was in control of the
					 meetings and who was responsible for policing and law enforcement, I think
					 things happened at the meetings that should never have happened. I believe
					 having one group in charge would be a positive move. The huge report on APEC
					 pointed out the need for clear parameters in order for the RCMP to be able to
					 police these meetings without having to answer to political bosses, provincial
					 police forces and so on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a very positive step and I hope the RCMP
					 will take advantage of the opportunity to better understand how people can be
					 allowed to protest and demonstrate legitimately without encouraging violence or
					 demonstrations that turn into anything other than demonstrations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation appears to cover three general types of
					 international organizations. There are international organizations originating
					 by treaty, for instance, NATO and the International Civil Aviation Organization
					 in Montreal. They are currently covered under the immunity, which would be
					 extended to a second category, the new international organizations with
					 headquarters in Canada, like the IOC, the environmental secretariat and
					 different NAFTA bodies, which are growing steadily.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third one is stand alone organizations that move
					 from country to country, like APEC and the G-8. I am not satisfied nor am I
					 comfortable with how that is defined and what groups could be included. Could
					 groups involved with the chambers of commerce and things like that come under
					 that umbrella of immunity? We are anxious to get the bill to committee to
					 analyze it and see if there are extended immunity rights that were never meant
					 to be part of the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that our country should be in a
					 position to play host to these organizations. I think Canada is an attractive
					 destination for them. Recently we moved the meeting of finance ministers to
					 Canada because it could not be held in India. That is just an indication of
					 what we have to offer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wind up, I am concerned about the double standards
					 between Canadians and non-Canadians. The bill would extend immunity and
					 taxation exemptions to a number of groups. It seems to ring a bell to me with
					 extending the immunity or exemption from the firearms control act to
					 non-Canadians whereas Canadians have to follow those rules. We need more
					 clarification.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the upside, the bill ensures that Canadian diplomats
					 receive the same privileges and immunities that their representatives in Canada
					 receive when our diplomats are in foreign countries. It has an enforcement
					 clause and that is a good aspect in it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support both the purpose and philosophy but we hope
					 there will be amendments that deal with some of the concerns which I and my
					 colleagues have raised throughout this debate.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will ask him one question about Bill C-37, that being

					 bill or is there more that could be done in that particular area?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, first, I will make it clear that I do not
					 sing at all. I appreciate the comment, but it is an all party effort, with
					 members of all parties attempting to bring the Israeli and Palestinian members
					 of parliament to Canada to meet with Canadians. It has already been a rewarding
					 experience because for eight months Israelis, Palestinians and Canadians have
					 worked together. We have not accomplished the goal yet, but we have already
					 made progress.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the question of law enforcement, I am
					 confident that the clarification of the RCMP as the law enforcement agency
					 responsible for enforcement in this situation will ensure a much better
					 reaction and law enforcement situation. Plus, if we have a group of RCMP
					 specialists in this type of field who specialize in the management of these
					 international events, they can understand and perhaps use their experience to
					 improve the process so that protesters can protest and demonstrators can
					 demonstrate without violence, without damage and without the awful
					 circumstances involved in recent events.</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I too will attest to the hon. member for
					 Colchester--Cumberland's hard-working approach to all that he does in the House
					 of Commons. In that regard, he reflects of course the hard-working people of
					 his province and my native province.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, I thank him for the comments he has made
					 outlining the strengths of the bill to amend the Foreign Missions and
					 International Organizations Act. However, having delivered the good news to the
					 hon. member, I was somewhat taken back when he indicated that he did not
					 believe a thorough investigation has followed the tragic events regarding Mr.
					 Knyazev's departure from the country and what led to it. I assure the House
					 that we have been doing everything possible to assure that Mr. Knyazev is
					 investigated and brought to justice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, we have worked closely through the
					 mutual legal assistance program with the Russian authorities. They have now
					 completed their investigation and, in accordance with Russian law,
					 investigators must now review their report with the victim and her family. This
					 is consistent with their approach.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have from the outset worked very hard to make sure
					 that everything was appropriate, that this was a very thorough investigation,
					 and although it has been extended, there is no concern whatsoever that any
					 deadlines will be missed in that regard. I do feel it necessary and incumbent

	My empirical data is very simple, Mr. Speaker. There
					 have been no charges laid and the Russians have not co-operated in the way they
					 should have. The big one for me was, they said that they would only send
					 Russian investigators to Canada if Canada paid. That does not show much of a
					 commitment on behalf of the Russians to see that justice is done. Justice in
					 this case will only be done if we pay for it even though the charges are
					 against Russians not against Canadians. The Russians should pay for
					 this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am not arguing that the government did not
					 do what it could within the parameters that were available. The parameters
					 should change, and they could have been changed under this bill, to give more

					 them.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this was a series of meetings proposed to
					 bring Israeli members of the Knesset and Palestinian members of the legislative
					 assembly to meet with Canadian parliamentarians. It was actually scheduled to
					 take place last Monday but because of a change in schedules and the volatility
					 of the situation, we had to delay it for a short time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am convinced that both sides are still committed to
					 do this. As late as this morning, I talked to Israeli and Palestinian
					 authorities and they are both still committed to come. It will be very
					 beneficial for all of us if they can.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the magic is that already the Israelis, the
					 Palestinians and the Canadians have worked together. We have proven we can work
					 together and make accomplishments, even if it is just a small accomplishment. I
					 am very optimistic that if we get another chance to enhance this, we will even
					 do better.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I also want to congratulate my friend, the
					 member for Cumberland--Colchester, on his efforts in bringing together the
					 Israelis and the Palestinians. As he probably knows, he has taken on a
					 Herculean task. Nevertheless, every effort helps and at some point will be able
					 to break the camel's back or one more straw will destroy the enmity between the
					 Israelis and the Palestinians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my pleasure to speak to Bill C-35. I want to
					 continue down the same path that my friend from Crowfoot started down. Not long
					 ago he gave an excellent speech in this place about some of the concerns that
					 we have about the separation between the people who enforce the law, the RCMP,
					 and the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is a real embarrassment facing the
					 government, if it had the opportunity, the temptation would be to use the RCMP
					 or any police force to try and cover up that embarrassment. I will not suggest
					 that this government is prepared to do that, but there have been concerns in
					 the past and we all know that. I am speaking of the APEC affair or the airbus
					 affair of which my friend spoke. There was enough evidence in the APEC affair
					 to warrant our concern about that possibility. In the airbus affair, we saw
					 evidence that the government did what it could to pursue a former prime
					 minister to the point where it cost Canadian taxpayers $3.4 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada we have taken our freedoms for granted. For a
					 long time we have lived in relative peace. We have never really been in a
					 situation, not since Confederation, where our personal liberties have been
					 seriously threatened. There have been times when there have been bumps along
					 the road and at various points Canada has entered into great conflicts.
					 Canadians have always valued their freedom, but unless they are threatened,
					 after a period of time people tend to take their freedom for
					 granted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the greatest innovations of modern times is the
					 idea of limited government. It is important to remember that for a long time in
					 history the normal course of events was for the monarchy, or the government or
					 the church to have all the power while individuals had none. Over the last 800
					 or 900 years we have seen that change. We have seen more and more rights
					 accumulate to individuals. We should value those rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As somebody once said that government is not reasoned.
					 It is not eloquence. It is force. Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a
					 fearsome master. I believe that is right. That is founded on what we know from
					 history. Governments at various times have intervened in the ability of
					 individuals to pursue their lives as they wished.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any time a piece of legislation comes along that
					 suggests that more power should accumulate to the government, in this case via
					 the RCMP, we should be concerned. We should watch and make sure that we are not
					 giving away freedoms frivolously or without going trough them to ensure that
					 there is not some other way that we can deal with this. I submit that there is
					 a different way that we can deal with this. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that legislators in general would be
					 happy to see would be a government that recognized there was concern about its
					 connection to the RCMP and security forces and that it would take some steps to
					 ensure that there was, on the one hand, oversight, but on the other hand,
					 eliminate some of the possible ways that, in this case, the Prime Minister's
					 Office could interfere via security forces to try to cover up some kind of an
					 embarrassment. There are ways to do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way would be to involve this place, through our
					 committees, to ensure that there would be some kind of an oversight capacity.
					 Some people have suggested that we could set up our own committee to
					 specifically deal with those types of things. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it would be a subcommittee of the justice
					 committee. It is a good idea to have some committee empowered to ensure that
					 our security forces are not politically interfered with in some way. That is a
					 critical point because at this point we almost leave it solely to the
					 discretion of the ministers in charge as to whether or not they can get
					 involved in some way. We really count on their good will.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that every day it be challenged in
					 some way, but there are times when governments could be tempted to intervene
					 and in so doing start to limit the freedoms of individuals. At a time of crisis
					 we need to be aware particularly of that possibility. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possible option would be to set up a subcommittee
					 or committee to have oversight to ensure that if some of these issues arise we
					 have a way to look at them and deal with them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard it said in this place by the justice minister
					 today that there were concerns at this time about whether or not the government
					 would interfere in the rights of individuals, or something like that. There
					 have been many times when the government has interfered with the rights of
					 individuals in Canada. I could point to Bill C-68 and suggest that the
					 government absolutely and completely interfered with the rights of individuals
					 when it brought in that legislation. It completely interferes with our right to
					 private property.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preceding Bill C-68, and I believe as a part of it, the
					 government through order in council confiscated people's legally obtained
					 firearms without compensation. That is completely contrary to the idea of
					 property rights and the basic freedoms we have established over a long period
					 of time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people believe our basic freedoms were only
					 defined in 1981 with the charter of rights. That is completely wrong. We had
					 hundreds of years of common law tradition before then which really laid down
					 the ground rules for our basic freedoms. Mr. Diefenbaker brought in a bill of
					 rights which put those rights down on paper. I argue that the government
					 violated those rights when it brought in Bill C-68 and started to confiscate
					 firearms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I argue that when it comes to endangered species
					 legislation the government is on the cusp of interfering with our most basic
					 property rights, again because it is not prepared to offer full compensation
					 for land that is taken out of production in the hope it can somehow protect an
					 endangered species. We have no problem with endangered species legislation, but
					 we believe the government should ensure that the basic rights of people are
					 protected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no more fundamental right than property
					 rights. Some people may question that, but I argue that every right is a
					 property right. My friend from Hamilton nods his head, but every right is a
					 property right. In fact there is only one right and it is the property right:
					 the right to the security of ourselves, the right to control our actions, the
					 right to acquire things. There is but one right and that is a property right in
					 oneself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When abolitionists were trying to get rid of slavery
					 they used to call it man stealing because people were stealing someone else's
					 person. I argue there is but one right and every other right flows from it: the
					 right to property. The first right we have is the security of our own person.
					 The right to freedom of speech flows from that. The right to freedom of
					 association and the right to keep what we have produced with our hands and our
					 minds all flow from the same source: the right to private property in
					 ourselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we set down laws at a time when we are concerned
					 about having security of our person breached by forces outside our borders, we
					 have to be careful that we do not at the same time breach them by empowering
					 our government to do too much. That is my primary concern with Bill C-35 and
					 actually with Bill C-36 as well, while we are talking about bills presently
					 before the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other examples of how government has breached
					 our rights even since I have been a member of parliament.</p>

					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every piece of legislation that comes through this
					 place has to be screened at some point, and I hope justice department lawyers
					 do it, to determine whether or not it is in some violation of our fundamental
					 rights. I can say nothing more than that to clarify it for the hon. member.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summary of the bill talks about empowering the
					 RCMP, giving the RCMP new powers which some people are concerned may kick the
					 door open for political interference by the RCMP in matters that might
					 embarrass the government. That is really the point I am trying to make. I am
					 simply saying that there are precedents for governments violating our rights.
					 One of the rights that have been violated, I would argue again, is a property
					 right. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andy McMechan, a Manitoba farmer, was put in chains and
					 cast into prison for the great crime of selling his own wheat, a violation of
					 his most basic right to property. It was absolutely ridiculous. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is my response to my friend across the way who was
					 wondering whether or not the legislation has any connection at all to the idea
					 of basic rights. I argue that of course it does.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I go beyond that and touch on something else which my
					 friend from Crowfoot touched on. He is here right now. He gave a great speech
					 when he talked about some of these different things. I simply point out that

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the freedom to protest takes many forms.
					 The freedom to protest is limited like every other freedom. Every freedom has a
					 reasonable limit. When protesters in Quebec City started to tear down fences
					 and break windows, they should have been arrested and charged. They should have
					 been convicted and sentenced, if in fact they were guilty of those crimes. I
					 want to make that very clear. No freedom is unlimited. There are reasonable
					 limits to all of them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of introducing new limits on freedom, what
					 should happen is that security forces of various kinds should be given enough
					 resources to enforce the laws that presently exist. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not need more and more laws that restrict our
					 freedoms. We need adequate resources to enforce the ones we have. We made that
					 argument in the past about Bill C-68 and other pieces of legislation. No law by
					 itself will stop people from doing things if they have criminal intent. What
					 will stop criminals is more police on the beat, more security and more
					 intelligence gathering. All those things can stop criminals but just passing
					 laws does nothing in and of itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are confronted with something like the APEC
					 protest or the Quebec City protest, the issue is getting more police out there
					 to ensure that people can protest peacefully and have their say about things,
					 but the moment they step over the line, trespass on property or vandalize, that
					 is when the police should step in and do their job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the best examples of how well that can work is
					 in New York City pre-September 11. Members will remember that when Rudolph
					 Giuliani was elected as the mayor of New York City quite a while ago it was in
					 a state of turmoil because there was a tremendous amount of crime. Mr. Giuliani
					 said that if he were elected he would hire more police and put more cops on the
					 beat. He did that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They started charging people for crimes already on the
					 books. Graffiti artists were arrested and charged. They cracked down on crime.
					 They cracked down on those who were harassing people on the street. They
					 cracked down on petty vandalism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, not only did they deal with petty crime
					 but the violent crime rate dropped like a stone. That is the point. Making new
					 laws will not fix everything, but if police are on the beat to enforce the laws
					 it makes a huge difference. We know that empirically. Common sense tells us
					 that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time in my own community we were battling to
					 get a proper number of RCMP officers. The federal government had cut back
					 funding to the RCMP. We had a situation where a lot of new people had come to
					 town and the crime rate went up. Since we brought more police into the
					 community my understanding is that things have stabilized. I do not know that
					 crime is going down, but it certainly is not rising the way it was previously.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are grateful the government is finally starting to
					 put a bit more money into justice after listening to the Canadian Alliance. I
					 guess it started to realize that perhaps it is not such a bad investment after
					 all to put money into these things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is simple. We should not assume that by
					 creating new laws, and perhaps even violating some of the fundamental freedoms
					 in which we believe so strongly, somehow some of the problems with crime will
					 end. It will not happen. We need reinforcement. I conclude by saying that the
					 government's first role has to be the security of the liberty of people.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact a lot of people would argue that the security
					 of people's liberties should be the government's overwhelming and overriding
					 role. What does that mean? It does not just mean securing their personal
					 safety, as critical as that is, it also means securing all their fundamental
					 rights, including the right not to have their lives interfered with by their
					 own government. </p>

					 about threats from outside the country, we should also be alive to the danger

	Mr. Speaker, I think sometimes on this side of the

					 deplore the effect special interest groups have on government policy and that
					 kind of thing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having listened to the member for Medicine Hat speak
					 just now, I realize that despite these, shall we say, conservative tendencies,
					 I belong on this side and not that side because the member for Medicine Hat
					 brought in the concept of property rights and individual rights versus
					 collective rights. If something defines me on this side, and I think defines
					 the Bloc Quebecois, the NDP and the Conservatives as well, it is the idea that
					 collective rights have to take priority over individual rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Medicine Hat is actually echoing a
					 philosophy that exists in the United States, indeed, it is actually written in
					 the constitution of both the state and the federal constitution in the United
					 States. It is the idea that an individual has vested rights in property against
					 every other influence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side of the House, and I think some
					 opposition members, would think that the collective good actually transcends
					 the individual's right to his or her own personal advantage. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned the species at risk legislation in which
					 property rights may be in collision with the need to preserve species.

	Mr. Speaker, I am not sure where my friend was going.
					 Let me simply say that there have been many times, and I did not touch on all

					 collective. Let me point to one that may resonate more with the
					 member.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second world war we rounded up Japanese
					 Canadians, took their property away and sent them to internment camps for the
					 good of the collective. My point is that everybody should have a personal right
					 to the security of their person no matter what, as long as they do not violate
					 the equal rights of every other person to have that same security and freedom.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to argue that when we see things like what
					 happened during the second world war when those people were rounded up, that
					 was a violation of individual rights because of collective rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make the point that when it comes to
					 endangered species, there would be no collision between private property rights
					 and the endangered species legislation if the government would simply
					 compensate people for taking away their property. That is all we are
					 asking.</p>

					 reference to this mantra of free speech or any reference at all to the ability

					 perhaps, has come to appreciate this a great deal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke about the possible interference within
					 government agencies, particularly the RCMP. We see that time and time again,
					 even on a bill as important as the new anti-terrorism bill, Bill C-36, where at
					 the outset of the bill going to committee, both here in the House and in that
					 other place, the Prime Minister made comments from outside the country as to
					 the outcome of the deliberations with respect in this instance to the sunset
					 clause.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend also alluded to government becoming too large
					 and interfering,particularly in property rights. I am reminded of an expression
					 I heard that any government that is large enough to give us everything we want
					 is certainly large enough to take everything we have. I think that expression
					 ran through his speech as well. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the member expand further on this concept of
					 parliamentary ability to do its work? The government and the Prime Minister, in
					 particular, through his office and through his reach, which we have seen at
					 APEC where Jean Carle was doing his bidding and through the Shawinigan affair
					 where the BDC was called upon to make certain interventions, all of that is
					 very indicative of a government that does not respect parliamentary democracy.
					 I would encourage my friend to comment further.</p>

					 said that our system of government had evolved into a form of elected
					 dictatorship and that cabinet had become nothing more than a focus group. I am
					 concerned that there be a separation between the powers of the police and the
					 state, especially given the comments made by a very respected person in this
					 town and one whose opinion I respect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just wonder whether we should not really be focused
					 on separating the power between the dictatorship and the police force and make
					 sure they work in an arm's length relationship.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask my colleague from Medicine Hat if he has
					 any such concerns.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very concerned about the ability of

					 Liberal members are just as frustrated about this as we are. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have talked privately with many Liberal members. When
					 we go to committee to sit down and talk about making changes to bills, I often
					 see a parliamentary secretary hovering like a hawk, waiting for any sign that
					 there might be some deviation from the government line on a piece of
					 legislation, and if there is, members are brought to heel very quickly. That is
					 unfortunate. We have competent people on all sides of the House who should be
					 allowed to do their job, which is to represent their constituents and to use
					 their talents and skills wisely.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will, upon conclusion of my remarks,
					 attempt to address some of the concerns that have been raised.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I will not discuss the price of eggs in
					 China.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think basically that is the kind of thing that has
					 been brought into the House today. I am disappointed when I hear speakers
					 complain as they do about their perception of parliament not being relevant and
					 then go on to list anything but what we are discussing today, which is Bill
					 C-35, an act to amend the Foreign Missions and International Organizations
					 Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would assure the House that as a Liberal member I am
					 quite able to discuss and put forward my frustrations, such as they may be, and
					 have never had need for the opposition parties to convey my frustrations. I
					 have always been able to do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move to the topic at hand, which is Bill C-35, an
					 act to amend the Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act, I am
					 pleased to perhaps bring a focus to the discussion today that not only are we
					 amending an act but we are doing it at a time and within the ambience of the
					 very tragic events in the United States, which reminded us that threats to
					 public safety are of a global concern, that no system is infallible and that no
					 country is immune.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our commitment is to protect persons who attend
					 international meetings in Canada. That is our focus and it is very clear. It is
					 incumbent upon us, when we host any kind of meetings of organizations, to have
					 the legislative power and authority to ensure the safety of everyone involved.
					 As was mentioned, Canada is obligated to do so under various international
					 conventions. The amendments that we brought forward clarify our ability to
					 fulfill that obligation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2002, Canada will be hosting the G-8 summit in
					 Kananaskis, Alberta. This will be the first meeting of world leaders since the
					 horrendous acts of September 11. In preparing for this event, we will need to
					 take all necessary steps to protect our international visitors and to ensure
					 the meeting can take place safely.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments provide clear statutory authority to
					 support security measures and to ensure public safety and the safety of foreign
					 delegations at international meetings hosted in Canada such as the G-8
					 summit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments also help us to respond with greater
					 certainty to continuing and growing threats and to public safety in a world
					 that has so remarkably and fundamentally changed since September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the statutory authority to provide security mean
					 that the police will have broader powers? Absolutely not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to just digress from the notes that I had
					 planned. I think there is a failure on the part of some members to understand
					 that the federal government, in this situation, is attempting to umbrella two
					 systems. One is the common law which we develop according to precedent. The law
					 is growing and very much, as Thomas Aquinas said, a living thing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the province of Quebec has the code
					 civile, the Napoleonic code. Instead of developing in a similar way as the
					 common law, the Napoleonic code has all of what one wants contained in a
					 statute written down and codified. It is incumbent on the federal government
					 then to create legislation that recognizes and allows both systems to function
					 within our ambit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I think is causing some concern here with regard
					 to police powers is that all the authority has been very much in place within
					 the ambit of common law. What these amendments attempt to do is clarify and
					 codify in a manner that allows for no confusion. What is happening is that the
					 confusion is occurring on the other side of the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police have always had the authority to take
					 whatever necessary and reasonable security measures were required to protect
					 internationally protected persons and to preserve the peace in order for the
					 important business of these international events to proceed. These amendments
					 would simply clarify in statute police powers that are already in
					 place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also in line with legislation adopted by other
					 countries, such as Australia and New Zealand which have gone ahead and
					 clarified police powers in similar circumstances, just as we are going to
					 contend with within these amendments. This is the prudent thing to do given the
					 changing nature of international meetings and evolving challenges to global
					 security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In traditional diplomatic situations in the past,
					 frequently the dialogue and negotiations occurred on a bilateral basis.
					 Therefore, the immunities and all of what was set up within the Vienna
					 convention were aimed to apply to what was the traditional method of conducting
					 diplomacy, which was in a bilateral setting. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, today, as we have evolved more and more, a
					 great deal of our negotiations and our protocols are an end result of
					 multilateral negotiations and rather than just occasional multilateral
					 negotiations, they occur within the ambit of permanent international
					 organizations that continue on a weekly-monthly basis, many of which have
					 headquarters in Montreal and in other parts of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, the amendments would clarify three
					 things:</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the RCMP's role for assuming primary
					 responsibility to ensure security for the proper functioning of an
					 international conference attended by internationally protected
					 persons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the RCMP's authority to take security measures,
					 such as controlling, limiting or prohibiting access to an area in a manner that
					 is reasonable under the circumstances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, they clarify the fact that these statutory
					 police powers do not affect the powers that the RCMP and other provincial and
					 municipal police forces otherwise have under common law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight to the House the tremendous
					 co-operation that now takes place between the RCMP and its provincial and
					 municipal counterparts to ensure the safe and secure running of these
					 events.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security for the summit of the Americas in Quebec
					 City, for example, was the largest operation of its kind in recent Canadian
					 history. It involved a partnership of over 3,600 RCMP members, 2,700 members of
					 the Sûreté du Québec and 500 members of the Quebec City and Ste-Foy municipal
					 police forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure the House and Canadians that the RCMP
					 will continue to work with its many international, federal, provincial and
					 municipal partners to provide the most appropriate and effective security
					 arrangements for all federally hosted international meetings much as it did in
					 Quebec City.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threat that faces us in the aftermath of September
					 11 will not be easily removed. Our actions will be ruled by resolve. If laws
					 need to be improved they will be. If security has to be increased it will be.
					 However our actions will continue to be driven by the need to safeguard the
					 values that we cherish, the values of hope, freedom and tolerance to the
					 world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,
					 everyone has the fundamental freedoms of, among others, assembly, expression
					 and association.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments balance the government's need to
					 ensure public safety and the need to protect an individual's right to
					 demonstrate, as has been mentioned, openly, publicly but in a safe setting.
					 They are in no way intended to hinder peaceful protest. Any security measures
					 taken by the police will still need to satisfy charter requirements: that they
					 are necessary, reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments will help us to respond with greater
					 certainty to a changed world. They will ensure public safety and the safety of
					 our visitors at international meetings hosted by Canada. They will build on the
					 success of partnership that police forces across jurisdictions have
					 demonstrated at past international events. They will also protect the cherished
					 values and freedoms that define what is meant by being a Canadian.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly hope that some of the confusion that has
					 been exhibited in speeches here and at the first reading have been addressed by
					 my remarks. If not, I would be pleased to answer any questions that my
					 colleagues may wish to ask.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the parliamentary secretary two questions,
					 one to do with security and one to do with international organizations.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is an amendment with respect to security
					 and the powers of our security organizations. Does this mean that until now
					 police have been unauthorized to protect people who attend high level
					 international meetings in Canada? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, why at this time do we need to extend
					 diplomatic immunities to international organizations not established by treaty?
					 </p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from
					 Peterborough for his questions. With regard to the security question I would
					 assure the member that police can provide such protection under common law, as
					 was mentioned earlier. However the amendment hopes to clarify that power. To
					 assuage some of the concerns across the way, clarification frequently leads to
					 a delineation that is meant to make clear that police have a certain authority
					 beyond which they cannot go. They cannot extend it to levels that would concern
					 people. Clarification frequently means exactly that. That is all we are hoping
					 to attain by moving out of the realm of common law and into a codification of
					 that power.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question, a very good one, was with regard
					 to international organizations that have not been established by treaty. This
					 allows us to grant immunities and privileges by order. It is not an automatic
					 trigger. It requires an order to be passed to organizations and
					 conferences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, the OSCE, the Organization for Security
					 and Co-operation in Europe, and the G-8 are organizations that meet frequently
					 in different places and have not been established by treaty. It almost goes
					 without saying, but I guess we now need to say it in an amendment, that people
					 who attend the OSCE, G-8 or similar bodies must have the same immunities and
					 privileges as those who attend organizations set up within the ambit of a
					 treaty. Staying with the G-8, I suppose it is timely to have this clarified and
					 in place.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question I originally raised
					 on May 30 which was five months ago. At the time the distinguished
					 parliamentary secretary said he would be more than happy to take my question
					 under advisement and get back to me at an early time. It is now five months
					 later and at my initiative we are back to discuss the issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appropriate that we discuss the issue now
					 considering the things that are happening and the fact that the Prime Minister
					 has suggested he will send peacekeepers to Afghanistan to deal with the
					 aftermath of the military action when it ends. The question was raised today in
					 the House as to where the additional soldiers would come from, where the money
					 would come from and which peacekeeping efforts would be reduced to deal with
					 this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However it is more important that the government send a
					 message that it will play a part in establishing a transitional government in
					 Afghanistan and that it fight hard to ensure the United Nations plays a key
					 role in Afghanistan after the military action ends. If the United States or any
					 other country sets up a puppet government in Afghanistan it will be a disaster
					 the rest of the world will pay for a long time. It must be a United Nations
					 initiative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the government agree? Will it do everything it can
					 to ensure Canada plays a key role in establishing a transitional government
					 through the United Nations that recognizes and represents all facets of the
					 population in Afghanistan? Can the parliamentary secretary tell members whether
					 the government is prepared to play a role through the United
					 Nations?</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the question the member asked has
					 absolutely nothing to do with the question he asked on May 30. For your
					 information, Mr. Speaker, during question period he asked about the
					 cancellation and reissuing by DND of the tender for the redeployment of
					 vehicles and equipment from Eritrea. That is the question he asked. I do not
					 know what that has to do with Afghanistan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point in time Canada has not been asked by the
					 United Nations and the United Nations has not made up its mind as to whether it
					 is going to be involved in peacekeeping, and if peacekeeping is going to be
					 involved in Afghanistan. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the member should come back in six months and
					 ask the same question again. He may actually get an answer. However, I will
					 comment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the continuing interest of the member for
					 Cumberland--Colchester in the military and the way it operates and the economy
					 of scale that the military operates in. This ensures that the government has an
					 opportunity to reply to some of the concerns raised by Canadians as to whether
					 the military is combat capable, whether it is able to take part in the long
					 term planning that is ahead of us and whether the enhancement of global
					 deployablity is still of great concern. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the member's question. His question came
					 from the incident with the GTS <i>Katie </i> in which a shipping firm was not
					 being paid by the agent that had been contracted. It protested and Canadian
					 equipment, containerized equipment mostly, was held up in high seas and not
					 allowed to enter port. That created a situation. The Government of Canada,
					 through the Minister of National Defence, had decided that the use of
					 commercial carriers to move equipment and personnel, which has been a common
					 practice among Canada's allies for many years for non-combative services, eases
					 the pressure on military personnel who would otherwise have to provide these
					 services. On the subject of sealift in particular some valuable lessons were
					 learned from the GTS <i>Katie</i> incident. A number of steps have been taken
					 to strengthen the DND sealift contracting operations and options to meet the
					 transportation requirements of the Canadian forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After consulting with the Department of Justice, legal
					 counsel, the shipping industry and a number of NATO allies, DND decided to try
					 an industry best practice approach of chartering its maritime transportation
					 requirements directly with shipowners. This eliminates contracting
					 intermediaries and allows for the solicitation of bids directly from shipowners
					 through a broker. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The redeployment of Canadian forces equipment from
					 Eritrea this past summer offered an excellent opportunity to charter by this
					 means. It is a very successful operation and one now that we can be very proud
					 of. It provides the economy of scale, the efficiency that all of our allies use

					 (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore, NDP):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, on September 18 I asked the Minister of
					 Transport quite bluntly if the government would assume full control of
					 pre-board flight screening inside the Canadian borders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now customs agents receive an entire year of
					 training before they are put on the job by themselves. Pre-board flight
					 screeners, these officers who check the luggage and hand baggage before people
					 board the aircraft, receive 20 hours of training. Even after the terrible
					 events of September 11, that has still not changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The airlines, especially Air Canada, have been asking
					 the government to assume full cost, full control and full training for
					 pre-boarding screening officers throughout the country. In fact, many members
					 of parliament, when they leave the Ottawa airport, see a big sign at the
					 pre-check screening board which says “Airport security is an airline
					 responsibility”. That is simply nonsense. It has to stop.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada must assume full cost and full
					 control of airport pre-screening at airports in Canada, that includes small and
					 major airports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give the government credit. After September 11,
					 and long before that, as a former airline employee, I asked the government many
					 times to ensure that identification checks were done on people prior to the
					 boarding of a flight. That I must say is now being done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another dangerous aspect of airport screening
					 that is not being done. Nothing is being done to stop terrorists, who have no
					 concern for their own lives, from putting something in their suitcase, checking
					 it in and having it go onboard the aircraft in the underbelly. They then can
					 sit up top and an hour later in the flight a disaster can strike.That can still
					 happen today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not mean to frighten airline passengers or people
					 willing to take flights in the future, but there is no x-ray of baggage or
					 cargo going onboard airplanes. We have it internationally but not
					 domestically.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countries in Europe are doing it now and I encourage
					 the government to move with as much speed as possible to x-ray all baggage and
					 cargo that go on aircraft to ensure safety and to give back the confidence that
					 the travelling public deserves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We encourage the government on two points. First,
					 assume full control of security at all airports in the country, including the
					 cost, the training and employment of these people. The ones who are there now
					 do a good job, but they simply do not get the income nor the training to do
					 their job post-September 11. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, and I cannot reiterate this enough. it is
					 imperative that the government assume control of the x-ray of all baggage and
					 cargo which goes on board an aircraft. If it does that, it will indeed give the
					 travelling public the confidence it needs.</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Health, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to respond to the
					 question raised by the hon. member on September 18, 2001, on airline
					 safety.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to begin by providing assurances that the
					 safety and security of travellers have always been and will continue to be the
					 prime concern of Transport Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the events of September 11, 2001, and in the
					 days that followed, the situation was constantly being closely monitored and
					 measures were reviewed to provide for the resumption of air travel.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures and the other components of the aviation
					 safety system, including the requirements that pertain to screening officers,
					 are continuously being re-examined.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has already responded to the airline
					 industry's concerns by announcing on October 2 its intention to compensate the
					 airlines affected. This compensation is to cover losses resulting from the
					 closure of air space in the days that followed the September 11
					 tragedy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is establishing high standards for
					 screening activities. It requires screening officers be trained to certain
					 standards and that they act immediately to correct anything that hinders
					 screening operations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screening officers assigned to preboarding must follow
					 a rigorous program of training, which includes both theoretical and practical
					 training, before they are certified. The law requires them to take refresher
					 courses every two years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 11, the Minister of Transport, in a series
					 of important announcements on security measures, indicated that he would be
					 investing $55.7 million in the purchase of sophisticated explosives detection
					 equipment and high tech electronic equipment. This technological equipment will
					 be used to screen cabin and checked baggage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This announcement followed the minister's statement on
					 September 25 that Transport Canada would be purchasing explosive detection
					 equipment for priority airports in Canada. The Canadian security program
					 incorporates all of the standards of the International Civil Aviation
					 Organization and is one of the best in the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For obvious security reasons, information on the
					 implementation of the new equipment will not be released.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to provide assurances that Transport
					 Canada takes its responsibility for ensuring the safety and security of
					 travellers very seriously. Should any component of the system need to be
					 changed, Transport Canada will react quickly to ensure the necessary changes
					 are made.</p>

					 (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Canadian Alliance):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, last Wednesday I pointed out that the
					 Minister of Transport had announced the spending of $79 million on new security
					 procedures in transport, a vast majority of which was going toward highly
					 sophisticated state of the art detection screening equipment. I asked the
					 minister what airports that equipment would be going to. His response was that
					 it would go to the major airports where the highest volume of traffic
					 occurred.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a supplemental question I asked the minister what
					 good he thought it would do to put the equipment into high density airports
					 when at dozens of small airports across the country there was not even basic
					 x-ray equipment for carry on baggage. People going through those airports are
					 subject to a hand search. I am not disparaging the people who operate those
					 security checkpoints. They are not given the tools. It is very easy for them to
					 miss a hidden compartment or something else that basic x-ray equipment would
					 pick up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people board aircraft and fly into a major
					 airport, such as Vancouver or Calgary in my case, they are deposited on the
					 secure side, around the back of the sophisticated equipment which the minister
					 is spending millions of taxpayers' dollars on to no avail.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the minister how he thought it would help to
					 put in the fancy equipment and then have people fly out of small airports and
					 simply be routed around. His response as reported in <i>Hansard</i>
					 was:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should
						  know that when that is the case those people in transit are required to go
						  through security at the larger airports.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not true. Virtually every week I fly out of
					 small airports that do not have x-ray equipment. I know for an absolute fact
					 that I am deposited on the secure side. At no time ever, not once, have I been
					 re-routed through enhanced security at the larger airports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like it clarified why the minister gave such an
					 answer. Was he endeavouring to intentionally mislead members of the House, or
					 was he simply incompetent in answering a transport question?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, first of all, the safety and security of
					 our transportation system is Transport Canada's number one priority. The
					 Minister of Transport was very clear and dealt with these subjects amply during
					 oral question period and in his speeches during debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned, while it is not a part of the
					 government's general direction, without a doubt, we are prepared to study all
					 possible measures to improve airline safety. We have tried to reduce threats to
					 airline safety, both on the ground and in the air.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security in Canadian airports and customs operations
					 continue to be strengthened and we are accelerating the procurement of security
					 and explosive detection equipment. We are limiting activities in restricted
					 areas of airports, increasing the police presence in major airports,
					 heightening passenger screening, and improving measures regarding baggage.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Security and Emergency Preparedness Directorate of
					 Transport Canada is responsible for the development and implementation of
					 programs that contribute to the security of the national transportation system.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, the department is co-operating with all of
					 the relevant federal departments and organizations in Canada and with its
					 partners in the United States, including the FAA, to prevent incidents that
					 threaten the safety of our national transportation system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We constantly assess our approach and our measures to
					 provide a high degree of safety to travellers in this field that has been so
					 tragically shaken. The minister and the government have made a number of
					 announcements since September 11 on the subject of improvements to our
					 excellent safety program. He was equally clear in stating that we must not
					 discuss specific safety measures in public.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Transport and the Government of Canada
					 have announced a broad range of new measures to improve safety of operations in
					 Canada's airports. These initiatives will provide more than $69 million for new
					 equipment and related activities in Canadian airports. </p>
