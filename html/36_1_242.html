I have the honour to present, in both official languages, the 
fifth report of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources and 
Government Operations.  In accordance with its mandate under 
Standing Order 108(2), the committee has considered forest 
management practices in Canada as an international trade issue 
and has agreed to this interim report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that the committee intends to continue this 
work in the fall, having had a chance, first, to visit British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members who 
participated.  They did a terrific job.  I would also like to 
thank our witnesses, as well as our clerk, Richard Rumas, and our 
researcher, Jean-Luc Bourdages, for the excellent work they have 
done in support of the committee's work.  I emphasize that this 
is an interim report.  More work needs to be done, but our 
committee felt that the facts about Canadian forest harvesting 
practices need to known in the international marketplace, as well 
as the fact that Canada is a world leader in forest management 
practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that, Mr. Speaker, we wish you a great summer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan—King—Aurora, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have the honour to present, in both official 
languages, the 20th report of the Standing Committee on Finance, 
entitled “Productivity with a Purpose:  Improving the Standard 
of Living of Canadians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to bring to the attention of the House that this is a 
very important document which deals with a very important issue, 
that of productivity, which is a key determinant in raising the 
standard of living for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take this opportunity to thank the members of the 
committee who worked very hard throughout this session.  The 
finance committee held 193 meetings to deal with different issues 
related to finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the clerk, 
the interpreters, the researchers and every one involved in 
making sure that the committee of finance functions as well as it 
does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reiterate that the finance committee will continue to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 35(2), I will respond to the report 
presented by my friend, the chair of the finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to point out that in our supplementary report, 
which we attached to the productivity study, we expressed some 
scepticism about whether the government would be able to pursue 
the course of action laid down by my colleagues on the finance 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that there were some good recommendations in 
the report, recommendations to pursue freer trade, lower taxes 
and de-regulation.  Sadly, it looks like we were prescient 
because now we see the Prime Minister suggesting that there will 
not be any more free trade type agreements, that free trade will 
not be extended, that low taxes essentially are un-Canadian.  It 
appears that this report is dead on arrival, which is sad because 
I think many Canadians rightly expect that we should have lower 
taxes in Canada, right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, before we wrap up, I want to congratulate the chair of 
the committee and my colleagues for a productive year.  I also 
want to extend my thanks to the pages who will be leaving us 
soon.  We have certainly had a chance to get to know them and we 
appreciate the gallons and gallons of water that they have 
brought to us all over the course of year.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to introduce today in 
the House a bill to amend the Employment Insurance Act in the 
event of an employer's bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would make it possible to take into account, for the 
purpose of eligibility for employment insurance benefits, the 
hours worked by a contributor who has not been paid for the 
hours he worked for his bankrupt employer, which the employer 
obviously did not make the contributions necessary for these 
hours worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been penalized as a result of the employer's bankruptcy 
by the loss of his job and, second, by not being paid for the 
work done, the claimant is again penalized when the hours he did 
work without pay are not counted so he may receive benefits 
while he is looking for another job.

Employment Insurance Act as quickly as possible in order to 
provide a balance for workers of good faith.

the point raised by the hon. member for Saint John. While there 
is no doubt that she feels she has a grievance in relation to 
proceedings that may have occurred in the committee at some point

unaware, I know that the member, in reviewing the standing order 
under which she has moved her application, will recognize that 
the Chair has to examine it in the light of cold hard facts.  In 
this case the Chair feels that the application does not meet the 
exigencies of the standing order.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FOREIGN PUBLISHERS ADVERTISING SERVICES ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from June 9 consideration of the motion in 
relation to the amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-55, an 
act respecting the advertising services supplied by foreign 
periodical publishers, and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
although I have had an interruption of several hours and time to 
reflect on the merits of the Senate amendments and the amended 
bill, it has not changed my mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night I was puzzling over the fact whether the heritage 
minister, in her grand design and maybe in her new capacity as 
playwright once she leaves the House in the capacity of heritage 
minister, has designed the production of a play that is either a 
farce or a tragedy.  I have had time to reflect on that and it 
has to be in the category of a farce.  Nothing else would really 
fit the badly and almost comical way the government has handled 
the issue of split-run magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all about the government having picked a fight with the 
Americans on an issue that it absolutely lost.  It picked a fight 
and expended a tremendous amount of energy in an area which it 
knew it could not win.  The government thought it would have a 
lot of people rally behind it, even in its own cabinet, and that 
simply did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest this was a badly flawed bill right from the very 
beginning.  The chickens have come home to roost and now we have 
the amended version of Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a loss of credibility by Canada as a result of 
the government's actions on the world stage.  We have legitimate 
concerns.  We have legitimate problems with the Americans in 
areas where we need to fight the good fight.  Softwood lumber is 
one of those areas.  The matter of whether we are dumping cattle 
into the United States is another one.  Softwood lumber is a very 
big issue in British Columbia.  There are many of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same government, by the way, which assured Canadian 
forest companies that if they signed the softwood lumber 
agreement we would have five years of peace with the Americans. 
The government's assurances are basically a bit like a Hollywood 
movie set.  There is a false front, the nice looking hotel, with 
nothing behind it.  That is how the government handles it.  It 
tries to pretend that it is protecting Canadian interests when 
all it gives is empty rhetoric.  It goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of culture the government told us that there was a 
tremendous exemption which would protect the Canadian cultural 
industry.  The cultural industry is based on that so-called 
cultural protection, and what do we find?  It was not there but 
it keeps it going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the government is telling the cultural industry that it will 
take it to the World Trade Organization in the next round of 
negotiations and that it will give the industry a new cultural 
instrument, a new cultural agreement in the World Trade 
Organization.  If the cultural industry accepts that premise and 
builds its policies based on that, it will be disappointed once 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the only industry that has been subject to the Liberal 
government's fancy footwork in terms of pretending that it will 
protect them.  As I said softwood lumber is one example, but it 
goes beyond that.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the World Trade Organization-GATT back in 1993 in the Uruguay 
round, the government told the supply management industry that it 
would protect it and that it would not allow other countries to 
do away with article 11, which essentially was border closures or 
no access into Canada of dairy, chicken and eggs.  What did we 
get?  We lost.  We lost and we had to accept tariffs.  We still 
have very high tariffs in those industries but they will be 
coming down too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest supply management cannot believe the government 
either.  It is now telling supply management that we lost at the 
Uruguay round but, not to worry, at the new round of the World 
Trade Organization it will protect that industry.  I believe that 
assurance is worth nothing.  The government knows that cannot be 
done, so it is misleading the Canadian public and it is 
misleading those industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we regulate a cultural sector.  We do not even have a 
good definition of culture.  There is not agreement in Canada on 
what culture is.  There certainly is not an agreement on the 
Liberal side.  We know that there were different ideas by 
different ministers.  How do we regulate that?  I suggest it 
cannot be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean that culture does not deserve Canadians 
supporting that sector.  A better approach, one that is more 
enlightened, might be to promote our culture in the international 
trade forum, just like we do with any other business sector.  Let 
us promote culture at our embassies and consulates.  It deserves 
it. We know that Canadian artists deserve that promotion as well. 
That is a forum that is possible.  It is possible to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another way in which we might address the issue. There 
are problems with Canadian films getting distribution rights.  I 
suggest that we might look at international competition law or 
even Canadian competition law.  We could even go beyond that and 
into the United States where competition law might be applied and 
where there is too much concentration in the hands of one set of 
business people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are forums to be used, such as competition law, to break 
down that terrific monopoly so that it is possible for Canadians 
to distribute their own films in their own country.  There are 
things we can do but we have to be realistic.  Pretending we can 
protect them in the forums of this government and in Bill C-55 is 
simply not realistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are problems that may make Bill C-55, as amended, not even 
possible to implement.  What might they be?  On the matter of how 
much advertising revenues will be permitted for American 
publications by Canadian advertising companies there is a formula 
set in place:  12%, 15% and 18% by the end of a three year 
period.  Canadian advertising companies are set to challenge that 
content regulation because they are being restricted under the 
charter.  That is a substantial issue in itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the agreement?  If it is based on gross revenue, net 
revenue or after tax profit, who will police it?  Will we have 
another set of culture cops travelling around trying to decide 
what the revenue base should be?  That is exactly what will 
happen.  I suggest there is not common understanding, even with 
the United States, in the letters that were exchanged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do foreign publishers investing in Canada in the other section 
need to publish magazines with a substantial Canadian content or 
a majority content?  In the letters exchanged just last week we 
can see where the problem is already starting to percolate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These letters say that the United States accepts the terms of 
the agreement which state that a net benefit review by Canada of 
new investments in the magazine industry will include 
undertakings from foreign investors which result in a substantial 
level of original editorial content.  The United States is saying 
a substantial level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is Canada saying?  Canada is saying that we will use 
guidelines which call for a majority of original editorial 
content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought we had an agreement.  What kind of an agreement do we 
have when we cannot even get right if investment in Canada by 
American companies will have substantial content or majority 
content?  They are entirely different.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are sowing the seeds for the failure of this agreement.  I 
suggest the Liberal government knew that all along.  It is just 
another Hollywood movie front, the false front it is hiding 
behind, pretending that it is protecting the cultural industries. 
That is one aspect of a future problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect is that the Liberal government, in its lack of 
wisdom, will go into a policy that subsidizes Canadian cultural 
magazine publications upfront.  The Americans are asking, if that 
is the case, whether they should qualify for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have signed international treaties.  We signed the NAFTA 
agreement.  We signed the World Trade Organization-GATT agreement 
which says that we need national treatment.  It is in there. Does 
the government not realize what kinds of international agreements 
it has signed?  If the government subsidizes Canadian 
publications it will have to subsidize American publications as 
well.  How absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole concept of subsidies is wrong.  It is ironic that we 
will now subsidize American publications.  Is this not the height 
of irony? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, how long will these subsidies last?  Canada is 
going to the World Trade Organization millennium round, kicking 
off in Seattle this year, to argue against subsidies.  It will 
argue to phase out subsidies internationally.  The trade 
department is doing that and I agree 100%.  The Reform Party has 
suggested that subsidies distort the marketplace.  There is no 
place for them and in fact they are damaging sectors like 
agriculture very badly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Liberals are speaking from one side of their mouth at 
the World Trade Organization, they are designing policies to put 
the very opposite into effect in Canada.  How long will those 
subsidies stand up?  This agreement was not designed to stand up 
very long at all.  It is to get them through a critical period. 
This is a full retreat.  It is window dressing.  It is trying to 
save some face in the face of a very badly designed agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heritage minister picked a fight with the Americans and she 
lost.  The bill should never see the light of day.  That is the 
position of the Reform Party.  We will not be supporting it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am a little 
perplexed with what we are hearing from the official opposition 
which resisted Bill C-55 all the way through.  It was totally 
opposed to any form of support for our cultural industries, the 
magazine industry in particular.  All of a sudden it is crying 
that we have sacrificed this industry, which is total nonsense, 
by the way.  It is rather amusing to see this huge flip-flop on 
the part of the official opposition, the only party opposing the 
legislation on some grounds on which it has now totally shifted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the process it has tried to direct personal attacks, as it 
always has.  It gives the impression that it cannot do otherwise. 
It cannot debate the notion of ideas.  It directs personal 
attacks to the minister, which is nonsense.  That is not what it 
promised to do when it came to Ottawa.  It is not living up to 
expectations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These things need to be said.  I will read a couple of quotes 
for members.  One is from a fine gentlemen who writes for the 
Toronto <I>Sun</I>, Hartley Steward.  He used to publish the 
Ottawa <I>Sun</I>.  He is certainly not a friend of this side of 
the House but perhaps more of the other side of the House.  Here 
is what he had to say on this matter: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—despite claims by the magazine industry's lobby groups that 
this is the beginning of the end for Canadian magazines, the deal 
is a pretty good one for those who own Canadian magazines. 
American split-run editions will be allowed to carry only 18% 
Canadian advertizing.  Should they wish to carry more, they will 
have to set up a Canadian office and carry “substantial” 
Canadian content.  If “substantial” is regulated to mean 
“majority” it is, indeed, a major concession on the part of 
U.S. trade officials. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member like to comment on that quotation from Mr. 
Steward?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party was and 
still is, I believe, the only party 
that has resisted and said that it is dead against this 
agreement.  The reason is that the evidence has shown that this 
agreement, this so-called exemption, did not exist. The exemption 
the government pretended was available to the magazine industry 
simply did not exist.  I believe it was very misleading for the 
Liberal government to pretend it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the free trade agreement was signed in 1988, Canada 
supposedly had an exemption clause on our cultural industries, 
but there was a cost to that, a price to be paid. The price to be 
paid was that if Canada did that, the United States had the right 
to retaliate in equivalent effect.  That is the essence of this. 
We have seen it come home.  We have seen the cultural industries 
now say that they do not want any more exemptions.  The 
government told them about how great these exemptions were but 
they are not serving them well at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of saying that the magazine industry has been 
sacrificed, I would say it has been misled.  It continues to be 
misled because this is the same government that suggests in a 
report tabled today that Canada is going to protect cultural 
industries in the next round of the world trade talks, that there 
is going to be a cultural instrument, a cultural agreement in 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what happened in the so-called failed talks of the MAI. 
One of the key reasons that failed was the cultural industries 
exemption.  They could not arrive at any agreement as a result of 
that.  I suggest that there is not agreement and there will not 
be agreement at the World Trade Organization for that exemption 
clause or any cultural agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians would suggest that the United States is the main 
threat to Canadian culture.  That is what is perceived.  That is 
the reason these things are designed.  We have NAFTA.  We have 
the original free trade agreement, whether the World Trade 
Organization comes to an agreement or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States' biggest export, I believe, is its cultural 
industries.  The Americans regard it as commerce.  Think about it 
for a moment.  It is their biggest export. If we think they are 
going to say that these things are off limits or exempt, I do not 
believe that position is credible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is wrong for the government to pretend that certain 
conditions exist internationally that will protect our cultural 
industries in that way.  It is wrong and I do not think the 
government should be doing it, nor the parliamentary secretary or 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best thing that can be said about what has happened with 
Bill C-55 is that it is very much a face-saving gesture. 
Canadians lost.  The Canadian government lost because now we are 
going to have to subsidize the magazine industries.  The Liberal 
government lost.  It got beat up very badly on this.  It put the 
Canadian companies that were on the retaliation list through a 
painful period of time in our history.  For one year they did not 
know if they were the industries that would be retaliated 
against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had all kinds of presentations from the steel, beef and 
lumber industries.  They told us not to let this thing pass 
because they may be the ones that would face retaliation. 
Industries that had already faced tough times in dealing with the 
Americans possibly would be the ones that would be hit with 
further duties.  It put them through an uncertain time which is 
unfortunate.  It was an uncertain time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are legitimate fights that we need to take action on with 
the Americans.  This is not one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are legitimate fights in the area of softwood lumber.  The 
agreement on softwood lumber is due to expire in less than two 
years.  It is one where Canada has to make significant progress 
next time around.  The softwood lumber managed agreement which 
this Liberal government put in place is not working.  The United 
States has taken action against rough header lumber.  It has 
taken action against pre-drilled studs.  There is going to be 
more action.  We were promised five years of peace by the Liberal 
government for the forestry sector.  What did we get?  Anything 
but. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is going to be a fight.  Energy will be expended in the 
area of softwood lumber in the next two years.  I suggest that at 
least we put our energies where we have some chance of winning 
and where we are right on the issues.  That is not taking place 
at the moment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cattle industry is facing dumping charges and countervail 
actions by the United States.  The steel industry is continually 
harassed in terms of facing dumping charges and it has to defend 
itself against unreasonable action. That is where the trade 
department and the Canadian government should be putting their 
energy. Unfortunately that is not the case right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that, I suggest to the parliamentary secretary that there 
are many different views from Canadians as to whether it is a win 
or a loss here.  If he were to canvass some of his colleagues on 
the government front benches, he would find there was division 
all through this debate right inside his own government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians are asked what is important to them, what are the 
priorities and what we should be fighting for, they are talking 
about things like lower taxes. They are talking about things like 
less regulation in their lives.  The so-called cultural 
protectionism this government has been providing and advancing as 
a priority is certainly not a priority for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be honest with Canadians.  We have to give them a 
firm assessment of what is possible and what is not possible in 
future trade talks.  I would submit it is not possible to get 
this cultural protection in any international agreements because 
there is not international agreement out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States is probably one of the countries that is most 
opposed to the idea of cultural protectionism.  The Americans 
very much see this in a different light than Canadians do.  They 
see this as an aspect of business, of commerce, and this Liberal 
government does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned when this government talks about cultural 
protectionism.  What if other countries were to take the same 
attitude?  What if other countries were to say that they were 
going to make their countries off limits to Canadian cultural 
businesses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about Canadian artists who want to work in Nashville?  What 
about Canadian artists who want to work or who are currently 
working in Hollywood?  If the Americans were to take this dog in 
the manger attitude that we have no access to their country, that 
they are going to protect it, a number of Canadian artists would 
not have the access to work in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is badly designed legislation. The evidence of that is here 
in the amended version of Bill C-55. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first I want to 
respond to the remarks of the hon. member from the Reform Party 
regarding this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am somewhat surprised that the Reform Party on the one hand 
keeps claiming we can direct U.S. policy on trade and that we 
should somehow be standing up for farmers.  On the other hand, 
when it comes to our cultural industries and what is important to 
Canadians and identifying Canadian symbols, the Reform Party 
would have us just walk away and do whatever the Americans want 
us to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the hon. member leaves, I would like to say that in terms 
of his comments regarding the cultural industries in our 
committee report, we did not come out and claim that somehow in a 
new round we would be able to protect all of the cultural 
industries in Canada.  Our recommendation stated that at the WTO 
there should be a way in which countries can come together to 
discuss culture and put forward some of the interests of Canadian 
culture.  We feel the Canadian government and certainly the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage and her parliamentary secretary 
have done that very well with regard to Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should take that issue further.  At the next round of WTO 
negotiations in Seattle at the end of this year, we should come 
together with the different countries in the world that feel 
culture should be on the table and find a forum under which we 
can discuss those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the opportunity to speak to Bill C-55.  The 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade thanks the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, her parliamentary secretary and 
her department for all of the hard work they have put into this 
bill. 
We are very appreciative of our Minister Marchi and the Prime 
Minister who together with the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
stood up for Canadian interests.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Have the rules changed in the House and we are going to 
refer to each other by our names in this place? The member was 
talking about Minister Marchi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I did not hear the member refer to 
Minister Marchi. Normally if I hear that sort of thing I would 
certainly intervene.  I am sure if the hon. member for 
Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant made such an error he would not want to 
repeat it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was so proud of the work 
done by the Minister for International Trade that his name might 
have slipped out of my mouth.  It in no way was meant to go 
against the rules of the House. I would never do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work done by them was work done on behalf of Canadians.  It 
was certainly done under duress at a time when most of the 
opposition parties were onside with us, with the exception of the 
Reform Party.  It constantly criticized us for not standing up 
for one sector of society and criticized us at another time when 
we were standing up for an important sector of our economy and 
standing up to the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes in international trade it is difficult to get a deal. 
Rules are complex and different interests and different parties 
are involved.  These things take some time. Industries such as 
the steel industry in my riding, which is very important, have an 
interest in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to also take the time to praise the industries that did 
not jump on the bandwagon and take the American line like the 
Reform Party did.  They put forward good arguments when 
discussing this matter with my minister and the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage as well as our caucus members. Again I thank 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage for standing up for the steel 
industry in her area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize that these amendments to the bill 
represent a new stage of certainty and security in the evolution 
of Canadian culture as expressed by the Canadian periodical 
sector. In the legislative void created we accepted and 
implemented the WTO decision.  It is very important to remind 
members that when the WTO came down with its decision, Canada 
followed the rules.  We came forward and did what the WTO did, as 
we do internationally and as we hope other countries do.  We went 
further to make sure Canadian culture was protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Security in the future of Canadian stories told in these 
periodicals will continue to thrive through an investment policy 
which will foster Canadian content.  Most important, there will 
be jobs for Canadians in the periodical sector.  Canadians will 
be provided with the opportunity to read about themselves and to 
know about themselves and to appreciate more what their country 
is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have achieved this end through discussion, through 
co-operation and through working together with our American 
friends.  This is the way two countries so intertwined in trade 
should work. Rather than battle a country with which we share a 
common border and are close in many ways we should resolve these 
issues through discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pointed out that Canada has one of the most open markets in 
the world for foreign magazines.  Canadians enjoy reading about 
themselves but they also enjoy reading about foreign lands and 
seeing these through a Canadian perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We explained and we also listened.  In the end we struck a deal 
that was not only consistent with our cultural policies, but for 
the first time in our bilateral relationship with the United 
States, it agreed to and has recognized that Canadian content is 
a legitimate Canadian trade objective. 
That is the first time our American friends have done this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These achievements, however, did not come without a cost.  In 
any negotiation there is some give and take.  We had to provide 
something in exchange.  That is how negotiations work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agreed to let foreign publishers have limited access to the 
Canadian advertising services market, but not enough to inflict 
damage on our ability to promote that market.  It was enough to 
show that we were willing to give something in negotiation, but, 
most importantly, not enough to jeopardize Canadian culture as it 
is expressed in our magazines.  However, it was enough to remove 
the threat of damaging trade action by the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between January and last week no less than 10 meetings were held 
between Canadians and American groups working on this agreement. 
After all, we are each other's best customers.  We find that if 
we can negotiate, if we can sit down, if we can show each other 
our differences, then we can move forward more quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have more than $1.5 billion in trade crossing the border 
every day.  That is why we sought to resolve these issues through 
dialogue.  A trade war would have been far more damaging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We gave a little, maybe too much for some of our friends on the 
other side, maybe too little for others, but that is what happens 
in negotiations.  There is give and take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also remember that Canada and the United States have 
agreed, through dialogue, to other agreements, which were 
mentioned by the Reform Party, concerning issues of softwood 
lumber, issues of wheat and agricultural products.  When all of 
these issues came forward we did not end up with a battle; we 
ended up again giving a little, taking a little, but we ended up 
with an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think anybody who knew about the free trade agreement 
and the NAFTA which followed expected everything to be rosy.  In 
fact, I do not think any trade agreement in the world could make 
absolutely certain that there would not be disagreements with 
neighbours.  However, we find the best way to deal with these 
disagreements is through negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The desire to resolve these disputes through discussion is not 
only a matter of preference between friends, it is also the 
practical approach and the best way to deal with these issues. If 
the United States did retaliate against those industries that 
were the targets—steel, apparel, plastics and lumber—there 
would have been a chilling effect on our export markets and our 
export contacts in these areas.  While we would have had the 
right to challenge the United States pursuant to the NAFTA, 
Canadian exports still would have suffered.  The rules are there 
and we have to make sure that we understand those rules to put 
forward our argument and to protect the industries that we hold 
important in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Government of Canada preferred a negotiated 
solution; not a solution at any price, or one that played one 
sector off against another, but a mutually satisfactory agreement 
and a balanced agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the balanced agreement which was signed last week that 
led us to introduce these amendments.  The amendments to this 
bill provide increased certainty and security for the Canadian 
magazine sector and, thus, an ongoing and strengthening venue for 
Canadians to communicate with each other and to learn more about 
their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly thank the industry itself, which provided the 
government with a lot of the information and a lot of the 
resources it needed to put forward this argument.  That is the 
best way to do it; to work through the industry, through those 
sectors that are concerned about these issues, with the 
co-operation of the provinces, with the co-operation of Canadians 
and the NGOs to put forward an argument. 
That is why we win these arguments.  That is why we have moved 
ahead in trade.  That is why our trade numbers keep growing. 
Even though we are a somewhat small country, when we are put 
against our larger neighbour to the south I think we do pretty 
well.  If we go around the world and talk to other countries that 
deal with the Americans on trade issues, most of them look to 
Canada to see how we do it because we have been successful.

Trade and the Minister of Canadian Heritage for their hard work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened carefully to the hon. member, who spoke about the 
international trade aspect of the magazine bill which we are 
debating today.  He said in his remarks that if Americans did 
retaliate there would be a chilling effect on our trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he knows that there would be a chilling effect, why does he 
not bring the whole issue into perspective and mention it to the 
minister, whose selfish motive is to have this bill passed even 
if it affects the steel industry, the plastic industry, the 
agriculture industry and the textile industry?  Would there not 
be significant damage done to the international trade relations 
we have with the U.S.?  We have more than $1 billion in trade 
with our major trading partner every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also mentioned that Canada will have to argue at the 
World Trade Organization in the case of retaliation.  We all know 
that subsidies hurt Canadian businesses or Canadian interests. We 
know what the story is on softwood lumber.  We know what the 
story is on agricultural trade.  We saw what happened a few 
months ago with agricultural trade.  We also know that the 
government sold out the Canadian interest on the Pacific salmon 
fishery in the recent treaty it negotiated.  It has already lost 
the war on magazines with the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the hon. member shed some light on this?  What will be the 
effect?  Since he is an international trade specialist himself, 
can the hon. member shed some light on how much these subsidies 
will cost Canadian businesses, as well as American businesses? 
Because if this goes to the World Trade Organization, according 
to chapter 11 of the NAFTA, the subsidies will have to be given 
to American businesses as well.  How shameful.  Can the hon. 
member shed some light on how much these subsidies will cost 
Canadian taxpayers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, 
international trade is a very complex issue.  I think the hon. 
member should go back to his researchers to ask them why they 
would give him such false information as to put forward in the 
House the suggestion that we would have to subsidize American 
companies.  That is not the case.  It is not even on the board. 
Most people who have been following this issue know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell the hon. member, because it is a very important 
point and I think it is an important point for Canadians to know, 
that what we are talking about here is the 20% of the market that 
we now control.  American and other foreign companies have 80% of 
the shelf space.  We are only talking about 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it his position and his party's position that we should all 
of a sudden give up this 20%, that we should not stand up for 
Canadian periodicals and Canadians?  That is certainly not the 
position on this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should know if he is sitting in this House as an 
elected Canadian member of parliament that it is the role of the 
Canadian government to stand up for Canada; not to mouth American 
interests, not to mouth American big business interests, but to 
stand up for Canadians and to allow Canadians the opportunity to 
learn more about themselves, to learn more about their culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a large country.  We cover millions of square kilometres 
of space, with people from the far north to the west coast and to 
the east coast who want to know about each other, who want to be 
able to read magazines about life in these areas.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that they are not afraid to read 
American magazines or foreign magazines, but they would like to 
know about these issues from a Canadian perspective.  We are only 
talking about 20% of the market that we hold in that shelf space. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some point at which Canadians need to stand up to 
bullying tactics.  That is what we did.  We told our friends, and 
again I say our friends the Americans, that we were not prepared 
to let their invasion go any further.  That is what the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage did and every Canadian should be proud of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
mentioned in his speech that 80% of magazines on the stand are 
foreign magazines.  Let me give him some true facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also been saying that 50% of magazines 
purchased in Canada are foreign magazines, but the latest numbers 
on readership, taking into account controlled circulation, the 
magazines distributed via bulk delivery, including magazines 
received in newspapers, show that only 4.9% of magazines read in 
Canada are bought off the stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Magazines received by paid subscription account for 35.7% of 
magazines read in Canada, and 59.4% of those magazines read are 
received through controlled circulation.  Therefore, 75% of all 
magazines read are received by controlled circulation and 95% of 
those magazines are Canadian owned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of these facts, I ask the hon. member once again, in 
dollar terms, what is the value of the subsidies they will be 
giving to Canadian businesses and possibly to American 
businesses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as my hon. colleague down 
the way says, nonsense.  The fact is that we will not be giving 
any subsidies to American companies.  That is just one of the 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point in time, as a government and as Canadians, we have 
to decide whether or not to take a stand.  We decided as a 
government—the Minister for International Trade, the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Canadian Heritage—that the 
Americans had crossed the line and that we were not prepared to 
give away that part of the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what we did.  That is what these amendments are 
doing today.  They are trying to make sure that Canadians in the 
future, our children and our children's children, will be able to 
read about their heritage and their country from a Canadian 
perspective.  They will be able to read things which are written 
by Canadians and they will be able to see the world through a 
Canadian lens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had we not acted, that would not have been the case.  I thank 
all of those in the industry, members on our side of the House, 
and those in the opposition who understand the importance of 
this, for their hard work.  We took a stand and Canadians will 
remember that in years to come. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to speak in 
opposition to Bill C-55, as well as the Senate amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to speak in support of my colleague's amendment, 
the amendment put forward by the heritage critic of the official 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 concerns advertising services supplied by foreign 
periodical publishers.  The heritage minister, right from the 
beginning, has mismanaged the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If enacted, the bill will prevent Canadian advertisers from 
advertising in foreign magazines that come into Canada.  This is 
not a heritage matter; it is an international trade matter.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international trade minister and the heritage minister are 
fighting over the issue.  The trade minister wants to do his job 
but the heritage minister will not let him do it.  She goes so 
far as to almost ruin our trade relations with the U.S., our 
greatest trading partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister bans Canadian advertisers from selling their 
goods and services in foreign magazines, the minister is telling 
Canadian advertisers that when it comes to freedom of speech they 
are second class citizens.  The Surrey business community which I 
represent should not be told how to run its business.  Businesses 
should not be prevented from doing anything that will grow their 
businesses, make them more prosperous and enable them to hire 
more workers or maintain the present jobs they have created in 
the small business industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the government's attempt to control the American magazine 
industry, it is trampling on the rights of Canadian firms from 
coast to coast to coast.  Why should Canadian firms allow the 
heritage minister to dictate to them where they can or cannot 
advertise their goods or services? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the minister consider the damage that would be caused to 
these firms?  I am sure she did not. Did the heritage minister 
consider the damage that would be done by the retaliation 
promised by the Americans if Bill C-55 is passed?  I am sure she 
did not.  She is not concerned about the fate of small businesses 
and their lack of advertising opportunities.  Once again we are 
experiencing the arrogance of this weak Liberal government with 
no vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go further, Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with 
the hon. member for Calgary East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big question is how much are these subsidies to the industry 
going to cost Canadian taxpayers?  We asked the minister this 
question but did not get an answer.  Canadians deserve to know 
the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's small businesses know what they need to grow and to be 
prosperous.  They know how to run their businesses. They do not 
need to be dictated to and to have their freedom restricted by 
the government.  The government continues to kill jobs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not bad enough that Bill C-55 will hurt our economy and 
our firms, what is worse is the minister pushed the Americans 
into promising retaliation if Bill C-55 is enacted. She is going 
ahead with Bill C-55 anyway without knowing what the effect will 
be on Canadian businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same minister who insisted that she would abolish 
the GST in order to get elected.  That promise was broken and she 
was forced to abandon her stubborn ways and seek re-election 
because the GST was a lot more powerful than she was. The 
business community across Canada suffers from the effect of the 
GST and the heritage minister has already shown us that she 
cannot help us with the GST problem.  There should be no 
mistaking the American promise of a billion dollar trade embargo 
for a Liberal GST promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans are not fooling.  They are not desperate Liberal 
members of parliament who will say anything to get elected.  They 
mean what they say. The Americans are quite serious when they say 
they will hurt our economy badly with trade retaliation in the 
steel, plastics, textiles, lumber and agricultural industries. 
The heritage minister has poked the American elephant with a 
sharp stick.  The American elephant has already warned her that 
the American elephant does not fear mice or former rat packers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What purpose will the minister serve with this bill if she 
succeeds in having Canada slammed by an American trade embargo? 
What is the point?  What is the use of Bill C-55 if we are 
slammed by a trade embargo by our biggest and oldest trading 
partner? A billion dollars of trade a day; it is going to affect 
our economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government not more concerned about building trade 
rather than damaging trade?  Why would the government allow the 
heritage minister to pursue her policy, which is Bill C-55, that 
promises to be so terribly destructive to our trade?  Let me tell 
the minister that when she lives in a glass house she should not 
throw stones at others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another important aspect I would like to bring to the 
attention of the House. As a multicultural country, many of our 
ethnic communities or minorities rely on foreign publications to 
keep the Canadian communities in regular communication.  The 
heritage minister's Bill C-55 will restrict the advertising that 
Canadian firms can buy in these foreign publications.  Why would 
the minister be so negligent as to penalize these diverse and 
sometimes small ethnic communities? These communities do not have 
their own newspapers, magazines or other publications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heritage minister has set Canada up for U.S. trade 
retaliation risking the jobs of thousands of Canadians and our 
country's standard of living.  The Senate cannot fix this bill 
with its amendments.  It cannot repair the damage done to our 
trade relations with the Americans because of what the heritage 
minister has done.  When she banned Canadian advertisers from 
selling their goods and services in foreign magazines, the 
minister told Canadian advertisers that when it comes to freedom 
of speech they are second class citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 should be opposed because it puts an unreasonable 
limit on free speech and freedom of the press.  Furthermore, Bill 
C-55 impinges on property rights and freedom of contract as 
granted by the 1960 Canadian bill of rights and common law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 is not worth the potential damage it will do to our 
economy and our job market.  Bill C-55 is not worth the risk to 
Canada's international reputation as an advocate of rules based 
trade that is supported and promoted by international trade 
tribunals for settling trade disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I oppose this bill and I tell Canadians that this 
bill is damaging Canadian trade relations and Canada's trade. 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to rise today in the debate on Bill C-55, an 
act respecting advertising services supplied by foreign 
periodical publishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I do that, as I think this is my last speech in the House 
before we break for the summer, I would like to wish all the 
members a good summer.  I would like to remind government members 
that today the united alternative results will come out and they 
will have a lot to think about over the summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to have one more opportunity to debate this bill 
before the House breaks for the summer. This is a very important 
piece of legislation.  As the official opposition trade critic, I 
am particularly interested in this bill because it explores the 
contradiction between our role as an open free trading society 
and the defence of our culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is blessed with a diversity of cultures.  Culture is an 
extension of a civilization.  It is an evolution and its maturity 
depends upon how the citizenry chooses to nourish it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's identity and culture is the sole domain of its own 
citizens.  It is not the role of the bureaucrats to legislate 
what Canadians will read, think or write, yet this is precisely 
what we have with Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition values the cosmopolitan Canadian culture 
we have today contrary to what other parties may think.  We value 
the right of every Canadian to pursue the logic extension of 
their culture and religion.  Yet we have here in Bill C-55 an 
attempt by the minister, by her bureaucrats and by self-interest 
groups to push their own vision of Canadian identity on the 
majority knowing full well that this is not what Canadians want. 
The Liberals continue to pursue an agenda of protection in the 
name of Canadian identity at the expense of other industries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year in October the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
introduced Bill C-55.  Last year the World Trade Organization 
handed down two rulings which found the provisions under the 
previous magazine advertising legislation ran contrary to GATT 
and WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government chose to introduce Bill C-55 which has never 
enjoyed wide public support.  This bill is not about protecting 
Canadian identity; it is about protecting the Canadian publishing 
industry.  This bill is about money, plain and simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this debate I have heard the minister and colleagues across 
the House speak about wanting their children to read Canadian 
stories.  They want their children to read about Canadian 
achievements.  There is nothing wrong with that. That is a good 
idea.  I think every Canadian would like to read about the 
achievements of their fellow Canadians, about culture, the works 
of Canadian authors. On that part I agree 100%, but this 
legislation is not doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is wrong. This is ill thought out legislation. 
Why do I say that?  Plain and simple, this legislation attempts 
to protect a small industry, the publishing industry.  The 
publishing industry can survive on its own. Canadians will read 
what is written by other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is not about that.  I disagree with the government 
when it says this bill is about Canadians and about Canadian 
achievement.  It is not.  This bill is the protection of one 
industry, forgetting that Canada has huge industries, forgetting 
that other industries are involved.  We have signed trade 
obligations that we have to live up to as well.  How will we do 
that? It is very simple.  When they write and read what is 
published, Canadians will decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental point is that what is going to be read by whom 
is not for the government to legislate down our throats. It is 
for Canadians to decide what they want to read, what they want to 
buy, what they want to do. Those who are in the Canadian cultural 
industry have risen to the occasion without government support. 
They do not need government support. There are excellent cultural 
artists in this country who write good books, who write good 
stories. They do not need a government prop-up.  They can do it 
and Canadians will love to read their writings.  We can start by 
doing it in our schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This business of attempting to force on the Canadian public what 
the minister of heritage thinks should be cultural policy is 
wrong.  A fundamental point on this bill is that the government 
should stay out of it and let Canadians decide. The artists who 
are capable do not need to be propped up by the government. That 
is the fundamental problem we have in supporting this bill.  That 
is why we are not in agreement with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is wrong for others to say that we are against what can be 
called our Canadian culture.  We are not.  We take extreme pride 
in seeing the achievements of our artists and people who work in 
the cultural industry but we also have obligations to other 
industries and this is impacting other industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. is right across the border.  It has a huge cultural 
industry.  We may feel threatened, but I do not think we will 
feel threatened with education and with the Government of Canada 
publicizing the great achievements of Canadians and such things. 
We can do more service for Canadian culture, for Canadian artists 
than just shoving a bill down our throats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have opposition from the advertising industry which is the 
one that is going to pay the price for this.  We have opposition 
from other industries, the steel industry.  All over the country 
we have this problem.  Why?  For just one little bill that is not 
going to have a major impact, I am sorry to say.  Do we really 
think Canadians will go out there just because of this bill and 
read about these things?  They will not. 
Canadians will read about Canada and Canadian achievements when 
the books and the things they desire are out there and when they 
have the desire.  Canadian identity is on the rise in this

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is absolutely wrong and that is why we are opposing it. 
We are not opposing it because we do not believe in Canadian 
culture.  We are opposing it because it is an ill-thought out 
bill that has an impact on other industries and on jobs.  It has 
a narrow definition of Canadian identity and Canadian culture.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity to rise in the House today 
to speak to Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know members are eager to return to their ridings and to go 
home, but we in the NDP believe that the bill today is a very 
important bill.  We intend to have as many members as possible 
speak to the bill because it is very critical in terms of the 
protection for our cultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today, the member for Saint John rose in the House to 
call for an emergency debate on the merchant marines.  She stated 
that the merchant marines who served in the war have never had 
recognition nor have they had their pensions. I make this remark 
because she said very eloquently that we would not be here today 
if the merchant marines had not fought or contributed to 
defending our country and democracy.  That is very true.  We 
would not be here today in the House or in this kind of 
democratic institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same vein, we should think about what it is that defines 
us as Canadians, which is partly what the bill is about.  What is 
it that defines us as Canadians.  Sometimes people believe that 
is a difficult question to answer.  I, as do my colleagues in the 
federal New Democratic Party, believe that one of the things that 
defines us as Canadians is our culture.  Whether it is our 
writers, our filmmakers, journalists, editors, publishers, 
printers, readers, children who may be involved in creative 
writing, our artists, visual artists, performers or theatrical 
artists, our Canadian culture and diversity is something that is 
very critical to who we are as a nation and as a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why members of the NDP are so concerned about Bill C-55. 
Even though it represents a small portion, just one piece of our 
cultural industry, it is an important piece and needs to be 
examined under the microscope of whether or not the bill will 
protect and enhance Canadian culture in this country or whether 
it is taking us down the slippery slope and the road toward 
further destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In listening to the debate today, in particular from the Reform 
Party members, it has been very interesting to hear the 
discussion and the points of view that are held and to hear the 
Reform members raise the question of how we regulate culture.  I 
have heard Reform members say that it cannot be done.  However, 
in their next breath, they have also pointed out that the biggest 
export from the United States, a very massive economy to the 
south of us, is the cultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers say that culture cannot be regulated or protected, but 
just a few moments ago we heard a Reform member say that culture 
is just another industry.  The Reform member said that we should 
not worry because the bill was just about another industry and 
that we should leave it to marketplace.  We in the New Democratic 
Party have a very different view. 
We believe that, yes, there is a cultural industry but it is 
intrinsic to who we are as Canadians and it demands, because 
there are imperatives, whether it is on magazines, broadcasting, 
the printing industry or the performing arts, that we stand in 
solidarity with the 987,000 cultural workers in this country who 
give us that definition of who we are and who allow us to speak 
to one another with vast differences in the regions, where we 
have come from and who we might be.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP believes that we must stand up and protect our cultural 
industries and our magazines.  That is why we believe this debate 
on Bill C-55 is so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Vancouver East is home to many cultural workers.  I 
think there is a myth that somehow Canadian society or the 
government subsidizes cultural workers and the arts.  In actual 
fact, I think the opposite is true.  Cultural workers, and very 
often the culture industry, subsidizes the rest of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from artists, writers, people involved in magazine 
writing and independent journalists that people are desperately 
trying to get a message out about what is happening in their own 
communities and in their own lives and to have debate about 
different issues.  Many of those people operate in an environment 
that is threatened all the time.  This is again why the NDP 
believes very strongly that we have to stand in defence of 
Canadian culture and Canadian cultural workers.  Our critic, the 
hon. member for Dartmouth, has expressed this many times in the 
House.  She is, herself, a well-known Canadian playwright. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really coming from that sort of premise that we in the NDP 
are very distressed, maybe not surprised but certainly 
distressed, about the route and direction that Bill C-55 has 
taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally, our party gave lukewarm support to Bill C-55 as 
something that would provide some protection.  However, what has 
become increasingly clear over the course of many months and 
so-called negotiations is that the government has caved in. I 
have to agree with the Reform member who just spoke.  It is not 
just on this issue that the government has caved in.  One just 
has to look at the salmon treaty in my province of British 
Columbia to know that the Canadian government caved in on that 
one too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is distressing because the Liberal government had an 
opportunity to defend Canadian interests in dealing with the 
Americans and protecting our cultural industry.  By not using the 
cultural exemption contained in NAFTA, which is yet untested, and 
by ignoring even its own legal advice about Bill C-55 being 
WTO-proof, the government in these so-called negotiations has 
actually shown that we have no interest in protecting our own 
culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also distressing because what we have learned from this 
process is the lesson the Americans have learned.  They know that 
if they threaten a trade war, we will surrender.  I heard a 
Liberal member earlier proudly stand up and say that we did not 
end up in a battle with the U.S. on this.  I would agree, but the 
reason we did not end up in a battle is because we simply gave in 
to it.  We should have had a battle.  We should have been out 
there on the front lines, maybe with support from other parties. 
I know our critic would have been there if she had been invited 
to the table.  We would have been there with cultural workers to 
say, “yes, this is something we want to have a battle on because 
we are not about to give in.  This is the thin edge of the 
wedge”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By refusing to use the existing trade rules to protect our split 
runs in magazines, we are basically saying that we will allow the 
Americans to make up international rules as they go along.  We 
are very concerned about this.  It is the thin edge of the wedge. 
It is only a matter of time before this massive industry, the 
largest export industry in the U.S., which is culture, goes after 
Canadian content on television or ownership levels in 
broadcasting. 
They might even go after our book publishing industry which, as 
we know, has been a very dynamic industry over the years.  It is 
a dynamic industry but it is also very vulnerable to the massive 
industry south of the border.  They could also threaten our 
Canadian film industry and our feature films.  The list goes on 
and on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my colleagues believe that the debate today on Bill C-55 
is not just about the specific provisions of the bill.  The 
debate is also about what will happen in the future, what the 
Liberal government will decide to do, and what course it will 
chose to take in terms of our cultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to spend a few minutes just looking at the 
highlights of this so-called American deal, which I think we 
would characterize as a Liberal sell-out, and the amendments that 
have come back from the Senate.  The reality is that the deal was 
made after the Americans threatened a trade war.  Canadian trade 
experts, both inside and outside the government, have stated 
repeatedly that the Canadian version of Bill C-55 was WTO-proof 
and that the cultural exclusion in NAFTA would also protect 
Canada in any trade war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have we seen?  After months of behind closed door 
negotiations, we have learned that the Prime Minister directly 
intervened and, as a result, Canada surrendered.  If somebody 
doubts that, they just need to read the debates in the House, the 
discussions and the questions during question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Dartmouth, our critic for culture and 
communications, has been following and monitoring this very 
closely because she has a keen interest in it and has a very good 
understanding of what the debate is all about.  To give the 
member for Dartmouth credit, she has been able to expose and 
bring forward in the House just what a sell-out Bill C-55 is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is curious that the Liberal members characterize the 
amendments that have come from the Senate, that were part of this 
so-called American deal, as providing certainty and security. We 
have to really question that.  What certainty and what security? 
It seems to us that the only certainty is that we are now 
embarked on a course where our interests are continually being 
put on the table and then whipped off the table because they have 
been sold off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the heritage minister responsible for this industry 
and for this bill went to the Senate and introduced the 
amendments that we now see in the bill.  These amendments are 
really implicit to the capitulation that took place to the 
Americans. In fact, after using time allocation in the Senate, 
the Senate passed the bill—surprise, surprise—and we have it 
back in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did Canada give away?  Well, definitions of Canadian 
content, now editorial content, is considered Canadian as long as 
it is original to a magazine aimed exclusively at the Canadian 
market, not, and I stress not, if it was written by a Canadian. I 
think that is a very disturbing kind of definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The precedent is now set for the Americans to challenge the 
definitions of Canadian content under the WTO and NAFTA, which 
could have profound impacts on our protections in broadcasting, 
book publishing, film and even protections around all of our 
cultural institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we had control of our own market under the original Bill 
C-55, it was illegal for new split-run magazines to accept 
Canadian advertising.  Under this deal, the Canadian government 
has agreed that we will allow new split runs to be created to 
invade our market with up to 18% Canadian advertising and, as we 
know, over a three year period.  Since Canadian advertisers can 
write off a portion of their ad expenses spent on Canadian 
magazines on their taxes—and remember that can now include 
magazines with no Canadian content—the government is actually 
saying that it is Canadian taxpayers who are providing a subsidy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill C-55 first came forward it was with the support of the 
NDP caucus.  We felt it was better than nothing.  We were 
lukewarm warm about it but we did provide some support.  It 
offered some protection to Canadian magazines from new split-run 
editions of American magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expressed our frustration very clearly.  The bill seemed to 
be subject to bargaining with the Americans behind closed doors. 
Even so, the minister gave us her assurance that the spirit of 
Bill C-55 would be respected in any deal.  We raised this point 
in the House continually, and we were always assured that the 
substance, the spirit and the intent of the bill would remain 
solid and would not be given away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now know differently.  The so-called deal that was made is 
actually substantially different and has set us in the direction 
of completely selling out.  The negotiations have not provided 
the kind of protection and the kind of defence that the minister 
stated publicly time and time again in the House and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deal that was put together committed Canada to amending Bill 
C-55 in the Senate to permit foreign owned publishers to benefit 
from increased market access with respect to advertising directed 
primarily at the Canadian market.  The deal also committed Canada 
to amending our foreign investment policy so that it falls under 
section 38 of the Investment Canada Act, allowing cabinet to 
regulate or prescribe what and how much foreign ownership 
Americans can have in our industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement also forces Canada to allow for increased 
ownership, up to 51% after 90 days and up to 100% within a year, 
subject to the benefit test.  The deal also committed the 
Canadian government to change the Income Tax Act to allow 
advertisers to receive deductions for placing ads in American 
publications aimed at the Canadian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider what has taken place over the last few months, 
the deal really sets out the surrender of our market by 
prescribing the formula to allow for American split runs to 
invade our market up to 18% within 36 months.  As we have heard, 
we are already flooded with American material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most disturbing points for the NDP is that in 
creating this so-called deal it is curious the amendments and the 
process came through the Senate.  Should that not have happened 
in the House of Commons?  Why is it that the government allows 
that to happen in terms of introducing those amendments after the 
original introduction of Bill C-55?   Why is it that took place 
in the Senate, a body that is undemocratic and unelected? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now debating a substantially different bill with major 
amendments from the Senate.  The bill should have originated in 
the House with debate and discussion in the House.  On those 
grounds alone we have very grave concerns and opposition to the 
bill because of the process used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example of what the bill means.  It is a very 
technically complex bill.  I will lay out the following scenario 
of what might be possible.  What is possible under the amended 
Bill C-55 if it goes through? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suppose Mr. Jesse Helms set up a magazine in Miami aimed it at 
the Canadian market to attack our policy on Cuba.  This is not an 
unlikely scenario.  A majority of the editorial content of the 
magazine is written only for that magazine, meaning that under 
the Senate amendments to Bill C-55 it is considered a Canadian 
publication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian advertisers in that magazine can therefore deduct a 
portion of their advertising costs from their taxes.  This allows 
the publisher, Mr. Helms, and his magazine to supply lower ad 
rates.  The only Canadian who touches this magazine would be the 
consumer, if anyone happens to read it.  No Canadian writers, no 
Canadian editors, no photographers or printers are required for 
the magazine to be considered Canadian under Bill C-55, the new 
deal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consequence is that existing Canadian magazines will suffer 
as a result of the subsidized ads in the new magazine, the 
so-called Canadian content, when ads are no longer placed in 
existing Canadian magazines.  That is the consequence of the 
so-called certainty, security, defence, and protection from the 
Liberal government for our magazine industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we stand in the House today to say that we will not 
go along with it.  We can see through it and we will tell 
Canadians that this is a sellout.  We have seen capitulation on 
other issues in this session.  This is a sellout.  We will not go 
along with it but not for the same reasons as the Reform Party. 
We want to defend and protect our cultural industry for Canadians 
because it defines us as Canadians.

fair warning if she has followed the debates.  It is a note that 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage received on May 25 and it 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Minister: 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Congratulations for hanging tough on your recent negotiations.

certainly a very well respected Canadian icon in our cultural 
field.  How then would the hon. member reconcile what he had to 
say with what she has just said? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to say 
that the NDP is a party that has principles.  We stand by them. 
We have stood by our principles when we were the CCF and now that

who like to shift around and basically take the direction of 
their strongest opposition, listen to the Reform Party and go 
down that road.  We are a small group but we are very proud of 
the fact that we have the courage to defend our principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We don't cave in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  We do not cave in.  In terms of the

like this one, or any issue really, we should look at the total 
breadth of the issue.  We should look at the debate that has 
taken place.  It is easy for the member to pull out one letter, a 
nice personal letter to the minister from someone saying she did 
a good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could pull out any number of debates, comments, media 
commentary and discussion around Bill C-55 which tell the member 
loud and clear that the real judge, the Canadian people who watch 
this debate and see what is going on, do not hold the same 
opinion.  They do not think the government held tough.  They do 
not think the Canadian government defended our cultural 
industries.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure today to speak to Bill C-55.  Canada has a longstanding 
commitment and a tradition of commitment to protecting the 
Canadian magazine industry.  This began in 1961 with John 
Diefenbaker's O'Leary commission, which was designed originally 
to develop a plan to protect the Canadian magazine industry 
against dumping from the U.S. and foreign magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1965 the split-run legislation was introduced, again to 
protect the Canadian magazine industry.  This is an issue which 
combines the elements of the free market with the elements of the 
importance of protecting Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not alone as a country in seeking to protect our culture. 
Most countries in trade agreements around the world have sought 
and successfully attained protection for their culture in trade 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney was 
successful in protecting Canadian culture in both the FTA and in 
NAFTA.  Unfortunately the Liberal government fervently opposed 
the free trade agreement and now embraces free trade.  It has not 
even utilized the cultural protection instruments within the free 
trade agreement at this juncture to protect Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said that he had a soft spot in his 
heart for the New Democrats.  The only thing worse than hardness 
of heart is softness of head.  I would argue that the U.S. 
arguments and threats of what would be illegal retaliation are 
far in excess of the dollar value of the Canadian magazine 
industry's advertising revenues in question.  This revealed 
elements of an industry in the U.S. that demonstrated hardness of 
heart.  In response we have a government whose softness of head 
provided very little opposition and in fact capitulated before 
the battle even began. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>U.S. industry groups that made these threats were not the trade 
negotiators.  They were not representatives of the U.S. 
government.  They were members of U.S. industries with a vested 
interest.  The threats that were made were in unrelated 
industries.  The sanctions would have involved for instance steel 
and specifically targeted in a rather nefarious manner the home 
city of the minister of culture.  The threats were in the amounts 
of up to $600 million when in fact the government had determined 
that $100 million was the actual dollar value of the advertising 
revenue in terms of Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister seemed to be standing firm during this debate and 
assured the House that Bill C-55 was tenable, was the right thing 
and would be consistent and defensible in our trade agreements. 
She provided reassurances to the House that it was a lock-tight 
agreement and that we would be able to protect the Canadian 
industry without incurring the wrath of our trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very last minute, after using the House in a very 
manipulative manner to develop Bill C-55 and providing those 
assurances, she gave in.  It was almost as though the minister 
throughout that process huffed and puffed and then the Americans 
blew our house down.  It was not the steadfast visionary 
leadership which is constructive in both protecting our culture 
and at the same time further promoting and developing our trade 
relationships with our trade partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has had a position from the beginning as being 
opposed to Bill C-55 and supporting in some ways the illegal U.S. 
threats.  The Reform Party has said that it does not believe in 
regulating culture and that culture should not be regulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same party whose literati have suggested that the 
book <I>Lolita</I> be removed from the parliamentary library 
because it is somehow offensive.  On one hand it wants to 
regulate culture and on the other hand it does not want to 
regulate culture.  I cannot quite figure it out.  Perhaps we 
should be able to regulate tawdry publications like <I>Lolita</I>, 
but we should not be able to regulate culture to protect Canadian 
jobs and Canadian culture within the confines of our country. 
I disagree with that inconsistency demonstrated by the Reform 
Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party and the government of Brian Mulroney had the 
foresight to protect culture under NAFTA and the free trade 
agreement.  During the free trade agreement negotiations the 
Liberals were saying that we would lose our culture and that it 
would not be protected.  The Liberals were saying that we would 
lose our medicare because of the free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly enough, since 1993 some of the Liberals' 
predictions have actually occurred. Our medical system has been 
attacked in an unprecedented manner. Across Canada the medical 
systems are in a shambles or in crisis in many provinces. That 
has nothing to do with NAFTA.  It has to do with a government 
whose priorities were clearly not on the health care system in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a further example of an inconsistency with the 
Liberal position.  We see the diluted and gutted Bill C-55 
potentially threatening Canadian culture.  Not only have we seen 
our health care system attacked by the Liberals and not because 
of NAFTA, but we are seeing our cultural industries threatened by 
the Liberals' weak-kneed capitulation.  They are not really 
fighting the good fight and utilizing the cultural protection 
elements and instruments in NAFTA which the Progressive 
Conservative government had the courage and foresight to put in 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is part of a larger issue.  It is one of vision, foresight 
and understanding of public policy, of not just where the Liberal 
Party is going in the next election but where the country is 
going in the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last weekend I attended the Free Trade at Ten Conference in 
Montreal.  The conference evaluated the impact on Canada of free 
trade over the past 10 years and of agreements like the FTA and 
the NAFTA.  Donald MacDonald was there.  He is a former Liberal 
cabinet minister and chairman of the MacDonald commission who 
came forward in the early eighties with a recommendation that the 
free trade policy with the U.S. be pursued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very interesting to hear him compare former Progressive 
Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Wilfrid Laurier. 
He said during his speech at the opening of the conference that 
Mr. Mulroney had the foresight and vision to do what would help 
Canadians in a new global economy.  He compared Mr. Mulroney to 
Mr. Laurier except he added that Mulroney was able to achieve 
more of his vision than was Laurier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That type of visionary leadership is very important and critical 
now as Canada faces more challenges in a global environment than 
we ever have.  The protection of culture is becoming an 
increasingly complicated affair because of the advent of 
technology, globalization and the pervasive nature of the 
Internet and the fact that we are increasingly going to develop 
electronic means to effect change on issues of censorship and 
regulation in terms of protecting culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a new world and there are significant challenges.  We 
should not be folding up our tent and going home. We should be 
rising to these challenges and fighting to protect Canadian 
culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are responsible for the capitulation on this very 
fundamental agreement, this longstanding tradition of protecting 
Canadian culture which began in the 1960s.  This has nothing to 
do with NAFTA.  The Liberals have refused to exercise the 
instruments of cultural protection.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A New Democrat member said earlier that there are instruments 
within NAFTA and the free trade agreement to protect Canadian 
culture.  Before utilizing those and before taking every possible 
step to protect Canadian culture, the Liberals gave in because of 
threats from the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This creates a tremendously dangerous international precedence. 
Whenever there are threats of trade wars, sanctions, or 
retaliation from any of our trade partners on any range of issues 
such as culture or the environment, we have demonstrated that we 
will give in before we exercise to their fullest extent the 
instruments we have within our trade agreements to defend them. 
This is clearly inconsistent with the principles of NAFTA and the 
free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals' gutting of Bill C-55 is inconsistent with the 
heritage of the Liberal Party of Canada which in the past has 
been consistent in the defence of culture. At this juncture the 
Liberals have turned their backs on a very important heritage. It 
appears less and less to be the Liberal Party of Pierre Trudeau. 
It is becoming the party of knee-jerk reaction, Earnscliffe 
polling, focus group economics and all types of crisis management 
and poll driven populism. Frankly it is the antithesis of what 
Canadians need at this juncture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier that the government has used parliament as a 
a pawn in this agreement.  It has used parliament in the passing 
of Bill C-55 as a bargaining chip with the U.S.  More offensive 
than that, the amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-55 have 
dramatically changed the intent and direction of this 
legislation.  Whether or not the legislation is in order is in 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a piece of legislation is changed so dramatically and 
completely emasculated by a government and when it is not 
consistent with the general principles and directions of that 
legislation as passed in the House, it should require a whole new 
legislative process and a new piece of legislation.  Clearly, the 
end agreement is not consistent with the agreement that the 
minister and the Liberals were talking about for so long.  Their 
platitude to describe this agreement was that it would allow 
Canadians to talk to one another and communicate with one 
another.  When the government gets through with this, the only 
way Canadians will be able to communicate with one another is by 
telephone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has turned its back on a longstanding tradition, 
a tradition that was protected by the government of Brian 
Mulroney in both free trade agreements.  In its commitment to 
Canadians the heritage of the Liberal Party should create a sense 
of conscience to be consistent in its protection of Canadian 
culture.  Instead of fulfilling the promise to Canadians and 
instead of the minister fulfilling her promise and commitment to 
the House that she would stand up and defend Canadian culture, 
she gave up before the fight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned not just about the contemptuous use of 
parliament as a bargaining chip and a pawn in this process, but 
also about the international precedent this will set, that any of 
our trading partners can bully us with threats of illegal 
sanctions and retaliatory actions without those claims being 
researched.  Even when legal experts have advised us that these 
claims and retaliatory measures were untenable and would be 
illegal in their nature, we have given up. 
We have given up.  That is not the signal we should be sending as 
we pursue more trade agreements and as we negotiate to play a 
larger role in a global environment, an environment that is 
becoming increasingly protectionist.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, both on the far right and the left in the U.S. the 
protectionist movement is gaining steam and getting stronger.  As 
that occurs and as we demonstrate at every possible turn that we 
are willing to give in, to cave in and to knuckle under when 
someone from another country in a specific industry group huffs 
and puffs, over a period of time the benefits we have gained in 
NAFTA and the free trade agreement will be lost significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not have commensurate dispute settlement.  We will not 
be utilizing the dispute settlement mechanisms that have been put 
in place intentionally to not only ensure access for Canadians to 
markets in other countries, but also to ensure that the issues 
and concerns that are important to Canadians, be they 
environmental or cultural, are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are some who argue that this is some form of 
protectionism, the free trade agreement and NAFTA were both 
consistent in providing instruments by which we could defend our 
Canadian culture.  Those are what we should be focusing on.  We 
should be exercising those to the fullest extent. The government 
has clearly abdicated its responsibility to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to move forward on this and if we want to examine the 
types of policies that would really help further the 
competitiveness of the Canadian magazine industry both within 
domestic sales and potential opportunities for export, in the 
long run the best trade policy would be a sound domestic economic 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party would argue that the government has to couple its 
trade policy with a more forward thinking economic and fiscal 
policy. We have to address the issues of personal and business 
taxation in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mintz report on business taxation recommended that the 
corporate tax system in Canada be made more neutral. Treat all 
industries as consistently as possible and eliminate the 
non-neutralities and distortions within the corporate tax area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mintz report also recommended that corporate taxes to the 
greatest extent should be based on profitability.  The profit 
insensitive taxes should be removed. Taxes on capital which have 
a negative impact on investment and a negative impact on 
productivity should be removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has the third highest corporate tax levels in the OECD 
countries.  Canada has a capital gains tax regime that is twice 
as repressive as that in the U.S.  Our personal income taxes are 
the highest in the G-7.  All these have a negative impact on all 
types of Canadian enterprise and business, including the Canadian 
magazine industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we support and believe that, we need to ensure that 
Canadian culture is protected through the vehicle that has been 
espoused by parliament since the 1960s through the split-run 
legislation to protect the Canadian magazine industry against 
dumping from the U.S.  We also believe that the best way in the 
long term to ensure the viability of the Canadian magazine 
industry and all industries and small businesses in Canada is to 
ensure that we have a sound, innovative and forward thinking 
economic policy. Tax reform should be an integral part of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should utilize this opportunity now, not just for 
tax reduction in small politically palatable directions where the 
government sees fit and focused on a leadership convention or the 
next election, but in the long term on what Canadians need in the 
next century.  A visionary and holistic approach to the systemic 
issues within the tax system is needed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
friend in the Conservative Party gave an eloquent defence of 
protectionism in the area of culture. 
He suggested that we need to have that.  However, would my friend 
agree that culture really is in the eye of the beholder and that 
when it is in the eye of the beholder it makes it impossible to 
defend through any type of protectionist measure?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my friend would not agree that when we start putting 
up barriers to protect culture, ultimately what we are doing is 
putting up barriers to protect somebody's very narrow definition 
of what that constitutes.  I would argue that is the wrong way to 
do it because everybody has a different view of what constitutes 
culture.  What we are doing is leaving it to bureaucrats and 
politicians to make those decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my friend, what is his definition of culture?  How can we 
protect culture in Canada with legislation when it means 
something different to everyone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is 
absolutely right, it is difficult to gauge or evaluate what is 
culture.  It is fairly nebulous in some ways and it evolves over 
time.  I know he argues that we should not even be trying to 
regulate culture, yet there are members within his party who feel 
we should remove <I>Lolita</I> from the parliamentary library 
based on some definition of what is culture.  I would point to an 
inconsistency in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of culture and the issue of what is unique to Canada, 
what is unique to Nova Scotia or Alberta, the distinctive 
elements of both our regions and our country, are clearly within 
the realm of Bill C-55 to protect, to ensure that there is an 
ability for Canadians to produce Canadian-originated stories 
about Canada and about the issues that are relevant to Canadians, 
and that there are vehicles to ensure that those stories and 
publications actually reach other Canadians.  That is the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When U.S. commercial interests are given unimpeded access to the 
Canadian magazine industry, the possibility for dumping magazines 
becomes immense.  We have an 18% limit, which is a huge shift in 
policy.  Actually, it becomes a trade issue because U.S. 
magazines have already covered their fixed costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the hon. member's party has some real difficulties 
with the CBC.  It is the same argument.  However, there is a role 
for the CBC to deliver the stories and cover the issues that are 
relevant to Canadians.  If we are to continue to be a 
knowledgeable society, a people respected globally for our 
global vision, a citizenry that fully supports the role that 
we play as Canadians as a middle power in an increasingly 
complicated world, we need to maintain and protect the Canadian 
identity.  This is not, as some would argue, an anti-American 
view.  Let us face it, we sit next to a cultural juggernaut, the 
U.S., and we are in a very difficult position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. has one of the largest cultural industries in the 
world, particularly pop culture.  We have to be very careful to 
ensure that the Canadian identity is not swamped as we progress 
into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think my friend is 
going down that same vague, muddy road.  I asked him what 
constitutes Canadian culture and I think he was completely unable 
to tell me.  Then he said that we need to protect the Canadian 
identity.  I would argue that is the same sort of nebulous term 
that means something completely different to everybody.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What this boils down to is deciding what is culture for 
ourselves or what is our Canadian identity.  To some people it 
will be toques and back bacon and drinking beer.  To other people 
it will be going to the NAC to see the symphony orchestra.  We 
have to decide that ourselves.  If we do not decide for ourselves 
it will be decided for us by bureaucrats, which is how we got 
programs like <I>Bubbles Galore</I> and all of the other 
boondoggles we hear about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to my friend again, until we can reconcile this problem, 
how can he possibly say that the United States can somehow put in 
place these protectionist policies which are completely contrary 
to the whole idea of free trade?  How can my colleague say that 
we can do that when everybody has a different view of what 
constitutes Canadian culture and Canadian identity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the perspective which 
Canadians have on Canadian culture is one of the things that 
makes Canadians and Canada uniquely diverse and distinct.  If we 
ask Canadians what their definition is of culture, we are going 
to hear a significant breadth and depth of perspective on that 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would agree with the member for Medicine Hat that culture is a 
difficult issue to define.  It is interesting that we are having 
in the House of Commons perhaps an unprecedented discussion 
between two finance critics about culture.  It really frightens 
me about where we are going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Culture is very difficult to define.  We have a significant 
amount of indigenous culture in my home province of Nova Scotia 
which has been successful in global markets.  I would like to say 
that part of it is completely market driven, but often the 
incubation of that cultural entity is provided with some level of 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have in Canada a very small population which is spread over a 
huge land mass.  This is also part of the national unity issue, 
about which I remain very concerned.  The ability for us to 
maintain some level of distinctiveness may be one of the threads 
which keeps the country and the regions together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think any country in the world can define culture in a 
paragraph or in a sentence.  Most countries are interested in, 
devoted and dedicated to protecting some element of culture.  As 
we get into a more global environment, as we see the decline of 
the role of the nation state in terms of the government's 
influence slowly declining and economies being integrated, it 
makes it increasingly important for citizens and for nations to 
protect their cultural entities and identities.  This is very 
important to people.  People want to participate in global trade 
opportunities and we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. agreed in both the NAFTA and the free trade agreement 
to a set of conditions and a set of instruments to respond to 
this kind of debate and specifically to protect culture.  My 
argument and my party's argument is that they were included 
specifically and the government has not utilized those 
mechanisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Censorship is going to be another issue that we will have to 
watch very closely, as well as privacy issues, especially with 
the evolution of the Internet.  All of these things are evolving. 
I would say that it is best for us to have discussions here and 
to collectively develop solutions.  We should certainly not turn 
our back on Canadian culture, as nebulous as it may be.  We 
should seek to understand culture and perhaps to define it 
better, but we should never stop protecting what is unique about 
this country and our cultural distinctiveness.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government has once again caved in to American 
pressure.  The government has once again tried to tell the 
Canadian people that a slap in the face is a pat on the back. 
The government is happy to sell out the interests of the Canadian 
cultural industry and happy to pretend, despite all evidence to 
the contrary, that this deal, this watered-down bill, is in the 
best interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Canadian Heritage spoke yesterday in the 
House she asserted that the new requirements for Canadian content 
were in some way a victory for the Canadian magazine industry. 
Let us get some things straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before these amendments were introduced, Canadian content was 
not even an issue.  Split-run magazines were to be illegal, 
banned and prohibited.  American companies were to be stopped 
from sending recycled American stories into our country and 
stopped from taking Canadian advertising dollars out of our 
economy, out of our industry and placing them in American bank 
accounts.  For the minister to claim that these new requirements 
are a victory for Canadians simply beggars belief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps, if I could be so bold as to suggest lines for the 
minister's speech writers, the government should shift its 
emphasis and tell the truth to the Canadian public.  The truth is 
what we have with this new and neutered Bill C-55.  It is a 
conditional surrender; not an unconditional surrender, but one 
where the Liberal government was allowed by its American masters 
to preserve a shred of its dignity in the hopes, no doubt, that 
this ever so pliable administration would be around for years to 
come to do the bidding of those in Washington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This surrender will be the first step in a wholesale attack on 
the protection Canadians have erected to preserve their cultural 
industry.  We can expect to see the American magazine industry 
pressure their government to launch a challenge to our laws under 
the provisions of the WTO and the NAFTA.  This surrender, the 
loss of this first battle, has opened a hole in the Canadian 
defences which threatens the very heart of our culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By acknowledging the ability to negotiate Canadian content 
requirements for magazines, the Liberal government has laid down 
a carpet for the long line of American entertainment businesses 
which are all too eager to swamp our country with their cheap 
television shows, low quality radio broadcasting, American books 
and movies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that they know we are willing to trade on our heritage, to 
trade on the minds of our writers, actors, painters and 
broadcasters, there will be no stopping them.  I know that the 
government dismisses fears such as those that I have just 
expressed as being apocalyptic, anti-American and who knows what 
else, but I disagree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no problems with the United States and I stand with all 
members in the House in admiring the many contributions our 
neighbour has made to human progress.  However, that admiration 
is qualified, as all admiration should be if it is not to descend 
into fawning hero worship.  That is what I fear has gripped the 
government:  an awe at being so close to such a powerful country 
that it has rendered the Liberals unable to discern what is in 
Canada's best interests, an awe that has opened the doors of our 
country to ideas about American health care, American justice and 
American governance, thinking of the ever increasing power of the 
prime minister's office and making comparisons between it and the 
American president's white house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are elements of America that I am happy to see remain on 
the south side of our border.  The line between admiration and 
adulation is a thin one and I fear it may have been crossed.  We 
are truly the mouse lying down with the elephant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not a negative reflection on either party, for we in the 
New Democratic Party are firmly committed to the equality of all 
things.  It is simply a reflection of the reality that America's 
cultural industries are the largest in the world and we, because 
of our close ties, are more susceptible than any other country to 
domination by them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reason for us to slam the doors and introduce 
protectionist measures that will exclude American magazines from 
the Canadian market.  Our objection is that we should pay U.S. 
companies to take money out of our country.  That is what Bill 
C-55 calls for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first that level may be 18%, but we can bet that in a couple 
of years it will increase and then increase again.  Those 
magazines with their large budgets and market penetration will be 
able to attract Canadian advertisers through the simple exercise 
of the law of supply and demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot blame those companies for choosing to advertise in 
split-run publications.  They are simply making the best use of 
their advertising dollars.  However, we can blame the government 
which allows those magazines to exist for choosing to cave in to 
American threats instead of defending Canadian businesses that 
will lose out because their government refused to defend them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All too many times we have heard members opposite insult my 
party for our stand on business.  The New Democratic Party is 
proud to defend Canadian businesses, to defend this whole 
industry, while the government is happy to serve as the B movie 
cast of this Hollywood controlled production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are debating should not be reduced, as some have tried 
to do, to an argument over culture.  Another battle in the war I 
referred to earlier is for the right of Canada to determine its 
own economic and cultural policies.  If the bill becomes law, 
those whose interests may be threatened will examine every bill 
passed by the House.  They will see that laws can be changed to 
suit their needs and that as long as the compliant majority 
government sits in the benches opposite, no law, no bill, no act 
or motion need pass without their veto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the years since the transformation of the GATT into the WTO 
and the FTA into NAFTA we have seen numerous violations of those 
agreements by the Americans.   Whether it be softwood lumber, 
salmon and now magazines, there is a consistency to those 
disputes that bears mentioning.  Every one was won by the 
Americans.  Some they lost on paper, as international tribunals 
and other august bodies passed judgment in our favour, but when 
it came down to it the logic of the mouse and the elephant came 
into play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The elephant knows that it can win every time.  It only needs to 
move a bit to make us do what it wants.  The elephant really has 
moved with the bill.  The Americans have pushed the government 
into doing exactly what it promised would never happen by 
allowing new split-run magazines to be introduced with watered 
down requirements for Canadian content and a built-in flexibility 
that is bound to see the percentage of allowable Canadian 
advertising in split runs increase year after year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage promised that whatever changes 
were made the spirit of the legislation would remain unchanged. 
She was either misled or misleading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original Bill C-55 presented to the House contained solid 
planks upon which to build a defence of the Canadian magazine 
industry.  One by one those planks were removed under American 
pressure until eventually nothing was left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister asked for credit because the trade dispute with the 
United States was avoided.  How much credit should we give 
someone whose actions will damage Canadians in much the same way 
as a trade war while denying us the right to retaliate in kind? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was elected to protect jobs in my riding.  One of the few 
sectors of the Cape Breton economy that is booming is our 
cultural sector.  It makes me angry when I look through the 
provisions and implications of the legislation and realize that 
government funding for local magazines, concerts, festivals and 
recordings could be threatened.  The government may be so 
enamoured of American culture that it is happy to watch it engulf 
our own.

not the least of which is our culture.

It is very clear that it is not about culture.  It is about 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to quote from a Canadian publisher that will benefit 
from the money aspect of Bill C-55.  It is by a gentleman by the 
name of Jean Paré, publisher of <I>L'actualité</I>.  He says that 
Bill C-55 is a fold, a capitulation.  He says that the government 
is giving our lunch to the Americans, lunch meaning money, and is 
proposing to give us welfare.  Canadians will be providing more 
money.  Rarely do we see any talk about culture until we get into 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maude Barlow is chairwoman of the nationalist Council of 
Canadians.  That is almost a misnomer.  The material I have seen 
coming from Maude Barlow literally makes me sick to my stomach. 
She does not represent a majority of Canadians by any means.  She 
represents a small minority of people who end up in the NDP camp. 
That should be made very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She says that this is total capitulation by the government and a 
farce.  Our NDP critic says we are now in danger of not only 
losing our magazine industry but our national soul as well. 
That gigantic emphasis of an issue is not even factual.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Had Bill C-55 had not been brought to the House, could anyone 
say that Canadian culture would have suddenly stopped and we 
would no longer make progress in developing our culture as 
individual Canadians?  It would have continued with much less 
waste of money and time than we have spent in the House on the 
bill.  It has cost us gigantic sums in our relationships with the 
Americans.  We may not be able to put an exact dollar figure to 
it, but why would we as a country want to literally antagonize 
our best friends in the whole world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have personal dislike for the supposed nationalists of the 
House and of the country slamming Americans.  That is exactly 
what is being done in the House today.  My grandfather came to 
the country in 1902 from Iowa.  His family was in that neck of 
the woods.  Whether or not anyone likes it, we in Canada are 
Americans.  We are on the North American continent.  We are in a 
relationship with people and together we comprise the North 
American continent.  When I hear people speak against Americans 
and refer to the United States, in essence they are talking 
against ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the fact that our heritage minister has 
personalized the debate to make it evident to everybody in the 
country what the bill is about.  I have listened to her many 
times in question period and in her speeches in the House going 
on and on about what would happen if the bill did not go through 
and we do not protect culture.  She wants to force the culture 
she believes is Canadian  down the throats of every Canadian. I 
do not believe she has a full idea of what Canadian culture is, 
but she certainly wants to force her version and the Liberal 
government's version of culture down our throats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She refers to her daughter and providing culture for her 
daughter and for my daughters and those of everyone else by 
extension.  The government's and the minister's version of 
culture literally makes my stomach turn.  I will tell the House 
why.  The minister and the government have put large sums of 
money into their version of culture, which includes among other 
things pornographic movies such as <I>Bubbles Galore</I>.  She has 
put gigantic sums into Canadian culture as she perceives it in a 
dumb blonde joke book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Film Board, which is funded by taxpayers, is 
producing movies that degrade, demonize and make our military 
into something that it was not.  Our military was recognized 
worldwide for the great job it did in World War II.  The veterans 
of the country said that our culture was not expressed in the 
glory and valour type movie put out by the film board. That is 
not what they went to Europe to fight for.  They fought for the 
right to be free and to develop the Canadian culture which flows 
naturally out of the interaction of humans and is not forced.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening is that Bill C-55 is an attack on freedom of 
speech.  I have already mentioned the negative impact it has had 
on trade and will have in the future.  I mentioned that it is 
force-feeding a culture that is in essence not real.  It is an 
artificial concept of what the government believes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how independent this great magazine industry can be 
when it is going to be subsidized to the tune of millions of 
dollars, probably per annum, which will not take too many years 
before it will be in the billions, in order to help it to compete 
with the rest of the world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once anyone receives money from the government, the government 
calls the shots.  Believe me when I say that the magazine 
industry is going to have to pay attention when the Prime 
Minister calls up and says that the government would like to slam 
the NDP or the Reform a little bit more, or wants an article 
massaged to make the government look good.  I wonder if that does 
not have a real negative impact on Canadian culture and on the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw what was done with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. 
If we look at its reports, its media analysis and the way it 
portrays this country and the various political parties, it might 
as well have been written by the Prime Minister's office.  The 
Prime Minister appoints all of the directors and the chief 
executive officers of the CBC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see a loss of this ability to be independent.  It is a big 
negative on the country to have that happen.  The CBC is a good 
example of what the magazine industry will be coming up to.  The 
industry will lose its independence.  I do not know whether it 
feels it is independent now, but it will certainly become a lot 
less independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to deal with the issue of culture.  Canada's 
landmass has existed for billions of years.  The best historical 
evidence available is that about 11,000 years ago the aboriginal 
people came to this country.  Even without government subsidies, 
they somehow managed to establish a culture and have kept it 
going to this very day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at my riding.  The Icelandic people came to this country 
and established a tremendous culture.  They have written 
tremendous books and magazines and have done tremendous paintings 
without any government subsidy.  They have not been told by 
government that their culture is not what they think it is, that 
it is going to buy their culture and force-feed it to them and 
then they will end up being Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final comment is that we Canadians will develop our culture. 
We will do a lot better developing it without the federal 
government telling us what it will be and how we are going to do 
it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would just like to ask 
the hon. member how he can have it both ways?   How can he first 
talk so easily about the freedom in this country and then pass an 
opinion about the content of certain cultural entities?  I do not 
understand it.  Is this freedom according to the Reform Party or 
the Reform Party's interpretation of freedom?  Whose freedom is 
it?  It seems to me it is either freedom or it is not freedom.  We 
cannot qualify freedom. 
This debate has been going on for many years in this country.  In 
the 1970s, the province of Ontario had censorship of films.  That 
was done away with in favour of classification as society grew 
more mature and in the name of freedom of expression.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member to search his conscience and determine in 
his own mind what kind of freedom he is talking about.  Is it his 
brand of freedom, his interpretation of freedom, or is it 
freedom? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the freedom that we are 
talking about here is the freedom to be free of government 
propaganda.  It is the freedom to develop a culture that flows 
naturally from our youth and and from people living in the 
countryside today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out west we spend a lot of time outdoors.  Quite often, in order 
to protect ourselves from the sun, we wear a big hat called a 
Stetson.  That is a kind of culture thing of the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take this to the logical conclusion, where Bill C-55 is 
saying that we have to protect culture, the Liberals are 
protecting what they think is a small little piece of culture 
like this in the magazine industry.  However, culture is much 
bigger than that.  By logical extension from Bill C-55, Canadians 
should be told by the government that, for instance, since 
Montreal people like to wear berets all Canadians should wear 
berets because that is Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of real good quarter horses that I use for 
sorting cattle and working my ranch.  We now have the government 
and the Bloc on the other side trying to tell me that the 
Canadian horse is some horse that is raised down here in Ontario 
and Quebec.  Well that cultural horse is not the kind of horse we 
use out west.  Here again is big government imposing its vision 
of culture on us.  We want the freedom to develop it ourselves 
without all the propaganda that flows when the government puts 
money into magazines and tells the magazine industry what it 
should do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be free from the excessive taxation.  The government 
puts billions of dollars into the magazine industry in order to 
protect it so that the magazine industry can somehow put out 
cultural articles so Canadians will know about each other.  Why 
should I as a taxpayer have to pay these magazine publishers to 
put out a magazine?  That is what we will be doing if we 
subsidize them through Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is talking about tax breaks.  Every tax break to 
an industry means those are taxes that I, as a businessman 
without any subsidy like that, will have to kick in out of my own 
pocket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think those are the freedoms that we are talking about: 
freedom from big government and freedom from the Liberal 
government especially. 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to congratulate my colleague from Selkirk—Interlake for an 
excellent speech.  He told people how it is.  I just want to 
follow up on what my friend said, because I think he was going 
down absolutely the right track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians used to have a lot of respect for the term 
liberalism in the classical sense at one point.  One hundred 
years ago we had some respect for that.  Do hon. members know 
what it stood for?  It stood for limited government, one of the 
greatest human achievements of all time.  It stood for free 
trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, at the turn of the last century we know that the Prime 
Minister's own hero, Wilfrid Laurier, was pushing free trade.  He 
was a free trade advocate.  He believed in that because he was a 
liberal in the classical sense.  They believed in personal 
freedom. That is what classical liberalism was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that the Liberals across the way are so far from 
that today that they desecrate the memory of that type of 
liberalism. 
This government seems to believe that culture is what it chooses 
it to be, even though, as my friend pointed out, everybody has a 
different view of what culture is.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out to my Conservative colleague down the road, if 
there are 30 million different views of what constitutes culture 
and Canadian identity, then who ends up choosing?  Should it be 
each individual for himself or herself?  I think it should be. 
That makes sense to me.  Should it be bureaucrats who impose 
their values and vision on the rest of us and do it with our tax 
money?  They take the money out of our pockets for what they 
believe is culture and we have to pay for it.  We then have 
spectacles like <I>Bubbles Galore</I> being produced, a lesbian 
porno film that the rest of us have to pay for.  That is 
absolutely ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe my friend over there is laughing and thinks it 
is funny. I think it is absolutely ridiculous that the Liberals 
would defend that so-called vision of culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that this party has changed to the point where it 
cannot be recognized anymore.  The classical Liberals of 100 
years ago are spinning in their graves when they consider how 
interventionist this government has become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to point out that in the period when we had real 
classical liberalism throughout the world in the 17th, 18th and 
19th centuries, we saw an unprecedented advancement in human 
happiness when governments were limited.  For millennia, we had 
toiled under governments that imposed their own will upon the 
people and taxed them as they saw fit.  There was no freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then saw an outbreak of freedom, going back into the 17th 
century.  It grew and grew through the 18th and 19th centuries. 
We saw tremendous advancements in human happiness.  We saw people 
become wealthier.  We saw standards of living go up.  We saw 
people become healthier.  We saw people live to a much older age 
because there was more food and health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, in the 20th century somehow we lost sight of what it was 
that had happened and what the root was of all this prosperity. 
We started to build up these big governments again. I would argue 
that the bloodiest of all centuries has been the 20th century 
precisely because we somehow forgot the lessons of those previous 
centuries and started to embrace big government. We had huge 
government, Utopian-type governments.  We had national socialism 
in Germany and we had communism in the Soviet Union.  It was 
bloody and it was hell on earth for many people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting this government is like that, not at all.  I 
am suggesting that it forgets what it is that gave us all that 
prosperity and that today it is still the root of the prosperity, 
to the degree that this government allows it to show its face.  I 
am talking about those principles I talked about before: limited 
government, free trade, personal freedom.  Those are great things 
but we cannot simply say that we want to have personal freedom on 
Monday, but that on Tuesday, when we are dealing with culture, 
that we do not really want to have that because we have a better 
idea of what constitutes culture.  I reject that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that the Liberals do not have a better idea.  I say that 
each individual has to make that decision.  That is why I reject 
Bill C-55 on principled ground.  It is a violation of the freedom 
of speech.  It is a violation of our right to trade freely and 
exchange goods and services on a voluntary basis.  It is 
ridiculous that we have the nanny state intervening and telling 
us what we can watch when we have to pay for it.  I think it is 
absolutely crazy, but that is what the government defends every 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government does this, I believe it desecrates the 
memory of classical liberalism and what it used to mean to be a 
real liberal in that classical sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a little about some of the specifics of this 
legislation.  I want to argue, just on a pragmatic basis, that to 
enter into this legislation was perhaps one of the most 
ridiculous, stupid political moves I have ever seen in my life. 
We live in a country that is very dependent on free trade, 
especially with the Americans, with whom our trade is worth over 
$1 billion every day.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we do?  We basically poke them in the eye with a sharp 
stick and say that we want to defend this undefined nebulous 
concept called culture which means something completely different 
to everyone else. In doing that we are going to jeopardize this 
trade that we do every day and the millions upon millions of jobs 
that go with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the government for a moment consider that?  Apparently not. 
It wandered into this and suggested that this nebulous concept of 
culture is more important than food on the table and jobs for 
many people.  Of course, the Americans were not blind to this. 
They said that they would retaliate in areas like steel and 
plastics. Interestingly, steel is the industry we see very much 
of in the heritage minister's riding.  As a result of that the 
government started to back away when it saw that the Americans 
were fighting hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that this is an issue of backing away from the 
Americans.  To the contrary, I believe what this issue is 
ultimately about is the belief that Canada can compete without 
protection in any field.  We do not need the nanny state telling 
us what to do and protecting us.  We can compete because we are 
as good as or better than the Americans and everyone else. Our 
people are just as competent.  No, they are more competent. I 
believe that.  I am sad that this Liberal government does not 
believe it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sad that the Liberals do not respect their heritage, from 
where they came 100 years ago when they used to believe in those 
sorts of things. They have given that up.  They have bought into 
this inferiority complex that has become a national joke.  I 
think it is sick.  I am embarrassed that the Liberals sit across 
the way and laugh about this. They smirk.  I think it is 
absolutely ridiculous.  They should be embarrassed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are approaching Canada Day.  Some day I would like to see a 
Canada Day when we do not have to have all these regulations, 
barriers and so-called protections for the government's narrow 
little definition of culture.  We are grown up enough to stand on 
our own two feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am ashamed that this government would do this.  I just wish we 
had enough people on this side to stop this ridiculous 
legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to comment on 
some of the comments we heard from some of the Reform members 
this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Peace River said earlier when he was criticizing 
the legislation before us that it was creating barriers to the 
American publications.  I want to make sure that the people 
listening to this debate know that that is totally inaccurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian magazine market is totally accessible to all 
foreign publications.  Anyone can go into any magazine shop in 
any city or town in the country and buy just about any magazine 
published in the United States principally, because we happen to 
receive about 80% to 90% of the export of American magazines in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the member to argue that we are creating barriers is 
tantamount to misleading the House.  I want people who are 
listening to be aware of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Peace River said that the foreign publishers 
would be eligible for subsidies should we provide subsidies to 
our Canadian publishers.  Under the WTO arrangements and under 
our national treaties, agreements of this kind have never 
required national treatment under subsidy programs.  To make that 
affirmation that should we desire to help our magazine industry 
in Canada we would have to extend the same to the American 
publishers is inaccurate. I wonder on what basis the member made 
such a suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the member for Selkirk—Interlake talked about how terrible 
it was that the government would personalize this debate, and 
that the Minister of Canadian Heritage would infer that she 
wanted her daughter to have access to stories from Canadians 
about Canadians in Canadian magazines. That came from a member 
who just prior to that had made extremely disparaging remarks 
about someone else, about Maude Barlow. 
We may or may not agree with the views of Maude Barlow but to say 
comments like “whatever comes from Maude Barlow turns my 
stomach” and then say the government is personalizing a debate 
is uncalled for.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Selkirk—Interlake made a comment which I think a 
lot of people are going to find rather strange.  He said that 
chastizing the NDP for attacking the Americans does not matter 
because “we are all Americans”.  I have news for him.  I am not 
an American.  I am a proud Canadian and I sure as hell want to 
keep it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest intervention was from the member for Medicine Hat, 
the theory of social evolution à la Monte. I am starting to 
understand where the Reformers are coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I thought this was questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The parliamentary secretary is right. 
It is questions and comments but he has taken almost four minutes 
of the five that are available.  The member for Medicine Hat does 
have the right of reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was wondering if in 
the member's comment that all things bad come from government, he 
has in his social theory the notion of wealth sharing for the 
common good, and is he prepared to abandon that? Is he showing 
the true colours of the Reform Party? Industries and common good 
do at times have precedence and do count for something in this 
country but the member obviously does not care about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to address some of 
the issues my colleague has raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He suggested that there are no barriers being created to 
American magazines.  Of course that is completely untrue.  The 
fact is that if American magazines want to come here and pursue 
advertisers, then they have to follow certain Canadian rules. 
Those are barriers. It does not mean they have unfettered access 
to come in here. They have to follow the government's 
regulations.  Again they want to micromanage the industry and in 
doing that they deny Canadian advertisers the ability to 
advertise with whomever they want without facing a penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned the WTO and whether or not we would have to 
give national treatment to foreign magazines coming into Canada. 
There is a long established principle of reciprocity under free 
trade agreements. It is not beyond the pale that this would be 
the case.  The Americans would pursue this under the WTO and ask 
for reciprocity and the same sort of dealing for their 
publications as are given to Canadian publications. I think the 
member is talking through his hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend across the way said that the member for 
Selkirk—Interlake said that we were Americans.  He was talking 
about all of us being from the Americas, North Americans. 
Although my friend is trying to push the anti-American hot 
button, it is not going to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to make the case that I argued for limited 
government, something the member's party believed in some time 
ago when Canada was a country that was growing and was a lot more 
prosperous than it is today.  The member should be ashamed that 
he abandoned that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to make a few comments concerning Bill C-55.  This is a 
very important issue for all of us. What we are debating embodies 
some very important principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons, with the support of the NDP caucus, passed 
the Canadian version of Bill C-55.  I say Canadian version 
because we know that what we are looking at now has a slightly 
different approach to it.  When we passed this bill a few months 
back we gave our support because of the protection this bill 
offered to Canadian magazines from new split-run editions of 
American magazines.  That was the reason for our lukewarm 
support. We had a lot of concerns about this bill but we did 
stick with the government and we did support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time we expressed frustration because the bill seemed to 
be the subject of bargaining behind closed doors with the 
Americans.  This concerned us greatly. The minister gave us her 
assurance that the spirit of Bill C-55 would be respected in any 
deal that was worked out. How wrong we were to have believed 
that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look for a moment at the contents of what we call the 
Canadian bill.  What did it provide? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 would make it an offence for a publisher to provide 
advertising services aimed at the Canadian market to be placed in 
foreign periodical publications, except for those currently 
receiving Canadian advertising.  They could continue at the 
current level of Canadian advertising under the grandparenting 
provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An offence was enforceable by a Canadian court in any Canadian

by the minister using powers of investigation borrowed from the 
Criminal Code.  The penalties ranged from a maximum of $20,000 
for an individual first offence on a summary conviction to 
$250,000 for a corporate offender on indictment.  There were also 
provisions for jail terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Offences that took place outside Canada by foreign individuals 
or corporations were deemed to have taken place in Canada for the 
purpose of enforcement of this act. The government could collect 
unpaid fines levied upon conviction in the same manner as a civil 
judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were a lot of things in this bill that perhaps merited 
some consideration.  But what happened to this bill?  The 
Americans became concerned and they threatened a trade war. 
Canadian trade experts both inside and outside government stated 
repeatedly that the Canadian version of Bill C-55 was WTO proof 
and that the cultural exclusion in NAFTA would also protect 
Canada in any trade war.  Yet after months of behind closed door 
negotiations the Prime Minister directly intervened and Canada 
gave in.  We surrendered. We caved in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An hon. member mentioned earlier that we are all Americans, but 
we know full well that there is quite a difference between 
Canadian culture and American culture.  Even though we all are 
part of the North American continent, there is quite a difference 
in approach and in cultural identity and so forth between our two 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite often we see that Canada gives in to the Americans.  We 
give in on matters that involve our environment. We allow 
substances to be put into our environment because the Americans 
will sue us if we do not allow those substances to be used.  We 
give in to big brother so to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heritage minister had the Senate introduce amendments which 
we now see in this bill in order to implement our capitulation to 
the Americans.  After using time allocation in the Senate, the 
Senate passed the bill and it is before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What exactly did Canada give away?  Let us look at the 
definitions of Canadian content, editorial content or 
non-advertising.  It is considered Canadian as long as it is 
original to the magazine and aimed exclusively at a Canadian 
market; not if it was written by a Canadian, but as long as it is 
original and aimed at the Canadian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The precedent is now set for the Americans to challenge the 
definitions of Canadian content under the WTO and NAFTA.  This 
could have a profound impact on our protections in broadcasting, 
book publishing, films and even our protections in all cultural 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An hon. member from the Reform Party made some reference to the 
NDP critic's description of culture and the use of the term soul. 
I am proud that we in the NDP are concerned with issues that 
relate to the soul.  We are concerned about things that are 
meaningful to us.  We go beyond the dollar and cents value that 
quite often is placed upon things by so many others.  Quite often 
that dominates and determines what the end policy is going to be, 
rather than the heart and soul having some role to play in terms 
of our Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to control of our own market, the original Bill 
C-55 made it illegal for the new split-run magazines to accept 
Canadian advertising.  Under the American deal we will allow new 
split runs to be created to invade our market with up to 18% 
Canadian advertising phased in over three years.  Canadian 
advertisers can now write off on their taxes a portion of their 
ad expenses spent on Canadian magazines.  In a sense the 
government is making the taxpayers subsidize the American 
industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original bill grandfathered existing split runs such as 
<I>Reader's Digest</I>, <I>Time</I>, <I>Sports Illustrated</I> and 
so forth, but the new bill allows for new split runs and that is 
the real threat to our magazine industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on at some length about some of the problems with 
this deal, but it is a cave-in by the Canadian government.  Often 
the Liberal government caves in, sells out and gives up on the 
basic values that are important to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go through a number of examples of how this happens.  I 
look, for example, at the need for a national shipbuilding 
policy.  Again this is an issue on which the government has caved 
in.  It is afraid to face up to the fact that we need a national 
shipbuilding policy to enable many skilled people who are looking 
for work in this area to pursue that work in a meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government constantly says that it has a policy.  It gives 
one or two examples of a few concessions here or there but 
nothing that sets any sense of direction for a national 
shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the most recent issue of the treatment of 
merchant mariners.  These honourable veterans served their 
country well.  Yet after the war they ended up being mistreated. 
They were not given the opportunities that were given to the 
regular military.  These men have been fighting for years to be 
recognized as having contributed in a meaningful way to the 
protection and well-being of their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We get to a point where finally some recognition is given 
through legislation.  However they are saying they want some 
compensation for lost opportunities.  They want the government to 
show in a symbolic way that it understands what they went through 
and what they suffered, not at the hands of the enemy so much but 
at the hands of their own government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had the opportunity to correct the situation.  An 
all party committee listened to witnesses from across the country 
who felt that these men should be adequately rewarded.  What did 
the government do when there was the opportunity to correct the 
situation?  Again it looked at the bottom line of the dollar 
figure and caved in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We receive letters from many constituents on this matter.  One 
letter was from a navy veteran in the province of New Brunswick 
and concerned the article in the <I>Times</I> transcript today. He 
did not agree with the chairman of the committee that most 
veterans did not think they should get the $20,000 payment.  He 
did not know to whom the chairman had been been talking but he 
knew the way veterans felt about it and that they did not feel 
that way. He wanted something to be done to ensure that the 
actual feelings of the veterans were heard.  We feel that these 
merchant mariners should get this compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other veterans are speaking out on behalf of merchant mariners. 
People from all across the country are speaking out.  Yet the 
government caves in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the issue concerning the military ombudsman.  Well 
over a year ago the government put in place a system designed to 
facilitate men and women in the armed forces in obtaining an 
independent means of redress of their concerns.  Even then the 
government did not make it truly independent.  Rather than the 
ombudsman being accountable to parliament, he ends up being 
accountable to the Minister of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thought we should give it a try and see how it would work. 
Well after a year the military ombudsman is sitting powerless. He 
produced a report which he called <I>The Way Forward</I>.  He sent 
it on to the minister for a response.  That report has been 
sitting on the minister's desk for over 150 days.  The minister 
is sitting silent.  He has caved in again, perhaps to the top 
military brass.  We do not know.  With hundreds of complaints 
waiting and thousands expected, the minister has not yet 
responded to the military ombudsman's report to enable him to 
begin his work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is clearly a need for the government to look seriously at 
accountability and fairness and how these concepts can be 
enhanced through an ombudsman concept for the military and 
perhaps even for the federal government as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again it is an example of caving in, an example of looking at 
the dollars and not giving any consideration to the other 
principles involved in trying to help people resolve their 
problems. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then again we look at employment insurance and the employment 
insurance grab that took place, another example of grabbing the 
dollars and forgetting about the unemployed men and women out 
there who could benefit from those funds in a meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently with Bill C-78, the pension surplus grab, the pension 
funds of the Canadian military, the RCMP and public servants were 
being grabbed for the government's coffers without any 
consideration of how best to improve the benefits being received 
by survivors and contributors to the pension funds.  Again it is 
a cave-in by the government.  We could also look at pay equity, 
another big example of a cave-in by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I return to one example that is very dear to my heart and very 
important to me.  I am referring to a small community in my 
riding that is without a good, clean, healthy, drinking water 
supply.  One might ask in this day and age how it could be 
possible that a community is drawing water from wells that is not 
suitable for drinking and not suitable for washing clothes. There 
are young children and older people in that community. These 
people are living next to the main water supply for the city of 
Halifax.  It passes them by.  It is unbelievable in this day and 
age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been struggling to get funds to enable the project to 
move ahead to get these people hooked up to the central water 
system. We are only asking for a small contribution from the 
federal government for that project, a contribution which could 
have well been handled under the Canada infrastructure works 
program. Because of a slight mix-up the project did not get in 
under that program.  Even money that had been committed by the 
federal government has been taken off the books.  We are 
struggling to get some money to assist with the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the government's priorities?  Cave-in, cave-in, 
cave-in.  That is what is happening with Bill C-55.  The changes 
that have been made to the bill are a cave-in by the government. 
It is an attempt to try to avoid protecting Canadian culture.  If 
we are to be seen as truly proud Canadians, at some point we must 
stand up and be counted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke to an hon. member from the government side who said to 
me just yesterday that it was awful to have to do something one 
does not want to do.  I asked him if he was referring to the 
merchant marines and he said that was right.  I told him that I 
thought it was time he stood and was counted and that he did not 
have to do something he did not want to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was campaigning I said very clearly to my constituents 
that I did not want politics to change me.  If it ever get to a 
point where I will not stand up for what I believe to be right 
and make a decision based upon my conscience and upon what I know 
to be right, I will be ineffective in politics and it is the time 
for me to get out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever we are considering changes to legislation hon. members 
should remember that we have to stand and be counted.  We have to 
base our stand upon the principles we believe in as individuals. 
We have to be true to ourselves if we are to be true at all in 
forming legislation that will be meaningful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those remarks I would say the amendments and changes to the 
bill do nothing to enhance Canadian culture.  They do nothing to 
secure or protect our magazine industry.  I urge all hon. members 
to consider this point, to reject what we call the American deal, 
and to promote a truly positive deal for Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am also pleased to have an opportunity to participate 
in this important debate on Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To follow the words of many of my colleagues in the New 
Democratic Party, I remain firmly committed to our objective of 
preserving and enhancing Canadian culture and see the bill as 
exactly opposite, an anathema to that objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues have done, I would also like to acknowledge the 
work of the hon. member for Dartmouth who has been so vigilant on 
the issue from the beginning. 
She brought her personal involvement in the cultural artistic 
fabric of the nation to the process and the bill, which gives 
them real meaning and definition.  I congratulate her for leading 
our caucus in preserving a sense of meaning around the debate and 
doing everything possible to persuade the Liberal government that 
what it is doing is wrong when it comes to preserving Canadian 
culture.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring us back to what it means when we talk about culture. 
What does Canadian culture mean?  Many others have done the same 
in this debate.  They have tried to talk about how culture is the 
spirit of a nation.  Many others have talked about culture being 
the mirror which reflects the lives, the history and identities 
of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a celebration of everything that is unique, special and 
important about a nation.  It gives expression to our struggles, 
our history, our values, our beliefs, our troubles and our 
moments of ecstasy and joy in the development of a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many have written on this subject.  Many have tried to find the 
words that will impress upon governments everywhere the 
importance of acknowledging what culture is and how important 
cultural policy is in the pursuit of adhering to the true 
definition of culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to a couple of writers who have tried to express what we 
are talking about.  I am drawing on a document produced about a 
year ago by the Canadian Conference of the Arts called the 
“Final Report of the Working Group on Cultural Policy for the 
21st Century”.  I will refer to this document on several 
occasions throughout my speech because it encompasses much of 
what we are all about today, why the bill is so important, and 
why we are so concerned about the direction the government is 
taking us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That report uses quotes from a well known author, essayist and 
novelist, Hugh MacLennan, who said in 1978: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know intuitively that we will become great only when we 
translate our force and knowledge into spiritual and artistic 
terms. Then, and only then, will it matter to mankind whether 
Canada has existed or not. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the essence of what we are talking about today.  We are 
talking about the means by which we can translate our past, our 
present, our hopes and our aspirations into spiritual and 
artistic terms.  Others from all walks of life have tried to 
express these thoughts as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to put on record the quote of a Vancouver 
businessman, David Lemon, who said in 1993: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arts are intrinsic to a sense of nation.  They are intrinsic 
to the cultivation of a shared identity.  They are intrinsic to a 
prosperous economy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that has been overlooked in the debate.  We 
talk about the importance of culture as an expression of our 
inner most feelings and of our history as a nation.  We talk 
about how it is a mirror and how it gives us some identity, but 
we sometimes overlook the value of arts and cultural activities 
in terms of the economy.  Certainly it is a message I would hope 
Reform members are listening to and trying to understand in order 
to rethink their policies when it comes to culture. 
We are not short of studies which show that this whole area of 
the arts and cultural industries is probably one of the most 
labour intensive aspects of our economy and one of the greatest 
contributors to our prosperity as a nation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  It is one of the top five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  My colleague from 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre has reminded me that culture and the 
arts are ranked among the top five contributors to the economic 
life of this country.  There are many spinoff benefits.  There is 
an incredible economic value to this whole sector which we cannot 
ignore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we put together our intrinsic belief in upholding and 
preserving the culture of the nation with the economic benefit, 
surely we have a formula that is beyond reproach in terms of 
support and significance in terms of government action, 
legislation and policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That obviously leads to a strong cultural policy.  It is 
important to note that this country does not have a national 
cultural policy.  For at least 10 years groups like the Canadian 
Conference of the Arts and many others across this country have 
been clamouring at the doorsteps of the government for a national 
cultural policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this day, June 10, 1999, we do not have a national cultural 
policy.  We have seen study after study after study, but no 
action.  Another subcommittee of the heritage committee has just 
completed another cross-country tour trying to find out what 
Canadians think about cultural policy.  It heard the same message 
again and again.  Yes, we need a cultural policy to give meaning 
to what it is that we want to preserve as Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the fact that we are dealing with Bill C-55, I am 
beginning to understand why we may not have a national cultural 
policy.  I am beginning to understand that it may have been a lot 
more difficult for the government to bring in this regressive 
American legislation on the magazine industry of this country if 
it had in place a national cultural policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote again from the policy paper of the Canadian 
Conference of the Arts, which was released in June 1998, just one 
year ago.  It makes a very important point.  It asks the 
question: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do governments exist?  What is the purpose that sustains them 
and gives them the moral and political grounding necessary to 
continue to function?  The essence of the answer is 
sovereignty—the right of a nation to take charge of its own 
destiny and chart its own course through history. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the conference, sovereignty has three key 
components.  The first is political sovereignty, a great deal of 
which we have given up in the course of the last couple of years 
in terms of how this place functions, how many times the 
government has brought in closure, how many times it has bypassed 
parliament, how many times it has said one thing and done 
another, and the list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Canadian Conference of the Arts, another key 
component is economic sovereignty.  We do not have to look too 
far to appreciate just how much we have sold off as a nation, how 
much we have given away, how much we have thrown to the wind in 
the interests of the globalized economy, in the interests of 
large multinational corporations which would like to have access 
to a completely unfettered marketplace without any barriers in 
their way, including such things as a national health care plan, 
which we used to have in this country, including such things as a 
universal pension plan, reasonable unemployment insurance, and I 
could go on to mention any number of areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a third key component of what it means to truly have 
what we all want and that is cultural sovereignty. 
The definition applied to that is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The affirmation of the right of sovereign nations to foster and 
promote the creation, production, distribution and preservation 
of the works of the imagination in their many forms, or artifacts 
and objects of importance to the collective history of the 
citizenry of the nation state, through direct governmental 
measures. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could add, through a proactive government, through a 
government that has the wherewithal and the political will to 
ensure that cultural sovereignty is preserved and is a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Conference of the Arts provides some very good 
words around just how important that is.  It says in its report 
at page 8: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cultural expression reflecting the common and diverse 
experiences, observations and aspirations of the citizens of a 
nation state is central to the creation and maintenance of a 
shared sense of identity and the promotion of understanding among 
diverse elements resident within the same political boundaries. 
Cultural expression builds a sense of common purpose and 
tolerance, and a respect for the differences inherent in peoples 
who have brought to the nation a wide array of distinctive 
traditions, values, and perceptions.  Cultural expression fosters 
and expands the fundamental cohesive elements within a state. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that just about says it all in terms of why we on this 
side of the House are so concerned about the preservation and 
enhancement of Canadian culture and why we are so opposed to Bill 
C-55.  We had an opportunity to use the tools of government to 
ensure that we create that sense of identity, that sense of 
tolerance, that expression of appreciation for all the diversity 
that makes up this nation and we blew it.  In that typical 
scenario of the mouse beside the elephant we allowed ourselves to 
be squashed.  Maybe it is more like the flea on the mouse sitting 
by the elephant.  We allowed ourselves to be squashed, to be 
stamped out.  We could have stood up to our American neighbours 
to the south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take us back a few years to 1986, 1987 and 1988.  At 
that time I happened to be the minister of culture and heritage 
for the province of Manitoba.  I, along with my colleagues in the 
provincial government of Manitoba, as well as many colleagues 
from different parts of the country, worked day in and day out to 
express our concerns about the proposed free trade agreement.  We 
identified at that point that the free trade agreement would be 
dangerous, would be a barrier, would be devastating in our 
pursuit of the preservation of Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope Conservative members are listening.  We were told at that 
time by the Brian Mulroney government of the day not to worry, 
there was an exemption for culture.  We were told that we would 
never lose anything by way of cultural artistic expression in 
this country because there was a strong exemption which would 
prevent any kind of erosion as a result of American actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government had a chance to test the cultural exemption in 
the free trade agreement and the NAFTA.  It could have tested 
that exemption to stand firm on its earlier commitments and to 
show clearly that it was prepared to do everything possible to 
preserve Canadian culture.  It caved in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an indication from the WTO that Canada had a strong 
case. 
There was certainly all kinds of support from the cultural 
community in Canada.  There were all kinds of legal arguments. 
There was all kinds of advice.  There was all kinds of solid 
evidence to suggest that the government use that supposed, 
absolutely rock solid provision which would preserve Canadian 
identity, that exemption for cultural affairs in this country, 
and the government chose not to.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result, as my colleague from Dartmouth said, is a sellout to 
the Americans.  There is no question that Bill C-55, as amended 
by the Senate, according to the wishes of the Americans, 
particularly the giant media magazine corporations in the United 
States, is a sellout.  Others have used the term cave in, but it 
is the same thing because we did have a choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In making the deal on magazines this government has shown that 
it is willing to sacrifice Canadian cultural policy without a 
fight.  When the Americans come back with more threats against 
other cultural initiatives, whether it is Canadian content, 
ownership of our broadcasting industries, subsidizing the CBC or 
even our support for artists through the Canada Council, the 
precedent is set for us to cave in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of taking this opportunity, using that supposed 
wonderful exemption, fighting for and setting a precedent for all 
aspects of Canadian culture, the arts and creative enterprise, 
this government chose to cave in, just like we saw it do on the 
MMT issue.  It could have stood and fought.  It could have shown 
leadership and used the provisions that were available to make 
the case, but because it was threatened, because it was 
intimidated, because there was a question of retaliation, a 
question of suits, a question of financial compensation, the 
government chose to cave in before it had even fought the battle. 
The precedent is set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members opposite not understand why we are so concerned about 
this bill?  Do they not see where it might lead us?  Do they not 
understand how dangerous this can be for the future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not matter whether we are talking about culture, water 
or pharmaceuticals.  Let us not forget what this government did 
when it caved in on pharmaceuticals.  Liberals stood in the House 
before they formed the government in 1993 and said that Brian 
Mulroney was wrong to bring in Bill C-91, which extended patent 
protection to the pharmaceutical giants, because it would give 
profits to those big corporations and hurt the poor and the sick 
in this country.  What did it do?  It caved in to the giant 
pharmaceuticals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today this government is caving in to the giant American based 
magazine industry, and we will all pay the price.  It is not too 
late for the government to reconsider, to understand that it is 
important to stand for Canadian culture.  What we are talking 
about is our very identity, our very traditions around tolerance

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was not intending to speak to this bill, but in listening to 
the NDP, the Liberals and the Tories talk about a national 
cultural policy, it just sounds like something I would hear from 
some socialist communist regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not want government telling them what our culture 
is or government shaping and moulding it.  Government will 
promote and foster what it values and it will unlikely reflect 
the values and culture of its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own view I see this as just a means of social engineering 
society. 
When I hear words like tolerance and values, I believe they are 
code words for “see things the way I see them or you are wrong in 
your views”.  I am very apprehensive about government trying to 
shape and mould culture.  That smacks of a government which 
thinks it knows more than the ordinary people. It is telling us 
what to think, filtering what we will hear and telling us what we 
are going to say.  Generally this is a huge waste of money.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How would a cultural policy reflect the views of Canadians when 
the government that would implement it was elected by 38% of the 
vote? The hon. member talks about how dangerous it is to not 
bring in some strong bill like this.  I think it is much more 
dangerous to get government into moulding culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Reform member 
in making those kinds of comments is insulting just about every 
individual and every organization that has played a part in 
contributing to the quality of life in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The words I used to define culture come directly from the 
working group of the Canadian Conference of the Arts and its 
report on cultural policy for the 21st century.  Those 
organizations together said that Canadian culture is about the 
expression of our common and diverse experiences, observations 
and aspirations.  It is about building a sense of common purpose, 
tolerance and respect for the differences among people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member from the Reform Party suggesting that is not a 
noble goal?  Are we not all here trying to ensure that we are 
tolerant and respectful of one another and trying to build a 
sense of common purpose, trying to ensure that public good takes 
precedence over selfish greed?  Is that not what we are all 
about?  Is that not what culture is all about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform member can insult me all he wants.  But what he has 
just done is insulted the Confederation Centre of the Arts, the 
Canadian Museums Association, the Canadian Book Publishers 
Council, the Specialty and Premium TV Association, Simon Fraser 
University, the Pacific Music Association, the Office for 
Cultural Affairs in the city of Vancouver and on and on. Every 
organization involved in this field has been absolutely committed 
to do the opposite of what the Reform Party is suggesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Saskatchewan has just said to me, maybe 
that is why the Reform Party is at 9% or 10% in the polls.  The 
most important thing for us today is to get beyond where Reform 
is coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote once more from the Canadian Conference of the Arts 
paper: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When cultural sovereignty is eroded, lost or subsumed within 
narrow political or ideological objectives the nation state is 
deprived of one of the most compelling bonds of nationhood.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the member give her speech and my colleague make his 
comments.  In any country of the world where culture has been a 
forced issue, in other words where a government or some group has 
been forcing culture upon any group of people, it does not work. 
That is quite obvious in history.  A recent case is the Soviet 
Union where culture and politics were forced upon people and we 
all know what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the NDP member like to comment on that?  She quoted from a 
study done by a group of people who in my opinion are forcing a 
culture upon Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when one has 
blinkers on, I suppose it is very hard to understand what we are 
talking about when we propose a cultural policy for this country 
and when we express our opposition to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the member to know that no one is trying to force 
anything down anyone's throat. 
Whenever members of the Reform Party have difficulty with 
something, they like to portray it that way.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about forcing anything on anyone.  We are 
talking about the fact that it is very hard as Canadians to 
compete with the Americans to the south of us.  It requires 
proactive government.  It requires us to do whatever we can to 
support the artistic cultural fabric of this nation. Otherwise it 
will be stamped out and I would hope that the Reform Party is not 
suggesting that for one moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I think the member is twisting what we are saying. We 
support museums and all the various groups around the country

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  That does not sound like a point of

</I></B></P><P align=left>On questions and comments, I will go to the hon. member for 
Surrey Central.  He has not had a chance to do that yet. 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I heard the hon. member preaching about what Canadian culture is 
and how it should be dealt with.  She mentioned imposing culture 
on all Canadians.  She should commend the Reform Party which 
believes in the equality of all citizens.  We believe that every 
community has the right to promote their culture, but it is not 
up to the government to promote Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member if taking God out of the constitution is 
the culture she wants to promote, as an hon. member from her 
party is trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad the 
member for Surrey Central said I was preaching. I certainly feel 
as if that is what I am doing today.  I am preaching to people 
who have yet to be converted to just what it means to have an 
expression of who we are as a nation, to be able to share that 
with the world, to be able to pass it on to our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand the gist of the question as posed. To do 
anything but what we are proposing today would be to say let 
American culture rule the day; let us stamp out all of our unique 
expressions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the whole question of economics, we are not 
talking about wasting money and causing taxpayers extra burden. 
We are talking about the opposite.  The member should know that 
the largest subsidy to the cultural life of Canada comes not from 
government, corporations or other patrons, but from the artists 
themselves through their unpaid or underpaid labour.  When 
creative activity is diminished because many artists are unable 
to earn a decent living, something is lost to all of us and our 
entire culture fails to fulfil its promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to 
correct the record.  We support museums and we support various 
groups around the country promoting their culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member is, are we not Canadian and do we not 
have a culture without government trying to get involved in 
shaping it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier 
to the member for Surrey Central, I think the members of the 
Reform Party by their words are suggesting that we give it up and 
allow the American culture to dominate everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier we are simply trying to create the climate 
with every tool possible provided by government to support the 
unique aspect of Canadian culture, to ensure that we can express 
what is unique about being Canadians to the rest of our society 
and to the world. 
I cannot think of a more noble objective if we are truly 
interested in preserving any sense of nationhood and allowing our 
children to understand exactly what it means to be Canadian and 
all of the history that has been before us.

notions.

the Yugoslav generals signed an agreement last night, since 
ratified by a UN resolution today, that clears the way for 
implementing a peace plan in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bombing has been suspended.  Yugoslav security forces are

extend its congratulations to our Canadian Armed Forces that have 
done us proud once again and to our NATO allies for this great

agreement? 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. 
That is exactly the reason I wanted the occasion at 3 o'clock to 
make a statement extending congratulations to our soldiers who 
have done an excellent job there and to the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked with President Clinton and Prime Minister Blair earlier 
this morning.  There will be more to say when I give my 
statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this occasion to thank the parties in the House of 
Commons for the support they have given to the position of the 
government.  Despite the differences we might have, when there is 
a question of principle like this we have shown that we can be 
united and stand strong and firm in defence of the values which 
are so dear to Canadian people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the maintenance and enforcement of the Kosovo peace 
agreement, including the protection of returning refugees, is 
very much dependent on the success now of the peacekeeping 
operation which must take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The peacekeeping forces, now under a UN mandate, will roll into 
Kosovo within days and Canada will be among them.  Canadians 
would now like to know the details of what our troops will be 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the defence minister what specific role our troops will be 
called upon to fulfil and how long we can expect them to be in 
Kosovo. 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the initial group that will go into 
Kosovo, hopefully tomorrow, will involve approximately 100 
Canadians who will accompany the British fourth brigade.  They 
will be the engineers who will go in to help clear the roadways 
and routes for the troops who will follow them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a reconnaissance contingent.  Part of them are 
already in Macedonia.  Some of them are leaving Greece where they 
picked up the equipment, the Coyotes, the helicopters, et cetera, 
and will now be moving them in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I expect the full contingent of 800 will be there in just a 
matter of days.  They will stay there until the peace and 
security for the people of Kosovo are secured and the refugees 
can return to their homes safely. 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the estimated number of peacekeepers required to enforce 
the Kosovo peace agreement continues to increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The defence minister has talked about sending more than the 
current 800 Canadian ground troops to Kosovo, despite warnings 
from the chief of defence staff and other military experts that 
say our forces are already stretched to the limit and that any 
further commitments are unrealistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the defence minister now confirm whether or not he intends 
to make further commitments to Kosovo and, if so, where he 
proposes to get those resources? 
<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

There are a number of aspects of it that require examination, 
including what would fit in with the team in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many countries contributing to the NATO core UN 
authorized team.  They need to provide complementary skills and 
roles.  We are looking to see what is possible in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me at the same time say that those who have been there to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
every minister in every circumstance has sought the opinion of

followed.  He has made himself readily available for press 
questioning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Mr. Wilson is doing a good job.  Before him, the 
position did not exist; now there is someone who can speak on

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canadians need 
more than the Prime Minister's word to believe his claims of his 
integrity.  They need more than the word of an ethics counsellor 
who has no independence, no clout and no teeth.  They are not 
getting real answers from the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I ask the Prime Minister, will he take politics out 
of the search for the truth and ask the auditor general to review 
these three projects? 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the auditor general is supposed to look at all projects. 
It is his job.  He is paid for that.  He reports to the House of 
Commons four times a year.  We have extended the possibility for 
the auditor general, who had to report only once a year, to 
report four times a year.  He is free to look at any operation of 
any department anytime he wants. 
<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when HRDC 
withholds 363 pages of my access to information requests on 
Pierre Thibault and Yvon Duhaime, the government cannot claim 
full disclosure.  When the Liberal industry committee chair 
prevents the Prime Minister's trustee from testifying in public, 
the government cannot claim full disclosure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister is innocent of these charges, why is he

that has to first be approved by the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have access to information documents that show the 
following:  Aerospatial Globax received $2 million in grants on 
the eve of the election and then gave a $4,000 donation to the 
Prime Minister's campaign.  Confections St. Elie got a $285,000 
grant from the same program on the eve of the election and then 
gave a $1,500 donation to the Prime Minister's campaign.

these grants and donations to the Prime Minister's campaign? 
<P><A NAME="LINK165"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

contributes any money above $100 we have to make it public, so 
there is absolutely no link. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I should see if there are any members of parliament, 
especially of the Reform Party, who have worked to receive grants 
from the government and who have received donations in the past 
that are legal under our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a long list of Reform Party members who have benefited 
from those programs, and in doing that they have just done their 
job, which is to work for their constituencies. 
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
challenge the Prime Minister to find one who sold a money losing 
hotel to his grant recipient before the thing was approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Megatech Electric also got a government grant under the 
transitional jobs fund and it also gave money to the Prime

</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that there is just one happy coincidence after another 
for the Prime Minister.  There are millions of dollars in

the vote release, there will be two or three parties on the

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that when a contract is given to somebody who has bid 
$6.5 million, when the second bid was $9 million, the government 
was right to give it to the lowest bidder.  I understand that the

million.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health is responsible for the safety of Canada's

up to the police to decide whether or not to lay charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned, the action as reported in the 
newspapers was clearly irresponsible and unacceptable. 
According to the newspapers, the individual lied on the 
Héma-Québec forms.  He answered no when he should have answered 
yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently, Héma-Québec has taken action to ensure that the blood

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the blood 
has already been used.  If the answer had been yes on the 
questionnaire we could have held the blood back for three weeks 
and made sure it was safe by re-testing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This minister is responsible.  This minister had a blood scandal

<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the reality is that Héma-Québec provided a form to a potential 
donor.  The donor was asked questions and, according to news 
reports, answered dishonestly, with the result that blood was 
taken onboard and then put into the system.  The form was 
prepared and distributed in accordance with the way we do things 
in this country.  We ask people who are giving blood to tell the 
facts and we act on that.  That is good practice.  If someone 
lies, there is not much we can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Héma-Québec is tracing the blood, trying to get it out of 
circulation.  It is taking every reasonable step to make sure 
that no one is harmed by this event.

that farmers gave nothing back to the country in the good years, 
implying that they should receive no help today.  However, 
farmers have shared their hard-earned profits through excessive 
Liberal taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister goes out there, is he going to also meet with

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

that in bad years they should be withdrawing those NISA dollars 
because they are bad years.  That is the purpose of the program.

the same message. It is a critical situation.  It is being

<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Marine Atlantic ferry service in Newfoundland is in crisis. 
Traffic and freight backlogs are causing havoc.  Tourism, an 
important growth industry in the province, is being hampered 
every day by an inadequate ferry system between the isle of 
Newfoundland and the mainland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Newfoundland tourism minister, a Liberal, has said  “the 
four Liberal MPs from Newfoundland are sleepwalking through this 
debate”.  He has called on them publicly to come out of their 
comas and do what is right for Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the transport minister prepared to commit today to the 
purchase of a new ferry as the wide awake Liberals in 
Newfoundland have recommended? 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there is a bit of a silver lining in this.  The fact 
is the pressure on Marine Atlantic is due to the increase in 
tourism to Newfoundland as a direct result of the buoyant economy 
and the policies of this government.  However, this does pose 
quite a challenge as to capacity requirements. We are reviewing 
it.  Over the summer I propose to go to Newfoundland, travel on 
the ferry, meet with the workers, and learn firsthand what has to 
be done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
section 32 of the terms of union between Canada and Newfoundland 
commits Canada to maintain a suitable passenger and freight 
service between Port-aux-Basques and Sydney.  Does the Liberal 
government believe that the current cattle car level of service 
lives up to this commitment by the Canadian government, or is the 
minister willing to accept his responsibility and purchase the 
ferry that is available to give Newfoundland the service that it 
deserves? 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I said, Marine Atlantic is assessing its capacity 
requirements and that could include getting a new ferry. We just 
do not make knee-jerk decisions based on political requests of 
the opposition.  What we do is thoroughly analyse the demand. We 
will do that and that may mean a new ferry, but we will do things 
in an orderly systematic fashion.

Speaker, members of the House will be aware that today NATO has 
decided to suspend its air campaign against the Federal Republic

adopted a resolution which set the term for an end to the 
conflict in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This paves the way for the establishment of a peacekeeping force 
led by NATO and for the return of refugees to their homes in 
peace and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a great day for the values that we have been fighting 
for in the world.  This is a great day for the stability and 
security of Europe.  This is a great day for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our NATO partners knew that they could count on Canada, as they 
did every time European democracies have resisted the brutal 
force of tyranny throughout this century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During 78 days, our fine Canadian pilots risked their lives to 
accomplish their duty in the name of Canadian values.  Our 
efforts were not limited to military action.  Canada played a 
central role in the diplomatic effort to find a peaceful solution 
to the conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Patiently we worked through the G-8 and bilaterally to bring 
Russia to understand our action and to play a constructive role 
in dealing with the Yugoslav regime.  In the end, Russia was a 
peace-broker and this country deserves the gratitude of the 
international community. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the request of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Canada 
welcomed over 5,000 refugees from Kosovo.  Canadians demonstrated 
again that they spontaneously open their arms and their hearts to 
those who suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made important contributions to the work of relief agencies 
assisting the refugees in countries neighbouring Kosovo: Albania 
and Macedonia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is an important milestone in the search for a solution to 
the Kosovo crisis, but we are aware that a gigantic task remains 
ahead of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us have no illusion. 
While we are confident that the agreement between NATO and the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the obligations set by the 
security council will be respected, we remain realistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the Yugoslav regime betray its commitments many 
times before.  I call on the Yugoslav authorities to fully 
respect all the provisions of the resolution.  But until the last 
Yugoslav soldiers and policemen have left Kosovo, and until the 
international peacekeeping force is firmly in control, there 
remains a possibility that hostilities will return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our most urgent task is to monitor the departure of the Yugoslav 
forces and to deploy the peacekeeping force without delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another key element of the peace plan and the UN Security Council 
resolution is the demilitarization of the Kosovo liberation army. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We welcome the commitment of the Kosovo leadership to fulfil this

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to confirm that the Canadian contingent of the KFOR 
is on its way to Kosovo, and will be ready to move in within 
days.  The challenges and risks that our peacekeepers will face 
will be real and we wish them Godspeed in their important work to 
secure and stabilize Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the peacekeeping force is deployed in Kosovo, we will start 
to organize the return of refugees, build democratic 
institutions, work toward confidence and reconciliation, and 
reconstruct the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will participate in this effort within international 
organizations such as the United Nations, the OSCE and the World 
Bank, and through its own bilateral assistance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be no sustainable peace in Kosovo, and elsewhere in 
the former Yugoslavia, without justice.  Canada has strongly 
argued for the provisions of the UN Security Council resolution, 
which facilitate the work of the International Criminal Tribunal 
for the former Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tribunal's role will be indispensable in building confidence 
in a just settlement in Kosovo, one in which the perpetrators of 
crimes against humanity will be held accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has supported the tribunal's efforts in other parts of the 
former Yugoslavia and will continue to do so in Kosovo.  Earlier 
this week we already announced that we were contributing a team 
of forensic experts to assist the tribunal's investigations 
there. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not a war against the Serbian people.  Canada remembers 
that for years Yugoslavia was a friend.  We fought alongside 
Yugoslavia in the struggle against tyranny during two world wars. 
Our friendship with Yugoslavia has deep roots and could be 
revived easily, but this friendship did not extend and will never 
extend to a regime that adopted the thinking and the methods of 
the tyrants of the Europe of the 1930s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sincerely hope that Yugoslavia will soon be re-integrated 
into the community of democratic nations sharing the values on 
which the Euro-Atlantic nations are based.  We stretch out our 
hand to the Yugoslav people.  We will be pleased to offer them 
assistance for democratization, the economic reforms and the 
reconstruction of Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, before this can happen, major changes will have to 
happen in that country.  First and foremost, the leadership of 
Yugoslavia will have to change.  Five of the leaders of the 
country, including President Milosevic, are indicted by the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.  They 
are entitled to a fair trial and I hope they will seize that 
occasion to defend themselves, paving the way for new leadership 
to take the helm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision of the UN security council is a recognition of the 
human dimension of international peace and security,  From Rwanda 
to Kosovo, there is mounting evidence that internal conflicts not 
only crush human security but also threaten to destabilize entire 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that humanitarian and human rights concerns are not 
just internal matters.  Canada has fought for this issue to be 
given new weight in the international community and, in 
particular, in the United Nations.  We believe that the agreement 
reached today in the council is an important step toward a 
broader definition of security by the international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we are at the end of a terrible crisis that has caused 
problems for many of us, I would like to thank all the members of 
the House for their candour, the expression of their views and 
the support of the parties for the cause we were defending and 
the values that we believe in. 
This is a very good way for members of parliament to go back home 
to their constituents, who showed confidence in them during the 
last election.   Members will be able to show them that 
collectively we have participated in a big move forward to make 
sure human security and human rights are preserved around the 
globe in a new fashion in the future.

expressing the profound relief and thankfulness of the members of

temporary peace has been achieved in Kosovo and a temporary peace 
which we hope and pray will become a lasting peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been noted earlier today, the bombing has been suspended, 
Yugoslav troops are pulling out of Kosovo, hundreds of thousands 
of refugees hopefully are preparing to return home and a 
peacekeeping force with a UN mandate, including Canadians, will 
soon roll into Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said during question period, it is a day to extend our 
profound thanks and appreciation to NATO and those brave 
Canadians who served with NATO for this great achievement.  This 
is also the time to express our thanks and appreciation to those 
moderate Serbs who, under very difficult conditions, have brought 
pressures to bear on their own government to accept this 
proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to suggest that this is also an appropriate time to pause 
and measure our progress toward peace in the Balkans against the 
objectives that we set for ourselves when this conflict first 
began. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The moral objective of NATO and Canada's involvement has always 
been to halt the ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the Yugoslav 
government and to care for the victims of Serb aggression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The political objective has been to create a safe home for all 
the Kosovars in the region and to stabilize relations between 
Kosovo and the Republic of Yugoslavia and its neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The military objective, which was set at the beginning, was to 
damage the military capability of the Yugoslav government to 
carry out ethnic cleansing and hopefully drive it to the 
bargaining table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Measured against the scale of those three objectives, we can now 
say with some confidence that the military objective has been 
achieved, that the moral objective has been at least temporarily 
achieved, and that the great challenge now before us is to 
achieve the political objective of creating a safe home for all 
Kosovars in the region and the basis of a lasting peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to suggest that achieving this political objective will 
be an even greater test of our ingenuity, our resources and our 
determination than achieving the military objective. However, we 
cannot turn back now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will raise a question:  Are there any lessons which Canada can 
learn from our participation in this NATO exercise thus far and 
which call for follow-up action by the government and this 
parliament?  Let me suggest two lessons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first lesson is that years of neglect and mismanagement of 
our armed forces by this government and others have left us and 
our armed forces personnel in an unacceptable position.  Canada 
has had great difficulty in mustering the minimal resources 
required to be an active participant in this NATO operation.  If 
we are called upon to do more or to sustain another peacekeeping 
operation somewhere else in the world at the same time, it would 
simply be beyond our capability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore call on the government to address this problem in a 
meaningful way immediately as well as in the next throne speech 
and budget if it is our intention to be a real player in 
maintaining world peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second lesson to be learned from this Kosovo crisis, and 
this was referred to by numerous members during the take-note 
debate, is the very real need to create a better legal framework 
for multinational actions against inhuman acts by the governments 
of the sovereign state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Kosovo case, NATO took the initiative to halt ethnic 
cleansing and to restore regional stability in an area of the 
world where NATO countries have a strategic interest.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN mandate to send in peacekeepers came after the NATO 
initiative, although I think many of us would have preferred if 
it had come before.  The question still remains on what grounds 
should other states be permitted to intervene in the affairs of a 
sovereign state.  How are such interventions to be regulated in 
law so as to permit multinational efforts to stop ethnic 
cleansing as in Kosovo but also to safeguard against the abuse of 
the right to intervene? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most thoughtful speech given in the Chamber on this subject 
was given by Václav Havel, President of the Czech Republic, when 
he addressed the Chamber on April 29.  Dr. Havel's convictions, 
like those of Nelson Mandela's, are not only sound because they 
are well reasoned but are sound and acceptable because he has 
suffered so much for those convictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Havel told the House, and he was applauded by all members 
when he said it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the state is a human creation, humanity is a creation of 
God. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From that premise he reasoned that human rights rank above the 
rights of states and human liberties constitute a higher value 
than state sovereignty.  He said in reference to NATO actions in 
the Balkans: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has now been clearly stated that it is not permissible to 
slaughter people, to evict them from their homes, to maltreat 
them and to deprive them of their property.  It has been 
demonstrated that human rights are indivisible and if injustice 
is done to some, it is done to all. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He then went on to justify NATO military action in the Balkans 
on the grounds that in this instance protecting human rights 
should take precedence over respecting the rights of states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to suggest that the challenge for the future is therefore 
to find a framework in international law which provides for 
international intervention in the affairs of sovereign states, if 
those states persist in violating basic human rights, while at 
the same time ensuring that international law does not permit 
alleged violations of human rights to become an excuse for one 
group of states to attack the sovereignty of another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in most issues involving human rights and the rights of 
states, the challenge will be to find the right balance, and 
finding the right balance is a task for which the country has a 
peculiar talent.  This is a challenge which all of us must 
address in the months ahead so that the tragedy of the Balkans is 
not repeated in other parts of the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We can only hope that the Yugoslav president will honour his 
commitments, although this has not been his wont. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that we have nothing against the Serbs, the 
only enemy of humanity is the Milosevic regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will 
rejoin the community of nations as soon as possible.  There is 
no doubt that the NATO action was justified by the necessity to 
see human rights win out over barbarism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore supported the government's resolution to endorse 
the NATO air strikes, even if we are as opposed to the use of 
force as many other Quebecers.  This resolution was not, 
however, a good representation of the need to find short, medium 
and long term solutions to the political problem behind the 
conflict between the Kosovar people and the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent months we have witnessed one of the most disturbing 
human tragedies since the second world war: ethnic cleansing, 
deportation and dispossession of close to one million Kosovars, 
who have been deprived on both a number of civil rights and 
their right to self-government by the Milosevic regime for some 
ten years now.  This is what has led to the tragedy we now see 
unfolding before our very eyes daily on our television screens.

</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is now cause for celebration: the war and destruction 
are over, and the era of peace and reconstruction is beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can this peace be built? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of problematic issues must be addressed and complex 
political challenges faced, for the political stability of the 
entire Balkan region is at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, there are many questions yet to be resolved 
concerning the status of what is legally a Serb province, which 
will come under the administration of the United Nations, and an 
international military protectorate.  Under what conditions will 
the return of the Kosovar refugees from Albania, Macedonia, 
Bosnia, Montenegro and all of the other countries that have, 
along with Canada, opened their doors to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, with all the abuse and atrocities perpetrated by the 
Serbian troops and soldiers in Kosovo, there is no question of 
putting the Albanian Kosovar population at the mercy of the Serb 
political powers in Belgrade yet again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen to the charges of war crimes and crimes against 
humanity against Slobodan Milosevic and his acolytes by the 
international criminal court? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Yugoslav government benefit from international 
reconstruction aid that will be offered while President 
Milosevic is in power? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will Montenegro take advantage of its courageous position 
against the Milosevic regime in recent months and decide its 
status freely or will we abandon Montenegro to its fate and 
allow the Serbian president to tighten his grip on this tiny 
republic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen to the ethnic minorities in all of the 
countries in the region? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased that the UN has finally played a role in 
resolving the Kosovo crisis. Unfortunately, the UN has shown 
itself incapable, initially, of preventing Serbia from violating 
the collective and human rights of the Kosovars and of finding a 
quick solution to the conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proves two things. First, the UN is incapable, in its 
present form, of resolving regional conflicts and that its 
institutions and its operations must be significantly reformed. 
Canada should call for such a reform as a member of the UN 
Security Council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it proves that, in the absence of such reform, regional 
or intergovernmental military organizations will increasingly 
have to take whatever action they deem necessary to ensure 
international security and the respect of human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The triumph of the democratic countries will reaffirm that we 
are moving into a new era of international law in which despots, 
tyrants, terrorists and dictators have to understand that they 
no longer have the immunity they thought they enjoyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, charging Slobodan Milosevic will remind those 
responsible for crimes against humanity, torture or terrorism 
that they cannot escape justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude, let me return to the proposals I made in 
April. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As quickly as possible, following the reinstatement of the 
individuals and collective rights of the Kosovar people, I 
suggest that Canada, with other members of the Organization on 
Security and Co-operation in Europe, the OSCE, promote an 
international conference on the status and rights of ethnic 
minorities in Europe, and specifically in the Balkans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short term we must also target the sources of instability 
in the Balkans, namely the difficult economic situation of the 
countries in the region and the feeling of exclusion from major 
European political institutions.  In this regard, we must 
recognize the wisdom of the position adopted in early April by 
the foreign ministers of the European Community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These countries agreed to set up a fund of at least 250 million 
Euros to establish a security pact for the Balkans.  This fund 
for Balkan countries would be tied to partnership agreements 
with the European community, including on issues such as 
economic assistance and trade privileges.  So, this is a step in 
the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following that, we will have to go further and integrate 
interested Balkan countries into the European community and 
NATO. This is necessary to ensure Europe's stability, the 
region's prosperity and the security of Europe's economic and 
military partners.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
colleagues in the New Democratic Party and I share with all 
Canadians the immense relief that the terrible conflict in Kosovo 
is drawing to a close.  A peace settlement has been signed. 
Yugoslav forces are withdrawing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party wished for and worked for an earlier suspension of the 
bombing, and we regret that did not happen.  However today we are 
immensely relieved that the NATO bombing campaign has been 
suspended at long last. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hope that the Yugoslav withdrawal and the 
demilitarization of the KLA proceeds rapidly.  During the 
withdrawal and its aftermath, let all civilians in Kosovo, 
Albanian and Serb, be spared further harm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hope with the entry of the peacekeeping force into Kosovo 
that the creation of a common security and the rebuilding of 
basic physical, economic and social infrastructure will enable 
the Kosovo refugees to return safely and swiftly to their homes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to 
the members of the Canadian forces, who have served faithfully 
during this conflict and who are now going to take part in the 
peacekeeping force about to enter Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These women and men have run great risks in performing their 
duty and their families have made sacrifices that deserve our 
heartfelt thanks. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also pay tribute to other public servants who have worked 
with the refugees in the Balkans and with the many aid workers in 
non-governmental agencies who have done their best to help the 
refugees faced with this terrible humanitarian disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from visiting with refugee families in the province of 
Nova Scotia the gratitude that they themselves feel for the 
assistance and the support provided to them in their hour of 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The beginning of the Yugoslav withdrawal and today's suspension 
of the bombing are only the first step in a long journey toward a 
true peace settlement and true human security.  The challenge of 
ensuring the safe return and resettlement for all Kosovo 
civilians lies ahead.  The massive destruction inflicted in 
Kosovo and the rest of Yugoslavia must be repaired.  The economic 
and social institutions of the entire region must be rebuilt and 
revitalized.  War crimes must be investigated and prosecuted 
where indicated by the International Criminal Tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A temporary civilian administration must be established in 
Kosovo, and beyond that a permanent political settlement 
recognizing the legitimate rights and interests of all peoples of 
the region must be achieved.  Let us make no mistake about it. 
This will be an enormous task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we urge the Government of Canada to provide leadership in 
this economic, social and political reconstruction process.  We 
urge the Government of Canada as well to play a leading role in 
the essential redefining and reconstruction of our international 
institutions, because above all else this conflict demonstrates 
how currently incapable and ill equipped the United Nations is 
today to help resolve and, where necessary, to intervene in civil 
conflict taking place within the borders of a sovereign state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO intervened in this humanitarian disaster in part due to 
that fact.  As this terrible conflict moves to the reconstruction 
now necessary, let us redouble our efforts to ensure that in 
future neither NATO nor any other military alliance acts outside 
of the sanctions of the United Nations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now set to work to reform and revitalize the United 
Nations so that it is able to deal more effectively and less 
catastrophically with future humanitarian crises that arise in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have in Canada a proud history of successful international 
innovation and international achievement.  We have a large 
internationalist community with considerable expertise, ready and 
eager to contribute to the project of creating the conditions and 
the instruments to secure and maintain peace in the world.  We 
call on the government to make use of these resources as it works 
with the international community on these vital questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us as parliamentarians, in concert with others around the 
world who value peace and human security, learn the lessons of 
this conflict.  Surely we have learned that while there are 
international emergencies such as this one, where the horrors of 
the humanitarian crisis require military intervention as a last 
resort, such military intervention always carries with it grave 
threats to the lives of innocent civilians, to the environment, 
and grave risks of catastrophic escalation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make it a central task of the international 
reconstruction to face up to the difficult ethical dilemmas 
involved in such crises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada and others in the international community take up 
these challenges and can find ways to respond more effectively to 
such grotesque human rights violations, this conflict can be seen 
as the beginning of an era when the international community 
recognizes its responsibilities and finds effective means to 
defend human rights and secure peace in our global human family.

<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, I want to sincerely thank the Prime Minister for 
taking the time today to make a statement in the House.  That is 
greatly appreciated. We also greatly appreciate him taking the 
time to hear all of the speeches by the leaders of each party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to congratulate the men and women of the 
Canadian forces who will be called into action.  While we in 
parliament are about to begin our break, the men and women of 
the Canadian forces assigned to the KFOR will not be getting any 
break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should however point out a number of elements that merit 
consideration and solution as well, I hope.  There have been 
some slip-ups in the way this House was involved right from the 
start of this conflict.  Parliament ought to have taken a vote 
and held a real debate.  Unfortunately, it did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That did not keep us from supporting the government's position, 
but I believe the government needs to learn some lessons from 
this.  I hope that the situation will never be repeated, but 
should another armed conflict arise, I hope that the government 
will realize, as I said in the first debate when this conflict 
started, that the parliamentarians here are the best tool of the 
government.  The best allies of the government are here in this 
House.  I trust that the government will bear this in mind next 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, parliament could have got involved much earlier 
and gradually more as the conflict unfolded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, as a member of NATO, may have won the war, as it were, 
but this is the first time Canada has been at war without a UN 
mandate since the second world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Korean war was fought under a clear mandate by the United 
Nations.  The Gulf war was fought under a United Nations 
mandate.  Ever since that organization was created, all 
engagements by this country's peace forces since the end of the 
second world war have been by UN mandate.  This is the first 
time Canada has ever been at war without any UN mandate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's credibility since the second world war needs 
rebuilding. Its credibility as a peacekeeper, as a vehicle of 
conciliation, and as one of the best channels for diplomacy and 
political solutions, has taken two beatings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's credibility as a peacekeeper needs to be restored, as 
does the credibility of the UN, which failed to foresee the 
strikes and to provide solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time there is war in the Balkans. Never 
was the UN involved, until afterwards. The international 
community was not involved in Slovenia or Croatia. 
There was also Bosnia, where 250,000 people died before the 
international community decided to get involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the history of the Balkans is riddled with serious 
problems. Did we take specific action in this country to try to 
find solutions ahead of time? Reports of both 
governments—Conservative and Liberal—said, when the Dayton treaty 
was signed, that the next problem in the Balkans would be 
Kosovo. They knew it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of National Defence knew it. It had specific 
reports. Canadian soldiers and observers have been in Kosovo for 
a long time. They knew what was happening, but nothing was done 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Montenegro is another place in the Balkans where problems may 
arise. 
It is clear in the agreement that was signed—we hope it was 
clear—that the Serbian army cannot leave Kosovo and move into 
Montenegro in order to topple the government there, which has 
NATO's support. The Montenegro government requested an 
international force there. It did not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement signed excludes the presence of any international 
force in Montenegro. I hope that they will make every effort to 
ensure there are no more dead in the Balkans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that Canada will again assume its role as a leader in 
diplomacy and peace, and not as a leader in war. I hope that 
this will happen very soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also salute the men and women going to Kosovo and we will 
pray hard for them. 
From the beginning of the conflict, and until June 3 in fact, 
the official position of the Canadian government was the 
disarmament of the KLA.  Now, we know that what they have in 
mind is nothing more than demilitarization.  Heavy arms will be 
taken away from Albanian KLA troops, but they will still be 
armed.  We know that Canadian forces will be in the Kosovo 
region, where there is a very large Serb population.  Canadian 
troops will therefore be at great risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to support the government.  I hope that the 
government will continue to support the former mission, which I 
hope will still be valid, namely keeping the peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going to war is easy.  The war in Kosovo marks the first 
offensive war Canada has won, unlike the gulf war, which was not 
an offensive operation.  Canada has won a war. 
Are there people celebrating in the streets?  Is this the kind 
of war we are looking at now?  Are people completely indifferent 
to what is going on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this bears thinking about.  Let us resume our leadership of 
peace, not war.

<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the House sees its way to 
complete consideration of the Senate amendments to Bill C-55, the 
magazine bill, and Bill C-49, the land claims bill, today or 
tomorrow, and I say hopefully today, I will consult my fellow 
House leaders about the possibility of commencing the summer 
adjournment without further delay.  If these bills are not 
concluded then of course we will have to complete them next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that it is the intention of the government to follow 
the sequence I have just enumerated along with the bills I will 
now enumerate either this week, next week, or when the House 
resumes in the fall, whichever is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intention at this time would be Bill C-54, the electronic 
commerce and privacy legislation; Bill C-68, the youth justice 
bill, as I indicated a little earlier today; Bill C-56, the 
Manitoba claims bill; Bill C-48, the marine parks legislation; 
and Bill C-63, the new citizenship act.  These are important 
bills for the government to take the opportunity to debate 
whether that means we sit longer or in the fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we adjourn this week, these items will be given a high 
priority in the autumn.  As hon. members are already aware, when 
the House returns in the autumn the government will be asking 
parliament to deal on a high priority with legislation ratifying 
the Nisga'a agreement. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to take advantage of this opportunity to thank all 
hon. members, including the House leaders, the members for 
Langley-Abbotsford, Roberval, Winnipeg-Transcona and 
Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough for their constructive participation 
in helping the House of Commons do its work effectively, with 
the help, of course, of their respective whips. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want express my appreciation to the hon. member for 
Peterborough, whose performance as my parliamentary secretary 
for the last two years stands as a major contribution to the 
good operation of this House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last few days members have been particularly kind in 
offering me words of congratulations about an event which will 
occur next week, namely the fact that I will be receiving a 
degree in history from the University of Waterloo, a little 
secret I hid from most of us for 11 years.  I guess it is my own 
personal way of countering the brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the kind notes that were sent to me by hon. 
members, by the people at the table and by others in the House 
who were similarly kind in sending me notes and expressing kind 
words.  I do not deserve that praise.  I appreciate it enormously 
however. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I can leave one message for everyone, I do not want anyone to 
think this was impossible or nearly impossible.  That would be 
the wrong message.  The right message, I believe respectfully, is 
that given the time constraints and if I were able to do it 
countless Canadians could also work to improve their adult 
education.  I invite all of them to do so for their own 
satisfaction and the future of their careers.

and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys,

the closing moments of the debate on Bill C-55, an act respecting 
advertising services supplied by foreign periodical publishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to acknowledge the tremendous work that has been done by 
the hon. member for Dartmouth.  She has been one of the few 
voices in the House of Commons that has actually spoken out and 
described this legislation for what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is a sellout.  I think it is fair to say that 
today is a retreat.  We are surrendering to the American forces 
on this issue.  I tried to think of an appropriate way for 
members of parliament particularly at this time to accept a 
Liberal negotiating position.  What could that be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would simply walk around for the next little while looking 
like prisoners because we have surrendered to the Americans. We 
have surrendered to American pressure.  If we want to demonstrate 
the appropriate way to be in the House of Commons whenever we 
talk about something to do with the United States, we would 
strike the appropriate pose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appropriate way to speak on any issue dealing with the 
United States would be on our knees. This is the Liberal 
negotiating position. We are on our knees doing a variety of 
things.  At the moment I am just going to speak about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen this surrender to the United States on a whole set 
of issues.  We started off a little while back with 
pharmaceuticals.  We caved in to the American pharmaceutical 
lobby.  Bill C-91 gave 20 year patent protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember Bill S-9. For some reason the Government of Canada 
decided that Canadians who contributed to American charities or 
to American university fundraising campaigns should get a 
Canadian tax deduction.  One has to admit that it is pretty crazy 
when tax deductions are given to Canadians who contribute to 
American universities and colleges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will just resume the pose to go to the softwood lumber issue. 
Once again a lot of us, particularly those of us in British 
Columbia, could stand this way.  We would be handcuffed because 
we are essentially prisoners of war to the United States.  We had 
a free trade deal with the United States, or so we were told. 
Then it came to dealing with softwood lumber and the government 
caved in again to the softwood lumber lobby. Now we have to 
accept quotas on our softwood lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently we looked at the Pacific salmon treaty.  We got 
down on our hands and knees again, went down to Washington and 
again caved in to American pressure.  We gave away our coho 
stocks. At this rate we are going to wear out the knees of our 
pants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we got into the plutonium shipments.  The Americans wanted 
to ship plutonium to Canada in order to dispose of it. We agreed 
and caved in again to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next it was the willingness of the Canadian government to allow 
American warships with nuclear weaponry to enter Canadian waters. 
This was despite the fact that British Columbians had almost 
universally passed legislation saying that British Columbia and 
British Columbian territorial waters were a nuclear-free zone. 
The Government of Canada said it was going to ignore that.  It 
was on the Americans' side, not on the British Columbians' side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again we have seen the government cave in. The 
appropriate way to deal with American related issues is on our 
knees.  There is no point standing up.  We might as well be on 
our knees, wearing out the knees of our pants, going down to 
Washington and saying that this is the appropriate position for 
the Canadian negotiators.

access to fresh water. 
The House passed a unanimous motion to call for an immediate 
moratorium on freshwater exports.  Did that happen?  No.  We ran 
down to the United States and said “Let us set up a committee to 
study ways and means of exporting water from Canada to the United 
States”.  This is embarrassing.

order.  There comes a time when grandstanding and this kind of 
behaviour should perhaps be ruled on. Mr. Speaker, the point of 
order is— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I accept the fact 
that the hon. member for Ottawa—Vanier is making a very 
considered point of order.  As the chair occupant I gave that 
some consideration. But I also thought that in light of recent 
happenings with the New Democratic Party, God knows they could 
spend some time on their knees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your 
intervention, but consider what we are doing here today. 
Consider, as we are surrendering to the United States, as we are 
surrendering to the Americans, what we are actually debating in 
the House of Commons. In a letter we are agreeing— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Excuse me.  I think 
the hon. member for Ottawa—Vanier was quite correct and there is 
a point beyond which we need to respect the dignity of the House. 
I would ask the hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland 
Valleys to resume his normal dignified manner in the House and if 
not, we will just go on to the next speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, why did I get down on my 
knees in this subservient position during this debate on Bill 
C-55?  Why did I clasp my hands behind my neck in a symbol of 
submission?  It is because that is what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time and time again we cave in to the American 
interests. Just once we would rejoice in this House to stand up 
for Canadian interests, just one time.  Whether it is on the 
softwood lumber deal, whether it is on the salmon deal on the 
west coast, let us just one time stand up for Canadian interests 
and Canadian sovereignty and stop caving in and dropping to our 
knees the minute an American walks into the room. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listen to this.  This is astonishing.  When the government votes 
on this legislation, we are agreeing to the following definition 
of Canadian content in publications: “If it is created for the 
Canadian market and does not appear in any other edition or one 
or more periodicals published outside of Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means if a resident of Waco, Texas writes a story about crime 
in the streets of Dallas and it is published in <I>Maclean's</I> 
magazine, that is Canadian content.  If we look at the writings 
of Jesse Helms about the situation in Cuba and it is not printed 
anywhere else except in a Canadian publication, that becomes 
Canadian content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the Minister of Canadian Heritage, who in their right mind 
dreamt this up?  Who in their right mind could stand in this 
place and say “I believe that a Texan writing about Texas is 
Canadian content”.  That is what we are being asked to approve 
in the House this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disgraceful.  Anybody in our country who is interested in 
Canadian culture when they watch how people vote today will find 
out who really supports developing Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I think I have demonstrated clearly what I think 
should be the appropriate posture for every Canadian, and 
particularly every parliamentarian, when we get into the 
discussion of Canada-American relations.  We should assume the 
Liberal negotiating position, either on our knees or with our 
hands in the air as a symbol of complete submission.  It is 
unfortunate, but unfortunately that is the case.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my colleague 
is quite right.  The Liberals have been absolutely atrocious in 
their dealings with the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming from the northwest coast of British Columbia, I know all 
too well how much the people in my communities who fish are going 
to suffer as a result of the Pacific salmon deal.  The member is 
quite right.  We caved in to the Americans on Pacific salmon. 
The Liberals caved in. The minister wraps himself in the flag and 
tries to paint himself as the conservation fisheries minister, 
but in reality what we have done is sold out to the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know sometime in my life what the Canadian 
government got in return somewhere else in Canada.  I am sure 
there is some backroom bargaining going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to remind the member that I come from British 
Columbia which has an NDP administration.  He was demonstrating 
postures so I have one for him.  With an NDP administration, we 
in B.C. have the posture of having no money left because the NDP 
unfortunately cannot run a province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague have any comments to make about that since he 
was demonstrating the NDP's position with respect to the Liberal 
negotiating positions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my friend almost threw me 
with that question because as he was asking it he had one of his 
hands in his pocket. I was wondering what that was supposed to 
symbolize, but I will leave that for debate on another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be honest about what has happened in British Columbia. 
When the federal government in its wisdom decided to seriously 
cut back funding for health care and education, there were very 
few provinces that decided that they were not going to see actual 
cutbacks in those two fields in their jurisdictions so they 
backfilled.  They kept their commitments to education and health 
care and they backfilled so that education and health care would 
not take the hits that they have in most other provinces across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a priority. The Government of British Columbia decided 
it was crucial as we enter the 21st century in a knowledge based 
economy that education remain a priority and be accessible to 
British Columbians.  That is another reason tuition fees have 
been frozen for four years in a row, in order to keep tuition 
fees low enough so that public education at the post-secondary 
level is available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two very important things are education and health care. I would 
suspect if my friend had a chance to get to his feet after this 
question he would admit that he too would value that priority by 
the Government of British Columbia to keep health care and 
education as number one and number two priorities in terms of 
funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is the House ready

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK240">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from June 4 consideration of the motion in 
relation to the amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-49, an 
act providing for the ratification and the bringing into effect 
of the Framework Agreement on First Nations Land Management. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
continue my remarks from last Friday when we first began debating 
the Senate amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now useful to remind the House of some of the history of 
the legislation before us.  Back in the fall of last year the 
government introduced Bill C-49.  At the time it was introduced 
there was a great deal of discussion among the various parties to 
see if we could get all party consent to speed the bill through 
the House of Commons.  Apparently the bill had been before the 
House before and had not succeeded.  Apparently many people were 
lobbying various members of parliament trying to get speedy 
passage of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After we reviewed it we found that there were some flaws.  We 
started pointing them out to the government.  A lot of the credit 
for identifying these flaws goes to grassroots people living on 
reserves, particularly in British Columbia, and municipalities in 
British Columbia that expressed some concern about the lack of a 
consultation process with regard to the use of land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerns were also expressed about other areas of the bill such 
as expropriation.  We received a great deal of mail, e-mails, 
faxes and so on, from people in the Musqueam reserve who had an 
experience relevant to the legislation which certainly made them 
very fearful and concerned about what could happen if Bill C-49 
were passed without amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We began discussions with the government talking about the 
amendments we were looking for.  We had some indication back in 
November and December that we were to get amendments but we never 
got them.  Consequently, in February and March when Bill C-49 
came back into the House, members of the official opposition 
voiced strong opposition.  We made it very clear to the 
government that we would not support the bill until amendments 
were made.  In fact, we were to mount as stiff an opposition as 
we possibly could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Various members opposite in the government benches made public 
comments about Bill C-49 at that time.  I would like to read into 
the record some of those comments.  A news story in the Vancouver 
<I>Sun</I> of March 4, 1999, indicated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nations legislation faces possible changes: Amendment in 
the Senate is pursued for a bill that gives land management 
powers to 14 Indian bands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>B.C. Liberal MPs said Wednesday the Senate will study and 
possibly amend legislation that would give bands such as the 
Musqueam and the Squamish expropriation powers on reserve land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seven member B.C. caucus has been inundated by letters, 
telephone calls and faxes expressing concern about the bill, 
which is expected to easily pass third and final reading in the 
House of Commons early next week before going to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, called the First Nations Land Management Act, 
transfers land management powers from Ottawa to 14 Canadian 
bands—including five in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The powers include the right to expropriate any interest in its 
lands such as leases if the band council deems it necessary for 
“community works or other first nations purposes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has gained notoriety because it has been linked to the 
$490 million Nisga'a treaty and to the Musqueam band's imposition 
of 7,000% rent increases on leaseholders living on reserve land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some Musqueam leaseholders say the band plans to expropriate 
their leases in order to build condominiums, but the band says it 
has no motives other than to enforce the Federal Court of 
Appeal's ruling sanctioning huge hikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indian Affairs Minister Jane Stewart has said that bands wouldn't 
be allowed under Bill C-49 to expropriate interests on Musqueam 
land except for community purposes such as hospitals or sewer 
projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provoked concern among some mayors near the 
reserves who don't feel the legislation requires sufficient 
consultation between bands and municipalities prior to property 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And native women's groups are upset because the bill doesn't 
provide adequate protection for women who often lose access to 
the marital home after divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The controversy over the legislation has prompted government MPs 
to hold out hope that the Senate could send amendments back to 
the Commons, forcing the Indian affairs minister to reconsider 
her legislation.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal Senator Ray Perrault said the public feels a sense of 
powerlessness over issues like Bill C-49, the Musqueam matter, 
and Nisga'a.  The emotion expressed in the letters he has 
received is as powerful as any he's seen in his long political 
career in the B.C. legislature and the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“They believe they don't have sufficient input; they feel the 
democratic process is subverted”, Perrault said. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to a statement of the minister, the article continued: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—she will naturally have to consider any amendments that may 
come back from the Senate, but she doesn't believe Bill C-49 has 
flaws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“I feel very comfortable with the bill”, she said. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all members of the House, and anyone who happens to be 
watching, how the minister could be so far on one side of the 
issue.  She is not accepting advice from Liberal senators who 
have spent their entire careers in politics.  She is not 
accepting advice from members like the member for Vancouver 
Quadra who is recognized as somewhat of a legal and 
constitutional expert.  She is telling her critics, including the 
critics from within her own party, that there is nothing wrong 
with the bill.  She does not feel that it needs any changes and 
is intent on seeing it passed just the way it is.  Is that the 
way the House of Commons should be doing business? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another article from the Windsor <I>Star</I> of March 11 
indicated that a local Liberal member of parliament, the member 
from Essex Kent, found himself in an unusual position of voting 
with Tory, independent and 42 Reform members against a 
controversial government bill that gave 14 Indian bands greater 
power over land management issues.  Because dissent within the 
Liberal ranks was frowned upon and discouraged by the Prime 
Minister, the decision of the member from Essex Kent was both 
unusual and gutsy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 has already drawn legitimate criticism on two fronts. 
First, it would pass more control of reserve lands to band 
councils, allowing them to expropriate interests on their land 
such as non-native leaseholders if expropriation is deemed to be 
in the community's interest.  The bill does not specifically 
define those interests, leading to concern that land could be 
used for commercial development or even casinos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one B.C. reserve non-natives already have been saddled with a 
7,000% increase in their rent, leading to suspicion that the band 
is trying to lower real estate prices so it can keep future 
compensation payments down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second concern outlined in the article was that native women 
were concerned that the bill did not guarantee women equal rights 
to property when a marriage breaks down. 
Bands can create their own rules and there is no requirement for 
any appeal process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might see the member from Essex Kent as attempting to score 
political points in his riding where the government and the 
Caldwell first nation have negotiated a tentative agreement that 
would give the band $23.5 million to establish a 4,500 acre 
reserve on what is now prime farm land.  However, the Caldwell 
deal raised many legitimate questions about the government's 
approach to land claims and the continued promotion of the 
unsuccessful reserve system.  I submit that Bill C-49 feeds into 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In opposing Bill C-49 the member from Essex Kent accused Indian 
Affairs Minister Jane Stewart and her department of intentionally 
trying to avoid public consultation on—

the public's concern was correctly focused.  He said that the 
bill needed changing.  He said that he would work behind the 
scenes to see that it was changed.  He must have had some 
opposition from the minister of Indian affairs because she was 
publicly quoted in the same articles saying that she thought the 
bill was fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Against that backdrop, the bill was sent over to the Senate for 
consideration, deliberation and debate and apparently there was 
some kind of a deal cooked up in the backrooms between Liberal 
backbenchers and senators that this bill was to be amended by the 
Senate and sent back to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we found that out we were somewhat encouraged because we 
believed it meant that we were actually going to have the 
concerns addressed that were brought to us by mayors and city 
councillors from the Vancouver area and from aboriginal women 
living on reserve, particularly the Squamish reserve.  We 
received a number of concerns expressed by these women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were starting to believe that those issues would be resolved. 
I think the House may be aware that there is a young lady from 
the Squamish reserve who actually had a piece published in the 
<I>National Post</I>.  Her name is Wendy Lockhart Lundberg.  I 
think that she is an absolutely courageous woman who has done a 
great deal to move this issue into public debate, and that is the 
issue of native women's rights or the lack of native women's 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She published an article in the <I>National Post</I>.  It is 
really important that the House understands how she feels and how 
many of her fellow band members feel, native women such as Maizy 
Baker.  I hope these people are watching because I know this 
issue is very important to them. They have expressed their 
concerns over and over again to all members of the House, 
particularly members of the Standing Committee on Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that all members of parliament from British Columbia 
have received mail from these people and they have made their 
point very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wendy Lockhart Lundberg, a member of the Squamish Band in the 
Vancouver area, in her article that was published in the 
<I>National Post</I> earlier this spring, said that native women 
feel threatened by the federal bill.  She said that while media 
attention focuses on the formal treaty process, federal actions 
are attempting a legislative end run around treaties by offering 
bands powers over land management.  Native women will bear the 
brunt of these legislative provisions and will be denied the 
protections that could be afforded through treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She continued to say that a little publicized government bill, 
Bill C-49, the first nations land management act, was scheduled 
for third reading in parliament the next week and poised to 
become law.  Bill C-49 would give legal effect to land management 
agreements which have already been signed by 14 bands.  These 
included her band, the Squamish, as well as Vancouver's Musqueam 
Band and bands across the country and would be open to other 
bands in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 grants participating bands almost unlimited powers 
over the ownership, management and expropriation of band lands. 
The implications of Bill C-49 for the rights and position of 
native women are large and the B.C. Native Women's Society, 
supported by three major native organizations, has lodged a court 
case against the federal government to require that the issue of 
native women's rights be properly addressed before enactment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the marriages of native women fail, as all too many do on 
account of poverty and related conditions, they and their 
children typically lose the family home.  There ex-spouses 
typically get possession of the family home based on decisions of 
the band council.  Often the women have nowhere to live on the 
reserve and many end up in the worst circumstances, in urban 
ghettos.  Unlike all other Canadian women, native women on 
reserves do not have the protection of property division laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 contains two provisions which are particularly 
worrisome for native women.  First, it states that rules and 
procedures regarding the use, occupation and possession of land 
upon the breakdown of a marriage will be determined by the land 
codes of each signatory band.  Yet there is little assurance that 
these future provisions will be any less tilted against the 
interests of women and their children than the results of the 
current system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Bill C-49 offers band councils draconian powers of 
expropriation which must concern native women as well as other 
native people living on reserves and non-natives with leasehold 
interests.  Specifically, a first nation may expropriate any 
interest in its first nation land that, in the opinion of its 
council, is necessary for community works or other first nation 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The band need give at most 30 days notice to expropriate and it 
is obliged to pay fair compensation that can be disputed only 
under the rules set by the band itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only may these powers be used against native women, they may 
also be used against band members outside the governing elite. 
For example, the Squamish nation has valuable waterfront property 
in North Vancouver which is rumoured to be the subject of band 
council plans for commercial redevelopment.  These plans could 
displace many band members living there to a reserve area up the 
coast, thus making expropriation powers very useful to the band 
council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, any party having a leasehold interest on reserve 
has reason to fear the strong expropriation powers for bands in 
Bill C-49.  With the sword of quick expropriation hanging over 
their heads, current leaseholders will find few parties willing 
to buy their leasehold interests and their property values will 
plummet.  A band can then expropriate their property by offering 
fair compensation at the depressed market values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A band council's expropriation powers will be unlike those of a 
municipal or senior government.  The band will be able to 
expropriate for any other first nation purpose, not limited to 
the need to build schools, highways and the like.  Many bands see 
their lands as a major means for economic development so that 
leaseholders can expect their land to be expropriated.  Whenever 
a band finds a more valuable use the band will fully control the 
zoning.  With this ever present threat, how many non-natives will 
want to make the investments needed for development or leasehold 
arrangements with bands? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wendy Lockhart Lundberg's mother lost her native and band status 
when she married a non-native many years ago.  Her status was 
restored following the 1985 amendments to the Indian Act, but her 
father's property was never returned to her.  The Squamish Band 
allows someone else to occupy the property and uses its diverse 
powers to block her mother's efforts to regain her family home. 
Under Bill C-49 her land could be permanently lost through 
expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Squamish nation has sent a council member to Ottawa to 
support Bill C-49, while not informing the general band 
membership of the existence of the bill.  The Squamish nation has 
intervened on behalf of all signatory bands on the side of the 
federal government and against the B.C. Native Women's Society on 
the Bill C-49 lawsuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Lundberg said that she believed her mother's rights and 
those of many other native women would be lost forever if Bill 
C-49 passed in its present state.  Their chances of obtaining 
legally binding provisions that restore their human and property 
rights would be much better served through an openly debated 
treaty process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A registered status native and member of the Squamish Band, 
Wendy Lockhart Lundberg, said that Bill C-49 was introduced into 
parliament by a female minister of Indian affairs and its passage 
would be enacted by Her Majesty in right of Canada. 
She said that she doubted whether either of those women share 
native women's concerns about their lands, homes and families.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is beyond us to understand why the minister and the 
government have not bothered to listen to the pleas from these 
women who are very concerned about their lack of property rights 
which all other Canadian women enjoy in the event of marriage 
breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another example that I can share with the House and that 
is the example of Maizy Baker.  She tells me that there are many, 
many more like her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maizy Baker is a member of the Squamish Band.  She is an elder 
in the band and she has a property that she would like to be able 
to pass along to her children.  We all do that as Canadians. 
This is a matter of— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  If the hon. member 
for Skeena would forgive me, I need to interrupt twice before 5 
o'clock, once for the adjournment proceedings.  This seemed like 
a good moment to interrupt because I need to make an announcement 
on behalf of the Speaker before time gets too far along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is for members who are watching the proceedings from their 
offices.  The Speaker's reception, to which all members are 
invited, is currently going on in the Speaker's chambers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I apologize for interrupting the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that there is 
other business that needs to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus for a minute on Maizy Baker because I think her 
story is important.  It is important in the context of how we see 
ourselves as Canadians and how we see our fellow Canadians and 
their rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maizy Baker is a status member of the Squamish nation who is 
living in the Vancouver area.  She is an elder.  She has 
children.  She has property that she wants to pass on to her 
children.  She has lived on that reserve all her life.  That is 
what she knows as her home.  It is her family home.  It is where 
her children grew up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us have these same circumstances.  We grow up in 
families and even in our middle years and later life we identify 
with the family home as the home where we grew up.  It is our 
place.  It is no different for Maizy.  Maizy has found out that 
she is living in that house by permission of the band council. 
She does not own it.  There is no heritability.  There is no 
ability for her to pass that property along to her children and 
their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue strongly that is contrary to Canadian values and 
everything that we believe in and stand for in this country. 
Where are Maizy Baker's rights?  Where are her property rights? 
Where are the rights of her family?  Will they find at some point 
in time when Maizy has gone, and hopefully it will be a long time 
before that happens, that the family home in which they grew up 
is arbitrarily assigned to another band member and no longer has 
any meaning or value for them as family members? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue not.  I would say that the biggest flaw we have in 
the reserve system is related directly to land and land 
management.  Let us face it, land is a very, very important 
instrument in delivering individual rights to Canadians and to 
all people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maizy Baker does not have those rights.  She does not have that 
ability.  She cannot pass her property along to her children. 
The biggest flaw in the reserve system, and there are many, is 
that there are no property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that Bill C-49 or any other legislation that 
might be brought down in this House in the near future would 
provide exactly the same kind of fee simple property rights that 
all other Canadians enjoy, although that is what I would like to 
see; I am suggesting that the bill was an opportunity to address 
that issue.  There could have been private property rights of 
some kind assigned under that legislation. 
There could have been protection of some kind because without 
some kind of property right it is impossible for the whole issue 
of division of the marital home to be addressed in any meaningful 
way.  Without a private property right, we are left with always 
is an arbitrary decision by somebody else, most often the band 
chief and council, as to who is going to end up with possession 
of that home once the marriage dissolves.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues were raised by Maizy Baker and Wendy Lockhart 
Lundberg with the House standing committee on aboriginal affairs. 
They were also raised in the Senate committee hearings that took 
place a month to five weeks ago.  These ladies, and many others, 
travelled great distances, all the way from British Columbia in 
the case of Wendy and Maizy, to tell their story and to put their 
concerns forward with the senators who were studying this bill 
and who were supposed to be working behind the scenes with 
Liberal MPs to make amendments that would provide the kind of 
protection and address the kinds of concerns that were being 
raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The groups made very forceful presentations.  I have copies of 
the minutes of the Senate committee meetings, I sat in on some of 
those meetings.  After the Senate committee listened to all of 
those presentations and after hearing the expressions of 
frustration and deep concern these women were telling, at the end 
of the day the committee sent the bill back to the House with a 
couple of amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the amendments are a small step in improving some of the 
expropriation concerns expressed by myself and others in the 
House, they do not go anywhere near the issue of aboriginal 
women's rights.  They do not go anywhere near the issue of the 
concerns of municipalities over mutual consultation when adjacent 
lands are to be developed.  On the issue of compensation, the 
only real change is that the bands must adhere to the 
Expropriation Act, which we do agree is an improvement.  However, 
it does not require the bands to expropriate only for the public 
works or public services that may be required by the band.  It 
still says that it is anything that the band council may deem to 
be in the band's interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the May 14 minutes of the Senate committee on aboriginal 
people.  When the minister appeared before the Senate committee 
on Bill C-49, she said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you, honourable senators, for allowing me to be here to 
speak about an extremely important piece of legislation.  I have 
been following your work and I recognize the attention and 
diligence that you have brought to Bill C-49. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would start by positioning the bill and its importance from my 
point of view. As honourable senators are aware, the bill 
ratifies and brings into effect a framework agreement that was 
signed on February 12, 1996, by the 14 First Nations and the 
former Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
Together with the signatory First Nations, Bill C-49 is a product 
of over 10 years of work that sought to find a meaningful way of 
restoring land management jurisdiction to the signatory First 
Nations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that if this is the best they can do after 10 
years I am absolutely nonplussed.  I cannot understand how 
anybody can say that this is a good bill.  After 10 years, I 
would have expected something much more refined, something that 
would have addressed the issues and the concerns that have been 
expressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework agreement and this legislation provide the 
signatory First Nations a legitimate, organized and controlled 
means of taking back the authority to manage their lands and 
resources at the community level and pass laws regarding how 
their land is developed, conserved, protected, used and 
administered.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can already see the major difference between the Squamish 
Reserve, for example, or any reserve that might be covered under 
this bill, and any non-aboriginal community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I live in a non-aboriginal community.  Some members of the House 
live in communities, but I think most members probably live in 
communities, municipalities, cities or whatever.  The 
municipality I live in collects property taxes from me and has 
some say in what I can and cannot do with my property. I believe 
that is based on consideration for my neighbours who may not want 
me to put up a barn in my front yard.  However, it certainly 
cannot tell me where I can live, where I cannot live, who can 
live in my house and so on, because I own my property not the 
community.  The municipality does not own that property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You can raise money on your property, 
too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Yes, I can pledge my property for 
security if I want to raise money for a mortgage, to start a 
business and for a whole variety of uses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the legislation before us does is it transfers the 
administration of lands which, incidentally, are lands that are 
legally held in the title of the crown of Canada.  This is also a 
big flaw and a big mistake.  Why should the land title for Indian 
reserves be held by the crown?  That is totally inappropriate, 
but that is how they are held.  What the crown is simply saying 
is that it is not going to administer those lands any more, 
that it is going to turn them over to the local chief and 
council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that in a democracy that expresses itself to be 
concerned about the individual rights of people and tries to give 
individuals as much freedom and opportunity as possible, we 
recognize that fundamental to that is, as I said earlier, 
creating a private property right.  This does not do that.  The 
bill just simply transfers the administration of these lands from 
one government jurisdiction to another, from one body of 
government to another and from one bureaucracy to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is on record as supporting the notion that 
decisions made with respect to most aspects of community life are 
better made at the community level than they are in Ottawa or in 
the legislatures in the various provinces.  We believe that the 
more we devolve the decision making the more likely it is that 
better decisions will be made.  It is very likely that as a 
result of this legislation there will be better decisions made 
with respect to the business of the band and the business of land 
development, but, from an individual point of view, I would argue 
that it is more likely that individual rights will be prejudiced 
as a result of this legislation rather than enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now continue to quote the minister.  She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that First Nations can undertake projects without 
having to turn to me for their approval. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would agree that is a good thing.  She continues to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will have the flexibility to move quickly when economic 
opportunities arrive or when partners approach them.  In that 
way, they can get on with the task of creating jobs and 
encouraging economic growth in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also like to welcome my parliamentary secretary.  We 
spoke about the importance of (him) being with us today, as well. 
I am glad he is able to join me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notions and philosophy in Bill C-49 are in keeping with our 
government's efforts to increase self-sufficiency in First 
Nations communities.  The bill is a major component of the goals 
that we outlined in “Gathering Strength—Canada's Aboriginal 
Action Plan”, which was the federal government's response to the 
Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that the government tabled a response to 
RCAP of January of last year.  I remember that it was during the 
ice storm because I came back here for the minister's 
announcement and almost had to stay here for a week before I 
could get a plane to leave again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister, in referring to that, was saying that these 
legislative initiatives were a response to the RCAP report.  I 
would remind the House that there were many people present at 
that announcement of the minister, including Mr. Daniels who 
represents off-reserve natives, and Marilyn Buffalo who 
represents Native Women's Association of Canada.  They were not 
particularly enamoured with the minister's announcement and made 
presentations very much in opposition to what Bill C-49 is all 
about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In previous opportunities that I have had to meet with the 
Senate, we have had a lively and informed discussion on how 
appropriate it is that we move to a new and modern relationship 
with First Nations in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now turn to the issue of the land codes.  Let us remember 
that the bill and the framework agreement provide for the 
creation of land codes that will set out the specifics of the new 
land management regime for each First Nation.  Community members, 
not chiefs and council, will approve these land codes.  A land 
code will be the basic law that will govern lands and resources, 
after the land provisions of the Indian Act are withdrawn from 
the community.  The land code will include the rules and 
procedures that will apply to the use and occupancy of First 
Nations land, the sharing of revenues, accountability to members, 
the enactment of laws, conflict of interest, and the 
establishment of alternative dispute-resolution mechanisms.  The 
land codes are to be ratified by on- and off-reserve adult 
members in each community.  First Nations will establish a 
specific process for ratification within the parameters of the 
framework agreement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want members to remember that what the minister is essentially 
saying is that the band members themselves are going to be the 
ones to adopt these land codes and they will be the ones who 
determine how land is to be managed on the reserve after Bill 
C-49 is enacted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal women who testified in front of the standing 
committee on aboriginal affairs and the senate standing committee 
had some very pointed things to say about that very issue.  They 
are deeply concerned that this will not be the case.  I want 
members to recall that.  I will come back to it through the 
testimony of the aboriginal women who came to Ottawa and gave us 
their views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would note that this bill is really a win-win opportunity for 
all parties. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only wish it were so.  She goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The First Nations win because they can include their land and 
resources in decisions that shape their future.  The First 
Nations and their neighbouring communities also win because 
increased economic development on First Nations land will mean a 
healthier economy for the region.  They will be able to deal 
directly with the First Nation on business matters instead of 
having to go through my department. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we think that is a good thing.  We are not opposed to 
that.  As a matter of fact, the Reform Party worked very hard 
trying to negotiate amendments to the bill late last fall that 
would have seen us supporting Bill C-49, except we could not get 
the government's agreement to support those amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, at this late stage, we find ourselves in this unfortunate 
situation of not being able to support Bill C-49, and we do it on 
behalf of these people who have approached us.  It is not our 
issue anywhere near as much as it is theirs.  They are the ones 
who have asked to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to turn now to three particular issues that have 
been the concern of this committee and others, not the least of 
which is the issue expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of expropriation deals with the First Nation 
expropriation powers.  Members of the committee have raised the 
issue of whether First Nation expropriation powers here differ 
from those provided to other entities. At the outset, I would 
remind you that expropriation powers already exist under the 
Indian Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do, but those expropriation powers are currently in the 
hands of the federal government and not in the hands of the band. 
The federal government is currently bound to the Expropriation 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On request of First Nations, I can exercise expropriation powers 
for the general welfare of First Nations under section 18(2) of 
the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, we are seeking to replace the powers under the 
Indian Act and to ensure that the signatory First Nations have 
the tools they need to manage their land.  The power to 
expropriate of the signatory First Nations is similar to the 
expropriation power afforded to federal and provincial 
governments and the public and private organizations such as 
municipalities, school boards, universities and hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize that this bill does not allow for 
arbitrary expropriation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the people we heard from, including band members, are 
saying exactly the contrary.  If members read the wording of the 
bill, it is easy to see that the minister is incorrect. 
I want to repeat this.  She said that it is important to 
recognize that this bill does not allow for arbitrary 
expropriation.  It says in the bill that the band can expropriate 
for any purpose it deems to be in the band's interest.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the band council has a meeting one night and decides it is in 
the band's interest to expropriate a piece of property to build a 
community hall or to build a sewer and water project and so on, 
that is fair ball.  What happens if it decides it is in the 
band's interest to expropriate and take a number of band members 
or non-native leaseholders out of their homes because there would 
be a higher return on that property if there were multi-family 
residential apartments for rent?  That is the kind of concern 
people have been expressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is quite wrong when she makes that statement.  She 
knows she is wrong.  It is very clear.  Words mean something. 
Words are not put into agreements because they have no meaning. I 
am not a lawyer but I do know from long and sometimes painful 
experience that we have to take agreements at face value.  We 
cannot read into them things that are not there and we cannot 
read out of them things that are there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says very clearly that the band can expropriate for any 
purpose it deems to be in the band's interest.  Any purpose.  It 
does not say it has to be a water project or a sewer project.  It 
does not say it has to be a road or a hydro project or anything 
like that.  Any purpose. By the way, no municipality or province 
can expropriate under those kinds of conditions.  Canadians would 
never stand for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Expropriations do happen from time to time in Canada but they 
happen when there is clearly a public good at stake and most of 
the time there is fair compensation.  Too many times government 
drags its feet and does not want to pay fair compensation, but 
for the most part there is reasonable compensation paid as a 
result of an expropriation that may take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this instance for the appeal process, if they do not like 
what the band offers for that expropriation, it is for the band 
itself. That is clearly unfair.  We are not going to suggest that 
bands are going to be unfair, but it is part of any reasonable 
process that a disengaged, unbiased third party would arbitrate a 
dispute if there was a dispute over what fair compensation should 
be for an expropriated parcel.  Every other Canadian would want 
to be entitled to that and every other Canadian is entitled to 
that.  That is the reason we have arbitration processes.  It is 
the reason we have our courts. Courts are disengaged, unbiased 
parties who are supposed to arbitrate a decision when two parties 
are in dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When two parties are in dispute I do not think many people would 
find it very acceptable that one party would go to the other for 
a resolution of that dispute.  Mr. Speaker, if you and I are in 
dispute over an issue of monetary compensation, I hardly think it 
would be fair that I would have to go to you to have that dispute 
resolved, that you would be the decision maker.  That is the way 
this legislation is written.  I do not think that is acceptable 
at all.  I do not think that is the Canadian way of doing things. 
I do not understand why the government is not willing to make 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I apologize if I am taking time, but I want to clearly 
articulate the serious flaws with this bill.  I want to say it is 
not appropriate for a minister of the crown to say that she has a 
fiduciary obligation to aboriginal people, which she does and we 
accept that, and then to be the arbiter herself of these very 
serious questions.  We need to have an opinion from justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have an opinion from some other area that can give us 
an unbiased, fair interpretation of what this all means without 
the burden of the fiduciary obligation of the minister attached 
to it.  She has her job, she should do her job.  But we should 
also have another party.  I would suggest it should be the 
Minister of Justice, the justice department that provides us with 
the kind of direction that we need.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Order.  This may well be 
a good opportunity for the member to catch his breath, as I have 
to read the adjournment motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the 
House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for Winnipeg North 
Centre, Health; the hon. member for Markham, Government 
Contracts; the hon. member for Skeena, Aboriginal Affairs; the 
hon. member for Dewdney—Alouette, Immigration; and the hon. 
member for Davenport, Kyoto. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Skeena has unlimited time on debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to go back to the 
minister making her comments and observations with respect to the 
expropriation powers in the bill.  She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that specific concerns have been raised about 
whether these areas have been treated with sufficient clarity. 
From my point of view the bill does deal with expropriation 
appropriately. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, from the minister's point of view she said the 
expropriation issue has been dealt with properly.  But from her 
own backbench, the member for Vancouver Quadra, the member from 
Essex Kent and members of the Senate have said clearly that it 
has not been dealt with.  They have said very clearly that the 
bill is poorly drafted.  How can we accept the minister's words? 
I do not think we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am trying to paint a picture of a minister who seems to have a 
very strong inclination to defend this legislation in its present 
form rather than to seriously consider the critique that has been 
levelled against it, rather than consider the changes that would 
be appropriate and that have been suggested by the Reform Party 
and others. She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, it is important that we make our intentions 
clear, I would welcome your further attention to these aspects of 
the bill. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She goes on to identify the second major issue with respect to 
this bill, that being matrimonial property. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of matrimonial property, I recognize that we have 
another important issue:  the management of real property upon 
marital breakdown.  This is a significant issue that we must 
address.  There is a legislative gap regarding matrimonial real 
property rights upon the marital breakdown on reserve.  In cases 
of marital breakdown the Indian Act does not provide guidance on 
the use, occupation and possession of the matrimonial home or on 
the division of the interests in land on reserve. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister herself identifies the problem under the Indian Act 
and says that there is no redress, there is no solution, there is 
no way of ensuring fairness and equity at the present time under 
the Indian Act.  She goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts have been asked for guidance.  However, the Supreme 
Court of Canada replied in Derrickson v Derrickson that reserve 
lands are under federal jurisdiction and provincial laws 
respecting the division of matrimonial lands do not apply. 
Clearly, this is an issue that needs resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is a significant step forward as it would 
enable the 14 signatory first nations to resolve the matter. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to that, without the land codes and without the 
benefit of being able to look at them, we have no way of knowing 
whether this is a step forward, a step backward or a step 
sideways.  We do know for sure that the minister has identified 
clearly what I have just been saying, that there are no private 
property rights for aboriginal women on reserve.  That leads to 
the problem where in the event of a marriage breakdown, there is 
no ability to divide the matrimonial home or to assign the 
matrimonial home under the laws and jurisdiction of provincial 
guidelines which exist for all other Canadian women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nation members are required to vote on a community 
process for the development of rules and procedures for 
matrimonial property.  This process must result in rules and 
procedures to be adopted within, at a maximum, 12 months from the 
date the land code takes effect.  An arbitration process has been 
set up in the framework agreement to ensure that this delay be 
respected.  The rules and procedures cannot discriminate on the 
basis of gender. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the minister is saying that the land code is the way to 
address this issue.  What we are saying and what the people who 
appeared before our committee to testify are saying is that they 
do not believe that is the case.  They do not believe that the 
requirement to develop a land code is any guarantee that we will 
actually see property rights for aboriginal women, and families 
for that matter, introduced in any real and meaningful way with 
the enactment of Bill C-49.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. senators can appreciate, for those first nations who 
remain under the Indian Act, we have a continuing issue and 
problem.  For those who will be part of Bill C-49, we are taking 
a bigger step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The larger issue remains significant.  The issue of matrimonial 
real property upon marital breakdown affects all first nations 
that remain administered under the Indian Act.  We must look 
beyond the first nations land management act and determine what 
can be done to resolve the current vacuum in the Indian Act 
concerning the division of real matrimonial property. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is absolutely right. We keep referring to 14 first nations 
bands that are going to be covered under this bill at the present 
time. That is quite true.  It is incumbent upon every member of 
this House to realize that any band that decides it wants to be 
covered under this bill simply has to elect to do so by band 
council resolution and it will automatically come under the 
umbrella of Bill C-49, the first nations land management act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not quite correct to say there are only 14 bands. 
Potentially every band in Canada will be under this first nations 
land management act in the future. It is very likely we will see 
more and more of these bands electing to be covered under the 
umbrella of this legislation in the very near future once the 
bill is enacted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Matrimonial property is a significant issue.  It needs to be 
dealt with more thoroughly as do the issues facing aboriginal 
women generally. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good statement. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to address the concerns that have been raised by 
witnesses whose testimony reached beyond Bill C-49 and we need to 
assess as well the work of the Special Joint Committee on Child 
Custody and Access and your special study on aboriginal 
governance which I am looking forward to receiving.  I 
congratulate the committee on the work that you have done to 
date. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is clearly acknowledging that this issue is a real 
and important issue and it is an issue which affects aboriginal 
women and needs to be addressed.  If the minister recognizes this 
and says so in testifying before a Senate committee for all 
Canadians to see, then why does she bring in legislation which 
does not deliver?  Why does she bring in legislation that does 
not provide the assurances that these women are looking for?  Why 
does she not do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are legitimate questions. We are not trying to be 
spoilers. We are not trying to frustrate the process.  We are 
trying to ensure that the rights of these people are finally 
recognized which they have not been for 130 years. We are trying 
to make sure that it is done in a real way and in a way that will 
make them feel secure about their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, I should like to table a letter in both French 
and English that formally requests the assistance of this 
committee in that particular regard.  I will not read it. 
However, I should like it to be considered because this is an 
area that has broad application and through which the work of the 
Senate would be useful. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is asking the Senate to address the issue. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third area that has been of interest to a number of people 
regards the consultation with municipalities.  A few 
municipalities near some of the 14 first nations have raised 
concerns that they have not been consulted on the framework or on 
the development of land codes.  There are those who say the 
provisions in the bill must be more specific and that the 
legislation must require that consultation will occur. I am not 
sure that one can actually legislate the quality of consultation. 
What is truly effective for first nations and municipalities is 
to build a consultative partnership based on mutual respect and 
individual autonomy. The signatory first nations and nearby 
communities have the option, if they so choose, to create their 
own consultative process.  In fact, this is what has been 
happening.  For the government's part we have been keeping 
municipalities informed of the process of creating a first 
nations land management regime and have left it to first nations 
and nearby municipalities to decide for themselves what further 
discussions would be useful between them.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House with absolute certainty that what the 
minister said here is incorrect.  We have met with municipalities 
on the lower mainland of British Columbia who say they are 
appalled that the federal government would attempt to enact this 
kind of legislation without consulting them.  They have not been 
consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once they became aware of this bill, and they became aware of it 
largely through media reports that started to surface in late 
December of last year and January and February of this year, they 
became deeply concerned and they started contacting members of 
parliament, and members of the committee in particular, asking 
why they had not been consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is trying to lead us to believe in her testimony 
that all is well with the views of municipalities.  I can say 
that is just not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the minister goes on to say that this bill and the 
framework agreement put land management powers back in the hands 
of first nations and remove the minister from the decision making 
process.  Again, this is a step that we would support 
wholeheartedly.  We do not think that it is appropriate that a 
minister in Ottawa, regardless of which minister or which 
political party might be in power, should be making day to day 
decisions about the use of land on reserves, or anywhere else in 
Canada for that matter, thousands of miles away from Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill and the framework agreement pave the way for a better 
understanding and a closer relationship between first nations and 
neighbouring municipalities.  They remove some of the previous 
constraints that impeded the building of partnerships between 
first nations and neighbouring communities and now various land 
and resource management initiatives will be able to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that the 14 first nations who signed the 
framework agreement are leaders in land administration.  This 
initiative was brought forward at their request.  They worked 
co-operatively and in partnership, not only with each other, but 
with the federal government, with the affected provinces and with 
third party stakeholders.  Now they are waiting for parliament to 
pass this bill so they can get on with the building of their 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we would take our hats off to these band leaders and say 
“Good on you for trying to get the decision making power wrested 
away from Ottawa and brought to your own communities”.  Again, 
the flaw is that the federal government continues to see 
aboriginal people as collectivities rather than as individuals. 
When that is done it undermines the individual rights that those 
people would like to have.  It certainly takes away the 
opportunity to address issues such as the disposition of the 
marital home, the ability to inherit property, the ability of 
people to feel like they have their own place which they can call 
theirs, that belongs to them, their family, to their children and 
their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 130 years why do aboriginal people not feel that they have 
the security of owning their own home?  Why does the federal 
government continue to turn a blind eye to the property rights of 
aboriginal people?  This legislation makes no attempt to redress 
that.  It sees aboriginal people as collectivities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many aboriginal people see themselves as collectivities as well 
from a cultural point of view, from a language point of view and 
so on.  That is legitimate, but they are also individuals.  I can 
tell the House from a lot of experience, and I know many other 
members of the House have a lot of experience, that if we go to 
virtually any reserve community in this land and talk to 
individuals, if there are 2,000 people living in that community 
we are going to get 2,000 points of view virtually on every 
issue, just like there are 301 points of view in the House of 
Commons on every issue that we debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government insist on seeing these people as 
homogeneous groups who all think and act the same way and who all 
want the same thing?  Nothing could be further from the truth?  I 
say that it is insulting to see these people in that light.  I 
say that it is insulting not to see these people as individuals 
with their own lives and desires, dreams and aspirations.  They 
are individuals, not collectivities. 
That is the failure of this bill.  It sees people as 
collectivities and does nothing to address individual rights, 
property rights.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister further testified before the Senate committee, 
saying that this bill deals with something much broader than land 
management.  It is about self-reliance.  It is about economic 
opportunity and accountability to members.  It speaks to the new 
relationship that we are building with aboriginal people, one 
based on the principles of mutual respect, recognition, 
responsibility and sharing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are great words, but again she is saying self-reliance. 
Without private property ownership they will never have 
self-reliance.  It cannot happen.  The two are mutually 
dependent.  We have to have both of them together or neither one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the main barriers that aboriginal people have to 
self-reliance in Canada.  There are no property rights.  If they 
have no property rights, how can they raise money?  How can they 
raise capital to start a business?  If they do not have property 
rights, how can they pass their property along to their children 
when they pass along?  If they do not have property rights, how 
can they have any sense of security about where they are going to 
live the rest of their lives and how they are going have personal 
security? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sincere when I say that I am absolutely shocked that the 
federal government and the minister of Indian affairs do not 
understand that.  I would ask her how she would like it if the 
private property which she owns all of a sudden became communal 
property.  She would be living in her house at the pleasure of 
the municipality.  She would not have the ability to take a 
mortgage on her property or to pass it along to her children. 
How would the minister feel under those circumstances?  How would 
any of us feel?  That is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be pleased at this point to answer questions that you 
have with regard to Bill C-49. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then Senator St. Germain states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you, Madam Minister, for appearing and for covering most of 
the issues which were controversial during our hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not confuse the day but, being from the province of 
British Columbia, I would be remiss if I did not bring up an 
issue that has generated a lot of concern; that is the issue 
concerning leaseholders and one particular band in my province. 
It is not necessarily appropriate to discuss this here today 
because it is a different issue, but Bill C-49 is viewed as 
having a possible impact on the situation in some way, shape or 
form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member who represents that region, I wish to alert you that 
we must find some type of resolution on behalf of our native 
people and on behalf of the leaseholders and on behalf of every 
person in British Columbia.  Therefore, I will ask at a later 
date for your assistance in resolving this unacceptable 
situation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senator of course is referring to the very unfortunate 
Musqueam situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to Bill C-49 and the land code, I have a technical 
question.  Do you have officials with you? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some officials with me. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the senator states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event of a vote on the establishment of a land code, how 
would alleged voting irregularities or alleged denial of voting 
rights, perhaps by off-reserve natives, be resolved?  The 
minister will be at arm's length from those 14 bands.  What 
method or tribunal would be used to resolve that dispute? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister answers: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your earlier comments, Senator St. Germain, are noted.  I 
appreciate the significance to you of the issues raised in your 
province.  I continue to hope for a satisfactory resolution to 
those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the process of ratification, certain steps involve a verifier 
who is jointly selected between the federal government and the 
First Nations.  Indeed, once the process of verification has been 
approved and once I have been party to signing an individual 
agreement—and I must sign an individual agreement to bring a 
First Nation into the process—the ratification process on the 
First Nation occurs.  The verifier continues to have the 
responsibility to examine the ratification process and to ensure 
that the appropriate electors participated.  If there are 
challenges to that process, the verifier will analyze the 
disputes and allegations that may be brought forward and will 
make a determination as to whether the process of ratification 
has been followed acceptably.  If it has not, then we do not have 
an agreement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give members the minister's comments against the 
backdrop of what happened with the ratification of the Nisga'a 
treaty because I think it is important that the House understand 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Nisga'a treaty was presented to the Nisga'a people for 
ratification, and part of the ratification process was written 
right into the agreement itself, it was the Nisga'a people who 
were of voting age who were going to have the opportunity and the 
right to vote in a referendum to accept or not to accept the 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This took place, I believe, in November of last year.  The 
Nisga'a people live not far from where I live.  They are in the 
riding which I represent.  I was contacted by many of those 
people, who expressed real concern over the voting process 
because it was the Nisga'a Tribal Council that was the enumerator 
of the voters.  It was the Nisga'a Tribal Council that decided 
whether or not people were on the voters' list.  It was the 
Nisga'a Tribal Council that put the voters' list together, that 
put the polling stations together, that manned the polling 
stations and that oversaw the vote, which took place over the 
course of two days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members of the House how we would feel if we had an 
election process in a province or in Canada where the sitting 
federal government was the one that enumerated all the electors, 
was the one that set the rules for the vote, was the one that 
manned all the polling stations, was the one that scrutinized the 
results and counted the ballots.  Would we accept it if the Prime 
Minister was the one setting up the process?  That is the process 
that was followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is basically saying that there will be a verifier. 
I want to tell members that in the case of the Nisga'a 
ratification the federal government had one observer to cover 
seven polls over a two-day period.  There was one observer for 
all of the polls, not one observer for each poll, which included 
Vancouver, four stations in the Nass Valley, as well as Terrace 
and Prince Rupert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that the Nisga'a Tribal Council did anything 
underhanded; I am just saying that it was not a fair vote and a 
vote that people felt confident in.  One party oversaw it which 
had a vested interest in the outcome of the vote.  That is what 
will happen under Bill C-49. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is saying that there will be a verifier.  What does 
that mean?  The government will have the same thing it had up in 
the Nass Valley when the Nisga'a ratified their agreement.  It 
will have one person overseeing all of the polls, but it will 
essentially be the band council that will put the voters' list 
together, decide who can vote and who cannot, where the polling 
stations will be, what time they will open and close and who will 
staff them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just unacceptable in a democracy.  At great expense we 
send people from our parliament all over the world to oversee 
elections in other countries, such as South Africa and South 
America, to make sure that a fair process is followed and then we 
see this kind of process taking place in our own country, and our 
own government thinks it is fine.  It does not see anything wrong 
with it.  It feels that this is the right way to go about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear a lot of noise behind me— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The Bloc is supportive of what you are 
saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  I am glad the Bloc is supportive.  We 
always appreciate support when we get it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  I am not concerned about my flight at the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The senator goes on to ask: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are you comfortable enough with those amendments that we as a 
committee can proceed to final ratification on them? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my opening comments, I fundamentally believe this is 
a very good bill on all counts.  In receiving testimony from the 
14 First Nations, I know you feel that way as well. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She completely ignored the testimony of the Aboriginal Women's 
Association of British Columbia, Maizy Baker, Wendy Lockhart 
Lundberg and others.  She just wanted to focus on the testimony 
of chiefs and councils that appeared before the Senate committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, there may be opportunities for us to clarify 
the particular language used on expropriation. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was telling the senators that the only area where 
she was prepared to entertain any amendments was expropriation. 
There is nothing on the issue of aboriginal women's rights. There 
is nothing on the issue of property rights.  There is nothing on 
the issue of consultation with neighbouring municipalities.  The 
only area where the minister was prepared to entertain any 
amendments at all was on the expropriation powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate dominated by Liberal senators is nothing but a puppet 
for the government.  Lo and behold we get amendments back from 
the Senate.  Do we have anything on aboriginal women's rights? 
No.  Do we have anything on consultation?  No.  We have a couple 
of small baby steps on expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a parliamentarian I am so frustrated with this process and 
the fact that the Senate, which had an opportunity to address 
these issues, would not do it.  It is is essentially controlled 
by the Prime Minister's Office as is everything else around here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, the Prime Minister's Office and cabinet members make 
all decisions.  The House of Commons is a necessary inconvenience 
for them and they treat it with contempt.  They know they have to 
come in here.  They come in here as a matter of ceremony more 
than anything else.  The way the Senate treated the bill is a 
very clear indication of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it were truly an effective elected Senate, a Senate that had 
credibility and that was not a puppet of the PMO, I believe there 
would have been amendments this party would have supported.  The 
bill would have been amended properly.  It would have passed 
through the House with all party consent and everybody would have 
been happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not get that because the other place has no credibility. 
It is only doing the handiwork of the PMO.  It only dances to its 
tune.  The Senate committee continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Chalifoux: Thank you, Minister...for appearing before us. 
It is important to have many things clarified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You state you are willing to develop a process to address the 
issues of women, especially women living on reserve, and 
including the consideration of the matrimonial property laws, et 
cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have spoken to representatives of the NWAC and I understand 
that you want them to participate.  Do you have any funding to 
assist that organization to participate?  That is a big issue. 
That organization does not have that kind of money.  They really 
need funds to participate properly.  Have you addressed that 
issue? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator, I thank you for your work in this particular regard.  I 
recognize that you have taken a keen interest and a keen 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Matrimonial property is a huge issue for us. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were warm words.  Is it a huge issue?  There are no 
changes to the bill.  She continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was approached first and foremost by the native women's 
association in B.C.  This involves not only the national 
association; the British Columbia native women's association 
really addressed this in the first instance.  Clearly something 
has to be done in the context of Bill C-49 to begin to deal with 
this problem.  The resolution in Bill C-49 is appropriate in my 
opinion.  It means that, community by community, women will be 
participating in the creation of codes— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the minister is ducking the issue.  She does not want 
changes to the bill but she says that she will rely on the codes. 
No one has written a code as yet.  She will rely on the codes, 
which no one can read, to deliver on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people we are hearing from, Wendy Lockhart Lundberg, Maizy 
Baker, the Aboriginal Women's Association of Canada and the 
Aboriginal Women's Association of British Columbia are saying 
there is no way they want that in the legislation.  They want a 
guarantee.  They are asking us why they cannot have the same 
rights as all other Canadian women.  Why do they have to be 
dependent on the good graces of a band council to come up with a 
land code?  Especially after I described the ratification process 
on the Nisga' treaty, we can see how the results of referendums 
and ratifications can be skewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do they have to rely on that process?  Why could the 
minister and the government not put that protection in the 
legislation for them and make sure it was there now?  It is a 
flawed process. I suggest the reason it is not there is that the 
minister and her government care more about the collectivities 
than they do about individuals.  They put collective rights ahead 
of individual rights when it comes to aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that has been the bane of aboriginal people from the 
beginning of the country.  It is time we ended that.  It is time 
we recognized that these are real people.  They are individuals 
and they deserve the same individual rights as all the rest of 
us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>NWAC can play a broad role.  I would note that their funding 
comes primarily not from my department but from Canadian 
Heritage. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine that.  Its funding comes from Heritage Canada. 
Referring to the Minister of Canadian Heritage she said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take the representations and relay them to my 
colleague...Having said that, we do provide money to NWAC for 
particular project work, not the least of which was included last 
year and again this week—the symposia on the important issue of 
Bill C-31.  We have provided funds to NWAC so that they can begin 
to have broad discussions.  They have invited many chiefs and 
individual members and other experts on this issue.  We are 
supporting them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see what she was saying there.  The senator asked if she 
would provide funding for these women so that they could put 
together a reasonable package or proposal that would address 
important issues such as the issue of the matrimonial home in the 
event of a marriage breakdown.  The minister in effect said that 
it was not her responsibility but the responsibility of the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage and that she would have a word with 
her some time.  That is exactly what the minister was saying. 
Where is the concern on the part of the minister when that is how 
she treats this very important question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then Senator Austin intervened: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minister, you, of course, are welcomed by all members of this 
committee and we thank you for your work in this important area. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He must be a Liberal senator.  He continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to begin by echoing comments of Senator St. Germain with 
respect to the high level of interest that this legislation has 
provoked in British Columbia. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see from the discussions that took place the high level 
of concern expressed about British Columbia.  It is not as if 
this is a meaningless bill.  It has been well covered in the 
press in British Columbia and it has been such a subject of 
debate because people are very concerned about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The senator went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know you are quite familiar with what is happening in British 
Columbia.  The reason for the high level of interest is the 
perceived link between the issue of the Musqueam leaseholders 
under this bill and the Nisga'a treaty, and the link is not 
always rational.  People tend to link things because they appear 
in a certain order, whether that is realistic or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This committee, in hearing its evidence, has heard a great deal 
of concern with respect to two nuances of clause 28 of the bill, 
relating to expropriation.  As there is a good deal of concern 
and because I think—and believe my colleagues agree—that it 
would lessen the tensions that exist in the political system of 
at least my province, I have developed, with the stakeholders, 
some language that I am just having put before the members of the 
committee here.  The language has now been seen by both sides 
and, I believe, by your officials.  I should just like you to 
consider that language, be aware of it, and be aware that I will 
be proposing this amendment when they come to the 
clause-by-clause consideration. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see that obviously the senator is a Liberal senator.  He 
quite rightly identified that the concern with Bill C-49 had been 
linked to the Musqueam situation and the Nisga'a treaty.  He then 
pooh-poohed this by saying that people should not be concerned 
because they are completely unrelated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest they are related in some fundamental ways.  As I have 
already identified, there was absolutely no consultation on the 
part of the minister.  They negotiate agreements in back rooms 
that affect large numbers of people without even giving people 
notice that they are doing it.  That is exactly what happened 
with the Nisga'a treaty.  That is exactly what happened with Bill 
C-49.  That is exactly what happened with the Musqueam 
leaseholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1965 the Musqueam leaseholders signed a lease with the 
federal Government of Canada.  In 1980 the minister of the day, 
John Munro, assigned the government's authority in that lease 
over to the band without notification, without consultation and 
without an as you may please to the leaseholders who lived on 
that land.  Until 1993 they went under the assumption they had a 
lease with the federal Government of Canada. 
They found out 13 years after the fact that was not the case, 
that the lease interest had been assigned over to the band.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to take anything away from the Musqueam Band, but 
when a Canadian citizen or taxpayer signs a lease with the 
Government of Canada, it is expected that the federal government 
will honour the lease and treat the leaseholder fairly.  Is it 
treating someone fairly when a deal is made and the leaseholder 
is not notified that the interest in the lease has been assigned 
to somebody else?  That is the common link between government 
aboriginal policies in a whole range of areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Essex Kent has it right.  The minister and her 
department's policy is to keep the dummies in the dark, in their 
view we being the dummies.  Anybody who is not in the PMO or in 
the cabinet room, as far as they are concerned, do not need to 
know.  When legislation such as this comes into the House, we are 
just a thorn in their side, somebody that they have to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as they are concerned, they think the Parliament of 
Canada is irrelevant.  They think that all government operations 
should be run out of the PMO and the cabinet room.  At some point 
I think they would like to see the House of Commons completely 
eliminated as a relevant institution altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The senator went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment essentially deals with subclause 28(1)...There was 
a good deal of concern that the disjunctive “or” with “other 
first nation purposes” was a broader power than that which was 
reserved by the federal government for itself, in terms of the 
items which could be made subject to expropriation.  The 
amendment would add the word “community”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not something?  Now we have a real safeguard in the 
legislation.  The Liberals are patting themselves on the back and 
saying “weren't we great?”  They amended the expropriation 
powers to recognize or reflect the concerns that were expressed. 
How did they do it?  They included community purposes.  Other 
than first nation purposes, they included first nation community 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  A meaningless amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Exactly, a meaningless amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The senator went on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of intervenors who were concerned seemed to be 
comfortable that adding that word would bring the wording within 
the normal concept of expropriation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people to whom we have talked, the people who made 
interventions to the Senate and to our committee, in no way 
believe that is satisfactory or addresses the problem.  He went 
on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment is to subclause 28(5).  At lines 42 and 43, 
the amendment would remove the phrase “shall take into account 
the rules set out in the Expropriation Act” and would replace it 
with “shall apply the rules set out in the Expropriation Act”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would agree that this amendment is strengthening the bill. It 
is one small step.  For my hon. colleagues who may not understand 
what this means because they are not familiar with it— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You mean the Liberals do not understand 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Exactly.  This is for the benefits of the 
Liberals.  I know they are interested.  I can see them over there 
paying rapt attention to every word that comes out of my mouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the first nation can expropriate for any 
community purpose.  If it wants to build a casino or put up a 
multi-residential structure, it can expropriate people's 
residences in the process because that could be deemed a 
community purpose.  This requires the first nation to abide by 
the rules set out in the Expropriation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand they have increased protection.  On the other 
hand they have not given any sense of increased protection at 
all.  This effectively means that the expropriation powers of the 
14 bands covered under the agreement are much stronger and much 
broader than expropriation powers anywhere else in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments that have been moved are not nearly sufficient to 
level the playing field and make the expropriation powers similar 
to other communities, other provinces or even the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responds and says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of things I should like to say.  First, there 
has been a very direct focus on ensuring that third-party 
interests are considered and managed appropriately as a result of 
this bill.  As honourable senators are aware, any kind of 
third-party interest that exists now will continue to exist until 
its expiration, even after the passage of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing to note is that the 14 First Nations have gone 
to considerable lengths to engage and consult third parties and 
must, with final agreement of their individual agreements, ensure 
that all third parties are aware of what is happening and what 
the circumstances of the land codes as developed will be.  The 
focus on third parties is a real one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to ensure that we pass good legislation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I find that a bit of a joke.  I will continue with the 
quote. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the priority for all of us, including First Nations who 
will be among the beneficiaries. I believe it is a win-win-win 
situation for all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have followed the debate and discussions you had around new 
language that may add clarity while not changing the intent of 
the bill.  I want to reiterate that the intention of the bill as 
presented is consistent with what now exists in the Indian Act 
and with what will be available, and what is available, to other 
expropriating bodies.  However, if we can get a clearer product 
and, from the point of view of the table, a better piece of 
legislation by clarifying the language, we must consider it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to that issue, I just wish to say again that it is 
vitally important that we get Bill C-49 completed and enacted 
into law. We have communities within the 14 First Nations who are 
stymied now, waiting for jobs and economic development.  I am 
thinking, for example, of the Scugog First Nation, who have other 
lease arrangements that are in limbo because we are waiting for 
this legislation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is going to the emotional appeal rather than 
addressing herself to the technicalities of this bill.  She, as 
the minister, should understand those technicalities.  She should 
understand the importance and significance of them and she should 
be able to speak to them. She was not prepared.  She danced all 
around the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard this minister speak many times. She is very good at 
emotional appeal.  She is very good at talking in generalities, 
but she is not very good at talking about specifics.  I believe 
the reason she is not is that she fundamentally does not 
understand this language herself.  I believe that she is acting 
at the behest of her own department and that her department is 
the one that formulates the legislation.  I also believe it is 
the department that pushes the agenda and that the minister is 
there as a mouthpiece for the department to do its bidding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This minister has shown over and over again, whether we are 
debating Bill C-49, the Nisga'a treaty or other issues, that she 
does not have a fundamental understanding of what she is talking 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another example of the minister not wanting to speak to 
the specifics of this bill.  She continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting this done must be a priority. I recognize that there are 
issues.  In that regard, making these clarifications may allow us 
to move forward with a good product.  I am hopeful that the table 
will encourage swift passage through the Senate and state loudly 
and clearly that they understand and appreciate how significantly 
important it is for the 14 First Nations to get on with it and 
for us to prove that, in fact, we can change the relationship and 
recognize, with courtesy, respect and dignity, the capacity and 
capability of First Nations to govern themselves. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There we have a clear, emotional appeal for courtesy, respect 
and dignity.  She is calling on us to have that, which we all 
have and want to have, but that is not the point.  It is not a 
matter of discourtesy or disrespect or a lack of appreciation for 
these 14 bands that leads us to this point.  It is a concern for 
the technicalities in this bill.  The minister does not want to 
address the issue so she dances all around it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Austin says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should like your assurance that the bill will be dealt with 
expeditiously in the House of Commons when sent there. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the extent that I have any kind of influence, believe me, it 
will be made clear that this bill is a priority for me.  I would 
ask the senators, in their report and at third reading, to 
clarify that it is an important undertaking for them as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also very respectful of the comments you have made with 
respect to Senator Austin's comments and the need for more 
clarity on expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the amendments that Senator Austin has proposed.  We 
also feel that there is a lack of clarity within the 
expropriation provisions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that Senator Ghitter is playing the minister's tune 
as well.  He is not prepared to take her on, on the aboriginal 
women's issue.  He is dancing to her tune.  He is not prepared to 
take her on, on the issue of consultation.  He is having a very 
nice conversation with the minister saying that they really 
appreciated her being there, that they really liked her words and 
that they agreed with the need for some clarity in the 
legislation.  He was not prepared to deal with the hard issues. 
We can see that this very mutual adoration society, I suppose, 
continues ad nauseam through this entire process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of my colleagues, because I do not want to put 
them through much more of this kind of painful experience, I will 
go on to talk a little bit more about the presentations that were 
actually made by the presenters as opposed to the senators.  I 
think members might hear a slightly different tone and a slightly 
different set of concerns. I can assure members that it was not a 
mutual admiration society when these people were presenting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start with Mrs. Marilyn Buffalo, who is president of the

the position of her association very clearly.  She said:

We are not opposed to the legislation.  We recognize the amount 
of work that has gone on here.  We recognize the good aspects in 
this bill.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will give the signatory band the authority to manage 
its own reserve lands and resources without having to obtain 
approval from the Minister of the Department of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development. We will celebrate this level of 
autonomy if the membership of the First Nations concerned enjoys 
and provides their informed consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Indian Act, there are no provisions offering 
protection of matrimonial property for native women in cases of 
divorce from Indian men. Native women, unlike other Canadian 
women, cannot obtain orders for possession or for partition and 
sale of reserve land under provincial legislation, according to 
the Supreme Court of Canada case Derrickson v. Derrickson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the B.C. Native Women's Society, typically, a 
native woman lives on her husband's reserve. This is likely due 
to the fact that previously the woman was legally bound to live 
on her husband's reserve. If the marriage ends, the woman and her 
children have no place to live because the husband usually keeps 
his house. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was Marilyn Buffalo, president of Native Women's 
Association of Canada, who was stating this.  It was not some 
Reform MP.  Why does the woman not understand this?  Often the 
woman cannot return to her old reserve unless she is divorced and 
she does not usually get support from her husband's reserve. This 
creates a desperate situation for the woman and her children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Buffalo continues to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the federal government has been aware of the 
deficiencies in the Indian Act, it has failed to provide a 
remedy. Considering the serious implications for native women, 
and the failure of the federal government to take action on their 
behalf, the B.C. Native Women's Association launched a court case 
against Canada. In that action, the B.C. Native Women's 
Association seeks two declarations: first, that the federal 
government has a constitutional responsibility under section 15 
of the Constitution Act to correct the inequality that exists in 
the Indian Act regarding matrimonial property; and, second, that 
the federal government cannot pass its fiduciary responsibility 
to correct the inequality deficiency on to the First Nations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, they are saying that the federal government has 
the responsibility.  They cannot delegate that.  That is what we 
are saying of the Nisga'a, they cannot delegate.  These are 
constitutional obligations that belong to the federal government. 
They cannot be delegated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Buffalo goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government answered the action by applying to the 
court to strike out those parts of the B.C. Native Women's 
Association statement of claim that relate to the framework 
agreement. On December 15, 1998, the signatory First Nations 
obtained intervener status in the case. On December 22, 1998, the 
judge announced that he would reserve his decision on the federal 
government's application.  As of this date, the judge has not 
returned his decision. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see what has happened.  The Native Women's Association 
has launched a suit against the federal government and the 14 
first nations that are signatory to Bill C-49, and are to be 
covered under it, have applied for intervener status.  They are 
trying to stop these women from achieving their goals.  It 
appears that the minister is taking the side of the leaders in 
these 14 bands rather than looking at this in a fair and unbiased 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She continues to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Native Women's Association of Canada certainly cannot blame 
the signatory chiefs for the fact that the Indian Act ignores the 
human equality and property rights of native women. It is the 
federal government that must answer for this particular breach of 
its fiduciary responsibility. It is the Native Women of Canada's 
responsibility to bring forward the concerns of native women 
regarding this bill. That is why we are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NWAC, as it is sometimes referred to, has already expressed very 
strenuously its great concern about this legislation to the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, to the 
Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples, and to the 
chiefs who support this bill, including the national chief 
himself. There has been no meaningful response to our efforts. 
Despite NWAC's discussion with the departments of Justice and 
Indian Affairs, there has been no serious commitment by the 
federal government to act on this matter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the presentation that was made in April of this year. 
No meaningful response to our efforts.  On June 9 at the National 
Native Women's Association annual general assembly the minister 
of Indian affairs announced her commitment to act on the concerns 
expressed by native women in regard to their equality and 
matrimonial property rights in cases of divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister announced that she would establish an independent 
fact finding process to examine native women's rights to 
matrimonial property when a marriage breaks down.  It would 
appear that this was meant to be just a smokescreen.  As the 
minister introduced Bill C-49 just two days later into the House 
of Commons she was well aware of the concerns that native women 
have with this legislation.  Almost a year later there has been 
very little action taken by the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development regarding the fact finding process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our great hope that this bill will not become law before 
the serious and obvious gaps are filled.  A provision was added 
to Bill C-49 that is supposed to address the issues that concern 
native women.  This provision is clause 17 which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A first nation shall, in accordance with the framework agreement 
and following the community consultation process provided for in 
its land code, establish general rules and procedures in cases of 
breakdown of marriage, respecting the use, occupation and 
possession of first nation land and the division of interests in 
first nation land; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nation shall, within 12 months after its land code 
comes into force, incorporate the general rules and procedures 
into its land code or enact a first nation law containing the 
general rules and procedures. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister described the third provision which is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nation or the minister may refer any dispute relating 
to the establishment of the general rules and procedures to an 
arbitrator in accordance with the framework agreement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister went on to say “However, this provision does not 
adequately address the concerns of native women.  In its current 
form the bill presents the following issues of concern. First, 
there is no indication of how cases of divorce and division of 
matrimonial property are to be dealt with within the 12 months 
following the community ratification of the land code. As each 
first nation is to predevelop its own land code, in the absence 
of any clear underlying principles, native women will not have 
any access to any consistent application of law concerning 
protection of their property rights as all other Canadian women 
have and all other native women have”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill states that the first nation or the minister may refer 
any dispute to an arbitrator but native women who may be victims 
of inequitable practices have not been given standing in the 
dispute resolution processes.  Moreover, who will pay for the 
native women's involvement in this process particularly when it 
is clear that native women are the poorest of the poor? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under clause 12 of Bill C-49, signatory first nations can obtain 
community approval for the adoption of their land code and an 
individual agreement by any process agreed upon by the first 
nation and the minister with a minimum approval of 25% plus one 
eligible voter.  This threshold is so low that it provides no 
assurance that the will of the community will be behind the new 
regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine instituting a land code with 25% plus one of the 
eligible voters in support of it.  Besides the lack of protection 
of native women's equality and property rights, another issued 
raised by Wendy Lockhart Lundberg causes great concern to native 
women. This has to do with the extraordinary expropriation powers 
given to the chief and council under clause 28 of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the House this is a native woman on behalf of 
the Native Women's Association of Canada appearing before a 
Senate standing committee saying that the expropriation powers, 
which I talked about, are far too powerful and far too broad for 
the band council. They do not need that kind of expropriation 
power.  She is also intimating that it is not only bad for 
non-native leaseholders, but it is also bad for native people and 
she goes on to explain why. I will cover that in just a minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wendy Lockhart Lundberg uses the example of her own mother to 
illustrate her concern about these extensive powers of 
expropriation.  Her mother's status was reinstated in 1985. 
However she has not been welcomed back to the Squamish nation 
although she is a member. 
As a status Indian she receives only health benefits.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Lockhart Lundberg's grandfather had a certificate of 
possession for two lots which he bequeathed to his daughter, Ms. 
Lockhart Lundberg's mother, in his will which was properly 
executed in accordance with the Indian Act.  These lots are still 
in his name but are occupied by other people and have not been 
referred to Ms. Lockhart Lundberg's mother. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask is that fair?  Is that what we in Canada want to see 
happen?  The band could easily expropriate those lots with 
minimal compensation because compensation need only be fair, 
whatever that means.  The first nation need only take into 
account the provisions of the Expropriation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Lockhart Lundberg is quick to point out that the 
expropriation powers can be used against all band members.  She 
was quoted in a House of Commons debate as saying that the 
Squamish first nation chief and council is rumoured to have plans 
to commercially develop valuable waterfront reserve lands in 
north Vancouver.  These plans could mean the displacement of band 
members to reserve lands further up the coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Lockhart Lundberg is saying that the band could in fact 
expropriate band members who are sitting on valuable waterfront 
property where their homes are.  They could be expropriated 
further up the coast to much less desirable land so that the band 
could build some kind of resort or multi-residential condominiums 
and so on for lease or for rent on the basis of where it thinks 
it will get the biggest revenue stream for band activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another of Ms. Lockhart Lundberg's complaints is that the 
Squamish first nation's chief and council did not have a 
community mandate to sign the framework agreement.  Clause 45 of 
the act stipulates that any band may sign on to the framework 
agreement on behalf of the band if it has been duly authorized to 
do so.  Ms. Lockhart Lundberg believes this means duly authorized 
by the community following consultation and a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A likely response from the signatory chiefs would be that duly 
authorized means the authorization comes with being elected by 
the community and that they are not only authorized as elected 
chiefs to act on behalf of the band, but they are obligated to do 
so. It sounds a lot like the Prime Minister who says “I was 
elected with 38% of the popular vote two and a half years ago 
which means I can do virtually anything I want for the next five 
years”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have to say that some of the band leaders who think 
this way have come by it honestly because they have had a lot of 
contact with prime ministers and governments who think precisely 
that way.  That is one of the reasons we have a real problem with 
accountability.  If there is a problem with accountability on 
reserves today, and there certainly is on many reserves, there is 
a real problem with accountability as we have seen in the last 
few weeks in the House of Commons when the Prime Minister is not 
willing to be accountable for his actions. These bands come by it 
honestly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an effort to create awareness in the community, Ms. Lockhart 
Lundberg has a core of about 10 women who have started a petition 
in opposition to Bill C-49.  The petition and the signatures were 
sent to Ted White, Reform Party member of parliament for North 
Vancouver.  As of April 6, some 262 signatures have been 
received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I need to admonish 
the hon. member for Skeena not to use the surnames of any members 
presently sitting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  My deepest and humblest apologies, Mr. 
Speaker.  I know that you admonished me once before.  It was an 
error, I can assure you.  I will try not to do it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national Native Women's Association of Canada supports Ms. 
Lockhart Lundberg in her outstanding efforts.  In keeping with 
the commitment of the Native Women's Association of Canada to 
advance issues and concerns of native women and in a spirit of 
co-operation and compromise, the association submits the 
following proposals to amend Bill C-49. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have people who are testifying before the Senate 
committee, because the Senate has not been able to come up with 
any worthwhile proposals for amendments, making their own 
suggestions for amendments.  They are hopeful the Senate is going 
to adopt them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first proposal is that into clause 6(3) there should be 
inserted a provision related to the division of matrimonial 
property which meets minimum recognized standards to serve until 
affected first nations implement a land code that includes 
division of matrimonial property on divorce provisions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second proposal concerns clause 12.  It is that an approval 
rate of a minimum of 51% of eligible voters for land codes and 
individual agreements should be required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third proposal regards clause 17, incorporated by reference 
into clauses 21(2) and 22(2), to add a minimum standard to 
guarantee that native women's rights to matrimonial property in 
divorce are no less than the rights of other women and to ensure 
consistency, equality and natural justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What could be more fundamental in a democracy than equality, 
consistency and natural justice?  What member in the House would 
dare stand up and speak against those principles?  What member in 
this House would dare suggest that these women are not entitled 
to these? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Sit down and give me a chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Why are the members who are making all 
the noise over there opposed to amending the bill to reflect 
those qualities, to give these women what they are looking for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth proposal regards clause 20, to add a provision 
specifying that the lawmaking powers would include the use, 
occupation and possession of the first nation land and a division 
of the interest in the first nation land in case of a marital 
breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth proposal is to add a provision specifying what happens 
regarding matrimonial property when a first nation law passed 
pursuant to Bill C-49 is inconsistent with provincial laws of 
general application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is interesting.  Mr. Speaker, I am sure you are very 
familiar with the Nisga'a treaty.  You have probably read it 
several times by now.  In the Nisga'a treaty when it comes to 
land management, this is the direction the federal government is 
going in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event of an inconsistency or conflict between a Nisga'a 
law and any federal or provincial law, the Nisga'a law will 
prevail. That is the direction the minister and the government 
are going in, not in the direction the aboriginal women's 
association of Canada is asking for. I use the Nisga'a as an 
example because I think it does point to the underlying 
philosophy and attitude of the Government of Canada under the 
Liberal administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seventh proposal recommends that clause 28 be amended to 
limit the powers of the expropriation provisions by adding a 
requirement for a community approval process calling for no less 
than a 51% approval rate of eligible voters.  Add a provision 
requiring that an appeal process be available to first nation 
members.  Add a requirement for all proposed expropriation orders 
and a subsequent community consultation process to be verified by 
an independent verifier jointly appointed by the first nation and 
the department of Indian affairs, and amend clause 28(5) to 
ensure that first nations must apply the rules for determining 
fair and full compensation as set out in the Expropriation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the one area where the Senate made some concessions.  It 
has put the band under the Expropriation Act.  It has not gone to 
the extent of saying that the powers of the expropriation be 
limited by requiring a 51% approval rate in the community.  It 
has not required that an appeal process be available to first 
nation members, but it has required by the amendments that we 
have before us, and we do agree that these amendments are a small 
step in the right direction, that the Expropriation Act 
provisions apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eighth proposal regards clause 45.  It recommends that 
“duly authorized” be defined as meaning supported by at least 
51% of the community as indicated in the community referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She went on to say that it would appear that the two greatest 
weaknesses of Bill C-49 are its lack of provisions protecting 
native women's aboriginal equality and property rights, and the 
extraordinary powers of expropriation accorded to signatory first 
nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NWAC is concerned mainly with the provisions and issues 
affecting native women and consideration for making the 
legislation more acceptable to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her opinion the amendments presented are reasonable.  Some of 
the chiefs of the signatory first nations have sent letters to 
NWAC members giving them assurances that the concerns of native 
women can and will be adequately addressed in the individual land 
codes. 
It is my strong belief that if it is the chiefs' intention to 
adequately address the concerns of native women anyway, then the 
chiefs should have no objection to the proposed amendments.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems to be pretty simple to me:  do not wait for the land 
quotes, put it in legislation.  If the chiefs are being upfront 
and genuine in saying that they want to see the issue addressed 
as well, then it should be in everybody's interest to incorporate 
it into the legislation and our concerns on this side of the 
House would be largely alleviated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She went on to say that she wanted it clearly understood that 
NWAC does not imply that the signatory chiefs have any intention 
of perpetrating discrimination against native women in their 
communities.  This submission is merely intended to point out 
potential problems with this legislation.  The fact is that any 
and all first nations will be able to sign the framework 
agreement, perhaps with the sole intention of abusing the 
substantial power contained within the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see that Marilyn Buffalo was saying the same thing that I 
have said.  We are not accusing the chiefs of trying to make a 
power grab so that they can take advantage of people; we are 
saying that words mean what they mean.  The reason we have laws, 
the reason we have constitutions, the reason we have these 
protections called the charter of rights and freedoms is not 
because we necessarily expect that somebody will take them away 
from us, but we want to guarantee that nobody ever can.  We want 
to make sure that we are protected.  These women are fighting for 
that same assurance.  They want to make sure that their rights 
are protected in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She continued by saying that members of the aboriginal community 
had asked not only at this committee but at previous committees 
whether or not NWAC had a mandate to address this issue.  The 
fact that they have been around for 25 years is an indication 
that there needs to be a voice, an independent voice, one that 
is not dominated by males and male dominated organizations.  That 
is the reason this organization was founded, not by them, but by 
their aunts and their grandmothers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purposes of the record, as she said before, NWAC is only 
one of the five national organizations that own real estate in 
Ottawa.  They are completely mortgage free and they do not spend 
money unless they have it.  They do all the work on a pro bono 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are contributing their time.  It is not like some of the 
other organizations that there are around here, in a wide variety 
of areas, where people are being paid big salaries.  These people 
are doing it out of a sense of commitment, not for the sake of a 
paycheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said that they have many friends and are prepared to go to 
the full extent of the law to be involved and to assist in any 
way they can.  She also said that the backgrounder that was 
developed and sent to every member of parliament and senator was 
done in-house by volunteers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator St. Germain then went on to thank Miss Buffalo for her 
presentation.  He said that he had a question which zeroed in on 
one particular incident in regard to Ms. Lockhart and the 
Squamish Band.  He asked if there were any other incidents in 
other parts of the country.  He indicated that perhaps she would 
not not want to explain why they zeroed in on this particular 
case.  However, he said that they were dealing with huge numbers 
of these situations and he wanted to know if they were isolated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Miss Buffalo said that her answer was twofold.  First, neither 
NWAC nor any other women's group was informed as to what was 
going on here in Ottawa.  Many of their women did not know about 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator St. Germain said “That happens to many of us”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Miss Buffalo said that should not be an excuse.  That is not 
acceptable.  Because they are poor they do not read the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I>.  It does not hit their reserve.  Nor does the 
<I>National Post</I>.  By the time they receive information it is 
by luck or through the native newspapers and many of them do not 
cover this issue.  By the time native women read this it is ready 
to become law.  That is the unfortunate reality.  She said that 
this was also not being debated in open public forums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator St. Germain asked:  “How are you funded?  Are you 
funded by the government?”

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She responded by saying that they receive funds of $300,000 a 
year from Heritage Canada.  That is their core funding from the 
national office, which they run through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The senator asked if there were several incidents which she 
could enumerate.  She said that there were, which is why at one 
point they were excited about the task force that was going 
across Canada, the proposed fact finder.  They were excited by 
the announcement that the minister made at their annual meeting.

<A NAME="LINK250">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ)</B> moved that 
Bill C-502, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (deduction of 
expenses incurred by a mechanic for tools required in 
employment), be now read a second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this bill, which 
I introduced in the House in order to raise an issue that has 
been around too long and is harmful to the growth of an 
essential sector of Canadian and Quebec industry, namely auto 
mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I introduce this bill on behalf of all the women and men who 
work as auto mechanics and have been calling for this bill for 
some years now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you are a democratically elected member of 
parliament, as I and every one of the 301 members of this House 
are. We all know that when we are campaigning and visit various 
car dealerships and garages, the mechanics frequently raise the 
issue of having a tax deduction for the cost of 
purchasing tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am calling for the co-operation of the House for I believe 
that there is nothing partisan about this legislation in the 
least.  The bill is presented with no malice and no ulterior 
motive, and I trust that my colleagues of all parties will 
subscribe to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take care to point out that it concerns mechanics and not the 
broader issue of the automobile, because I would need a number 
of hours more in order to explain the negative effects Quebec 
has felt since the implementation of the auto pact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I will simply say that since its 
implementation a number of years ago, this trade agreement with 
United States has benefited Ontario only. Given that 97% of 
automobile assembly takes place in Ontario, clearly the auto 
pact benefited Ontario. It explains in large measure the 
difference in the rates of unemployment between Quebec and 
Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking here about automobile mechanics in the true 
and literal sense of the word. Instead, we are talking about men 
and women who, day in day out, slog under automobile hoods in 
often difficult working conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is winter when they have to work under cars with salt, 
snow or slop literally running down their faces. These men and 
women slog, their hands covered in grease, in an effort to 
repair what many people—often the poor—consider one of their most 
valuable possessions. For many people, their only possession—when 
it is not borrowed from the bank—is a car. These men and women 
must be encouraged, and this is the intent of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say cars represent one of the most valuable possessions 
because of the major financial investment that their purchase or 
lease represents for Canadian and Quebec households. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to be able to make use of this investment, which we pay 
back at the end of each month to the bank, for a long time. 
This is why everyone wants cars to be well maintained and the 
necessary repairs made, hence the absolute necessity of being 
able to count on trained, competent and motivated mechanics to 
work on their cars and trucks.

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As things now stand, it is difficult for these mechanics to be 
able to work under ideal conditions because of the high cost of 
buying the tools they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my time is running out, I will conclude by saying that I 
am counting on all members of the House to support this bill. 
These men and women are asking the government to allow them to 
deduct from their income the cost of buying their tool set, 
which can run from $5,000 to $40,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately, what we want is for all of society to benefit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish to state that the 
completion of Bill C-49 is an urgent matter because it has been 
delayed some five months longer than hoped by dozens of groups of 
Canadians, both natives and others, who must await its passage 
before completing long overdue arrangements.

relation to Bill C-49— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  We are debating now a private member's bill on mechanics' 
tools.  I just cannot understand the relevance of the House 
leader for the governing party talking about Bill C-49 during 
this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I appreciate the 
intervention of the hon. member for Lakeland.  The government 
House leader rose on debate, was recognized and was making his 
point.

This is a debate on mechanics' tools.  This individual is totally

</I></B></P><P align=left>He is trying to sneak in a statement here which he cannot do any 
other way.  It is just downright dirty and I ask you to rule, Mr. 
Speaker, that what he is trying to do is out of order.  Let us 
get on with the debate on Private Members' Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Perhaps we can lower 
the temperature here a bit if we read the relevant standing 
order.  It is Standing Order 53(1).  If members will give me a

are doing here is absolutely kosher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The relevant standing order is found at page 30 of the standing

</I></B></P><P align=left>A motion has been proposed on a matter of urgent nature by the 
government House leader pursuant to Standing Order 53(1). If we 
go further into the standing orders, and if members would bear 
with me I would appreciate it because this is the first time this 
has happened to me as well, the Speaker has the option to provide 
for up to one hour of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time provided to debate the motion will be up to one hour. 
It is the purview of the Speaker to determine how it will be 
done. It would seem to be appropriate that it would be done by 
party at 10 minutes each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless someone else can give me a reason that we do it some 
other way that would be better, that is what we will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point or order. 
This is not according to the rules of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  I am not talking about the ruling.  I am 
talking about Beauchesne's, which I have not yet completely 
memorized, but I know that there is a citation in it which says 
that a member may not rise on debate as a guise for making a 
motion.  He cannot do that.  It is against the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The standing order 
very clearly states that “a Minister of the Crown may, at any 
time when the Speaker is in the Chair, propose a motion”.

debate the hon. member for Elk Island for 10 minutes.

nothing to say.  That is why he is not getting up to debate the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It has been pointed 
out to me that the mover of the motion should be the first

full 10 minutes to say what most of us in the House think at this 
point.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The member who is speaking, the House leader of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The member rose on debate.  Once he said his piece, he 
moved his motion, which is fine— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The government House 
leader moved the motion.  The Speaker then had to read the motion 
into the record, present it to the House.  From that point on 
debate on the motion started.  There had been no debate on that 
motion until it was read to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. government House leader on debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I was saying, I do not 
think I need much time to convey what most members think about 
this issue and about what has been occurring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us stick mainly to the issue.  The issue is that the 
aboriginal community and indeed several other Canadians involved 
with the issue of land claims have been urging us for months and 
months and months to pass Bill C-49, which we did.  The Senate 
considered it and made an amendment which most of us concur in. 
Many of us have had members of Canada's first nations communities 
urge us to pass this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conclusion to all of that is that we need this bill 
urgently.  I do believe that most of us think in our hearts that 
we have already said that is precisely what we would do and that 
is precisely what I am urging the House to do now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 53(2) very clearly states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the Minister has stated reasons for the urgency of such a 
motion, the Speaker shall propose the question to the House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister never stated the purpose of this motion and the 
urgency of it.  Therefore the motion is out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  When the hon. member 
for Elk Island stood the first time, as I recall and we can check 
the blues, the hon. government House leader made the point of why 
it was an urgent matter and then went into it.  We can check 
blues.  I know the hon. member for Elk Island is a student of 
House procedure. We recognize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the opinion of the clerk that this is being done strictly 
according to the standing orders of the House of Commons. 
Therefore the Chair accepts it and recognizes the member for Elk 
Island on debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, often in 
this House when we speak we say we are so pleased to stand here. 
I often think of it still.  This is a place of honour.  I am 
called the hon. member for Elk Island, as all members here are 
called honourable.  I wish that I could on this occasion also 
stand to say that I am really happy to speak to this motion.  I 
am not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion the government House leader has brought forward is 
that we should suspend Private Member's Business. That is the 
motion, that we should now talk about Bill C-49, for which the 
time for debate ended earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is unconscionable.  For years and years and years the 
government front bench, whether it is the Conservatives or the 
Liberals, has controlled Private Members' Business.  Here we are 
into Private Members' Business speaking about a very important 
bill, that of double taxation for mechanics who have to buy tools 
in order to make their living.  This motion is now pre-empting 
that very important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-502 is important to Canadians.  The bill has been brought 
forward by a private member, a bill that should properly be dealt 
with in Private Members' Business.  The government over there 
says “Private Members' Business nothing.  Democracy, who cares 
about it?”  All the Liberals are about is getting their own way 
and pushing their way around like schoolyard bullies.  That is 
not acceptable.  It is wrong.

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of ways of getting Bill C-49 passed.  The 
government ran twice on its red book platform of making 
government more accountable, making government more democratic, 
doing things that are right according to the rules of the House 
and everything.  This is the same government which is now 
invoking closure on a bill which is incomplete.  That is why we 
are opposing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not pulling a shenanigan today.  We are simply exercising 
a parliamentary process.  We are exercising a duty in order to 
ensure that the flaws in Bill C-49 are corrected. The government 
wants to invoke closure and just ram it through because the 
Liberals want to go on their golfing vacations.  They want to go 
away. They do not want to be here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in deep trouble if members of parliament replace the 
urgency and the need for running the government on behalf of the 
people of Canada with the urgency to get out of Ottawa.  I am 
willing to stay here until the end of September if I have to in 
order to correct the flaws in the bill.  It is shameful that the 
government just snubs its nose at the democratic process, at 
debate, invokes closure and brings in these bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a new thing.  It happens every June.  It happens 
every December.  The government waits until then for the things 
it knows are not popular and not right and it hopes that the 
opposition will tire.  The Liberals hope that we will not care 
enough and that we too will want to join them on the golf course. 
Well, we do not.  We are here to represent the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the time to debate Bill C-49.  There are some very 
important flaws in that bill which must be corrected. It is our 
job as the official opposition, indeed it is our job as members 
of parliament and it should have been the job of the senators, to 
fix the errors in that bill which make it unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is unacceptable to women.  Aboriginal women are being 
cut off from the rights that every other Canadian has.  They are 
being cut off by the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed an amendment to it.  Of course the government. 
invoked closure.  It invoked its “Let us get our MPs to stand 
and vote when we pull their strings”.  The Liberal members got 
up and passed it without the amendment.  As a result, aboriginal 
women will not have the rights that are rightfully theirs because 
of the lack of the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can think of other things, such as the right to confiscate 
land, to foreclose on land and all sorts of different things.  We 
are dealing with people whose right of lease is being transferred 
and they have no rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incredible that the government is not willing to go 
through the democratic process.  As I said, there is a very 
simple way to get this bill passed and that is to correct its 
several little flaws.  That is all we are asking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often when we use words they have a tendency to reflect on 
ourselves so I want to be very careful when I use the word, but 
an element of arrogance is involved in a person who says “I have 
it absolutely right and you do not know a thing”.  That is what 
they are saying over there.  The Liberals are saying that the 
members of the opposition do not know that there are some flaws 
in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we heard today, the hon. member for Skeena has had many 
representations from people in the native community, from women 
and others.  He has had representations from people who live on 
lands adjoining the native reserves.  Those people have brought 
forward some very important concerns which ought to be corrected. 
What is the point of ramming this bill through and getting it 
wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my former bosses had a little placard on the bulletin 
board in his office which read “If you don't have time to do it 
right, when will you find time to do it again?” 
It is fine when we are working in an office somewhere to say that 
we have to take the time to do it right, otherwise we will have 
to find more time to do it again. When we are dealing with issues 
like this, doing it again is not a tenable option.  Once a bill 
is passed into law, it is usually very difficult to backtrack and 
to correct the errors and flaws in it.

promised to do and which it is failing to do. Exercise a true, 
democratic process here and not the bullying tactics.  Do not 
play the schoolyard bullies by saying “It is our way or no way. 
We are bigger than you.  We have 156 members and you do not have 
that many so we are just going to march forward and you poor

there do not want to do their work.  That is not acceptable.

to get out of here to supersede the urgency and importance of 
doing our job and doing it right.  I am embarrassed to be part of 
a parliament that is so eager to get out of this place and go 
back to the ridings, as important as that is.  Do those members 
have holidays planned?  What do they have planned?  I do not 
know.

be here in any event because I have it booked.  I have work to do 
here.  I am here to represent the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely shameful that the members over there are so 
eager to get out of here that they will not work on a bill for a 
little longer and perhaps accept some amendments from the 
opposition that will fix the flaws.  Then at the end of the day 
we could stand up proudly before our children and our 
grandchildren, before Canadians from coast to coast and say that 
we did a good job when we were in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the Liberals are going to be hanging their heads in 
shame and saying “We should not have done that.  We should have 
listened to other heads, but instead ours were totally clouded. 
They were on the other side and we assumed that they did not know 
what they were talking about”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those Liberals over there have a lot of wisdom, but there is 
also some wisdom on this side.  If we worked together we would 
get much better legislation on behalf of the Canadian people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-502, 
an act to amend the Income Tax Act (deduction of expenses 
incurred by a mechanic for tools required in employment), be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I must 
say that I am actually embarrassed to be a member of the House 
today because of what has just happened.  It is completely 
unacceptable for the government House leader and those opposite 
to pull these kinds of shenanigans and interrupt Private Members' 
Business, which is important business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would allow a tax deduction for mechanics' tools for 
the 90,000 mechanics across this country who want to be treated 
fairly under our tax laws.  When this issue was debated last year 
it was under my bill, Bill C-366.  The bill which we are debating 
tonight is exactly the same bill, except that one number has 
changed, the value of the tools.  When it was debated, every 
party in the House, except the governing party, supported that 
bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1935"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I even received letters and confirmation from many members of 
the governing party who supported the bill.  Tonight, what do we 
have?  We have the government House leader trying to interrupt a 
debate on this important bill so the government can bring forward 
a bill which it has had months and months to deal with. 
Actually, it is years.  I apologize for my underestimation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why now is it so willing, without thought it seems, to interrupt 
this important private member's bill?  I do not know, but it is 
wrong and I am embarrassed to be in the same House as these 
members who would try to pull that stunt.  It is shocking and 
completely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-502, as I have said, is identical to Bill C-366 which was 
debated last year.  This bill is asking for a tax deduction for 
mechanics' tools where it is a requirement of employment that 
they purchase their own tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, mechanics, who are generally low wage earners, most 
of whom earn $20,000 to $25,000, and there are 90,000 of them 
across the country, are forced to pay thousands of dollars for 
tools with after tax dollars.  It is double taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people in small businesses buy tools, for example farmers, 
they are allowed to deduct the full purchase price of any tools 
under $200.  The value of tools over $200 can be written off and 
claimed under the capital cost allowance.  They can write them 
off very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would put mechanics on the same footing as small 
business people, musicians and several other groups which can 
claim and deduct, for the purposes of taxation, the cost of their 
tools.  There are several groups who are already allowed to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government speaking out against this piece of 
legislation?  It is really hard to understand.  It seems that 
whenever the Liberal Party or the finance minister talk about tax 
fairness it really means one thing.  The government is very 
willing to look at tax fairness and implement what it calls tax 
fairness when it means more tax.  However, in this case, if this 
bill were to pass, it would mean that less taxes would be taken 
out of the pockets of mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader was willing to throw all of that aside, to 
interrupt the debate and to kill the debate.  We will not get 
another chance to debate this bill before the House breaks for 
the summer.  He was willing to just throw these 90,000 mechanics 
aside and say to heck with them, they are not important.  It does 
not matter to the government if mechanics have to spend $15,000 
on tools, out of their own pockets, when they cannot write off 
the expense.  It does not seem to matter at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It matters to the other parties.  The other parties have come 
out as being clearly in favour of this bill.  They did when it 
was my bill, Bill C-366, and they have tonight.  The finance 
committee, on at least two occasions since 1993, has clearly been 
in favour of this change, which would make the tax system far 
more fair.  It would allow a deduction for mechanics who purchase 
tools when it is a requirement of employment that they own their 
own tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue came before the House last year.  It came in the form 
of a very broad motion once or twice before.  It is time we dealt 
with this because it is important to those 90,000 mechanics, and 
it is important to me.  I believe that everyone should be treated 
fairly.  Clearly, fairness in this case means that mechanics and 
others in similar situations should be allowed to claim this 
deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will amount to something like $60 million a year which the 
the government will not be able to grab from these people.  That 
is why it is not supporting it, because it will lose $60 million 
a year in tax revenue.  We know that it just cannot get enough. 
There have been dozens and dozens of tax increases since the 
government came to power in 1993.  We know very well that it has 
increased the tax take by over $30 billion a year since 1993.  It 
is completely unacceptable that it would try to throw this all 
aside and snub mechanics once again as it has done several times 
in the House and as it has done twice in the last year.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I brought this bill forward the last time, I received 7,000 
letters from mechanics across Canada in two months.  Copies were 
sent to the finance minister.  He knows that these letters have 
been received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of sincerity does the government show in debating this 
bill?  Under access to information I received a copy of the 
speech that the parliamentary secretary gave when he spoke to my 
bill.  That access to information request showed that he did not 
even write the speech.  He did not even show the courtesy to 
mechanics to write his speech.  The access to information request 
showed that a departmental official from inside the finance 
department wrote his speech, and he delivered the speech.  He 
delivered it just like a good little boy should.  That is the 
lack of respect that the parliamentary secretary has for those 
mechanics, who are only asking for what is fair.  Government 
members do not even have the courtesy to write their own 
speeches.  They get departmental officials to do that.  It is 
disgusting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time this bill passed.  I am going to support this bill. 
We are going to support this bill.  The Bloc is going to support 
this bill.  I believe the Conservatives will.  They did the last 
time.  The NDP will support it.  NDP members have received 
letters.  There should be a lot of Liberal MPs who support this 
bill as well.  If they do not, I can guarantee that they are 
going to get letters from their constituents.  They will have to 
explain to their constituents that they would not even support 
this issue, which is a clear issue of tax fairness.  That is all 
it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently came back from Prince Edward Island.  I was amazed by 
the number of times I heard those people say that this House is 
no longer a democratic institution.  They have seen their members 
vote on issues which they know they do not support.  They have 
seen them vote in favour because their whip has told them that 
they are going to support the bill.  They pointed to several 
bills, one being the old Bill C-68, the gun registration bill. 
They are still upset about that.  They are going to continue to 
be upset about that until we get into power and throw that 
legislation out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are upset for several reasons.  They are upset with the 
legislation, but they are also upset with the process.  The 
process is no better tonight.  We see tonight, again, government 
members opposite showing a total lack of caring, a lack of 
respect.  The Liberals are showing arrogance, arrogance which we 
know comes before the fall.  We are seeing a level of arrogance 
on that side of the House that I have never seen in this place 
before.  I believe it will not be too far down the road when that 
fall comes.  The Liberals have come to think that they have all 
the answers.  They have come to think that the people they are 
supposed to be governing for do not matter any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, they have sent the message very clearly to 90,000 
mechanics who only want what is fair.  The House of Commons 
finance committee has said it is fair on two occasions.  Just to 
point out to government members, as if they do not know it, the 
House of Commons finance committee is controlled by a majority of 
government members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a committee controlled by a majority of government 
members which said, “Yes, let's do this.  Let's give these 
mechanics their tax deduction”.  Now is the time to do it.  Let 
us just do it, with no more stalling.  Let us do it now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I share 
the concern of the hon. member about the way the government 
continues to utilize the House as a tool for its own short term 
purposes. 
It refuses to treat the House of Commons with the respect that it 
clearly deserves and treat Canadians with the respect that they 
clearly deserve.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak on Bill C-502, an act to amend the Tax Act.  I will 
then discuss some of the types of tax reforms in a more holistic 
since that I believe is necessary in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supportive of this private member's bill, which deals 
with an amendment to the Income Tax Act, to allow the deduction 
of expenses for mechanic tools required in employment.  This is 
not the first time this important issue has been raised in the 
House.  It is not the first time that the government has not 
dealt with this issue, despite the fact that the finance 
committee has recommended that there be changes to the Income Tax 
Act to reflect the intent of the legislation.  Beyond the fact 
that there is widespread support for this issue, there is 
multi-partisan support, including the Reform Party, the New 
Democratic Party, the Progressive Conservative Party and the Bloc 
Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, if implemented, will have a positive impact on one of 
the most important industries in Canada, the automobile industry. 
There are over 115,000 mechanics working and paying taxes in 
Canada.  Mechanics have a very significant initial cost to enter 
the trade.  Effectively, some initially invest an average of 
$15,000 in tools.  Some initially invest as much as $40,000 in 
tools. They will have to replace this worn out equipment and buy 
newer equipment every year.  It is like members of parliament. We 
have a very short shelf life.  Sometimes we only last four years. 
Our depreciation rate is very rapid.  However, these expenses are 
very difficult to justify when we consider that the average 
income for a mechanic is about $29,000 per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important piece of legislation.  It is difficult 
for mechanics and people in this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the phone going off.  It is probably the results of the 
vote.  It reminds me of the song by Johnny Cash and June Carter 
Cash “We got married in a fever hotter than a pepper sprout” 
and we have been looking for Preston ever since the fire went 
out.  That is another story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  If I heard right, the hon. member used an hon. member's 
name in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  How could that 
happen?  If it did, would the hon. member for Kings—Hants do 
what is necessary to correct it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sorry.  I may have 
been mistaken.  I believe they may have thought I said Preston, 
but I in fact said that we need to press on.  If we are going to 
provide a national alternative to this government, we need to 
press on and work co-operatively to ensure that happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to private member's Bill C-502, which is of course the 
important piece of legislation that we are discussing at this 
time.  It is very important that we encourage those people who 
are inclined to study and educate themselves to become mechanics 
and pursue this line of work.  We have a shortage of skilled 
mechanics right now across Canada.  From a labour market 
flexibility perspective, there are not enough people doing this 
work at this time which creates significant problems for the 
Canadian automobile industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the finance committee has been 
consistent in recommending in both the 1996 and 1997 prebudget 
reports that we allow the tax deductibility of tools and amend 
the Income Tax Act to facilitate that.  The finance committee 
makes a lot of recommendations, some of which the government 
takes seriously and some of which it does not. 
It treats recommendations from the finance committee or from any 
other agency or committee like a buffet.  It chooses from the 
buffet and consumes, in terms of public policy, what it deems to 
be politically palatable and leaves the rest.  The unfortunate 
thing is that Canadians are not getting the issues dealt with in 
the serious visionary way they need.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first looked at the legislation, my initial concern was 
that it would further complicate the tax code.  I am really 
concerned that the Canadian tax code is far too complicated and 
too complex.  It encourages one type of behaviour and discourages 
another.  I call it a Pavlovian tax code.  There is a bit of 
Pavlovian psychology in trying to encourage Canadians to do some 
things and the government trying to discourage other types of 
behaviours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments are very poor at picking winners and losers in terms 
of tax policy and incentives.  I am typically very much adverse 
to an amendment that would further complicate the tax code.  I 
then thought about it and asked myself what the chances were that 
we would get any serious tax reform out of the government 
opposite or any significant broad based tax relief.  I thought 
that the chances were probably fairly low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could get some type of tax relief for hard-working 
mechanics across Canada, even if it would further complicate the 
tax code—and that is not something we want to see—and even if 
it only came in bit by bit, that would be a positive step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we would really like to see is the Canadian government 
actually dealing with the tax issue and the systemic flaws in the 
tax code in a more holistic manner.  The most important purpose 
of taxation is obviously to raise revenue.  Another purpose, to a 
certain extent, is the redistribution of income.  However, our 
tax code is trying to do too many things within the Canadian 
structure.  We need to adapt our tax structure and our transfer 
structure.  We need to take a serious look at changing and 
updating our equalization system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has recently been a trend among provinces to adopt a 
predatory tax policy to reduce taxes in order to attract 
businesses and people to the provinces.  I think that is actually 
very sound.  It has been done in Alberta with Premier Klein and 
in Ontario with Premier Harris.  We have seen it more recently in 
New Brunswick with the new Premier Bernard Lord.  Tax reduction 
and significant tax cuts resonate significantly with Canadians as 
do messages from governments that keep their word.  Mike Harris 
and Ralph Klein have remained consistent in keeping their word 
and providing meaningful tax relief to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With provinces pursuing predatory tax policy, the perverse 
impact would ultimately be that the provinces that can least 
afford to have an aggressive tax policy, the provinces that need 
economic growth the most, like in Atlantic Canada, will actually 
have the highest tax rates because their fiscal situations do not 
allow them to reduce taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that one of the issues the Canadian government 
should be looking at is a change to the equalization system and 
to the tax and transfer system such that over a 10 year period 
governments, like the one of Bernard Lord in New Brunswick or the 
future government of John Hamm, the future Progressive 
Conservative premier of Nova Scotia, could see, over a period of 
time, incentives to the equalization system to reduce their 
provincial taxes.  Over a period of time, the equalization system 
would be phased into a system that would actually encourage 
provinces to reduce taxes.  Currently the opposite is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just one of the issues that needs to be dealt with. 
There are literally hundreds of issues within the tax system that 
need to be addressed.  Canadians need a significant overhaul of 
the tax code in Canada.  We have not had serious tax reform since 
the early 1990s, some in the late 1980s, both of which were under 
the previous Progressive Conservative government of Brian 
Mulroney, which had the vision to do what was right but not 
always what was popular.  Prior to that, the last serious tax 
code reform was back in 1971 with the Carter commission.

biggest impediment to growth, jobs and prosperity in Canada:  a 
Canadian taxation system and tax code that is archaic and is not 
working.  We want to get Canadians working.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, again we have heckling coming 
from the Reform Party.  I must apologize to you for having to sit 
through that speech with all the rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  It hurts, does it not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  The hon. member says it hurts.  If the 
hon. member had any sense at all, he would perhaps deal with some 
of the facts rather than deal with this kind of back and forth 
taunting that he is so accustomed to. It 
is too bad he had to bring it to the House as well. I 
unfortunately cannot apologize to his constituents.  Hopefully 
when he goes back he will do that himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to do is basically deal with this particular 
matter.  As members have indicated in the House, this issue has 
come before the House and members have commented on this.  The 
finance committee has looked at it, has listened to witnesses and 
has included this particular measure in its report as part of a 
prebudget consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to go back to some of the comments made by the 
Reform Party member earlier and restate the state of confusion 
that he is in.  He seems to be confused about the types of 
employment that people are involved in.  He confuses 
self-employment with working for an employer.  He talked about 
the ability of farmers to deduct versus the ability of 
individuals who are employees of a particular corporation to not 
be able to deduct certain expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that work related employees' expense 
deductions are not available because employers normally provide 
items required for employees to perform their duties.  It is true 
in large part, but the hon. member across the way, the mover of 
this particular motion, is also correct that in some occupations 
it is not true.  In fact, automobile mechanics do incur 
substantial expenses as a condition of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know from the hon. members who spoke on this issue 
earlier, that it is also a complex issue.  I would therefore like 
to frame the issue with respect to a number of tax policy 
principles.  I think all members would agree that any change in 
tax policy needs to be fair and that the changes would also need 
to be relatively simple to administer and easy to comply with for 
the taxpayers.  They should also be consistent with respect to 
the government's overall fiscal situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task of finding appropriate tax treatment for mechanics' 
tools is difficult.  I often welcome this type of debate because 
it gives members on both sides of the House the opportunity to 
put forward their perspectives on certain issues.  I do want to 
highlight some of the challenges that we would face as a 
government with respect to this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I meet with mechanics in my riding and I often look forward 
to that opportunity.  We do engage in an exchange that is usually 
a healthy exchange, unlike the exchange that takes place between 
the Reform Party and ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that mechanics are not the only occupation in which 
employees incur substantial expenses as a requirement of 
employment, it would difficult to justify providing tax relief 
solely to mechanics to the exclusion of all others, which is in 
fact what this private member's bill proposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax relief has been requested for work related expenses and it 
has been sought to include individual personal computers 
purchased by employees, reading materials or professional 
journals, other general costs associated with skills upgrading, 
as well as tools for employee tradespersons, which is essentially 
another very important aspect to look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In extending tax relief to many equally deserving taxpayers, or 
as the hon. members across the way would say, just extend it to 
everyone, it is also important to recognize that it would 
certainly incur substantial expenses.  We would need to look at 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Kings—Hants talks about looking at this 
issue and says that we are not really in agreement with it 
because it would complicate the tax system even further.  I am in 
agreement with that.  We need to provide some greater reduction 
in taxes and to ensure that tax reduction simplifies the tax 
system and does not in any way complicate it.

<A HREF="#LINKT112"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that when any tax relief is provided it is 
only for items required as a condition of employment and not 
for personal use.  I mentioned earlier in my speech that 
there are other areas for which people have requested tax relief 
which would involve personal use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that the provisions we need to address with 
respect to these issues would inevitably be complex since they 
would need to account for a large variety of items for which tax 
recognition may be claimed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point to one and how difficult it often is to audit this 
type of expense.  Let us consider the extensive provisions needed 
just to ensure the equitable recognition of automobile expenses. 
This type of tax relief would complicate the tax system even 
further and involve a whole bunch of regulatory burden and other 
measures which would not in any way simplify the system but 
rather complicate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of what I have mentioned, I think hon. members would 
agree that the bill does not properly take into account issues 
which need to be considered before tax recognition could be 
provided for employee expenses, and in particular mechanics' 
tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The complexities associated with the proposed measure and the 
small size of the fiscal surplus lead us to a point where we feel 
that tax relief—and I know all members are in agreement with tax 
relief—should be directed toward broad tax relief to all 
Canadians.  We have a challenge with our personal income tax 
system.  We recognize that it is the highest in terms of the G-7 
countries.  We recognize that.  We have begun to reduce personal 
income taxes.  Obviously members opposite do not think it is 
enough.  They do not mind going back into a deficit position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians insist that governments maintain balanced books 
and demand that governments provide priority spending, provide 
tax relief and ensure that the debt continues to be paid down. 
That is the program we have embarked upon and one that we will 
continue to put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about tax relief, certainly I would not be an 
advocate of tax relief which would complicate the tax system even 
further.  I would advocate tax relief for Canadians at all levels 
of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we started to provide tax relief by increasing the 
basic exemption, ensuring that all Canadians would benefit from 
it.  We have eliminated the 3% surtax for those Canadians who 
were paying it, because that surtax was directed specifically to 
paying down the deficit.  Since we have eliminated the deficit 
the 3% surtax has now been eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to go further.  We also have to look at employment 
insurance.  Most members opposite complain that employment 
insurance premiums are too high, but they very rarely mention 
that employment insurance premiums have been reduced by billions 
of dollars since we have come to office and will continue to be 
reduced.  I find it quite ironic that often members opposite— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Obviously members opposite are now 
listening for the first time.  I find it ironic that they 
continue to advocate tax relief and at the same time come forward 
on a specific measure which would complicate the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same mechanics who are paying taxes which members opposite 
feel are too high would be robbed of any further broad based tax 
relief.  As all Canadians realize, there is not a big black hole 
full of Canadian taxpayer dollars.  We have to make choices and 
the choice of the government is to continue to provide broad 
based tax relief to ensure that we can stay in balance, to ensure 
that there is priority spending in health care and education, and 
to ensure that we continue to pay down the national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every Canadian now realizes that we pay some $40-odd billion in 
interest on the national debt.  They are not about to sit by and 
tell us to give it to certain measures which might be the pet 
projects of members opposite and rob us of the tax relief we are 
looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not something that I will support.  I say to my 
constituents back home that we will continue to support broad 
based tax relief.  We will continue to support a broad based 
program which meets the needs and priorities of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand, appreciate and empathize with the positions of 
members opposite that a deduction with respect to mechanics' 
tools is something that governments need to take into account. It 
is not just mechanics' tools, as I mentioned.  There are a number 
of other occupations where the relationship is not one of 
self-employed or contract but of employees that are required to 
make substantial investments.

put on the table I would submit most Canadians would agree that 
what is required is to continue to provide the greatest 
simplicity in the tax system, to continue to ensure that we pay 
down the debt, and to continue to ensure that we provide broad 
based tax relief, even if members opposite would disagree.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak 
today to Bill C-502, the purpose of which is to permit mechanics 
to deduct from their taxable income the cost of tools they are 
required to buy to practice their trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In visiting my constituents in the riding of Lotbinière, I often 
hear from mechanics and employees in car dealerships about how 
it is unfair that they are not entitled to this deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the hon. member opposite told us that the Standing 
Committee on Finance had looked at this matter and immediately 
acknowledged the problem.  This is what the committee had to 
say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Committee believes that all Canadian employees should be 
allowed to deduct from their income the cost of large mandatory 
employment expenses. Special provisions in the Income Tax Act 
already apply to artists, chainsaw operators and musicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To deny this tax treatment to apprentices and technicians in the 
automotive industry is not only unfair, it also imposes an 
impediment to employment, especially for the young who might 
choose to work as apprentices. Revising the tax treatment of 
such expenses would remove the impediment that exists under the 
present tax rules. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the December 1997 prebudget tour report, which the 
Liberals contributed to. However, they have a lot of ideas and 
consider many subjects. They analyze, but action must wait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give some statistics on the automotive industry. 
Independent business alone employs over 150,000 professionals to 
maintain and repair automobiles, including some 25% in Quebec, 
representing some 40,000 individuals, who are affected by this 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The media often debate important issues involving automotive 
manufacturers but short shrift is given vehicle maintenance and 
repair professionals who, unfortunately, are forced as a 
condition of employment to buy their own tools and to maintain 
them in perfect working order, and to pay insurance costs on top 
of the cost of buying and maintaining them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a heavy financial burden because, in addition to normal 
wear on tools, technological advances require these technicians 
to constantly invest in new equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are few statistics. An apprentice automobile mechanic must 
spend between $2,000 and $5,000 to buy the tools necessary to 
his trade. This same mechanic, who cannot work without a set of 
functional and modern tools, will have to spend in the first 5 
to 10 years over $15,000 on tools. 
If he specializes, he will have to spend between $30,000 and 
$40,000. This is a far from negligible expenditure, justifying 
in our opinion the request we are making today that this be tax 
deductible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at this a little more closely. Mechanics in Quebec 
and Canada live in an unfair situation and it is high time that 
the parliamentarians in this House do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill being debated this evening is intended to enable people 
employed as mechanics to deduct the cost of the tools they 
provide if they have to do so as part of the conditions of 
their employment. 
More precisely, the deduction could cover the cost of renting 
these tools; costs related to their maintenance; related 
insurance; the full purchase price of tools under $250; and, 
subject to regulatory adjustment of this amount reflecting 
inflation and the capital allowance cost, tools of more than 
$250.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that this measure would make tax equity possible 
for these people, who richly deserve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem raised, which we should also look at in relation 
to this highly unfair situation, is the matter of the next 
generation of mechanics.  This is food for thought for our 
Minister of Finance and our Minister of Revenue. Here we have a 
sector of employment not to be overlooked as an opportunity for 
young workers, particularly when there is so much youth 
unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a duty therefore to look seriously at this 
matter.  It must not use the excuse that if it allows this 
deduction for mechanics other trade groups will be calling for 
something similar. 
That is the usual evasive tactic used by the Liberals across the 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They hide.  They are frightened.  They sidestep out of fear of 
creating a precedent but precedent has been set long ago with 
this government.  We need only think of the Employment Insurance 
Act and, more recently, the legislation that is going to allow 
the government to get its hands on $30 billion from the pension 
funds of public servants, RCMP employees and Canadian Armed 
Forces personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the mechanics' demands, as I have demonstrated, 
the cost of their tools is astronomical.  I would remind hon. 
members that a tool of the trade is a tool of the trade, whether 
it is the virtuoso's violin, the logger's chainsaw, or the 
various tools used by a mechanic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will review the precise objectives of this bill. 
First, the bill's purpose is to ensure that mechanics receive 
equitable tax treatment that is identical to that received by 
farmers and commensurate with that received by chain saw 
operators, artists and musicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill is intended to alleviate the financial burden 
imposed on mechanics, whose terms of employment require them to 
buy their own tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the bill would offer a solution to the serious shortage 
of manpower in the automotive trades.  Enrolment in apprentice 
programs would go up and more mechanics would be able to 
continue in this line of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the bill seeks to create jobs for young unemployed 
Canadians and Quebecers, because talented young people are 
beginning to realize that a career in the automotive industry is 
increasingly within their reach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, the bill would permit mechanics to continue providing the 
public with the customary level and quality of vehicle repair 
and maintenance services, which will be to the benefit of all 
car owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, I feel that the bill would be good for 
the economy and job creation.  The Bloc Quebecois and I are in 
favour of the measures I have just outlined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the majority of members on this side of the House 
are aware of this completely unfair situation, which is 
penalizing people who do a lot for our society.  Is there anyone 
nowadays that does not need a mechanic?  People pay a lot for a 
car and want good service for it.  This takes skilled people who 
do a good job, but these people need help with their tax load. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, a tax break for those working in this sector is 
essential.  It is something parliament should address.  It is a 
situation that is hard to understand because other sectors have 
already been given a tax break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it is typical of this government to have a double 
standard.  It is always difficult to clarify matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite said earlier that what we are asking for 
will complicate the system, but I say that it will clarify it. 
It will give hard-working, honourable people the deductions that 
will allow them to do a better job, provide better service and 
be happier in their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I wish for them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, after 
this evening's shenanigans or Shawinigans, whatever it is, both 
words are synonymous, pulled by this arrogant, weak, lazy Liberal 
government with no vision, I rise on behalf of the people of 
Surrey Central to speak to Private Members' Bill C-502. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-502 seeks to allow mechanics to deduct the cost of tools 
from their income tax.  It will allow them to write off the costs 
of a set of tools which they need to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is virtually the same bill as one previously submitted 
by a Reform Party member, the hon. member for Lakeland, in the 
previous session.  The hon. member for Elk Island spoke to that 
bill. Unfortunately that bill was deemed non-votable despite 
receiving the broad support of all opposition parties, but not 
the support of the arrogant, weak, lazy Liberal government with 
no vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many mechanics, perhaps around 100,000 in Canada, are expected 
by their employers to provide their own tools. In fact mechanics, 
including auto body mechanics, cannot even apply for certain jobs 
unless they have their own tools.  If their tools are not good 
tools, it may affect them in terms of their job performance.  It 
may affect them in terms of being able to keep their job.  If 
they do not have good tools, they may not be working under safe 
conditions.  If their tools are not good enough or are limited in 
quantity, they try not to let anyone find out about it because 
they are afraid of losing their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Richard Denniston, a constituent of mine in Surrey Central, 
told me that auto technicians have to spend at least $20,000 on 
tools and upgrading their tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mechanics are not like many other workers who simply show up for 
work with the appropriate clothing.  Mechanics are special.  They 
need to show up for work with the tools they can use and trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-502 is to offer an incentive for mechanics 
that will encourage growth and job creation in this sector of our 
economy.  “Give us the tools so we can do the job” is all the 
mechanics are saying. The bill will treat mechanics in a similar 
fashion, in a fair manner, as other professionals and 
tradespeople. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many self-employed people are allowed to claim as deductions the 
items they require to provide a particular service. Doctors, 
dentists, lawyers, real estate agents and small business people 
can write off the tools of their trades, whatever they may be. 
They are deductible.  If doctors hire additional staff, they can 
deduct it from their taxes.  If dentists buy new equipment, they 
can deduct it from their taxes. It is only mechanics who cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mechanics have to use their tools to keep their jobs.  Others 
can claim these expenses on their income tax returns, but 
mechanics cannot. Why would we deny mechanics the ability to 
obtain the proper tools, the tools they say they need to earn a 
living? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is consistent with the Reform Party's tax relief policy for 
individuals, families and businesses.  This bill would give tax 
relief to young people entering the job market or those making a 
career change for securing potential employment.  The Reform 
Party has always supported measures that lower the tax burden of 
Canadians.  This includes virtually any measure anytime that 
would force this arrogant lazy Liberal government to lower taxes 
instead of raising them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes have been raised by the government 37 times, to the tune 
of about a $42 billion increase in revenue since 1993.  That 
comes to $2,020 per taxpayer or $1,123 per Canadian.  It is a 
huge amount of money to those people who are working harder and 
harder to pay taxes to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government raised the CPP premium, the largest tax increase 
in Canadian history.

taxes. High taxes kill jobs.  The government balanced the budget 
on the backs of the taxpayers.

Now it is going to give subsidies to American businesses through 
Bill C-55 which was voted on.

something very important is happening.  Democracy is speaking. 
Grassroots reformers are speaking out.  They will show Canadians 
what grassroots democracy means.  No other party in the House 
practises democracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
begin by congratulating the hon. member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans on Bill 
C-502.  I would, however, respectfully submit that this bill does 
not provide all that is needed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member opposite when he proposed this bill was 
concerned about the working people. I would offer the suggestion 
that if he has the interests of the workers at heart, he should 
be looking for more broadly based policies that would accomplish 
the same objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of these that I am pleased to point out is in the finance 
committee report that was tabled yesterday or the day before.  It 
talks about the need for tax provisions such as employee stock 
option plans that enhance productivity by encouraging employees 
to share in the risks and profits of firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we moved in that direction we would provide workers, 
employees, with a greater stake in the work they do.  They would 
have a greater sense of participation and job satisfaction. At 
the same time the productivity of firms would be increased. This 
has been shown by studies in the United States and Canada. 
Productivity would be increased 20% to 32%.  We would have an 
environment where a source of retirement income would be made 
available to employees because they had built up an equity in the 
firm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I respect what the member has proposed in a sense, I think 
what we need is a broader strategy, more broadly based answers 
and solutions to these sorts of problems.  Deductions for tools 
for mechanics is not really ambitious enough.  While I do respect 
the member for proposing it, we need much more broadly based 
solutions to deal with the questions of productivity, incentives, 
employee participation and employee job satisfaction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak this evening on Bill C-502. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make it clear that the subject here is automobile 
mechanics and not the far broader matter of automobiles in 
general.  Otherwise I would have needed several hours to address 
the harmful effects Quebec has experienced since the 
inauguration of the auto pact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, here we are dealing with mechanics, the men and women who 
toil away day after day under the hoods of our cars, their hands 
covered in grease and grime, repairing what we consider a very 
precious possession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are possessions we are still making monthly bank loan 
payments on and we want to keep them running as long as 
possible. 
At the present time it is very difficult for mechanics to work 
under ideal conditions because of the high cost of the tools 
they need to do their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact mechanics usually have to provide many, if not all, of 
the tools required for their work.  In addition to being very 
expensive, some of these represent more than a one-time expense.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, it costs a mechanic several thousand dollars in order 
to be able to perform his job because there are exceptions as 
my colleague for Lotbinière has just mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mechanics in Quebec and Canada are in an unfair situation. 
It is high time that parliament remedy this. This is why the 
member for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans 
introduced this bill, which is intended to help these thousands 
of workers who make our life easier and who are at a huge 
disadvantage compared to other workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that this measure will permit fair taxation for our 
fellow citizens who deserve it amply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an injustice. And we know what corrective action must 
be taken. I ask my colleagues opposite to be tricked into 
inaction until a global solution is found to the problem of 
federal taxes in Canada. After all, if anyone deserves a review 
of current federal taxes in their favour, it is the Canadian and 
Quebec middle class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is therefore vital because it allows us to correct an

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have a few minutes to raise an issue 
that I presented to the House on April 22.  It concerns a very 
critical health care issue, that of organ donations and 
transplantation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I am sure we in the House all agree on is that we have 
a serious problem in terms of the number of organ donors in 
Canada.  There is no question that Canada has one of the worst 
rates of organ donors anywhere in the western world. That is a 
critical situation which all of us need to work at addressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health committee spent a good period of time hearing from 
witnesses, receiving evidence, getting advice and presenting a 
report about how to address this very serious matter. I regret 
though that on a couple of very important issues in my opinion 
the committee's recommendations were weak and less than helpful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise two specific points and ask the government to 
give serious consideration to these recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first has to do with respect to a national donor registry 
system. The government has refused to commit to a registry that 
would encourage Canadians to think seriously about demonstrating 
their commitment to donate an organ if they should be faced with 
death. I want the government to look at a model that has been 
tried in other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of British Columbia has a donor registry system 
that allows every individual to look at the situation.  They can 
make the serious decision that yes they want to donate, or no 
they do not want to donate, or that they are undecided.

<A HREF="#LINKT118"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that would have been a very important system to 
encourage Canadians to make commitments around organ donations. 
The government and the health committee of parliament have 
refused to make that specific recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I want to raise the issue of safety and the whole area 
of health protection when it comes to organ donations.  In our 
view, organs are no different than blood.  We know we should have 
learned from our sorry history on the question of blood and taken 
very seriously the recommendations of Justice Krever when he said 
that this government must pursue a proactive regulatory approach 
when it comes to blood.  I would suggest he would also say that 
applies to organs, to tissues and to everything that is important 
in terms of the health and well-being of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this particular issue the government continues to reject the 
recommendations of Justice Krever and is bent on pursuing what it 
would call a risk management approach, which is basically a hands 
off, buyer beware kind of mentality, and that is not at all 
appropriate to the kind of issues we are dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again, whether we talk about blood, medical 
devices, food, genetically modified products, children's toys, 
breast implants or drugs, this government continues to reject 
its responsibility around absolute safety for Canadians.  I urge 
the government to take seriously the need to protect all 
Canadians when it comes to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry to 
interrupt the hon. member, but her time has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to respond to the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me state that in November 1998 the Minister of Health asked 
the Standing Committee on Health to consult broadly, analyze and 
provide advice regarding the state of organ donations in Canada. 
He also asked that during the course of their deliberations 
committee members consider the appropriate federal government 
role in the development of the national safety, outcome and 
process standards to improve Canada's organ donation situation 
and save lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee consulted broadly with Canadians and has released 
a report suggesting a Canadian approach that will improve 
donation rates.  This initiative is viewed as a strong regulatory 
approach and may well be used by other countries in developing 
their own risk management framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organ and tissue donation is a critical and ongoing issue.  We 
have heard witness after witness before the Standing Committee on 
Health state that what is needed for transplantation is not 
another committee report with a list of recommendations, but 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada is committed to providing the leadership that is 
required and delivering to Canadians the action that is desired. 
Health Canada has demonstrated a leadership role in addressing 
the many issues surrounding transplantation and will continue to 
do so in its response to the standing committee's 
recommendations.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK274"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
on a question that comes from question period about 10 days ago. 
At that time I asked the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development about a situation with respect to the Nisga'a 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially, there are several questions that we think need to 
be addressed in advance of Nisga'a ratification legislation.  One 
of the very serious issues that needs to be addressed is the 
whole issue of overlap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the parliamentary secretary is aware, the Gitanyow and the 
Gitksan bands—the Gitanyow is actually a part of the 
Gitksan—are claiming that about 84% of the land that the Nisga'a 
will control after the ratification of the Nisga'a agreement is 
actually their traditional land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have written a book about it.  They advance a very strong 
case.  As to whether it is accurate or not is a matter of some 
debate, but the fact remains that they have advanced a very 
strong case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequent to that and subsequent to me asking the minister, 
they travelled to Ottawa to meet with various members of 
parliament from different parties to talk about their concerns. 
Essentially, they are saying that they do not want the 
ratification of this agreement to proceed until such time as this 
overlap issue is dealt with. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT119"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand for the life of me why the minister 
responded to my question by saying that negotiations are ongoing 
and they are confident that they are going to have an agreement 
when the Gitanyow and the Gitksan people are telling us that 
nothing could be further from the truth.  They are not even 
talking at this point in time.  There are no negotiations going 
on.  There is nobody listening to their side of the story.  They 
feel very much like the minister and the department are taking 
one side on this issue, and they feel that is very unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have intimated to us that if ratification proceeds in 
advance of this very serious question being addressed, then the 
result likely will be a great deal of uncertainty and chaos in 
the future because they will be proceeding with a court case, 
challenging the Nisga'a agreement and challenging the federal 
government in its breach of fiduciary obligation if in fact this 
agreement is ratified.  If they are successful in their court 
challenge, who knows what the landscape might look like down the 
road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again ask the parliamentary secretary to explain, not only to 
this side of the House, but also to the Gitksan and the Gitanyow 
people, who are watching this on their televisions at home, why 
it is that the federal government appears to be taking a side in 
this dispute and why it is prepared to proceed with ratification 
of this very precedent setting, groundbreaking treaty in British 
Columbia without first resolving these disputes.  I might add 
that it is not a matter of a small overlap because 84% of the 
land that the Nisga'a will end up controlling after the agreement 
is ratified is claimed by the Gitksan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the parliamentary secretary could answer those questions 
for the people in my riding who are very concerned about this 
issue and who would like to have the answer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK275"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
unlike the member, I wish that I had two hours today to respond 
to his question because I would love to take it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that the hon. member is absolutely wrong again on his 
premise, as he has been wrong so many times throughout the year 
in his questions relating to this important file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin with, I met last night for two hours over a working 
dinner with the Nisga'a, their lawyers and their negotiators. 
Again this afternoon, for an hour in my office, I met with the 
Gitanyow nation's representative, Bob Epstein, whom I have known 
for almost 10 years.  We have talked about a mediation process 
and I am pleased to announce to the House that the process is 
moving along quite well.  I believe that over the summer, while 
this legal argument is in abeyance, we will have an opportunity 
to debate that with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member a simple question and point out in 
my one minute and 11 seconds now remaining that it strikes me as 
passing strange that a member would take sides with some of his 
constituents against others.  This is unusual, indeed.  I do not 
think that anyone in the House has ever seen that kind of 
practice before.  There have been a number of practices used, I 
believe, by the member, including the issue today on Bill C-49, 
to break the deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a deal on Bill C-49 with all of the House leaders this 
morning which was broken, much to the dismay of the people 
involved, which involved of course the member standing here for 
two hours, saying many things that are so inaccurate I want to 
spend the rest of the summer going over them to come back here in 
the fall and talk to him about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many friends in British Columbia.  I have travelled there 
many times over the past 10 years.  I would like to say to the 
good people of British Columbia, because I think it is worth 
repeating in these final hours before we break for the summer, 
that the member voted for Bill C-49 almost in its current form at 
second reading in the committee and then came back to the House 
and changed his mind.  I hope we have a different member from 
Skeena when we return in October.

<P><A NAME="LINK277"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
May 3 I asked the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration two 
questions about Canada's lax immigration policies.  At that time 
congressional meetings were being held in Washington to study the 
security of the American and Canadian border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister if she was proud of the fact that under her 
tenure Canada had become known as a launching pad for terrorism 
and drug trafficking.  I also asked her when she was going to 
wake up, stop talking and implement concrete measures to fix the 
broken system, which has become known as an easy mark to drug 
traffickers and terrorists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me expand on these thoughts.  The witnesses that appeared 
before the committee on the judiciary subcommittee on immigration 
in Washington said many things which this Liberal government and 
the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, as well as the 
parliamentary secretary, should take note of. 
Dale Brandland, sheriff for Whatcom County in Bellingham, 
Washington, stated before the committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our friends to the north, the Canadians, are good neighbours but 
I must tell you that I am troubled by their liberal immigration 
policies.  Anyone that has a passport can enter Canada and there 
is very little to stop them from entering the United States once 
they get there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on further to cite an example: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Abu Mezer is a prime example.  Local Border Control personnel 
in Whatcom County had apprehended Mr. Abu Mezer on three separate 
occasions, after attempting to enter the country illegally.  He 
was finally held, pending formal deportation...Approximately 7 
months later he was shot by the New York City Police Department 
just prior to planting a bomb that would have blown up the subway 
system. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was an individual who was in Canada three times under this 
lax immigration policy, rather than being deported under some 
criminal charges that he was facing in Canada after serving his 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eugene Davis, deputy chief of the U.S. border patrol in Blaine, 
Washington, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past several years Canada has adopted a non-visa 
requirement policy with many countries that the United States 
continues to require visas from.  This has resulted in many 
smugglers being able to easily bring third country nationals into 
Canada and then smuggle them across the border into the U.S. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government has stated that virtually every known 
terrorist group in the world has offices in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Justice, Michael 
Bromwich, stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The border in western Washington is experiencing a marked 
increase in the smuggling of BC Bud, an especially potent strain 
of marijuana. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The INS and other intelligence reports indicate that terrorist 
groups locate in Canada in part because of Canada's liberal visa 
and asylum (refugee) laws— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite clear that the immigration system is broken.  I hope 
we get some answers from the parliamentary secretary rather than 
empty rhetoric talking about what other parties stand for when it 
is his party that has not taken action to correct these wrongs 
and to fix the broken system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw an example of that in committee today when members of the 
Liberal government, rather than taking concrete action to remedy 
a situation on the head tax for refugees, voted against it and 
defeated it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They could have taken action to fix a broken part of the system, 
to remedy an injustice.  They could have taken time to fix the 
system and deal with these individuals who are abusing it.  Their 
own department officials, and I quote from an access to 
information document, stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The blatant misuse of the refugee process (in same series, a 
Honduran refugee claimant was openly honest about the fact that 
he had no understanding of what a “refugee” actually was, that 
he was just doing what he had been counselled to say upon arrival 
in Canada, and the reason that he was in Canada was to earn some 
money for his family back in Honduras).  This portrayal was 
extremely damaging to the integrity of the program and 
department. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly it was.  This is the kind of thing that is happening. 
This is the immigration CICs own internal documents stating that 
there are problems with the system.  Yet the minister fails to 
take action to address these serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like some answers from the parliamentary secretary to 
these questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK278"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me start 
by telling the member opposite that there is no head tax in the 
country.  For him to stand in his place and try to trivialize a 
tragic time in the country's history is despicable.  I think the 
member should be ashamed of himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get back to the other issues he was speaking about.  I 
will enlighten him by pointing out that both governments are 
working to protect the borders because movement occurs in both 
directions.  This is not a one way street.  I will also take this 
opportunity to mention a handful of collaborative initiatives 
between Canada and the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, both governments have taken concrete steps to 
systematically and regularly share information on known or 
suspected terrorists to ensure their early detection.  Second, a 
new information sharing tool to support daily immigration 
enforcement efforts is near completion.  Third, exchanges of 
information on visa issuance resulting in illegal immigration are 
now formalized and systematic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last but not least, let me remind the member opposite in the 
Reform Party that it is this government which announced the 
shared border accord with the United States in 1995.  It is this 
government that took that accord one step further and solidified 
its commitment on the immigration front by establishing several 
joint working groups in order to build a comprehensive 
Canada-U.S. strategy for the future.  This initiative is called 
Border Vision.  The concrete examples I described earlier are a 
direct product of this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suffice it to say, we have more vision that my Reform colleague 
who obviously is not aware of the testimony of all witnesses who 
appeared before the U.S. judiciary committee's immigration and 
claims subcommittee.  If the member were, he would know that the 
vast majority of witnesses spoke of the close co-operation 
between the U.S. and Canada to combat the trafficking of drugs 
and illegal immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by saying that members of the Reform Party talk 
about immigration and refugee policies.  They cannot get past 
their noses.  They keep talking about criminality, criminality, 
criminality.  The member is wrong, wrong, wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, two 
years ago the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development recommended the elimination of subsidies to fossil 
fuel industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two days ago I asked the Minister of Finance if he agreed that 
these subsidies were counterproductive in light of Canada's 
international commitment to reduce greenhouse gases and should 
therefore be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately we have federal tax incentives which encourage 
increased production of greenhouse gases and make it much more 
difficult for us to cut carbon dioxide emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions are not new.  In 
the 1993 election we committed to cut by 20%.  Yet the Department 
of Finance is blissfully continuing with policies which compound 
rather than resolve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, in 1996 the government introduced a special tax 
concession for the oil sands industry.  Oil sands extraction 
produces several times the amount of greenhouse gas produced from 
conventional oil extraction.  This tax concession makes the task 
of reducing emissions much more difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it may cost Canadians up to $600 million in forgone 
revenue.  We found that out in 1997 from estimates provided by 
the Department of Finance.  How then can we achieve the Kyoto 
goals with these perverse tax incentives in place, approved by 
the Department of Finance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a report commissioned by the highly respected Earth Council 
entitled “Subsidizing the Unsustainable Development: Undermining 
the Earth with Public Funds” we find a statement which applies 
to Canada as well as to other OECD countries: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judging by their public pronouncements, governments around the 
world realize they should be following policies that encourage a 
transition to greater energy efficiency and lower energy use. Yet 
many official policies instead encourage energy profligacy and 
waste.  Worse still, they usually favour the dirtier energy 
sources. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report also includes a table showing subsidies provided by 
OECD countries.  The table shows Canada contributing some $6 
billion in budgetary subsidies in the form of tax expenditures. 
The authors go on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more environmentally damaging a fuel, the bigger the subsidy. 
The subsidy ranking is a pollution rogues' gallery—coal far in 
the forefront, followed by oil, then nuclear power and finally 
natural gas.  Strikingly small is the proportion of total funding 
devoted to sources of renewable energy, the most environmentally 
friendly sources. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kyoto commitment is urgent and serious.  We must remove 
counterproductive tax concessions and promote the production of a 
renewable energy and the shift to natural gas, of which we have 
plenty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons I ask the parliamentary secretary when the 
government will remove the tax subsidies to oil sands 
developments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also fair to say that in the past many direct government 
subsidies have been eliminated.  In 1995 the government ended the 
direct financial support for energy megaprojects.  At the same 
time the Government of Canada increased spending on energy 
efficiency and alternative energy programs despite the fiscal 
pressures with which it was faced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also true that spending on R and D and market development 
programs in renewable energy and energy efficiency at NRCan now 
exceeds spending on the fossil fuel industry.  In addition, the 
1998 budget provided $150 million over three years to begin to 
address the climate change challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Davenport made reference to renewables 
versus non-renewables.  It was the 1998 budget in which the 
government moved to narrow the gap between renewables and 
non-renewables by extending the benefits and the $150 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a process in place today where we need to balance the 
creation of a strong economy and jobs with protecting the 
environment.  There is certainly a consultative process in place 
now which ensures that all Canadians, particularly the member for 
Davenport, will have the opportunity to take part in the 
development of that strategy.  We certainly look forward to the 
very valuable input that he will provide in that strategy.

members remaining in the Chamber would join with me in wishing 
one of our assistant head pages good luck in her future 
endeavours.  This will be her last day assisting us in the 
Chamber.  She is going on to law school and we wish her well. 
Isabelle Roy, thank you.
