<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ORDERINCOUNCILAPPOINTMENTS">ORDER IN COUNCIL APPOINTMENTS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to table, in both official languages, a 
number of order in council appointments which were made by 
the government.
<P>
	Pursuant to the provisions of Standing Order 110(1), these are 
deemed referred to the appropriate standing committees, a list 
of which is attached.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOUTHAFRICA">SOUTH AFRICA</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, six months after historic 
elections in South Africa, I am taking this moment to speak 
about the government's interim and new program which Canada 
is beginning to implement in South Africa.
<P>
	As members know, Canada has a long and honourable 
tradition of support to the people of South Africa. What a joy it 
was for those of us Canadians who were privileged to participate 
in the election process of April and May.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, South Africa needs constant support if it is to 
successfully emerge as a democratic society, prosper 
economically, and develop the potential of its population as a 
whole.
<P>
	The transition from apartheid and conflicts to reconciliation 
and rebuilding will bring new challenges.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am presenting to the House today an outline of Canada's new 
three-year bilateral program with an allocation of up to $20 
million for the next fiscal year.
<P>
	In the past resources from the Canadian International 
Development Agency as well as from Canadian NGOs, 
churches, academia, businesses, professional groups and unions 
have been critical in facilitating the heroic strides of the South 
African people toward a more democratic society.
<P>
	For a number of years we have worked with South African 
groups disadvantaged by apartheid to lay the basis for their 
involvement in their country's affairs.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	CIDA has extended its special South Africa fund. This fund 
will next year make available $2.5 million to Canadian 
organizations which have already established strong linkages 
with partners in South Africa.
<P>
	With the end of apartheid and the inauguration of Nelson 
Mandela as president, the Canadian government has acted 
promptly to re-establish bilateral relations in a number of areas. 
We have extended the general preferential tariff to South Africa. 
A Canadian trade office was opened in Johannesburg in 
February 1994 during a visit by the Minister for International 
Trade.
<P>
	Subsequently Canadian exports to South Africa for the first 
six months of the year were about 75 per cent higher than they 
were for the same period last year. A significant portion of these 
exports is in the form of manufactured and high technology 
Canadian products.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7602"> 7602 </A></B>
<P>
	Throughout the transition period there has been a strong level 
of interest in Canadian models of government and experiences. 
This interest continues.
<P>
	In July of this year the South African minister of 
constitutional development led a high level delegation of 
ministers, MPs and academics to study our system. This week 
another group of South African public servants is visiting 
Canada to acquaint themselves with how we develop our foreign 
policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Moreover, South Africa asked for and was given advice on 
various issues, especially on the refugee status claims 
processing system it is setting up. Canada offered to help South 
Africa become an active member of several multilateral 
organizations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For our efforts and our expertise Canada has been singled out. 
On September 1 South Africa's minister of arts, culture, science 
and technology, Dr. B.S. Ngubane, speaking in his country's 
Parliament acknowledged the contribution through Canada's 
International Development Research Centre to the creation of a 
science and technology initiative.
<P>
	The government has made a commitment to open the process 
of foreign policy making to all Canadians. In May of this year 
we held a major consultation in Ottawa and invited 
representatives of academia, the business community, church 
groups, unions and developmental non-government 
organizations to discuss priorities for the new South Africa. 
Their input has been vital in establishing the four key priorities 
for the next three years in South Africa.
<P>
	The first priority is governance. We will continue with our 
$10 million public service policy project funded by CIDA and 
managed by the International Development Research Centre. In 
addition we will begin more intensive training of senior civil 
servants and government officials from among groups 
previously excluded from top government positions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The second priority is human resource training to improve the 
education sector and correct the past injustices of apartheid. As 
we all know, it is critical to raise the general skill level of the 
population. To work efficiently, a society needs a more open and 
tolerant political culture.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Third, we will have strengthened civil society. With the 
transition to a new government many of the old organizations 
which were organized around resistance now need to transform 
themselves into bodies which can represent their constituents in 
a more peaceful but effective manner. We will support them in 
making this transition.
<P>
The fourth priority will emphasize economic growth in South 
Africa with a particular focus on the participation of black 
business people in various sectors of the economy as well as the 
consolidation of Canadian linkages.
<P>
	We believe that linking our four priorities with the help of all 
our Canadian partners is the only way Canada can ensure 
coherent, broad based development which will promote 
enduring peace and security in South Africa. We need to protect 
and nourish the South African beacon of hope on the African 
continent for the sake of all on that continent.
<P>
	I thank all Canadians for their collaboration in this process.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of all the Bloc members, I am pleased to speak on the 
issue of South Africa. The Secretary of State is giving us this 
opportunity, this morning, with her outline of the new interim 
program Canada is beginning to implement in that country. We 
must welcome this new Canadian commitment very favourably. 
Indeed, South Africa needs the constant support of the 
international community to be able to pursue successfully its 
democratization process.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	As I mentioned in this House on April 26, while for the first 
time, Blacks in all the villages, towns and cities of South Africa 
were starting to vote in order to elect representatives, as 
parliamentarians, we cannot remain indifferent to the testimony 
of an elderly citizen who told us: ``Now that I have voted for the 
first time in my life, I can die''.
<P>
	As indicated by the Secretary of State, governance, human 
resources training, strengthening the civil society, and 
economic growth in South Africa seem to be well-targeted 
priorities. We are confident that they will make it possible to 
sustain coherent development, which will bolster lasting peace 
and social justice.
<P>
	This three-year $20 million program is very timely. We 
believe that Canada, in addition to its foreign aid action and its 
remarkable involvement in UN peacekeeping, must make the 
promotion of human rights and democracy one of the key areas, 
if not the cornerstone of its foreign policy.
<P>
	Canada's recent turnaround on this fundamental issue does 
not augur well. If the Secretary of State is as concerned about 
promoting democracy as she would have us believe this 
morning, can she tell us what she really thinks of her 
government's drastic change of direction on this issue, a change 
which is far from identifying democracy and human rights as 
one of the main elements shaping Canada's foreign policy?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7603"> 7603 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to take the opportunity given to us this morning to call 
upon the Secretary of State to intervene. Her government's lack 
of leadership on the issue of human rights is an outright shame. I 
urge her to ask her Prime Minister not to renege on Canada's 
international commitments such as those made at the 1989 
Dakar Francophone Summit, where the 42 French-speaking 
countries passed a Canadian resolution to give basic objective 
status to the protection of human rights in the international 
community.
<P>
	Indeed, respect of individual rights was confirmed as a 
determining factor in the granting of international assistance at 
the 1991 Commonwealth Summit in Zimbabwe. So, on behalf of 
the thousands of Chinese people who have been left to rot in 
prison unjustly, I call upon her, I urge her to ask her Prime 
Minister to raise publicly the issue of human rights violation 
during his visit to China. It is her duty to do so, unless she too is 
afraid that Canada will be laughed at.
<P>
	But the example of South Africa speaks for itself. This shift 
the government is making will unfortunately cause the issue of 
human rights to be discussed behind the scenes, to humour 
certain nations, particularly potential commercial channels for 
Canada. We suggest that Canadian action should be consistent. 
Canada should have the courage of its convictions if it hopes to 
be respected and to maintain its credibility around the world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. Secretary of State for African and 
Central American Affairs for recognizing the need of South 
Africa and continuing the longstanding relationship that our 
countries have had.
<P>
	Having spent time working and travelling in the country, I am 
always struck by the enormous amount of potential that the 
country has both in terms of human and material resources. It 
can be the powerhouse that drives the whole southern half of a 
continent, a continent tragically that is littered with the 
carcasses of countries in various states of economic and 
political ruin.
<P>
	The end of apartheid done so admirably by the country and 
with such extraordinary restraint is a resolution to only one-half 
of their problem. The other half, perhaps the more difficult one, 
still faces them. This is where our country can have an 
extraordinary effect.
<P>
	We must do this given the constraints of the economic woes 
that we have within our own country.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	The trick of course will be for the South African government 
to guide its country through the mine field of economic and 
societal problems that face it toward a productive, vibrant 
economy that is safe and peaceful, a society where everybody 
has equal rights under the law, a society where everybody has 
the opportunity to achieve their greatest potential.
<P>
We must do this to ensure that South Africa does not wind up on 
the tragic heap of African countries that have fallen to such a 
state of disrepair and I am optimistic that South Africa will not 
be one of them.
<P>
	I have some questions for the hon. member. I see no amount as 
to the total amount of the aid package which will be given. This 
must be known. I would like to know exactly what projects are 
going to be funded and on behalf of the taxpayer request that 
accountability be set into the system.
<P>
	I would also like to know exactly where these dollars are 
going in order to ensure that they are going to go to the people 
intended. I would encourage the member to involve a review 
process of the project so that we can assess and determine 
whether the moneys that we are spending are going to help the 
people who truly need them.
<P>
	However, if I can synthesize the major problem that affects 
South Africa in its near natal stage, in its new South Africa, it 
will be the income disparity that exists between whites and 
blacks. This disparity and the extraordinary high expectations 
that have come post-election and how the government deals 
with this will be an incredibly important determining factor in 
the success or failure of the new South Africa.
<P>
	Under the yoke of apartheid and through the sanctions, there 
have been bred at least two generations of people without 
money, without jobs and without hope which in turn has bred an 
extraordinarily high level of violence and many areas of siege 
mentality.
<P>
	These expectations are asking for immediate gratification, 
expectations that unfortunately cannot be met in the short term. 
The cure for this lies in real sustainable jobs for the future which 
will provide the people with the funds to produce the necessities 
for life, education, good health and food and provide the tax 
structure and tax base that the government can utilize to provide 
for the infrastructure required.
<P>
	It will also provide for a vibrant middle class, especially 
among the poor black populace. This is exceptionally important 
and cannot be underestimated. It will help to make the transition 
from the era of apartheid to a new South Africa one that is 
coherent and one that will be moving in the future for safety and 
prosperity for all.
<P>
	I would however encourage our government and the 
Government of South Africa to listen to the following. Income 
distribution does not involve soaking the rich. It will be 
ineffective and counterproductive and will only drive out the 
skilled business sector and be counterproductive to those people 
who are meant to help.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7604"> 7604 </A></B>
<P>
	It is only by retaining these skills and the goodwill of the 
business sector that help will be provided for the larger, broader 
poor and essentially the black population and enable them to 
improve their living standard.
<P>
	It is important also for South Africa to encourage foreign 
investment and foreign investment from lending institutions. 
We must avoid quick social fixes because they do not work.
<P>
	Social reform is imperative with education and primary 
health care and widely accessible birth control and public 
housing being at the top of the list. This cannot come at the 
expense of a free market economy but must occur in tandem.
<P>
	In 1993 the government developed a $12 billion deficit. It 
must learn from our mistakes and not continue to spend in a 
deficit fashion. What it does is this. We know from our own 
sorry experience that it only seeks to compromise the very social 
programs and services that we hope to provide as governments.
<P>
	It must also avoid greater government intervention. It is as we 
know a country that has an extraordinary amount of government 
intervention in its private sector. We must help it as a country to 
move away from that. We must therefore encourage its people to 
move toward privatization. We must also encourage the drop in 
tariff barriers and decrease the tariffs according to GATT.
<P>
	Canada can indeed help this and I applaud the government in 
extension of the general preferential tariff. I would encourage it 
to remove as soon as possible the double taxation system that 
exists for companies that wish to invest in South Africa. This 
will go a long way toward helping our companies as well as their 
country toward a more productive, economic discourse between 
our two countries.
<P>
	South Africa in essence needs trade, not aid, and the 
liberalization of trade between our two countries is of greatest 
importance.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that what has happened in that 
country has been truly extraordinary, the move by themselves 
away from apartheid with extraordinary divisions among the 
people and doing it in a peaceful fashion to move toward an era 
of hope and prosperity for all. I hope our country will enable 
them to do this within the constraints of our country's economic 
woes. I hope the hon. member will provide the information I 
asked for on the aid package that has been given.

	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-50, an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act, be read 
the third time and passed.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, grain production in Canada has never 
been a static industry. From the time wheat was first introduced 
to Western Canada in 1812 by the Selkirk Settlers in Manitoba's 
Red River Valley, the crop has been in a state of change. It has 
been adapted and improved to meet the needs of producers and 
consumers. Producers are always looking for improvements in 
qualities such as plant vigour, early maturity, resistance to 
shatter and resistance to rust. Consumers, in turn, look for the 
qualities they need to use the product in a variety of ways.
<P>
	Here in Canada, we have been successful in breeding new 
crop varieties to meet these changing needs. Since the early 
1930s, over 600 new crop varieties have been introduced. 
Canada has set international standards for quality with the wheat 
and barley we have developed. Still, as the needs of consumers 
and producers have become more finely focused, more 
sophisticated plant-breeding techniques have become 
necessary. While our research scientists may find varieties 
which fill our current needs, we cannot afford to rest on our past 
successes. Our grain crops must be able to adapt to the 
requirements of an ever-changing world.
<P>
For producers, it is important that the crops grow efficiently 
with excellent field performance.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	From an environmental standpoint, this means high-yielding 
crops so we can free land resources for other uses. It also means 
crops which require reduced amounts of pesticides, fertilizers 
and other chemicals to reach their maximum potential.
<P>
	The results of continued research allow prairie farmers to 
effectively produce the grain crops our customers demand. The 
need for this research comes from our industry and from 
producers. Grain growers across the prairies have told the 
minister that they want to play an important role in research 
since the results of research directly affect their operations and 
their livelihood.
<P>
	This is why the Minister of Agriculture recommends 
amending the Canadian Wheat Board Act to allow voluntary 
levies to be deducted for the express purpose of supporting plant 
breeding research. An amendment is necessary since such 
deductions are not possible under the existing Canadian Wheat 
Board Act.
<P>
	This check-off program has been developed in close 
consultation with the 12 prairie farm organizations that make up 
the Western Grains Research Foundation. These supporters 
include the United Grain Growers, Western Canadian Wheat 
Growers Association, Manitoba Pool Elevators, Saskatchewan 
Wheat Pool, Alberta Wheat Pool, Prairie Canola Growers 
Council, Flax Growers Western Canada, Keystone Agricultural 
Producers, Western Barley Growers Association, Oat Producers 
Association of Alberta, Canadian Seed Growers Association and 
Unifarm. Scientists from universities and from the department 
have also participated in planning this program.
<P>
	With the passage of Bill C-50, research funds would be 
generated through voluntary levies on wheat and barley sales.
<P>
	The proposed check-off program would apply a voluntary 
levy of 20 cents a tonne on wheat and 40 cents a tonne on barley. 
It is anticipated that this would generate about $4.7 million 
annually in funds to be applied directly to wheat and barley plant 
breeding research. This would be in addition to the over $21.5 
million on wheat research in the 1993-94 crop year and a further 
$8 million on barley research which this government is already 
committed to.
<P>
	Levies would be applied to producers' final payment cheques 
from the Canadian Wheat Board and placed in a special account. 
Funds from this account would be transferred to the Western 
Grains Research Foundation (WGRF), which will administer the 
research funding program. It is important to note that in 
maintaining our fiscal responsibility to all Canadians, this new 
program will create no new agency, institution or bureaucracy. 
This means that more producer dollars will go to research.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7607"> 7607 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	The administrative structure already in place at the Canadian 
Wheat Board would be used to collect the levy and a proven 
producer-driven research funding agency would distribute the 
funds. Total incremental administrative costs associated with 
this program are estimated to be in the range of 2 per cent of total 
levies collected.
<P>
	By using structures already in place, we would be able to 
maximize producers' investments in research. The Foundation 
will report to all CWB permit book-holders so that they can see 
whether it is using their funds wisely. In a sense, the ultimate 
accountability of this program is that it is voluntary.
<P>
	If a CWB permit book-holder does not agree with what the 
Western Grains Research Foundation is doing, he can withdraw 
from the program. The Foundation needs to demonstrate to 
producers that it is using their funds wisely, in order to maintain 
their support. At this point, I should add that the WGRF, a 
federally chartered public organization, has a proven track 
record in supporting effective pure research.
<P>
	The importance of the investments made by our grain 
producers in research cannot be overestimated. This research 
has the potential to increase yields by 15 per cent, which could 
translate into additional gross earnings of $400 million a year 
for western grain farmers. This $400 million is not hyperbole, 
especially when you consider that a one-bushel-per-acre 
increase in wheat yields in Western Canada at today's prices 
would increase revenues by $100 million.
<P>
	This program will help Canada remain competitive in the 
international market and help us maintain our position with 
other exporters. Just as important, research like this will help 
further the development of value-added products in the grains 
sectors. I mentioned earlier the increased income of potential 
international customers. It is these value-added products which 
will give us a distinct advantage when we are dealing with these 
customers, and it is research which will give Canada an 
advantage in developing new products.
<P>
	This initiative is an excellent example of industry taking the 
lead in research funding. It also illustrates this government's 
willingness to address needs Canadians themselves have 
identified and to form strong partnerships for the good of all 
Canadians. With producers and government working together, 
all Canadians will share in the benefits of this program. I 
therefore recommend that the House approve Bill C-50, 
amending the Canadian Wheat Board Act to allow voluntary 
levies to be deducted in support of this important research 
program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at 
the outset I would like to thank and congratulate my colleague 
from Beauséjour, the Secretary of State for Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans, for his  great history lesson 
on the development of Western Canada.
<P>
	He traced its evolution from 1812 through the dark years of 
the economic crisis in the 1930s to the subsequent development 
of 600 new wheat varieties.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	We are participating in this afternoon's third reading of Bill 
C-50 in the light of the discussions held and the amendments 
debated a little earlier this week. I doubt we will learn anything 
new today. We covered all the bases and I am still convinced that 
this bill could be improved.
<P>
	This bill amending the Canadian Wheat Board Act did not in 
the end give rise to a great debate. There was a good exchange of 
ideas but nothing revolutionary, although it is unusual to see the 
producers themselves propose that deductions be made from 
their earnings in order to finance wheat and barley research. 
This initiative of Western farmers deserves to be encouraged 
and commended.
<P>
	I remember that former Liberal Minister of Agriculture 
Eugene Whelan-who left his mark, as all parliamentarians will 
agree-once told us that every dollar invested in agricultural 
research and development brings in $7. This is an investment 
that even you would not hesitate to make, if you could lend your 
money to a bank in return for a 700 per cent profit.
<P>
	At the very beginning of the process involving this bill, we 
had an informal meeting with senior officials from Agriculture 
Canada. They explained to us that this bill was based on an 
initiative of Western grain producers. Of course, my colleague 
from Beauséjour insisted several times that the amendment to 
the Canadian Wheat Board Act was a voluntary initiative of 
these farmers who, by filling out a form specifically designed 
for this purpose, could opt out of contributing to the private 
research fund.
<P>
	Officials from the Department of Agriculture estimate the 
participation rate at 90 per cent. I was, I admit, very surprised to 
hear that 90 per cent of them would agree to pay 40 cents a ton on 
barley and 20 cents a ton on wheat to set up a private research 
fund.
<P>
	However, I would advise my colleague from Beauséjour, the 
Secretary of State, as well as the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food to be very vigilant because, although 90 per cent is a 
lot, 10 per cent of farmers will benefit from research and 
development but without paying for it. If participating farmers 
are pushed around, they will opt out. And if the participation 
rate drops to somewhere around 50 per cent, it will no longer 
make any sense for these farmers to contribute voluntarily.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7608"> 7608 </A></B>
<P>
	At first glance, it would seem very inappropriate for the Bloc 
Quebecois to go against the will of producers, who wish to take 
control of their future. What they want is simple. They are 
prepared to take a part of their profits and invest it in wheat and 
barley breeding research.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	This bill is necessary because it will allow the Canadian 
Wheat Board to make deductions from wheat and barley 
producers' final payment cheques for the explicit purpose of 
plant breeding research. The Minister of Agriculture tabled Bill 
C-50, an Act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act, because 
the Board does not currently have the right to make such 
deductions.
<P>
	The check-off will be made on the payment at the time of 
delivery. The rate is currently set at 40 cents for one ton of 
barley and at 20 cents for one ton of wheat. These rates were 
arrived at by estimating research costs, in millions of dollars, 
and dividing the total by the number of tons bought. I was 
surprised to see that, although the bill only refers to wheat, the 
amendments will affect wheat and also automatically barley, 
because of the regulations. It seems that two distinct funds will 
be set up, one for wheat and one for barley.
<P>
	The rates which I just mentioned will be fixed by the 
Governor in Council; they will not be specified in the act. That 
provision will allow certain classes of grain or certain provinces 
to be excluded. For example, Alberta will not participate in the 
check-off program for barley, since the Alberta Barley 
Commission already makes such deductions.
<P>
	If necessary, the amount of the deduction will simply be 
changed by order in council. Again, I tell the minister and his 
parliamentary secretary that if they are too greedy and if they 
lower the government's contribution in order to force greater 
direct funding from agricultural producers, they might see a 
number of these farmers withdraw from the program.
<P>
	Since the issue was raised when the member for Mackenzie 
tabled his amendment, I will state my position again. If the 
CWB starts competing with a province and jeopardizes its 
efforts, it would be preferable for that province to be able to opt 
out of this voluntary contribution program.
<P>
	Based on the 90 per cent participation rate anticipated by the 
minister, the Board expects to collect $4.7 million, that is $3.8 
million for wheat and $900,000 for barley. That money will be 
used to finance research on four basic aspects: wheat and barley 
breeding, as well as ways to improve acre yield. I may point out 
that finding a way to increase the yield per acre of wheat or 
barley by only one bushel would mean an additional $100 
million earned.
<P>
	As anyone in business will tell you, your profit is not on the 
first hot dog but on the last one you sell that day. Farmers know 
perfectly well that when they start taking the crop off a field, the 
first bushel does not pay but the last bushel is pure profit. The 
same applies to milk. The  last cow you milked pays for that 
meal at a restaurant or a show on the weekend.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	The third component would be to enhance the resistance of 
varieties to disease and parasites and the fourth, to find new 
varieties that are better able to meet new market demands.
<P>
	There is still one question: Why is Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Canada's research budget unable to meet the needs of grain 
producers? Why? The government tells us that the budget for 
research is $18.7 million. In that case, why should producers pay 
for parallel research? Please do not misunderstand me. I think it 
is an excellent idea to encourage producers to take the initiative 
and go ahead with solutions which they know will be to their 
advantage.
<P>
	However, the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
should not use the private sector as a way to get out of its 
commitments or, even worse, let it run the show.
<P>
	A few weeks ago, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
tabled a bill that clarified his department's role, including its 
involvement in research and development. Despite this 
restructuring, Western grain producers will conclude that they 
have to pay twice to get the kind of research they need. We 
moved an amendment in order to solve that problem, and to 
avoid duplication between research made in centres which will 
get contracts and research being done by the Department of 
Agriculture.
<P>
	Under this bill, the Canadian Wheat Board would distribute 
money received through deductions to research centres breeding 
new strains of wheat and improving existing ones.
<P>
	Under our amendment, the agency would have had to make 
enquiries and determine that the information being sought by 
the research would not become available as a result of other 
similar research. We are just trying to avoid paying twice for the 
same research.
<P>
	As taxpayers, producers already pour $18.7 million into 
research and development projects on wheat and barley. 
However, they will have to invest an additional $4.7 million to 
direct the research according to their own priorities.
<P>
	The Department of Agriculture maintains that, with the 
research and development budget being eroded, it is important 
that the private sector takes over. Unfortunately, I am always 
afraid that, over the years, we will see the emergence of a certain 
mindset, and that the federal contribution to research and 
development activities will diminish while that of the producers 
will increase. This a real threat, and only time will tell if the 
Bloc Quebecois was right to be so concerned.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7609"> 7609 </A></B>
<P>
	Research and development are key elements to our staying 
competitive on foreign markets, and it is no secret that in order 
to increase our exports, we will need to produce more at a lower 
cost.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	It is important to encourage such initiatives. The private 
sector, that is the producers as well as the industrial 
entrepreneurs, must play a more active role if research and 
development activities are to increase. However, it is crucial 
that the government fulfil its mandate, by continuing to finance 
research and development on a fair basis. In this case, we are 
talking about subsidizing a private research organization.
<P>
	This research agency is the Western Grains Research 
Foundation and it has already studied the issue. In the grain 
industry, there are some benefits to private funding for research 
projects which I would like to list. It meets specific needs 
identified by those who finance the research activities.
<P>
	However, we must be careful so that the bigger producers do 
not get to control the research at the expense of smaller 
producers. Since voluntary contribution is based on the number 
of tons of wheat sold, the main producers will, of course, invest 
more. With the amendment we proposed, the Canadian Wheat 
Board would have had to check the research being done before 
awarding the contracts.
<P>
	Then, if the research being conducted did not sufficiently 
meet the needs of small producers, the Canadian Wheat Board 
would have been able to do something about it, since it would 
have known what research it wanted to further. Also, the 
information remains confidential.
<P>
	But whatever we say about it, the fact is that two elements can 
influence the choice made by grain producers. First, the budget 
allocated by the department for this purpose is not enough. Even 
though the department advocates new market opportunities, it 
does not provide the tools needed to access new markets. 
Second, the research and development projects on wheat and 
barley that the department is financing do not reflect the 
priorities of the industry. This goes to show that the needs of the 
industry are somewhat misunderstood.
<P>
	Before I conclude, I want to say a few words about the 
amendments that were before the House yesterday afternoon. 
You see, a political party cannot pretend to know everything. 
Acting in a very fair manner, the Bloc Quebecois came up with 
two amendments to Bill C-50 in order to help farmers. My 
colleague for Vegreville also presented, on behalf of the Reform 
Party, two amendments that make a lot of sense and are very fair, 
and my colleague for Mackenzie also put forward an amendment 
to Bill C-50.
<P>
	This morning, I watched very closely the results of the vote 
and, to my surprise, the government party, led by the minister, 
defeated all five amendments thanks to its majority. I admit that 
the opposition may sometimes  move conflicting amendments 
that do not agree but, in this case at least, it seems to me that we 
found a very positive way to lend a hand to the government 
party, not to criticize but to improve its bill. It refused. It said 
no.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	For example, we asked the minister to submit the report of the 
Canadian Wheat Board to us, the elected representatives, within 
15 days following the day he receives it. This was a suggestion 
from my colleague for Vegreville. It seems to me that elected 
representatives like the hon. member for Frontenac, the hon. 
member for Vaudreuil and the hon. member for Vegreville 
should not have to wait six months before seeing this report. A 
fifteen days delay would have been reasonable. No. The 
government does not want restrictions or limits. Could it be that 
it has something to hide? Why did it refuse? The fact is it 
refused.
<P>
	I will conclude by stressing how important it is to avoid 
duplication and overlap of research projects conducted by the 
department and by the private sector even if it is stated that 
research plans will be discussed between concerned 
stakeholders to avoid such a thing. It would seem that the 
projects funded will be complementary but, unfortunately, there 
is nothing to that effect in the law.
<P>
	Again, I urge the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food to 
better protect the interests of the farmers across the country and 
especially in Quebec. You see, Bill C-50 will not be costly for 
the public purse. Bill C-49 neither, but it will not do a lot of 
good. All it did was to change the name of the department from 
the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food.
<P>
	I dream of the day when the Department of Agriculture will 
take concrete steps to make our farmers whose living depends on 
supply-managed products feel secure. Quebec farmers are a bit 
worried about the implementation of the GATT agreements on 
January 1, 1995, less than two months from now.
<P>
	I was reading this morning a press release from the 
Department of Agriculture announcing the elimination of the 
surtax on beef imports from New Zealand and Australia. This 25 
per cent surtax was abolished on October 7. In May, the minister 
had increased import quotas to 85,000 tons of beef carcasses 
from New Zealand and Australia.
<P>
	And I was interested this fall in the sale of our young steers. I 
kept track of what was going on in Quebec, particularly in 
Sawyerville, Victoriaville, Princeville, Sainte-Marie de Beauce 
and Saint-Hyacinthe, and our producers were proud because, for 
once, we could sell our cull cows, that is our dairy cows that are 
no longer productive. These cull cows are sold for beef. The 
price was 60 to 62 cents a pound and up to 65 cents in some 
cases. Immediately after the minister announced the elimination 
of the 25 per cent surtax, the price dropped.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7610"> 7610 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	In the case of slaughter calves, they sold for $1.25, $1.30 and 
up to $1.35 at the beginning of September, but as soon as meat 
processors were informed of the elimination of the 25 per cent 
surtax, the price started to drop to a point where, today, Quebec 
producers sell their steers for about the same price as in 1980. 
Fourteen years later, the price per pound is the same while 
production costs continue to increase.
<P>
	I was visiting a farm last week and the producer showed me a 
small plastic container that is used to milk cows. He told me 
that, on average, he breaks about two of these a year and that he 
has to be very careful. That small plastic container looks like a 
plain drinking glass. He showed it to me and asked: ``How much 
do you think this plastic container costs, Jean-Guy?'' 
Obviously, I gave a higher figure than what seemed a fair price: 
``Seven or eight dollars''. That was not it. The salesman from 
Laval was there. The farmer said: ``It is not $7 or $8. You know, 
farmers are used to that. Spare parts are always very 
expensive''. The real cost, as indicated on the bill, was $45.
<P>
	I told him: ``The day you break that small plastic container, 
Laurent, you would be better not to get out of bed, because with 
that mishap, your profit for the day is gone''. He agreed. The 
same thing is true for tractors and farm machinery. It is always 
amazing. Input and operating costs keep going up, but there has 
been no increase in beef prices over the last 14 years.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture is trying to justify the reduction 
and elimination of the 25 per cent tariff on beef imports from 
New Zealand and Australia. In conclusion, I fear that, once the 
GATT agreement is in force and tariffication applies, as is the 
case with negotiations with our neighbours- Tariffs have been 
set at a very high level, I agree, and they will deter imports, but 
let us take cheese, for example.
<P>
	Right now the tariff on cheese in 287 per cent under the GATT 
agreement that should normally come into force on January 1. If 
we prove to the Minister of Agriculture there is not enough 
cheddar cheese in Canada, he will order a lowering of the tariff 
from 287 to 100 or even 40 per cent or he will simply do as he did 
for the New Zealand beef and will abolish it altogether.
<P>
	That is a real concern. I said earlier I was looking forward to 
the day when the Minister of Agriculture will rise in this House 
and change the legislation in order to give a feeling of security to 
farmers. Nearly 85 per cent of all farmers in Canada have to 
work outside their farms to make ends meet. Only 15 per cent of 
the agricultural community can earn a living with farming.
<P>
	We cannot say agriculture is sick, but we can certainly say it is 
not healthy. There is discontent, serious discontent, and it is 
undoubtedly one of the reasons why it is so difficult for farmers 
at retirement age to find someone, whether one of their children 
or someone else,  to buy the farm at a fair price and to take over 
the business.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	There are no new farmers to take over the business, and when 
you look at the way things are, when you look at the future with 
open eyes, you realize that maybe young people are right to 
wonder whether there is still a future on the farm.
<P>
	I am one of those who believe there might be a future in 
farming, but our governments would have to take a stance and 
stick to it.
<P>
	Just think about what happened as recently as last winter, 
when we negotiated with the United States for the export of 
durum wheat. We had a flush in our hands, we had everything we 
needed to win on that issue, but we lost. We just lost. Will it 
always be like this? In the course of negotiations, we give some, 
but we also win some.
<P>
	In the case of the durum wheat, it was a perfect case. We lost 
it. In Quebec, our farming industry is based almost entirely on 
supply management. Quotas will disappear, after tariffs have 
been set at a rather high level. We hope that it will not be 
dramatically reduced year after year, because our Quebec 
farmers would be thrown on welfare or unemployment or onto 
the streets. We do not know exactly what will happen to quotas, 
but for many farmers they were their pension funds. I do not 
know what will happen six years down the road, when the value 
of quotas will be virtually down to zero.
<P>
	All this to tell you that the Bloc Quebecois, despite the flaws 
in Bill C-50, will vote for it, because that is what farmers want. 
They are the ones who demanded it. Of course, the bill is not 
perfect. But, between asking for perfection and voting against it, 
the Bloc Quebecois has chosen to support it, even if it means 
amending it next year, because with time, we will see what goes 
wrong with Bill C-50.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased today to be speaking on Bill C-50, a bill to amend the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act. In my presentation today I will talk 
about the bill itself, what is in the bill. I will talk a bit about the 
improvements that should have been made to the bill, some of 
the amendments that were put forward but unfortunately were 
not made. I will talk about the missed opportunity at a time when 
the Canadian Wheat Board Act has been opened up to change 
and the real missed opportunity because there were not more 
substantial changes made to the bill.
<P>
	I will start today by talking about the bill itself, Bill C-50, the 
bill to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act. The purpose of the 
bill is to amend the Canadian Wheat Board by allowing 
refundable check offs on wheat and barley on sales of wheat and 
barley to the board.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7611"> 7611 </A></B>
<P>
	This refundable check off is to be used for plant breeding 
research. I will summarize some of the provisions of the bill. 
The bill would allow for deductions from the farmer's final 
payment checks for each pool period, unless the farmer filed 
each year to the Canadian Wheat Board to be exempted from the 
refundable check off, from the deduction. The bill places this 
revenue in a fund with the Canadian Wheat Board which will be 
distributed to the Western Grains Research Foundation.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board must estimate how much money it 
will take from farmers per tonne for the grain to provide the $4.7 
million it wants to raise from this bill for research, again 
funding that will be directed to the Western Grains Research 
Foundation.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	The research funding agency would distribute the money to 
people or organizations for research based on what the board of 
directors for the foundation determined.
<P>
	There will be an additional reserve account set up which will 
put money into a special fund, a contingency fund intended to 
cover shortfalls from any particular year, shortfalls in funding, 
in case of a higher opt out rate or poor production on the prairies 
or just lower shipment levels through the Canadian Wheat 
Board.
<P>
	There is to be an annual report provided to the minister from 
the Western Grains Research Foundation each year and under 
the present provisions of the bill, the bill that we are going to 
vote on, this report must be presented by the minister within six 
months. One of the amendments I will talk about later states this 
report should be made public more quickly and the report should 
be made public as soon as it is presented to the minister from the 
foundation.
<P>
	In terms of the rationale behind the bill, the purpose for the 
bill, it is assumed that the benefits will be accrued to farmers for 
the following reasons. It will give farmers a role in supporting 
and directing research into new varieties of wheat and barley. It 
will link more closely the wishes of the agriculture industry, in 
particular farmers but others as well. It will give them more 
responsibility in directing where the research funding goes. I 
think this is an important part of this bill.
<P>
	It will provide $4.7 million of additional research for 
development of new varieties of wheat and barley, varieties 
which will be grown in western Canada.
<P>
	It may improve the development of new marketing 
alternatives, new marketing opportunities through the 
development of better varieties that are more readily 
marketable. Hopefully it will improve farm income through 
increased returns to farmers and a higher profit margin to 
farmers.
<P>
That is the intent of the bill. Reform does support this bill. I 
support this bill and the Reform Party supports this bill for the 
following reasons. We believe that research does benefit 
farmers and we believe that research money collected through 
the Canadian Wheat Board presented to the Western Grains 
Research Foundation will benefit farmers. Not only do we 
believe that but many farm groups believe that and have 
supported this bill.
<P>
	In talking to individual farmers in my constituency it seems 
that most individual farmers also support this refundable check 
off that will go to research.
<P>
	There are some conditions put on this and really some 
hesitation on the part of farmers, I have found. They hesitate 
because the number of check offs on the sales of their 
commodities is increasing all the time and they are concerned 
that there are too many.
<P>
	Farmers do recognize very well the importance of research. 
Farmers are willing to do their part in directly funding research. 
Farmers are also becoming concerned about the number of 
check offs, and this is another one.
<P>
	I believe the support is there but it is becoming hesitant and I 
think with new check offs there will be strong resistance at some 
point.
<P>
	This bill would have been improved substantially through 
amendments that were presented. I would like to speak briefly 
first about the second Bloc amendment, Motion No. 2. I believe 
the intent of that amendment was good. Reform did not support 
that amendment because the interpretation which we got from 
the legislation was unclear. Because of that we just found that 
we could not support the amendment.
<P>
	I think the intent would have been to ensure that the Western 
Grains Research Foundation funding is not duplicated, is not 
already done somewhere in Canada or somewhere else. Overlap 
and duplication would have been prevented.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	I think the intention of that motion was good but again, 
because of the way it fit into the legislation, we found that it was 
unclear. We were afraid that the Canadian Wheat Board would 
have been given the responsibility of making sure that money 
spent by the Western Grains Research Foundation was not on 
research already being done.
<P>
	We were afraid-I was certainly concerned-that the 
Canadian Wheat Board would be given that responsibility. We 
do not want the wheat board to be involved in any way other than 
providing a convenient collecting mechanism.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7612"> 7612 </A></B>
<P>
	Reform put forward two amendments to the bill, both of 
which I believe would have strengthened the bill. The first one 
was accountability. What we proposed is that the minister's 
report which he receives from Western Grains Research 
Foundation would be made public in a very short time through 
this House. I believe that accountability is needed. The hon. 
member for Malpeque on previous bills has pushed for a very 
similar type of accountability.
<P>
	Our second motion was to simplify the process that farmers 
would go through to opt out of making their contributions to the 
wheat board and ultimately to the research foundation through 
this check off. What we proposed was adding one small box to 
the Canadian Wheat Board's permit application form which a 
farmer could check off if they wanted to opt out of the program 
for that year.
<P>
	Some in the industry and some other members in this House 
opposed that method of opting out because they said that it is too 
easy to do. I am very concerned when government supports 
action whereby a bureaucracy interferes unnecessarily with 
decision making.
<P>
	In other words, in this case the people who opposed our 
amendment to make this easy said let us make it more difficult 
for farmers to opt out through added bureaucracy. I believe that 
is morally wrong.
<P>
	In too many places in our lives and especially in the lives of 
business people we have government interfering through the 
bureaucracy to make business more difficult to do. I am really 
quite upset that this motion was not supported, especially 
considering the reasons that were given for not supporting this 
motion.
<P>
	I believe these two motions and the intent of the second 
motion would have substantially improved this bill but they did 
not pass.
<P>
	What I would like to talk about now is the missed opportunity. 
The Canadian Wheat Board Act was opened. Why did we not 
make substantial changes to the act?
<P>
	My colleague, the member for Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, and 
I went to a Canadian Wheat Board rally in Regina about two 
weeks ago. What did we see at this rally? Did we see a bunch of 
radical farmers out to destroy the Canadian Wheat Board, this 
body which has been a very important body in western Canada 
for marketing grains? No, that is not what we saw.
<P>
	We saw very reasonable people speaking on changing the 
Canadian Wheat Board to improve it, to make it better for 
farmers. After all, this organization exists for farmers and it is 
funded by farmers. It is their organization. They wanted 
improvement.
<P>
I want to just talk about what a couple of speakers said at this 
rally in this regard. One gentleman talking about needed 
changes talked about how the Canadian Wheat Board was 
established in the first place. It was established originally in the 
1930s. It disappeared and came back during the war under the 
War Measures Act as a monopoly.
<P>
	That is when the wheat board first gained its monopoly power. 
It was in 1942 under the War Measures Act. It gained monopoly 
power so that Britain in particular could buy cheap food from 
Canadian farmers. Like so many pieces of legislation, instead of 
having a grandfather clause which would have the legislation 
end after a certain period of time it just continued.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Again I want to say that the Canadian Wheat Board has served 
a useful purpose. When the Canadian Wheat Board was set up 
we had a situation in the world first of all in western Canada in 
which farmers had a very poor communication system, very 
poor transportation and the grain buying companies were taking 
advantage of farmers because of the world they lived in, with 
poor information, poor transportation.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board, as did the wheat pool, served a 
very useful purpose in dealing with this problem. Back then we 
were dealing in a world where we had central desk buyers and 
central desk sellers. It worked well having a central desk seller 
selling to a central desk buyer. What wheat really was at that 
time was basically one commodity with a few different grades. 
This wheat board was marketing a fairly uniform commodity to 
a world that was not all that concerned with getting exactly a 
certain quality or a certain type of wheat. Under those 
conditions the wheat board worked well.
<P>
	What has happened is that the marketplace has changed. The 
world has changed. Now we have farmers who have extremely 
good communication systems. We have wheat which is no 
longer just wheat but is dozens and dozens of different 
commodities.
<P>
	Buyers buying wheat want a very specific product and we are 
looking at dozens of different products. Are we selling to central 
desk buyers any more? No, we are not. There are very few 
central desk buyers in the world so what we have now are 
mini-sellers because farmers want to become more active in 
selling. Grain companies servicing farmers want to become 
more active in selling outside of Canada as well. We have these 
mini-buyers and mini-sellers funnelling through the Canadian 
Wheat Board and the Canadian Wheat Board not selling to few 
buyers but selling to many buyers.
<P>
	We have the wheat board now which has become a funnel 
which takes a product from mini-sellers and sells to 
mini-buyers and again it is not just wheat or barley. There are 
many different, very specific products that these buyers want. 
We live in a different world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7613"> 7613 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe that the Canadian Wheat Board still can serve a 
useful purpose and so did these farmers at the rally. They said 
they were not out to destroy the Canadian Wheat Board, they 
were out to improve it. They talked about a voluntary wheat 
board and I thought they presented their case for a voluntary 
wheat board as they called it very well.
<P>
	There was one other farmer who really explained very well 
some of the problems we have with the board as it is. This story 
is going to sound really silly to anyone familiar with the grain 
industry but it is true. This farmer talked about his own 
situation. He had built a flour mill on his farm. He was 
processing flour, wheat, strictly from his farm. He was selling 
flour all across western Canada but he was selling specialty 
flour so he had to mill this flour from a very select type of wheat, 
his own wheat.
<P>
	The problem is that to operate within the law he has to market 
his wheat through the Canadian Wheat Board to sell to his mill. 
It is absurd but it is true. Not only that, he would only be allowed 
to sell as much wheat as the quota levels would allow. In spite of 
the fact he is milling his own wheat in his own mill he would be 
restricted by a quota level. It is absurd but that is what has 
happened.
<P>
	This story I believe demonstrates very well why we need to 
open the Canadian Wheat Board to change, to positive change, 
to changes that farmers support.
<P>
	This rally in Regina would have been an excellent meeting for 
the minister to have attended as it was in the minister's riding in 
Regina. It was really unfortunate I think and the farmers felt 
really cheated that the minister was not there. They were very 
pleased to see us there. They saw MPs who do understand there 
is a need for change to the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	I want to ask a question of farmers and other small business 
people, managers, owners. Would a farmer or another small 
business person allow a government agency to come in and 
manage their farm? They own the farm and they fund it. How 
many small business people would allow a government agency 
to come in and manage their operations? I say very few.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board is owned by farmers, funded by 
farmers and is supposedly for farmers. Then why on earth is it 
managed by government appointed commissioners? That is 
exactly what is happening and it does not make any sense.
<P>
	With regard to the Canadian Wheat Board, farmers want to be 
able to elect a board of directors. Recent polls have shown that 
over 90 per cent of western Canadian farmers want an elected 
board of directors to replace the government appointed 
commissioners. Does that sound so unreasonable?
<P>
The minister must act very quickly to allow for a farmer elected 
board of directors. After the farmers have elected the board of 
directors, the farmers should be allowed through referendum to 
determine what type of wheat board they want to serve them. 
They could choose to keep the board as is, which they certainly 
will not do from everything I have heard. They could choose to 
eliminate the board completely, which they certainly would not 
do from everything I have heard.
<P>
	There is a new movement to completely eliminate the board. I 
do not believe it is a strong movement. I do not believe a 
majority of farmers support it. I believe the options that would 
be chosen are somewhere in between. The first option would be 
to open the wheat board to competition on a continental basis. A 
continental market in barley and wheat is the first realistic 
option.
<P>
	The second realistic option would be to open the Canadian 
Wheat Board to competition anywhere in the world. More and 
more farmers are supporting this all the time.
<P>
	Another possible option would be to open the board to 
competition but allow the Canadian Wheat Board only to buy in 
export positions. It would eliminate the interference that the 
Canadian Wheat Board has in our transportation system, car 
allocation system and grain marketing system. It would let it 
stay in place to do its job in the export market. I believe it could 
serve a useful role in that regard.
<P>
	Let farmers decide that. It is not for me to decide. If they have 
another option that suits them, let them put the option forward to 
be voted on in a referendum. Let them choose the option they 
want.
<P>
	I would like to ask a rhetorical question: Why is the minister 
so opposed to making the changes that farmers want? I am not 
going to try to say what his motives are for refusing this change.
<P>
	I would like to end today with a story. It is a story about a 
farmer I know who is the anxious type. Some say he has an 
attitude problem. To relieve his anxiety, on Sunday mornings he 
goes out to his road. He calls it his road because he was the one 
who pushed to have it built and the one who pushed to have it 
paved. He likes to go to the end of his driveway and on to his 
road on his five-speed. On Sunday mornings the road is his. 
There is a curve down the road. He likes to get the car going 
about 100 before he gets to the curve and by the time he hits the 
curve have it up to 140. It makes him feel good; it relieves his 
anxiety.
<P>
	One Sunday morning he went out on his road, started to 
accelerate, and what does he see around the bend? A car was 
coming down his road on Sunday morning. He was upset. He 
was more anxious than ever. He started down his road and the 
approaching car swerved. He said: ``My God, a drunk on my 
road on Sunday morning''. As the car got closer he saw that it 
was a lady driver. He said: ``Oh my, a lady driver on my road on a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7614"> 7614 </A></B>
<P>
Sunday morning''. As the car got closer, the lady stopped the car  
and opened her window. He slowed down but did not stop. As he 
went by he heard the lady shout ``pig''. He was really anxious 
then and said: ``sow'' and he went on. He was more anxious than 
ever and hit the curve at 120 and as he started to accelerate into 
the curve he hit the pig.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	When that story was told to me it was to demonstrate how an 
attitude problem can interfere with the ability to change, but I 
am not so sure that is the only way to interpret the story.
<P>
	I believe that pig in the way of that farmer is in fact 
government. The biggest interference farmers have with doing 
business is government. Certainly, if that pig is not government, 
that pig and other pigs are being dropped in front of farmers by 
government and are interfering with them doing business. I 
believe government must stop dropping these pigs in front of 
farmers and other business people.
<P>
	In closing, we support Bill C-50, an act to amend the 
Canadian Wheat Board. We would have liked the bill amended, 
but I believe it is supported widely by farmers and I am looking 
forward to the legislation being enacted.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
rising to speak at third reading of Bill C-50. I note several of the 
previous speakers have wandered considerably off the topic of 
the bill.
<P>
	I want to make a quick allusion to the story we just heard 
concerning the man who presumed it was his road and all the 
problems he got into as a result of that false assumption. That is 
one of the basic problems of many people who are opposed to the 
wheat board and want what they call change. They too fall into 
the trap of making false assumptions about reality.
<P>
	The man presumed that it was his road and that no one else 
should be on it on a Sunday morning. What they presume is that 
the wheat board is just another buyer, just another grain 
company in the market, when in fact it is marketing the grain for 
all growers in western Canada. Once they get their heads around 
that space it will begin to make a lot more sense. That is one of 
the difficulties of my friend from Vegreville and his colleagues.
<P>
	The bill deals with how to finance plant breeding. It is a 
further proposal by government, following some proposals of 
the last government and some that were put forward in the 
Trudeau administration, to extract itself from publicly financed 
plant breeding. Publicly financed plant breeding has a long 
history in Canada, going back well over a hundred years. When 
John Wise was the minister of agriculture we celebrated a 
hundred years of plant breeding under the Department of 
Agriculture in Canada.
<P>
In my region of western Canada it was an extremely exciting 
initiative that was taken more than 100 years ago. Without the 
publicly sponsored plant breeding effort that occurred at the 
central research station in Ottawa and the varieties that were 
developed for early maturing hard spring wheat, my region 
would not have had a reason to exist in the world of agriculture.
<P>
	The varieties that existed prior to that time were not suitable 
for my region with its relatively short growing season. The 
development of Marquis wheat attracted the population there 
and made it possible for it to be economically viable. It made 
agriculture on the prairies the bread basket of the world, 
according to publicity at the turn of the century. Of course we 
were never that big.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	Many countries grow more wheat and more grain than does 
Canada, but few countries export as much of their production as 
we do. We export about 80 per cent of our production. None of 
the other countries are forced to do that because they have larger 
populations and consume it at home.
<P>
	Because of this we developed the marketing institutions to 
which some of my friends in the House have been referring. 
Essentially we built on that success by continuing the publicly 
financed breeding program to get around diseases that came up, 
rust that developed and insects that developed over time. As the 
region continues to grow grains, some of these pests and hazards 
insert themselves into the land and into the environment. It is a 
constant struggle to change varieties so they will be resistant to 
insects, pests, rusts, fungi and so on.
<P>
	I noticed the minister made reference to the fact that it was 
possible to get as much as a 15 per cent increase in yield due to 
plant breeding. It is on paper and it is in the test plot. However 
when we go on to the farms and start dealing with the exigencies 
of the overall environment and the climactic changes that occur 
over time, it requires a lot of other attendant improvements in 
agriculture to keep yields up. Some older varieties will still 
yield almost as well as the newer varieties by using the 
techniques available now.
<P>
	The advantages have been better but have not been terribly 
dramatic. They have been incremental to the point of producing 
huge benefits when compared to the pittance invested in them. 
Any economic research on the cost and benefit of plant breeding 
shows that for every $1 put in there is as a conservative estimate 
a minimum of $7 to other estimates that run as high as $15 or 
$20. The payback is extremely high. In spite of that, previous 
governments, administrations and popular wisdom have it that 
government has to get out of plant breeding and there has been a 
constant cutting back of share of the department's investment in 
that area.
<P>
	We have not kept up publicly financed plant breeding and 
because we have not done so government has come up with 
various ways of assuaging its conscience about it. During the 
late seventies and early eighties they talked  about plant 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7615"> 7615 </A></B>
<P>
breeders' rights. The last government finally implemented plant 
breeders' rights. That has paid the developers of new varieties 
for their cost and trouble by virtue of giving them what amounts 
to a patent to extract a fee from anyone who uses their varieties 
of seed during the next 15 years.
<P>
	On top of that we have the bill before us proposing to extract 
what some people call a voluntary payment and what others call 
a refundable payment from each tonne of grain sold in the wheat 
board region through the wheat board. The act does not say so, 
but the government indicates its intention is to extract $20 per 
tonne on all wheats and $40 per tonne on all barleys from the 
final payment paid out in January, following the closing of the 
previous crop year's pool. Producers would have the option 
before the end of February to inform the board that they wanted 
their deductions sent to them rather than to the research 
foundation if they disapproved of the activities of the research 
foundation.
<P>
	It is difficult to oppose a proposal that permits individuals to 
make up their own minds on whether they want to submit 
payments to such a scheme.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to make it quite clear to the House that what we are 
doing here as governments, as politicians, as ministries of 
agriculture, is layering one more cost on to farmers that was not 
there 20 years ago. Farmers are now financing plant breeders, 
first as taxpayers through public financing albeit not quite as 
adequate as it could be because of government cutbacks. We are 
asked to finance plant breeding through the payments under 
plant breeders' rights for the use of the newly developed seeds. 
Now we are being asked to finance plant breeding a third way by 
a check off on our sales of wheat and barley through the 
Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	I think that we have a right to ask how many more times we 
have to keep up this financing. The clear beneficiaries of this 
increased productivity are the consumers of the product. My 
friend from Frontenac indicated that it is the last bushels that 
create the profit, and that is true, but it is those last bushels that 
are used to depress the price. As we increase our production the 
supply is increased and the price for all of the production begins 
to fall.
<P>
	The beneficiary of this increased production is always the 
consumers. They have been getting cheaper and cheaper food. 
The cost of groceries and basic foods that go into the groceries 
has been falling all through this century.
<P>
	That has not been the case for a whole lot of other 
commodities and things that we use. Even housing has gone up 
in that period of time. With regard to transport, I hark back to 
just 15 or 20 years ago in making comparisons since today at the 
agriculture committee we were talking about cattle prices. In 
1977 I remember buying a new car. It cost me I think seven 
800-pound steers to buy a brand new car. It was a full size car, 
had  everything going for it. Today that car would take 
something in the order of 25 or 30 800-pound steers.
<P>
	We were being told in the committee that cattle prices had 
held up pretty well. They certainly have, have they not?
<P>
	The technology for cars has changed somewhat. I saw an 
article in the press recently which said that because of demands 
from government for environmental improvements to the 
emission controls and other requirements by government, the 
cost of a car is now about $4,500 more than in 1977. This was for 
all the technical improvements. If everything else were equal 
the car would be about half the price that it is now.
<P>
	When I look at what labour received out of that car between 
1977 and today, it gets about the same amount of money. The 
input in hours has dropped dramatically but labour gets about 
the same amount of money. Somewhere there has been a 
doubling of the real price of that car and the beef has dropped in 
what it will really buy to about a third. It has dropped 
two-thirds. Eight would buy a car and now it takes 25.
<P>
	I just present that to show that consumers have taken real 
advantage of the productivity of agriculture. I do not see the 
rationale for farmers to continue to have to pay a bigger and 
bigger chunk of the research to make productivity gains that 
consumers are going to benefit from.
<P>
	I think there will be a great deal of angst among farmers when 
they see the amount of deduction that there will be on their final 
payment cheques after January 1996.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	A lot of them will have to think long and hard whether they 
want to have their research deduction returned to them or go into 
the research group. One of the things that will be a factor for 
farmers in Saskatchewan and Manitoba at least will be the 
fairness of the extraction process.
<P>
	Members will know from the debate yesterday that there has 
been a special dispensation granted to Alberta and some B.C. 
producers because they have a different form of deduction 
already in place. Their deduction is for research in general. It is 
not for plant breeding research specifically.
<P>
	All the funds from this deduction will go into developing new 
plant varieties. We are told that perhaps 2 per cent will be used 
for administration purposes. The rest will be transferred directly 
for scientific work on developing new plant varieties.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7616"> 7616 </A></B>
<P>
	We know from the public annual statement on the Alberta 
check off for instance that much less than 50 per cent of the 
funds collected are even allocated to research and there is no 
distinction made as to whether the research is economic 
research, marketing research or actual plant development 
research.
<P>
	We have one set of oranges and one set of apples coming in for 
these deductions. Yet the government refused to make a change 
yesterday and so did the established parties in the House. They 
did not see any problem with this. They seem to be quite happy 
that Manitoba and Saskatchewan producers will pay 20 cents a 
tonne for plant breeding research. Alberta producers will pay an 
unspecified amount for research. They will pay the 20 cents for 
wheat but not for barley research.
<P>
	We will be paying 40 cents. What will they be paying? 
Nobody seems to know. As long as that stays very fuzzy, there 
will be a lot of people saying: ``Why should I contribute? If 
Alberta farmers are going to be getting the same benefits from 
those new plants as I am, why can they not pay the same 
amount?'' We were trying to have that dichotomy straightened 
out in the act. Yet the government refused to take any action on 
it.
<P>
	One of the problems that this federal government always has 
is a problem of treating people in each region the same within 
the region. I would argue that it failed this test miserably 
yesterday when it proposed to continue with this bill.
<P>
	I find it very difficult to see why we should be pushing for 
support for this bill. I find it very difficult to go out and tell my 
producers that this is a good bill for them when I see that we are 
simply taking step three as a way of continuing to back off 
public responsibility for plant breeding and put it on to the hands 
of producers.
<P>
	It is really a form of government offloading on to producers. It 
becomes a form of additional directed taxation that is a bad 
precedent to begin with. I have great difficulty supporting the 
whole concept that has been put forward in this bill.
<P>
	It is laying out a system that is inequitable. It is treating some 
farmers different than other farmers who live in the same region 
and who will all benefit the same from the research. It is putting 
what amounts to a third tax on producers who have some interest 
in upgrading the genetic material that they work with.
<P>
	It is also true that the final consumer is the one who reaps all 
the benefit from that new research. I find it very difficult to 
justify making an additional charge to the producer in those 
instances.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on third reading of Bill C-50, 
legislation that will produce a voluntary producer levy or check 
off program for plant breeding research.
<P>
I have a number of comments to make today, some of which are 
based on the bill before us, some of which are based on the 
debate that we had yesterday in this Chamber specific to report 
stage of the bill and as well some comments about the Canadian 
Wheat Board which I believe is central to this debate and is 
crucial to the future of agriculture in this country.
<P>
	First I would like to address the specifics of the bill which are 
before us for third reading today. Essentially, as we have heard 
in this Chamber already, the federal government has launched an 
agriculture initiative, depending on how we want to look at it, 
either as a tax grab from farmers or an opportunity for farmers to 
participate financially in the development of new grains 
research.
<P>
	The new legislation proposed here sets out what is called a 
voluntary producer levy or check off program to support plant 
breeding research programs for wheat and barley.
<P>
	As the minister of agriculture indicated in the Chamber 
during his comments at second reading, if passed the legislation 
would call for the first collection of this levy to take place in 
January 1995.
<P>
	The idea of the check off is not a new one. It is already in 
practise for beef and hog producers and as a concept has been 
endorsed by many of western Canada's grain organizations. This 
is however the first time that a check off has been applied across 
the board for wheat and barley production.
<P>
	According to the minister of agriculture there is general 
agreement for this idea among producers. The agreement is on 
principle more than it is on practice. While this bill sets out a 
particular practice we as members of Parliament are called upon 
to examine how that practice will be implemented and what it 
means rather than on the general principle.
<P>
	Here is how the bill is supposed to work. Western producers of 
wheat and barley will pay levies of 20 cents per tonne of wheat 
and 40 cents per tonne of barley delivered during the crop year. 
The first levies will be deducted from the Canadian Wheat 
Board final payments beginning with those for the 1993-94 crop 
year. Those final payments in the ordinary course of events for 
1993-94 would be made in January 1995.
<P>
	Based on projected deliveries the check off is expected to 
bring in, according to the minister of agriculture, an estimated 
$4.7 million for additional research. That research would be 
co-ordinated by the Western Grains Research Foundation, a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7617"> 7617 </A></B>
<P>
federally chartered public organization that has been 
co-ordinating research in this field for the past 10 years.
<P>
	Under the terms of the new legislation the foundation would 
be accountable to producers by having to report annually to all 
prairie permit book holders, by giving an accounting of the 
money received and how it has been used to accomplish its 
research goals.
<P>
	The new program is not intended to duplicate or replace 
current check off programs already in place in some provinces 
and, as has been mentioned numerous times in the Chamber over 
the last two days, certain Alberta grain producers will be exempt 
from the levy.
<P>
	I think it is worth repeating what was said yesterday. The 
check off in Alberta is somewhat different than the check off 
being proposed nationally. If one were to compare the reasons 
for bringing in the legislation as it is today and apply it to the 
implementation of the goods and services tax from a few years 
ago, the implication would be that any province with a 
pre-existing tax would be exempt from the GST and those that 
had no pre-existing tax would be levied the GST.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	In that case if the same principle were applied in 1990 as the 
one that is being applied here on the check off in 1994 only the 
province of Alberta would be subjected to this federal levy and 
the other provinces would be provided with an exemption. It is 
an interesting scenario to say the least.
<P>
	The program as proposed in Bill C-50 is also voluntary so that 
producers who choose not to participate may opt out if that is 
their preference. Any producer wanting to opt out may do so on 
an annual basis simply by putting that request in writing.
<P>
	In introducing the legislation the agriculture minister says he 
expects 90 per cent of western grain farmers to participate in the 
program but he gives us no indication at all on how he has 
calculated that figure.
<P>
	There has been as fair amount of criticism in the House over 
the last couple of days about the program. For those who have 
reviewed its components and have not liked what they have seen 
in the specifics of the bill, the arguments focus somewhat on the 
fact that plant breeding research in Canada has always been 
publicly funded. The new legislation simply gives the federal 
government an opportunity to withdraw from providing 
adequate funding, perhaps some time in the future, because they 
will say the producers themselves are being taxed through the 
levy for the necessary funding.
<P>
	Of course the minister of agriculture in his opening remarks 
denied that this would happen but there is certainly no 
protection in the existing funding in the legislation to guarantee 
the federal government's commitment to publicly funded 
research. Therefore, without that type of legislative guarantee it 
is difficult to accept the word of the minister.
<P>
At the same time if farmers opt out in numbers greater than the 
10 per cent the minister has already calculated the financing 
pool will be diminished. Actually it will be uncertain from year 
to year because the financing pool will have to be calculated 
only on the amount of money that is collected and if farmers can 
opt out on an annual basis it will be difficult to calculate the 
entire financing pool on an ongoing basis.
<P>
	Therefore the research institutions commissioned to do the 
research will not know from year to year what level of funding 
they will be able to receive. There is also the unfairness that 
some producers will pay for the support of research and want to 
contribute to it but all producers will benefit from that research 
whether or not they paid into it in the first place.
<P>
	This alludes to the exemption provided to certain Alberta 
producers who will get the benefit from the research even 
though they do not pay into it.
<P>
	The other argument is on the accountability of the process. It 
is acknowledged that the foundation must report on how it is 
spending the money for research but if producers disagree for 
any reason there is no mechanism in place for them to appeal 
those spending decisions and it is always after the horse has left 
the barn, after the door has been closed. You can only comment, 
perhaps publicly, and not direct or influence the way those 
decisions will be made. Therefore true accountability does not 
exist.
<P>
	As the member for Mackenzie mentioned a few moments ago 
there is an important concept here that every member of the 
House and all producers in Canada must keep in mind and that is 
the principle of research into grains production is an important 
public policy matter and as such we should do whatever we can 
to ensure that there is as much public funding and public 
accountability in the process as possible.
<P>
	Yesterday I indicated during report stage debate in what 
became in a sense a conversation with the minister of agriculture 
that the importance of the Canadian Wheat Board has never been 
more in question among Canadians. We are hearing in the news a 
considerable amount of discussion about the future of 
agriculture and the future of the Canadian Wheat Board because 
a number of producers in Canada, particularly producers near 
the American border, have been expressing discontent with the 
marketing practices of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	I think it is important during this debate about amendments to 
the Canadian Wheat Board Act that we do keep in mind how 
important the Canadian Wheat Board is and the role that this 
Chamber and the minister of agriculture must play in providing 
some support for the Canadian Wheat Board, the organization 
that we as producers and as members of Parliament have created 
in order to assist in the sale of all Canadian wheat and barley. 
Perhaps, as I suggested yesterday, we should as  well be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7618"> 7618 </A></B>
<P>
considering changes that would allow for marketing of oats and 
canola and perhaps even some other grains in Canada.
<P>
	Yesterday the minister of agriculture responded to one of my 
concerns by saying that he did not want to engage in a broader 
debate about the Canadian Wheat Board. Then he qualified his 
statement by saying, and I quote from <I>Hansard</I> of yesterday at 
page 7579, pertaining to a broader discussion about the wheat 
board:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The fact that I do not happen to mention some of those other things should 
not be taken as any kind of disinterest in the subject matter. I am simply holding 
my fire.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He is simply holding his fire. I wonder how long he intends to 
do that. How long does the minister intend to remain silent about 
his personal commitment and the commitment of this 
government to the Canadian Wheat Board?
<P>
	I say that because just the other day the Canadian Wheat 
Board in an unusual statement came forward to defend itself in 
the face of some of the attacks. I quote the information officer of 
the Canadian Wheat Board, Miss Deanna Allen: ``The board is 
under personal attack. If others are rallying farmers to rethink 
what they have, then let them think on accurate information''.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board is arguing that those who are 
calling for dual marketing in Canada are doing so not with 
accurate information. If the minister of agriculture has 
information like the Canadian Wheat Board has which can add 
to the debate, I think it is very important that the minister not 
hold his fire in this regard but rather engage in the debate and 
bring forward not only the information but the opinions that are 
needed to support the strong Canadian Wheat Board in its work.
<P>
	I will quote from the Canadian Wheat Board's defence of its 
activities in its releases from last week. Mr. Richard Klassen is 
the board commissioner with the Canadian Wheat Board. Mr. 
Klassen says in response to the U.S. market:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``The U.S. is a premium market. It is one of the few premium priced markets 
left in the world. It offers a high return because it is unaffected by the price 
discounting subsidies imposed by the U.S. and the European Union. U.S. 
customers are also usually willing to pay a premium for Canadian wheat 
because of its high quality''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The down side is that market is not large enough to accept all of the 24 
million tonnes of wheat and barley that western Canadian farmers want to 
export. The board as a result must sell into other markets that do not offer as 
high a return. The prices from these sales are what lower the overall return to 
farmers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``The question is really who should receive the commercial premium often 
available in the U.S. Should these premiums go to individual farmers or grain 
companies who access the U.S. directly, or should those premiums be shared 
among all grain growers in western Canada?''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The answer is through the Canadian Wheat Board all western 
Canadian farmers benefit from the premium market, whether it 
is in the United States this year and  next year or whether it is in 
Japan or China or Europe or Saudi Arabia in the future.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	I also want to indicate that I found the comments of the 
minister of agriculture the other day quoted in the Regina 
<I>Leader-Post</I> of October 27. The headline on the newspaper 
article was ``Goodale is determined''. The agriculture minister 
said ``Canada has a historic right to duty free access into Europe 
for a million tonnes of high quality wheat and almost a million 
tonnes of barley''.
<P>
	The minister of agriculture is wanting to have a stronger 
Canadian presence in Europe and is willing to fight for it. That 
market in Europe will not be accessible without a strong 
Canadian Wheat Board. If the minister of agriculture is anxious 
to fight for Canadian markets in Europe, he should be willing to 
fight for the Canadian marketing arm that gives us that access 
here in Canada.
<P>
	Those concerns of mine are shared by numerous constituents 
of mine, all of my constituents who have phoned me recently. 
One of my constituents was fortunate enough to be at a meeting 
organized by the National Farmers' Union in the United States 
just a couple of weeks ago, Mr. John Clair from Radisson, 
Saskatchewan, also a member of the Canadian Wheat Board 
advisory committee; a committee that I would strongly advise 
the government take a look at and see if it cannot turn that into 
more of a board of directors than an advisory committee so that 
the elected wishes of the producers are more influential in the 
decision making of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Mr. John Clair was at a meeting in the United States, a 
meeting that involved a number of farmers in Glendive, 
Montana. Mr. Clair says that he is more convinced than ever 
after that meeting that the Canadian Wheat Board should be left 
intact and keep its export monopoly.
<P>
	Quoting Mr. John Clair recently in an issue of the <I>Western 
Producer</I> from October 20, Mr. Clair says: ``They''-meaning 
the Americans-``said if there was a dual marketing situation in 
Canada, they would push to have the border closed 
immediately''.
<P>
	In other words, if Canadian farmers are given the opportunity 
by the Canadian government to just cross the border unimpeded 
with every truck load of grain that they can, the Americans as 
they have on so many other trade issues would immediately 
retaliate and close the border to all Canadian grain.
<P>
	That means any premium market that was accessible by the 
Canadian Wheat Board or any farmer immediately closed and 
there would be no access to those premium dollars to any 
Canadian farmer whether we can sell into that market or not.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7619"> 7619 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Clair also mentioned that the people he talked to looked at 
the dual marketing supporters in Canada as quite naive about 
their circumstances and even our own. Again I quote Mr. Clair: 
``They seem to assume it is just a great big pit we can drop wheat 
into''. In other words, the American market is just there for all 
the wheat that we can put into it.
<P>
	Mr. Clair says in a tremendous year, we can sell maybe 10 per 
cent of our crop to the United States. That means 90 per cent has 
to go some place else. There is nothing more true than that 
statement.
<P>
	I remind the minister of agriculture and the government that 
in the agriculture supplement to the red book they made a very 
strong commitment to the financial security of Canadian farm 
families, a commitment that extends to the value of the 
Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Basically the comment from the red book is that Canada's 
agri-food industry needs policies and programs such as supply 
management, the Canadian Wheat Board and stabilization to 
minimize the impact of market price fluctuations.
<P>
	On this day I call on the minister of agriculture and the 
government to, as they have with everything else in this place, 
stick to the commitment of the red book and maintain policies 
such as the Canadian Wheat Board to minimize the impact of 
marketplace price fluctuations on Canadian farmers.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFCANADIANHERITAGEACT">DEPARTMENT OF CANADIAN HERITAGE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from November 1, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-53, an act to establish the Department of 
Canadian Heritage and to amend and repeal certain other acts, be 
now read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
these past few weeks, the government has been repeating that it 
is acting in good faith, claiming it wants to negotiate with the 
provinces and maintain a partnership relationship with them 
instead of a paternalistic and dominating one. It never fails 
however to attack insidiously the government of Quebec for its 
alleged bad faith.
<P>
	Today, the Liberals give yet more proof of the fact that bad 
faith does not lie where they would have us believe it does and 
that this government, like the ones before it, never had any real 
intention of considering Quebec as a full-fledged partner.
<P>
	In introducing Bill C-53 to establish the Department of 
Canadian Heritage, the Liberal government has reached new 
heights in denying the existence of provincial jurisdictions and, 
what is worse, in denying the very existence of the Quebec 
people. Not content with infringing repeatedly upon provincial 
jurisdictions-culture, education and language in 
particular-the federal government has managed to violate the 
most fundamental element of Quebec's specificity as a society, 
namely its culture.
<P>
	As described in 1993 in an administrative document, the 
mandate of the Department of Canadian Heritage is quite 
explicit: to create a deep sense of identity and feeling of 
belonging based on bilingualism and multiculturalism.
<P>
	In order to achieve this, the department will rely only on 
programs that, according to the aforementioned document, 
contribute to a very strong sense of identity among Canadians. 
By emphasizing the Canadian identity and disregarding 
Quebec's identity and its distinct character, the Department of 
Canadian Heritage becomes, as far as Quebecers are concerned, 
a vehicle for promoting Canadian unity.
<P>
	In this connection, furthermore, we know that the minister 
will not hesitate to use all the tools at his disposal, at the risk of 
shamelessly using the public press.
<P>
	As proof, we have the words of his leader, spoken last June 16, 
and I quote: ``-there is a law governing the operation of the 
CBC, and I will ask that the CBC respect that law. The law says, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7620"> 7620 </A></B>
<P>
in defining the mandate of the CBC, that it must inform people 
on the advantages Canada presents''.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to look at just how little 
regard the government has for Quebec's special character and its 
historic claims.
<P>
	The economic, cultural and social contribution made by 
immigrants to the development of society in Quebec and in 
Canada is undeniable. But an indiscriminate policy on the part 
of the Canadian government could do serious harm to Quebec 
society. It is essential that a policy of integration does not end up 
diluting Quebec's identity beyond recognition. In Quebec, any 
diversification of the social fabric must take into account the 
French character of our community.
<P>
	For these reasons, Quebec and interested provinces must be 
allowed to participate in the development of a multiculturalism 
policy.
<P>
	Besides, the Act to establish the Department of Canadian 
Heritage makes the minister responsible for ``the advancement 
of the equality of status and use of English and French and the 
enhancement and development of the English and French 
linguistic minority communities in Canada''. Since the 
bilingualism policy is seen as a failure by the majority of 
Canadians, and a simple review of press reports across Canada is 
enough to convince us that the situation of francophones outside 
Quebec is far from getting better-which is not saying much 
when we know that the future of some French-speaking 
communities is actually threatened-, we can once again 
question the Canadian government's good will and ability to act.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The unfortunate matter of the closure of the military college 
in Saint-Jean and the procrastination surrounding the French 
school in Kingston, combined with the fact that the influence of 
the minister now in charge of bilingualism with his Cabinet 
colleagues is very questionable, do nothing to reassure minority 
rights organizations and those who have been waiting so many 
years for the Canadian government to honour the commitment to 
a just society made during the Trudeau era.
<P>
	From another perspective, we would have thought that, by 
giving the Minister of Canadian Heritage various 
responsibilities formerly within the purview of several 
departments, the government tried to save money. But it is 
clearly not the case.
<P>
	The federal government's tactic is well known. First, it 
consolidates its presence by using its spending power in an area 
of jurisdiction of special importance to Quebec; then it denies 
the distinctiveness of Quebec culture; finally, it promotes a 
hypothetical cultural identity across Canada.
<P>
	Furthermore, like every time the federal government gets 
involved in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction, 
duplication increases and becomes institutionalized. The 
Conseil des arts et des lettres and the Canada Council, the Grand 
Théâtre, the Place des Arts and the National Arts Centre, the 
national libraries of Quebec and Canada  are cases in point. Yet, 
even under the Liberals, Quebec has always demanded full 
control of its cultural resources and an end to the federal 
government's repeated interference.
<P>
	In that regard, former Quebec Minister of Culture Liza Frulla, 
who can certainly not be accused of having sovereignist 
motives, said: ``Real dialogue is almost non-existent and when 
it does occur, it is more often than not at Quebec's request. Since 
Quebec is often presented with a fait accompli, it has to react 
after the fact to make its real needs known''.
<P>
	Culture comes from people, artists and creators. It does not 
come from the government. The role of a government is to 
accept culture for what it is and to help promote and develop that 
culture. The government which should play a role to that end 
must necessarily be the one closest to the realities of people, the 
one which best understand their needs, priorities and values.
<P>
	The federal government, which is bent on creating and 
promoting a Canadian culture, is certainly the one in the best 
position to fulfill that role. Sure, it does have important, albeit 
artificial, financial means, but more often than not its priorities 
conflict with those of the artists and the Quebec government, 
which is in the best position to understand the needs of these 
artists.
<P>
	Quebec's Union des artistes could not have been clearer on 
that issue: ``-when Ottawa comes to Quebec with its own 
priorities, its objectives do not always agree with those of the 
Quebec government. That situation not only creates 
overlapping: It also creates a shock. This is what paralyses 
everything''.
<P>
	We must also look at the issue of copyright and the 
unacceptable sharing of responsibilities between the Minister of 
Industry and the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	In recent months, I have received dozens of letters from 
various organizations representing producers and creators and 
denouncing the uncertainty with which these people have to put 
up daily. They are not only concerned by the government's 
slowness regarding the copyright issue, but also by the rightist 
approach being perpetuated by the current Liberal government, 
at the structural level, in giving the Department of Industry, 
through Bill C-46, judicial and administrative responsibility 
over the Copyright Act.
<P>
	Composers, authors, artists, performers and producers 
worked hard to obtain a right allowing them to get something out 
of their work. The copyright system advocated by major 
industries, and also by the Minister of Industry, would 
jeopardize the chances of creative artists to see their economic 
conditions improve for good. Moreover, Quebec authors, who 
deal first 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7621"> 7621 </A></B>
<P>
with Europe and not the United States, would certainly not find 
satisfaction in a system patterned on the American model.
<P>
	The basic issue remains the fact that we are faced with an 
informally shared responsibility between two departments, 
which unduly delays the tabling of the act on the second phase of 
the copyright reform.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	We are witnessing a sterile confrontation, opposing the view 
of the Minister of Industry, who would rather conform to the line 
of American trade policies, and that of the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, who favours the copyright and neighbouring rights 
system. Meanwhile, our creative artists and performers are 
stuck between a Department of Canadian Heritage with no real 
authority, but is theoretically supposed to be looking out for 
them, and a Department of Industry with little concern for their 
problems.
<P>
	The situation has been particularly bad these past few days, 
since the Minister of Canadian Heritage has been suffering from 
a chronic lack of credibility with the people as well as his 
colleagues, after making several unforgivable errors of 
judgement that were recently brought to the attention of this 
House.
<P>
	It is therefore imperative that Bill C-53 be amended so as to 
make explicit the responsibility of the heritage minister 
regarding copyright and, in this respect, that the bill be 
introduced by the Minister of Canadian Heritage himself. Not 
only is Bill C-53 visibly flawed, but it is further evidence of this 
government's insensitivity to or even contempt for the 
distinctiveness and specificity of Quebec, which accounts for at 
least 25 per cent of the total population of Canada.
<P>
	That is why I support the motion put forth by my hon. 
colleague from Rimouski-Témiscouata. I therefore ask that the 
bill be withdrawn and the subject matter referred to the Standing 
Committee on Canadian Heritage.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to be able to share with you today my views on Bill 
C-53, the bill to create the Department of Canadian Heritage. 
The proposed legislation is a technical measure that gives 
official recognition to the departmental structure and division of 
responsibilities that was adopted when the government took 
office.
<P>
	As most members know the department has been functioning 
well now for more than a year and a half. The passage of this bill 
is a necessary legal step and will substantiate the areas of 
jurisdiction within which the Minister of Canadian Heritage will 
exercise his powers and carry out his duties and functions.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage brings together 
components from five former or existing federal departments, 
namely environment, communications, secretary of state, 
national health and welfare, and multiculturalism and 
citizenship. This fact alone allows you to imagine the abundant 
variety of programs that can be found within this department.
<P>
The legislation reflects the breadth of the department's mandate 
which includes responsibilities in areas such as cultural 
development, multiculturalism, official languages, heritage 
conservation, national parks, national historic sites, and 
amateur sports.
<P>
	Moreover, the policies and programs of the Department of 
Canadian Heritage are designated to promote increased 
understanding of our diversity, the involvement of all citizens in 
Canadian society and awareness of our cultural and natural 
wealth. In other words, the department is active in those areas 
that are linked to our identity as Canadians.
<P>
	One of the most visible programs administered by Canadian 
heritage is Parks Canada which is also one of the department's 
three principal sectors. Many Canadians and for that matter 
many tourists who visit Canada have taken advantage of the 
opportunity to experience the magnificence and unique natural 
beauty of the country's system of natural parks, natural historic 
sites and historic canals. As steward of these unrivalled 
examples of our natural and cultural heritage it is Parks 
Canada's duty to ensure their protection and interpretation on 
behalf of all Canadians.
<P>
	Parks Canada has a strong and respected presence in every 
region of the country. It contributes in a significant way both 
directly and indirectly to the local economies of communities all 
across Canada through expenditures on its own operations and 
through the tourism and economic benefits generated as a result 
of those activities.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	The second major sector of the department that I would like to 
mention encompasses those programs aimed at the promotion of 
Canadian identity and civic participation. As one would expect 
with such a broadly based mandate this sector includes an 
impressive variety of program areas.
<P>
	Some of the government's most important initiatives are 
being implemented in this sector. These include the promotion 
of official languages, the pursuit of excellence in amateur 
sports, the promotion of our cultural diversity and 
encouragement of the full and open participation of every 
Canadian in society, the promotion of greater understanding of 
human rights, fundamental freedoms and related values, as well 
as multiculturalism.
<P>
	All Canadians must feel a sense of belonging to this country. 
Multiculturalism seeks to bridge the gap between cultural 
communities with diverse interests and backgrounds. Within 
this sector are the programs that speak to us regarding what it 
means to be Canadian, that set us apart from the rest of the world 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7622"> 7622 </A></B>
<P>
and that have helped Canada earn its top ranking by the United 
Nations for overall quality of life.
<P>
	Last but not least, the other key sector that will occupy the 
time of the minister is concerned with the growth and 
development of Canada's cultural sector. This area has never 
been more important than it is now, given the significance of its 
contribution to the Canadian economy.
<P>
	Some maintain that culture is first and foremost a way of 
looking at the world and a symbol of our civilization. It is 
through this unique perspective of the world that we are able to 
distinguish ourselves from others. Culture therefore with the 
traditions and values it encompasses is what gives us our 
identity.
<P>
	Most members will agree that the federal government 
responsibility in cultural matters extends to those areas that are 
pan-Canadian, interprovincial and international in scope. 
Federal activities in this area remain complementary to those of 
the other levels of government. It is vital that there be many 
agents of cultural development and for governments to play an 
active role.
<P>
	The federal government's key objective in this area is to 
ensure that Canada's artists, creators and cultural industries are 
provided with the support they need to create and distribute 
cultural products and that Canadians have access to these 
important examples of cultural expression.
<P>
	Culture is the very essence of the national identity, the 
foundation of national sovereignty and national pride. In a world 
where globalization and the information and communications 
revolution are bypassing national borders, Canada needs to 
commit itself more than ever to cultural development.
<P>
	To summarize it is clear that the programs and policies of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage span Canada's past, present 
and future. The department can be regarded as the flagship of 
Canadian identity, bringing together a mosaic of federal 
programs that will help to confront and surmount the challenges 
that lie ahead.
<P>
	I fully support the passage of this legislation and look forward 
to the official recognition of the Department of Canadian 
Heritage, so help us God.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in this debate to address the amendment by my 
colleagues from the Bloc. Of course this debate deals with the 
department of culture, the Department of Canadian Heritage. 
Certainly some questions have been asked of the accountability 
and responsibility of that whole department very recently.
<P>
	Those are the types of things we need to discuss because if the 
credibility is not there, if there is no sense of total ministerial 
accountability and responsibility, then what does the legislation 
really matter? What does the name of the department really 
matter? As you well know, Mr. Speaker, probably very little. If 
someone stands as the Prime Minister has for days and days and 
says: ``I am totally responsible'', then we want to see that  
responsibility. We do not want them just to say it, we want to see 
it.
<P>
	As I address this amendment and the whole issue of this entire 
department I would like to call into question, sad to say but 
necessary to do, the need to look at some of the things that have 
happened in this department. Then we must ask: Can it even go 
on as such?
<P>
	Should there be a department of multiculturalism in this 
country? When people come to Canada do they feel they should 
really be part of Canada, or should they be hunkered off in their 
own areas, getting government money to continue the way of 
life they so freely left to come to Canada? One certainly wonders 
about that. When there is a minister who we certainly need to ask 
questions about, it is important that we look at the whole scope 
of the entire matter.
<P>
	Let us look at the chronology of incidents that have happened 
over the last several months. On March 15, 1994 this whole 
department was called into question when the minister wrote to 
Keith Spicer, the chairman of the CRTC, asking that it give ``due 
consideration'' to the application submitted by Konstantinos 
Daniilidis for a Greek language radio program licence. CRTC 
itself stamped the letter ``intervention''. The CRTC knows what 
an intervention is; perhaps this government does not but the 
CRTC does. Keith Spicer knows very clearly what an 
intervention is, or an interference if you will, by a minister.
<P>
	Two weeks later on March 29, 1994, the secretary general of 
the CRTC, Allan Darling, responded to the minister by thanking 
him ``for his letter of support''. He knows what a letter of 
support is. That confirmed the CRTC considered it an 
intervention. The minister did not respond to this letter.
<P>
	On September 20, months and months down the road, Mr. 
Mike Pattichis writes to the minister expressing concern about 
support for the Daniilidis application. He knew about it. The 
letter was never made public.
<P>
	Ten days later on September 30 the Canadian heritage 
minister writes to Mr. Pattichis to clarify that his March 15 letter 
was not in fact intended to convey support, certainly not. It was 
just carbon copied to the CRTC. It was a six month delay in 
responding to clarify the issue. The letter arrived too late to be 
considered by the CRTC. The file regarding Daniilidis had 
already been closed. In other words: ``Thank you. Appreciate 
that but you are out of time, you are out of luck''. Therefore, the 
CRTC was clearly under the impression that there was 
ministerial support for this the entire way through.
<P>
	On October 1, one month ago, the Prime Minister is made 
aware of the letter of support and exonerates the minister. How 
can anyone be exonerated for breaking guidelines so clearly, 
where this whole ministerial department is called into question? 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7623"> 7623 </A></B>
<P>
The Prime Minister takes no action. Funny. This was confirmed 
on October 28 by the Prime Minister when he stated in the House 
in reference to his exchange with the ``ethics counsellor'':  ``The 
answer that came from him did not lead me to change my mind 
about the decision that I had made earlier in the month''. I think 
it was October 1. We were still in the month of October. As if 
this was perfectly excusable.
<P>
	On October 26 ethics counsellor Howard Wilson is contacted 
not by the Prime Minister nor his officials, but by a Southam 
News reporter. He is made aware of the March 15 letter. The 
ethics counsellor does not launch an investigation into that. 
CBC breaks the story on Prime Time News later that evening.
<P>
	Sometime on the morning of October 27 the ethics counsellor 
Mr. Wilson is contacted by PMO staff regarding the minister. 
Does this smell like damage control, Mr. Speaker? You have 
seen damage control in your many, many years here. You saw it 
from within in fact and now you are seeing it perhaps from 
within again. The contents of that conversation remain 
confidential, but Mr. Wilson said that he was not asked to start 
an investigation. The details continue. Later on the morning of 
October 27 the minister stood up in this House claiming to have 
never seen the March 30 letter.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	All of us get a lot of correspondence in our offices, but if we 
do not see it and if we do not have competent staff to bring very 
important letters like that to our attention, then as the minister 
and the Prime Minister have said so clearly, we bear the 
responsibility for that.
<P>
	This minister should bear the responsibility for it. He has not. 
The Prime Minister has not and this is not the end of the story. 
He says of course that he ``took immediate corrective action''. 
From what we have heard in this House it would seem he was 
just acting as an MP, not as a minister, so he did not really need 
to take corrective action. However he took corrective action 
anyway because of what the Prime Minister said was a mistake. 
It was an error, so hey, go figure, as the high school students 
would say.
<P>
	In question period on October 27 at 2.24 p.m., the leader of 
my party said: ``There is a simple guideline that applies in these 
cases and it is a most elementary one''. Surely we could all 
understand elementary guidelines in this House. It is understood 
in most jurisdictions. That is that ministers do not communicate 
with quasi-judicial, regulatory bodies except in three ways: 
through statute; through orders in council; or through public 
formal submissions to that body. They do not communicate 
through telephone calls or casual conversations or casual letters.
<P>
	This is not proper. Mr. Speaker, you know it and I know it. I 
suspect all of us in this House know it. Perhaps it is time we 
admitted it.
<P>
	At 2.29 p.m. that day the Prime Minister stated in question 
period: ``I consulted the government's ethics counsellor and one 
I appointed for myself, and both confirmed that I had made the 
right decision in this matter''. At 2.49 p.m. the Prime Minister 
said: ``Mr. Speaker, the ethics counsellor has informed me that 
he is satisfied with the conclusion I have come to at this time''. 
The ethics counsellor knew nothing about this. I have spoken 
often about the phantom of the Ottawa. It seems to me he has 
been speaking to the Prime Minister during overtime.
<P>
	In question period on October 28, at 11.15 a.m. the Prime 
Minister said: ``I did not speak to Mr. Wilson myself, but I asked 
that he be consulted yesterday''. This contradicts the statement 
the Prime Minister said the day before. At 11.52 a.m. on October 
28 the Prime Minister said: ``In the case of quasi-judicial bodies 
that relate to the affairs of the government, the affairs of the 
members of Parliament and so on, the guidelines were not clear 
to my satisfaction. I have asked the Privy Council Office to 
prepare new guidelines in consultation with Mr. Wilson''.
<P>
	Sometime later on October 28 Mr. Wilson was approached by 
the PMO to look at existing guidelines for ministers. This was 
the first time Mr. Wilson received the confidential guidelines 
for ministers. Prior to this he had no knowledge of them 
whatsoever. It was October 28, getting very close to Halloween, 
the time of spooks and hobgoblins and all kinds of stories.
<P>
	On October 31, the very day of Halloween, in his statement to 
the House the Prime Minister stood up and attempted to clarify 
the role of ministers in regard to quasi-judicial bodies. 
Interestingly, while he revealed other ministers' letters to the 
CRTC, he did not account for his own action nor the minister's 
actions over the last seven months.
<P>
	During question period on Halloween, in full mask in 
response to the contradictory statements by the Prime Minister 
about the ethics counsellor, the member for Medicine Hat asked 
that the Prime Minister make the current ethics counsellor office 
independent and accountable to Parliament and not just the 
Prime Minister. Still during question period on Halloween at 
2.45 p.m. in response to the contradictory statements by the 
Prime Minister, he asked again that this be accountable to 
Parliament.
<P>
	Yesterday, November 2, in an interview with CBC 
Newsworld, Mr. Wilson admitted that he never undertook an 
investigation of the heritage minister affair. Can we look at a 
department that acts responsibly, that acts with integrity? 
Absolutely not.
<P>
	Let me close my remarks by saying this entire ministry, this 
entire department, this cabinet minister and all his officials, the 
Prime Minister and this entire government has been tainted by 
more than tuna fish. This department has been called into 
disrepute and we are disgusted by it.

	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this past weekend, Canadians of Greek origin commemorated a 
very important national holiday of their country of origin.
<P>
	On October 28, 1940 the Greeks said no, oxi, to the forces that 
sought to divide and conquer Europe. They chose to fight the

very pleased to tell this House about the national family literacy 
conference now being held in Ottawa, which is organized by the 
Movement for Canadian Literacy.
<P>
	Family literacy is a new approach which seeks to provide 
basic training and development services for adults who have to 
stay home with pre-school children. Besides meeting the 
specific literacy needs of adults, this new form of learning 
creates an environment that encourages children in the family to 
read and write.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc Quebecois are happy to support such 
initiatives and hope to see other projects to improve the basic 
training of a growing number of Canadians and Quebecers.

am proud to announce to the House that a woman from my 
constituency has been accorded a signal honour as one of only 
five distinguished Canadian women to receive the Governor 
General's Award in commemoration of the Persons Case.
<P>
Ms. Rose Charlie is a member of the Sto:lo and Chehalis bands. 
She has a record of 25 years of unstinting community service 
and advocacy.
<P>
	As a founding member of Indian Rights for Indian Women and 
the Indian Homemakers Association, Ms. Charlie was at the 
forefront in challenging the Indian Act that deprived First 
Nations women of their status when they married non-Indians.
<P>
	As a result, a federal legislative change was enacted in 1985 
that has enabled thousands of women and their children to 
regain their status as First Nations people.
<P>
	Rose Charlie never wavered in the pursuit of her cause. Not 
only is she an example of service and dedication to her people; 
she is testimony to the success that follows perseverance.

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Royal Canadian Legion was founded in 1925 to look after the 
veterans of World War I. The first ladies auxiliary was formed a 
year later. The first Remembrance Day was in 1931 when 50,000 
attended in Ottawa. This resulted in parliamentary recognition 
of Armistice Day. Today the legion has 600,000 members in 
1,800 communities.
<P>
	In Peterborough riding, legions in Havelock, Keene, 
Lakefield, Norwood, Peterborough and Warsaw, in addition to 
taking care of veterans affairs, donated tens of thousands of 
dollars to local charities this year alone. They supported 
disadvantaged children, minor hockey, Meals on Wheels, Civic 
and St. Joseph's hospitals, Easter Seals, the United Way, local 
churches, animals in distress, Terry Fox, homes for the aged, 
high school students, the lung association, Telecare and many

problem in Canada.

	What is being done about this problem and what should be 
done about it? For those youngsters in the school system today, 
which is within provincial jurisdiction, let us hope all education 
reviews stress the necessity to teach the basics.

	For those who have slipped through the cracks in the

you believed it was the right thing to do and not simply to get

Speaker, this is a normal process that is carried out a couple of 
times a year whereby in the reserves money is allocated for 
certain projects that have not yet been finalized and details have 
not yet been provided in the main estimates. They are then put 
into the estimates through a supplementary procedure which we 
went through yesterday and tabled in the House.
<P>

</B>Mr. Speaker, on June 25, 1993, the previous government 
implemented changes that abolished the Federal-Provincial 
Relations Office.

	When the new government came back, it obviously concluded 
that, considering the profile of the opposition, in particular, this 
was a problem that should be given all necessary attention, and 
that is what we did.
<P>
	Of the $5.9 million in the Supplementary Estimates, several 
hundred thousand dollars will be used to reduce overlap, which 
is exactly what the Government of Quebec and the opposition

In their attempt to have the supporting regulations changed, a

development of such drugs.

the altar of political expediency.
<P>

facts are clear. The Prime Minister knew of the heritage 
minister's letter fully a month ago and he did not contact the 
ethics counsellor, who only found out about it from the media 
last week.
<P>
	The Prime Minister had made up his mind before he contacted 
the ethics counsellor, who was not even asked for a ruling. These 
are the facts, not fiction.

	If this government wants to restore public confidence and

also wrong. This Prime Minister never denied that he actually 
called a judge. There was discrepancy about why he called. He 
admitted he had called a judge.

	This entire affair has been unbelievable and continues to be 
unbelievable. There is no denial of that.
<P>
	This government has placed politics before principle and its 
damage control spin doctors have spun out of control. This

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister in his 1995 immigration plan told this House and the 
Canadian people that the levels of family class immigrants 
would not increase but would remain stable at a level of 51 per 
cent of all immigrants. Does the minister still maintain that this 
is an accurate representation of the facts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we have said and 
confirmed in this plan is that the family class is very much a 
cornerstone within the immigration program. Not only in the 
family class category itself but the principle of family is 
protected in every other category. When we bring in an 
independent or a business class immigrant or a refugee they also 
have the legitimate right to bring in their families.
<P>
	We have also tried to seek a balance because there are four 
different categories in the immigration program. We want each 
category to have an appropriate market share of the overall 
program. It has been well received in the east, the west and 
central Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are talking about a plan and the numbers as the minister has 
released them to the Canadian people are somewhat deceptive.
<P>
	This minister has in effect created two separate and new 
classes of immigrants that did not exist last year. These classes 
were included in last year's family totals but have been 
conveniently shuffled off into another column. In fact the 
percentage of family class immigrants in 1995 is expected to be 
significantly higher than last year.
<P>
Why did the minister obscure and fudge the numbers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want to disappoint 
the hon. member but there is no fudging of the figures. The 
figures are very clear.
<P>
	We tabled four documents as part of the immigration plan, a 
10 year strategic framework, a document called ``Facts and 
Figures'' and a report of the entire consultation process of what 
Canadians said. In response to this the Reform Party of Canada 
put out a three paragraph position on immigration. On Monday

	While the Minister of Finance is saying that the country is 
practically on the verge of bankruptcy and that the time has 
come to cut government spending, the government tables 
supplementary estimates confirming over $2 billion in 
additional expenditures. At the same time, we learn that senior 
officials asked federal auditors in charge of the internal audit 
process to remember that their reports can be made public and to 
keep a low profile.
<P>

Leader of the Opposition who of course at one time was in 
government and knows how supplementary estimates work.
<P>
	There are not additional expenditure items. They were 
provided for in the reserves. There was not sufficient detail in 
accordance with the required procedures to place them into the 
main estimates at that point so it is fully understood they come 
under supplementary estimates.

the raising of refugee acceptance rates and threatened the career 
of those who do not meet an acceptance quota.

true that he was aware of the manipulations by the vice-chair 
long ago? Why did he not do anything about it before?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

question is no.
<P>
	I confirm that the chair of the Immigration and Refugee Board 
wrote to me yesterday suggesting that there would be reasons for 
conducting a fuller review. Yesterday I instructed our

write to the deputy vice-chair requesting his written comments

submitted by the sub-committee will be thoroughly examined. I 
want to reassure the hon. member and tell him that we will not 
take any measure that would jeopardize the safety of those who 
navigate on the St. Lawrence River or elsewhere.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
considering that the safety of navigation on the St. Lawrence 
River is not the responsibility of Americans, who have a real 
interest in cutting the costs of navigating in Canadian waters, 
how can the minister expect a binational agency to apply the 
same safety standards as the current pilotage authorities?

its very first priority the safety and security of Canadians and

Mr. Speaker, I would like to suggest to the hon. member that 
granted some young offenders cannot be rehabilitated, but most 
can. It is a very worthwhile exercise to seek the rehabilitation of 
young offenders because they are not going to serve their 
sentences forever. They are going to be back in society and it is 
in the interests of society that they be rehabilitated.

<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have

teddy bear as if the touch might keep her child alive.
<P>
	Canadians stand on these grounds to protest this 
government's refusal to admit mothers and fathers cry every day

	<I>Esprit de Corps</I> has in its writings been critical of certain 
aspects of sourcing of military equipment. Following this 
criticism a high ranking bureaucrat from industry, seconded to 
the Department of National Defence, is alleged to have 
suggested to advertisers that they should boycott advertising in 
the magazine <I>Esprit de Corps</I>.
<P>
	Will the minister launch an investigation to determine the 
scope of the involvement of personnel from the Department of 
Industry in attempting to destroy this Canadian publication?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there have 
been allegations of this nature made not only toward employees 
of the Department of Industry but also of the Department of 
National Defence.
<P>
	I have no evidence whatsoever that anyone in national 
defence or in the Department of Industry has made these kinds 
of threats. If the hon. member has names of individuals he could 
please give them to me or to the Minister of Industry because we 
cannot every day in the House of Commons have these 
innuendoes floating around and hurting institutions and 
government departments that carry on their job on a daily basis 
beyond reproach.

<P>
department to find out whether these allegations are true? That 
was my question.
<P>
	General Motors recently pulled its advertising from the 
magazine <I>Esprit de Corps</I>. The reason given for this decision is 
that its representative was getting bad vibes from the 
Department of National Defence. Would the minister of defence 
in concert with the Minister of Industry issue a directive that all 
personnel are to cease and that this kind of action would not be 
tolerated in any department of the Government of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can give the 
hon. member an assurance. If there are people doing this it will 
not be tolerated no matter what government department. Please 
come forward and give us the evidence before he makes the 
charges on the floor of the House of Commons.

	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister for International Trade. Today 
the Prime Minister leads Team Canada to China as an important 
strategy in our government's jobs and growth agenda.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister how he expects this mission to 
improve our international trade position and to improve the 
prospects for unemployed Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure all members of the House would 
join the hon. member for Oakville-Milton in wishing the Prime 
Minister well as he departs with his nine provincial colleagues 
and some 375 business people on the largest trade mission 
Canada has ever mounted.
<P>
	That mission in its scope and participation by all regions in 
Canada and by large and small corporations represents the 
culmination of the commitment this government has made,

Secretary of State for-

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister, who will appreciate 
that in an effort to manage the deficit and the debt, the 
government has been calling upon Canadians, UI recipients, 
students, farmers, fishers and many others to pay their fair 
share.
<P>
	She will also be aware that last week we heard the Royal Bank 
of Canada is expecting to see its profit margin in excess of $1 
billion this year. If she looks at the financial record she will find 
that in 1992 in spite of $63 million in profits the Royal Bank 
paid no income tax at all.
<P>
Last year in spite of $324 million in profits, the Royal Bank paid 
no income tax and also got a tax credit to apply for this year. Will 
the Deputy Prime Minister not admit that when a teller at the 
Royal Bank is actually paying more income tax than the entire 
Royal Bank of Canada there is something wrong with this 
picture?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this government 
has made serious efforts to increase fairness. We will make 
continued efforts to increase fairness.
<P>
	I would remind the hon. member that the large corporation tax 
in Canada applies to the banks. The corporate income tax applies 
to them. They pay a capital tax in addition to that, which is not 
part of the income tax but is separate from the income tax.
<P>
<B>(1500) </B>
<P>
	I might add that banks and all other financial institutions are 
expected, when they make profits the size they are this year, to 
pay their fair share of taxes which will go toward decreasing our 
fiscal deficit. That will be an important part of it.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFCANADIANHERITAGEACT">DEPARTMENT OF CANADIAN HERITAGE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-53, an act to establish the Department of Canadian Heritage 
and to amend and repeal certain other acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the heritage of our country traces its roots to our First 
Nations peoples and thereafter to the French and English people 
who came as the earliest settlers and, even later thereafter, to 
peoples from all over the world who chose to immigrate and 
make Canada their home.
<P>
	I am therefore pleased to stand in the House today to speak 
about Bill C-53, the Department of Canadian Heritage Act. The 
objective of the bill is designed to give legal status to the 
amalgamation of five predecessor organizations, namely the 
Secretary of State, the Department of Multiculturalism and 
Citizenship, the Department of Fitness and Amateur Sport, the 
Parks Canada component of Environment Canada, and the 
cultural broadcasting and heritage components of the 
Department of Communications.
<P>
	This extensive reorganization reflects the government's 
commitment to more efficient and effective government. Under 
the new structure, one department with one minister and one 
deputy minister is given responsibility for delivering an 
important mandate. The Department of Canadian Heritage is a 
blend of the various elements that define us as a diverse and 
vibrant nation with a rich and abundant cultural and natural 
heritage.
<P>
	The department's activities are the product of its broad range 
of responsibilities in the fields of cultural development, arts, 
broadcasting, national parks, historic sites, amateur sport and 
multiculturalism. The department also administers official 
languages, Canadian studies, and state ceremonial and native 
programs, all of which contribute in a very significant way to 
our sense of Canadian identity and pride.
<P>
	As international barriers disappear and evolving technology 
stretches the world's boundaries, the development of our 
identity as a nation becomes increasingly vital to our country's 
prosperity and élan vital. It is only natural that the federal 
government would have an instrument such as the Department 
of Canadian Heritage to enable it to continue promoting 
development and a sense of Canadian identity.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	The department has three principal areas of responsibility. 
Through Parks Canada, the department is the chief custodian of 
the natural and physical heritage found in our national parks, 
national historic sites and historic canals. Parks Canada 
commemorates, protects  and presents both directly and 
indirectly places of significance to Canada's cultural and natural 
heritage in ways that encourage public understanding, 
appreciation and enjoyment.
<P>
	The economic activity and tourism generated by the 
department's operations are of significance to many local 
economies not only in Canada but throughout the world. The 
parks service has been at the forefront of efforts for innovative 
partnership arrangements with private and not for profit 
enterprises in carrying out its mandated responsibilities.
<P>
	Another principal area of the department's activities involves 
the enhancement of cultural development through policies and 
programs to support our cultural industries and our national 
cultural and heritage institutions such as the Canada Council, 
the National Gallery, the National Arts Centre and the National 
Archives, to name but a few.
<P>
	In the area of arts and broadcasting, the Department of 
Canadian Heritage recognizes the importance of new 
technologies and is working to ensure that the impact of the 
information highway on Canadian artists will be a positive one.
<P>
	Through the citizenship and Canadian identity sector of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage the government devotes many 
of its efforts to promoting a greater understanding of our 
diversity, to increasing the involvement of all citizens in 
Canadian society and to promoting our two official languages.
<P>
	Canada's linguistic duality is deeply rooted in our country's 
very nature. Official language policies introduced by the federal 
government in the early 1970s reflect a generous and creative 
vision. The Department of Canadian Heritage has the unique 
responsibility of ensuring that English speaking and French 
speaking Canadians, irrespective of ethnocultural origins, feel 
at home wherever they choose to live in Canada.
<P>
	This department places a key role in the enhancement and 
development of English and French linguistic minority 
communities; respect for Canada's two official languages, 
together with respect for the traditions and contributions of our 
First Nations people; respect for our cultural diversity; and 
respect for basic human rights, making Canada a unique country 
and one of the most highly regarded and respected in the world.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage greatly affects all 
Canadians economically, socially and culturally. The economic 
activity and tourism generated by the department's operations 
are of great importance to many local economies.
<P>
	The policies and programs of the department are aimed at 
fostering greater awareness of our cultural and natural riches. 
These are heavy responsibilities but the department is up to the 
task. It is apparent to me that the mission of Canadian Heritage 
is closely linked to the major issues facing our nation today. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7637"> 7637 </A></B>
<P>
department has  a full agenda and its mission extends into many 
sectors of Canadian society.
<P>
	Clearly the Department of Canadian Heritage has a key role to 
play and, with the legislation in place, will be able to forge 
ahead to meet the challenges of the 21st century and the future 
beyond.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
out of great concern for the promotion and preservation of 
Quebec culture that I participate today in this debate on Bill 
C-53 to establish the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	It is unthinkable, in my view, that a department be established 
to promote, as indicated in clause 4, Canadian culture and 
heritage. Once again, the federal government is proving to the 
people of Quebec that it does not understand the first thing about 
Quebec culture. How indeed can one seriously claim that there is 
such a thing as a Canadian culture? Perhaps government 
members should be reminded that the French language is alive 
and commonly used in Quebec and in many regions of Canada in 
spite of sustained efforts on the part of the federal government to 
trivialize the spoilsports it views francophones as.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	Not only is Quebec culture alive and well in Quebec but it also 
radiates worldwide. Just think of the success of Quebec talent 
abroad. French Canadians are also successful abroad. Such a 
vibrant cultural environment can legitimately claim and gain 
complete independence at the cultural level. On that subject, the 
former Liberal culture minister in Quebec rightly indicated that 
she intended to reaffirm the need for Quebec to assume control 
over cultural matters on its territory. Culture is of paramount 
importance to Quebec; therefore, it is important that the 
government of Quebec be recognized the exclusive powers 
required to discharge its responsibilities.
<P>
	As you can see, there is nothing new or partisan about us, 
Quebecers, wanting to manage our cultural matters ourselves. 
History and the evolution of Quebec over the years show this 
deep-seated will of dealing with Quebec culture, and to do so 
from Quebec. Let us look for example at the demands made by 
Premiers Johnson and Bertrand in the 1960s, Bourassa and 
Lévesque in the 1970s and 1980s, who despite their many 
differences of opinion all demanded that Quebec's cultural 
affairs be administered by Quebec.
<P>
	In addition to promoting Canadian culture, Bill C-53 shows 
an intention of managing this so-called culture. I think that this 
bill amounts to an outright refusal to recognize Quebec's 
distinctiveness.
<P>
Let us now look at constitutional responsibilities in cultural 
matters. Section 92(16) of the 1867 Constitution Act recognizes 
provincial jurisdiction over all matters of a merely local or 
private nature. Is Quebec culture not a local or private matter?
<P>
	Furthermore, the 1867 act gives the provinces jurisdiction 
over the administration of justice in civil matters, which is, as 
my colleague from Rimouski-Témiscouata so eloquently said, 
a fundamental characteristic of our distinct society.
<P>
	Since provincial jurisdiction over education is closely linked 
to culture, it would be ridiculous and even totally inconsistent to 
deal with them separately. This demonstration clearly shows 
that the provinces have exclusive jurisdiction over the whole 
area of culture.
<P>
	Quebec is fed up with the federal government's meddling in 
provincial matters! Justifying cultural interference by invoking 
the existence of a single Canadian culture is taking comedy, 
which is turning into drama, a little too far. It also ignores the 
history of the two founding nations, need I remind you.
<P>
	Let us look for a few moments at your definition of nation. 
Since when is Canada a single nation? We live in a country that 
was created from scratch. Are you denying the existence of one 
of the founding nations of this country you are supposedly so 
proud of? Have you forgotten that there is a large francophone 
community in your great country and that they are in the 
majority in Quebec?
<P>
	True, your daily actions show how little interest you have in 
issues affecting francophones. We only have to think about 
Kingston, Long Lac, the military college in Saint-Jean. But is 
flatly denying the very existence of a francophone culture in 
Canada not going a little too far?
<P>
	It would be extremely dangerous to leave the administration 
of Quebec culture in the hands of a federal minister like the one 
now in place, working with a law which does not even recognize 
the existence of Quebec's distinct culture. Especially since the 
federal government was never too keen on investing as much 
money in francophone culture as in anglophone culture.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Take the example of the French and English networks of the 
CBC. The difference in the funding of these two is growing all 
the time; in April, the difference in the programming budget was 
$76.4 million. At the same time, we learned that the two 
networks had about the same size of audience.
<P>
	We cannot fail to mention the many instances of duplication 
and overlap in the cultural field. Almost every federal cultural 
institution has a counterpart in Quebec. For example, there are 
Radio-Canada and Radio-Québec, the Canada Council and the 
Conseil des arts et lettres du Québec, the National Archives of 
Canada and the Quebec archives, to name only these.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7638"> 7638 </A></B>
<P>
	Many hundreds of thousands of dollars are wasted every year 
with such unnecessary duplication and overlap. Can we afford 
it? Everyone knows that we cannot. Is it really asking too much 
to want to administer one's own culture? For too long, the 
federal government has shown its intention to assimilate and 
wipe out Quebec culture. The people of Quebec have enough of 
being laughed at for wanting to have all they need to develop and 
preserve their cultural identity.
<P>
	Fortunately, Quebecers have understood that negotiations 
with the federal government lead nowhere and they will show 
that by expressing their desire to become a sovereign people. 
That is the only way to ensure our survival in America. Until that 
day, as the representatives here in Ottawa of most Quebec 
voters, we will strive to have the existence of this francophone 
culture recognized, for it shall never cease to exist.
<P>
	Francophones pay taxes like all other citizens and as such they 
are entitled to all the benefits that anglophones have in this 
country and to the historical recognition that is their due. 
Finally, as Malraux said, culture is not inherited-it is won.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on the bill to establish the 
Department of Canadian Heritage. French-speaking 
communities outside Quebec have long relied on the federal 
government to protect their rights and promote their 
development.
<P>
	And the federal government has always responded with 
concrete and helpful measures for minority groups. In the early 
seventies, it set up programs to support French-speaking 
communities outside Quebec. These programs reflect an open 
and creative vision which allows French-speaking minority 
groups to thrive and fully contribute to the economic, social, 
cultural and scientific life of our country.
<P>
	Since then, these programs have evolved according to the 
needs of communities and they have played an important role in 
their development. One of these initiatives is the Official 
Languages Act, which was originally passed 25 years ago and 
improved in 1988. There is also section 23 of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees French 
linguistic minorities the right to receive school instruction in 
their first language as well as the right to manage their schools, 
where the numbers warrant it.
<P>
	So, the government of Canada, which happened to be a 
Liberal government, first created a legal framework to promote 
the development of French and English linguistic minority 
groups, and to promote the official languages in our country. It 
also created a constitutional framework which guarantees to the 
two linguistic communities the right to delivery of services in 
the official language of their choice. Whether it is delivery of 
services in both official languages or the right to education in 
the minority language, these initiatives helped make 
tremendous progress.
<P>
As regards the management of schools by French-speaking 
communities, the federal government supported every cause 
related to clarifying that right. The Court Challenges Program 
set up by the federal government was an invaluable tool for 
French-speaking minorities in the fight for the recognition of 
their rights. By the way, that program will soon be reinstated.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	After the 1990 Supreme Court decision on the Mahé case, the 
federal government lent its support to every province to ensure a 
quick implementation of that judgment everywhere in Canada. 
In May 1993, the federal government announced measures to 
fund part of the implementation costs of a school management 
system in every province where such a system had not yet been 
set up.
<P>
	Today, thanks to federal government support, 
French-speaking minorities can manage their schools almost 
everywhere in the country. I am convinced it is only a matter of 
time before all francophones in this country will be able to 
manage their own schools. I may add that this is already the case 
in my own riding.
<P>
	The federal government is also present in other areas that are 
of primary importance to these communities, including the 
economy, human resources development and culture, to name 
only a few. The Department of Canadian Heritage is not the only 
federal institution that can play a decisive role in priority areas 
but is responsible for co-ordinating the implementation by 
departments and federal agencies of the federal government's 
commitment to the growth and development of official language 
minority communities.
<P>
	These provisions of the Official Languages Act were not acted 
upon by the previous government. Last summer, cabinet 
members agreed to consider the specific needs of official 
language communities when implementing the policies and 
programs of their respective departments.
<P>
	A number of specific projects have now been finalized: The 
La Picasse Community Centre Project in Petit-de-Grat, Nova 
Scotia; the new school of electrical engineering at the 
University of Moncton; a human resources adjustment 
committee for Canadian francophones; an economic 
development plan for bilingual municipalities in Manitoba; and 
the construction of a francophone community centre in 
Edmonton.
<P>
	That is how this government supports the growth and 
development of Canada's anglophone and francophone minority 
communities. The departments each have their own mandate but 
all work together towards a common goal: ensuring that official 
language communities can reach their full potential in all areas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7639"> 7639 </A></B>
<P>
	The communities themselves agree this is a remarkable 
achievement that will have a clear impact on the development of 
minority official language communities.
<P>
	The Canadian government and the communities had 
established a good working relationship over the years, but since 
the seventies, the world has changed dramatically. Economic 
imperatives and new cultural, social and linguistic priorities 
that are developing today have made it necessary to restructure 
the federal government's approach, in order to make its support 
programs for these communities more effective.
<P>
	Thanks to the current exercise in repositioning at the 
Department of Canadian Heritage, communities will be able to 
take an active part in setting priorities and thus target the main 
areas where action is needed.
<P>
	Official language communities are a vital force in Canadian 
society, not only because of their numbers but also and above all 
because of their extraordinary vitality and energy.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has always greatly contributed to 
their cultural development through cultural co-operation 
agreements with the provincial governments, direct assistance 
to cultural institutions, through the federal Cultural Initiatives 
Program and various other support measures and instruments 
which I mentioned in my speech.
<P>
	Some people claim that the federal government does not do 
enough for francophone minorities outside Quebec. We should 
realize that despite the current financial squeeze, the federal 
government has maintained the special budgets that enable 
francophones to manage their own schools and have better 
access to post-secondary education.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, pursuant to the inter-departmental initiative 
announced last summer, all federal institutions will from now on 
be involved in the development of francophone and anglophone 
minority communities, in the spirit of the Official Languages 
Act.
<P>
	It is important to see where the real needs are and where real 
progress can be achieved in developing Canada's francophone 
communities. The federal government is committed to meeting 
the specific needs of these communities because it wants to 
develop this country's full potential. We are firmly committed 
to pursuing that goal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am both proud and sad to address this bill at this time. 
What has happened within the last 10 days or so has given me 
concern about what is happening to the heritage of Canadians.
<P>
I am a proud Canadian. My parents are proud Canadians. My 
parents came to this country as children. My father met my 
mother when they were teenagers in southern Alberta. They 
were married and raised a family during the depression. They 
have told me many, many stories about what happened in this 
country. My grandparents told me of some things that happened 
in other countries. They talked about heritage and culture. They 
told us about our culture, about our parents and our background. 
I am proud of both of those heritages, but the one I really 
understand and the one I am a part of is the Canadian heritage.
<P>
	One thing I want Canadians to be known for is their integrity, 
their honesty and their fairness and treatment of each other with 
justice. I am not that young any more, but my children are 
young. It seems to me that we as seniors in this country of ours 
need to present an example to the upcoming generation.
<P>
	The real heritage we have as Canadians is our children for 
whom we are building this country. I ask myself and I ask this 
House, what kind of legacy are we leaving to our children when 
they see the kinds of things that have happened in this House 
over the last 10 days?
<P>
	There have been allegations and almost accusations and 
statements made against and about the leader of our country and 
one of his key ministers. We have to ask ourselves: Is this the 
kind of thing we want our children to emulate? Do we want our 
children to think that the Prime Minister would defend a 
minister of the crown who would intercede or take action that 
could be interpreted as interceding on behalf of someone so that 
unfair or special advantage is given to one person over another? 
We do not want that.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has said: ``The buck stops here''. I admire 
him for saying that. It is responsible of him to say: ``I am 
accountable. I am responsible for the things that happen in my 
government'', which includes every minister on the front bench 
and all the parliamentarians he leads.
<P>
	But he is a leader beyond that. He is our Prime Minister. He is 
my Prime Minister. Even though I am not a member of his party 
he is still my Prime Minister. I want to be able to respect him. I 
want to look to him for leadership, as an example of the kinds of 
things that ought to be happening not only in this House but in 
this whole country. That is what we are looking for.
<P>
	Generally the position has been clear. The Prime Minister has 
indicated that he is a man of the people. He listens and he tries to 
do what is best. But there is now a question. Did he do what was 
best in this particular instance? The record is clear. I am not 
going to review the record now. But I ask the Prime Minister, the 
minister and every parliamentarian here, including myself: Is 
this the kind of behaviour we want our children to emulate when 
they become this country's parliamentarians?
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7640"> 7640 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	I am not proud. I do not think I could say yes to that question. I 
think I would have to answer no. I want my children and those 
who will follow us to have another example, a standard which 
says we will not interfere in the administration of justice. We 
will not interfere in a quasi-judicial body to get it to make a 
decision that is different from the one that is apparently 
independent and considers all the facts before a decision is 
made. That is what I want.
<P>
	I think there is a position here that can be salvaged but let us 
make clear that what ought to be said is said and that where a 
mistake has been made let the appropriate action be taken.
<P>
	At this time the Prime Minister must take action. He has 
decided not to. That is a decision. It is his opportunity to do that 
but I would encourage him to take at least some action. We are in 
a crisis situation and if we ever needed integrity in leadership it 
is today.
<P>
	Next year in 1995 this country will be faced with a major 
refinancing. A major amount of money is going to have to be 
borrowed in the world market. The question I want to ask is this: 
Will the lenders that loaned us money before continue to lend us 
money if they have any question as to whether we will do what 
we said we would do? We need confidence in the financial 
management of this country. We need to know that the Minister 
of Finance and the Prime Minister are serious about getting this 
budget under control and balancing the budget.
<P>
	Beyond that, we need something else and that is justice. This 
morning, in fact I am wearing the button which says ``Justice for 
Joshua'', right beside me was a group of high school students 
that said ``No, not just for Joshua, for all of us''. That is exactly 
what we want. We want justice for every person, young persons, 
middle aged persons, seniors, every person in Canada. We want 
justice for them, we want fairness for them and we want them to 
live in a way that they are treated equally as individuals and as 
provinces.
<P>
	That is the heritage we want. That is the heritage we can have. 
It is we together as a group, and as individuals, as the 
opposition, who will fight for that. We will build a country that 
we can be indeed proud of and we can then say to our children: 
``Follow our example. It is a good one''.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this opportunity that I have to address the House today 
is particularly important for me because of the nature of the 
debate. When we talk about culture, we are really talking about 
the very heart and soul of a nation. Therefore, allow me to speak 
with strong emotion.
<P>
The purpose of Bill C-53 is to establish the Department of 
Canadian Heritage and to unite under one authority all the policy 
instruments Ottawa has in the cultural area: the Canada Council, 
the National Film Board, Telefilm Canada, museums and 
national parks and the National Archives of Canada.
<P>
	The annual budget of this department would be approximately 
$2.8 billion.
<P>
	The main objective of this new super-department is to 
support and promote the canadian cultural policy. This is 
enough to get all the citizens of Quebec and the one million 
francophones outside Quebec seriously worried.
<P>
	Even if in the past the cultural development policy was not so 
well orchestrated, we could yet see clearly that it was in 
Ottawa's interest rather than that of the francophones all over 
the country.
<P>
	On the strength of the British North America Act and, hence, 
of the residual powers entrusted to him, and encroaching upon 
some provincial jurisdictions, education for example, the 
federal government is about to control more closely than ever 
what we call Canadian culture.
<P>
	The desire to take over one of the more essential aspects of 
our lives is not new. This is nothing but the logical and perfect 
continuation of actions taken since the first Communications 
Act of 1932 by which the federal government gave itself 
exclusive jurisdiction in the area of communications. The 
events that followed confirmed its exclusive jurisdiction in 
other areas. This is why the CRTC can declare unilaterally what 
is good for the provinces, including the only francophone 
province in this country.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Using its powers to expand its responsibilities and possibly 
create a new area of activity, Ottawa developed over the years a 
policy, the bilingualism and multiculturalism policy, based on a 
central theme.
<P>
	We can understand that some of our English-speaking fellow 
citizens had a hard time finding their own identity, but common 
sense should never have allowed the creation of such a 
two-headed monster. For humane considerations, my 
grandfather used to kill two-headed calves at birth. In Ottawa, 
they are considered as precious as the Golden calf.
<P>
	Between you and me, Mr. Speaker, where is the cultural 
difference between Canada and the United States, except for 
Quebec, of course? Compared to our southern neighbour, 
Canada is nothing more than a society without any significant 
distinctive traits. Is there really a Canadian culture or is it 
merely the creation of a political administration with an 
over-productive mind? Have we been the victims of too wide or 
too narrow designs? The future will soon tell us, since Quebec 
will shortly be an external observer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7641"> 7641 </A></B>
<P>
	However, for the time being, six million francophones have to 
adapt to this federal creature that many find disturbing. Beyond 
worn-out official statements and pious wishes, what did 
Canada's cultural policy give the French-speaking minority of 
this country?
<P>
	Our culture distinguishes us from other Canadians; how has 
this policy contributed to reinforce our own identity? The 
question begs the answer. This policy did not contribute a thing 
to our cultural development. What is worse, it actually had a 
destabilizing effect, limiting the growth and creative potential 
of its most distinctive and dynamic aspect. Even then it would 
have to be recognized as such-this is what happens when you 
have a policy the rationale of which has no bearing on Canadian 
reality.
<P>
	Praise it as you may, claim all you want that it is likely to meet 
the legitimate aspirations of Quebecers and other francophones 
coast to coast, it does not even manage to impose respect for the 
most basic element of our identity: the French language. Reports 
unanimously show hatred for the use of French, coast to coast. Is 
it two languages on equal footing or one language stomped on 
with both feet? In what way did passage of the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms benefit francophone communities?
<P>
	One of its main achievements is the following: Alberta, 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, NewFoundland and 
Prince Edward Island have yet to approve a single bill to give 
effect to plans for French language school management. They 
examine, they ponder, they hem and haw, as we would say. But 
so far, no concrete steps have been taken to support these 
communities who wish to manage their own schools.
<P>
	Does it come as a surprise that 127 years after the birth of 
Confederation and 25 years after the passage of the Official 
Languages Act, the commissioner responsible for ensuring that 
the linguistic rights of minorities are respected, Mr. Victor 
Goldbloom, cannot get over the ignorance of the anglophone 
majority, that goes about completely oblivious of the existence 
of the francophone minority?
<P>
	Mr. Goldbloom talks about ignorance when he should be 
talking about hostility in the case of the 65 Ontario 
municipalities which declared themselves officially unilingual 
English, although no law forces them to provide services in 
French. The Prime Minister of Canada said that his Canada 
included the 1 million francophones living outside Quebec. He 
must live in a great country full of respect and dignity. He should 
try living like little Jean Bilodeau or Jean Leblanc.
<P>
	In your opinion, Mr. Speaker, should we trust these people 
who are unable to face up to reality? Do you think that our 
culture is safe in their hands? Who are these people who, 
through the Department of Canadian Heritage, want to define 
our culture and therefore a large part of our lives? Who would 
benefit from having a say on the way we live, think and entertain 
ourselves? What would they like to see in our culture?
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	What about those who recently refused to recognize us as a 
distinct society? Those who, under the pretext of efficient 
budget management, merrily slash the amounts allocated to 
Radio-Canada, which is already unfairly treated compared with 
the CBC.
<P>
	There are also those who make it a point of honour, if not a 
duty, to duplicate the cultural institutions of the Quebec 
government. We will face those who are against any dialogue, 
any sharing of responsibilities, any co-operation despite 
Quebec's repeated calls for joint action.
<P>
	We should blindly leave essential elements of our collective 
future in the hands of these people, when all their actions seem 
designed to neutralize the efforts of another level of 
government.
<P>
	Thanks, but no thanks. I, for one, do not trust the supporters of 
this power, who are now striving to formalize a policy that never 
was and never will be consistent with our interests and 
aspirations.
<P>
	Even Liza Frulla, the former Quebec Liberal minister-who 
is not a sovereignist-admitted that Ottawa is creating overlap 
and duplication by interfering in Quebec's cultural affairs.
<P>
	This government, with its centralizing federalism, knows full 
well that whoever controls the means of expression of a culture 
also controls its vitality, energy and creative power. Let us not 
give Ottawa the privilege of imposing its ideal cultural order.
<P>
	It has long been proven that no one is in a better position than 
the Government of Quebec to develop a cultural policy based on 
the real needs of its people.
<P>
	Until Quebec has acquired its full political sovereignty, 
others will decide what should go into our creative endeavours. 
The Bloc Quebecois, which is waging a continual struggle for 
the integrity of Quebec culture, cannot support Bill C-53, which 
is contrary to the legitimate intentions of the Quebec 
government in this field.
<P>
	By creating this Department of Canadian Heritage, Ottawa is 
proving that it clearly intends to keep and even increase its 
ability to act in this sector which is crucial for the development 
of Quebec's cultural identity.
<P>
	In this country, where francophones start to be assimilated 
from infancy, I feel nothing positive about creating a 
Department of Canadian Heritage. It is simply an expression of 
the federal government's harmful centralizing designs on 
Quebec.
<P>
	Therefore, Mr. Speaker, you will understand that I 
wholeheartedly support the amendment moved by the Bloc 
Quebecois member for Rimouski-Témiscouata.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to have just a couple of minutes this 
afternoon to discuss the bill in front of us dealing with the 
Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	I am the critic for aboriginal affairs for the New Democratic 
Party. In that capacity I have had a number of dealings with the 
Department of Canadian Heritage. The department inherited a 
number of the programs from the former secretary of state which 
dealt with aboriginal people, their programs and activities.
<P>
	One of the programs that the department has inherited that has 
bothered me in its response for some time has been a program 
dealing with aboriginal education. I wanted to take the 
opportunity here, with the minister in the Chamber and the 
debate on this bill, to bring to members of this House and to the 
minister's attention some correspondence which I received in 
recent months concerning the treatment of aboriginal people by 
the department. When government asks members of Parliament 
for approval to do anything with relation to the department I 
think it is important that we understand some of the ways in 
which the department has responded to us in the past.
<P>
	I have in front of me a two paragraph letter, in fact the 
paragraphs are reasonably lengthy, addressed to me from the 
president of the Saskatchewan Indian Cultural College.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to read the two paragraphs. The president of the 
Saskatchewan Indian Cultural Centre is Linda Pelly-Landrie. 
She writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations and its affiliate institutions, 
Saskatchewan Indian Cultural Centre, Saskatchewan Indian Federated College 
and Saskatchewan Indian Institute of Technology have been actively seeking 
the financial resources required to develop curriculum for our First Nations. 
While various government departments have acknowledged that First Nations 
instructional and resource materials are essential to the retention and 
achievement of First Nations students, all contend that they are not adequately 
resourced and cannot finance our projects. Yet, the Department of Canadian 
Heritage has offered $500,000 to Mondia Editeurs and an affiliate, Micro Intel, 
two non-aboriginal firms out of Montreal, a contract to develop CD-ROM 
curriculum materials pertaining to the aboriginal peoples of Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Enclosed please find correspondence relating to the project proposed by the 
Department of Canadian Heritage. We ask that you review this material carefully 
and intervene on our behalf. Not only is offering a contract of this nature to 
non-aboriginal firms contrary to the government's commitment to the First Nation's 
inherent right to self-government, it is an insult. Adding to the insult is the 
demeaning and paternalistic manner in which the Department of Canadian Heritage 
has dealt with First Nations representatives on the project. We are the experts in 
determining First Nations curriculum content and the most capable of managing and 
controlling a project of this nature. Furthermore, we have demonstrated expertise in 
developing and producing quality instructional materials. Therefore, it is our  
contention that this project should be contracted and controlled by a First Nations 
institution organization.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I want to quote from a couple of paragraphs of a letter that Ms. 
Pelly-Landrie wrote to the hon. Minister of Canadian Heritage 
earlier this year on the same project. In the letter she indicates 
that the cultural centre had met earlier in the year with the 
minister of Indian affairs with a proposal for resources to 
develop curriculum programs for First Nations people. They 
were informed that the financial resources were extremely 
limited and that their project request could not be met.
<P>
	She goes on in her letter to the minister to indicate that the 
awarding of the contract for half a million dollars to the 
non-aboriginal group in Montreal is most objectionable:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Projects of this nature should be awarded to aboriginal people to promote the 
principles of Indian self-government and to encourage true partnerships 
between the federal government and First Nations governments.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe that First Nations have contributed significant changes to 
education. Indian control of Indian education is a principle to which all First 
Nations continue to strive for, as the ultimate goal to educational change, and 
improvement. The federal government must also be respectful of our 
commitment to develop and implement education for our people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I trust that you will take immediate action to review this proposed project, 
and that measures will be taken in the future for the full involvement of 
aboriginal people to determine the development and implementation of such 
projects.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These letters seem to have been ignored by the minister and 
the department. The project was awarded to the non-aboriginal 
firms.
<P>
	At the same time as Ms. Pelly-Landrie's letters were being 
circulated, another letter in support of the Saskatchewan centre 
has been drafted and sent to the minister from the Federation of 
Saskatchewan Indian Nations, the Indian governments of 
Saskatchewan, signed by vice chief E. Dutch Lerat of 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	The letter deals with this particular CD-ROM project and the 
treatment received by the aboriginal community on its request:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The First Nations of Canada have political and institutional structures which 
represent them on all matters of intergovernmental nature.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The First Nations are nationally represented in all such matters as languages, 
curriculum and cultural heritage by the First Nations Cultural Centres 
Executive Council (FNCCEC) of the Assembly of First Nations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Your Department, over the strenuous objections of the First Nations of 
Canada, has recently awarded a contract for Aboriginal Curriculum 
Development to a non-Indian Business-Mondia Editeurs of Montreal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7643"> 7643 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The project involves a computerized Aboriginal Curriculum Project referred 
to as CD-ROM.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The First Nations have been invited to participate on a sub-contractual basis 
for a minuscule portion of the contract, although this is not the real issue I wish 
to raise.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the pre-election Liberal Party Aboriginal Platform announced by the 
Prime Minister on October 8, 1993, your Government made a number of 
important commitments.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Two of those commitments are directly applicable to this issue:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``A Liberal Government, with the participation of Aboriginal Peoples, will 
establish an Aboriginal Educational Institute and networking facility that will 
co-ordinate and build upon initiatives in Aboriginal Curriculum Development 
for Aboriginal and Non-Aboriginal Schools, Standards, Development, 
Distance Education, Aboriginal Languages, Teacher Orientation and the 
Special Needs of Many Communities such as Literacy, Adult Basic Education 
and Special Education''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``The Liberal Platform on Aboriginal Economic Development includes 
measures such as procurement policies that stimulate the growth of Aboriginal 
Businesses''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	An example given with respect to this policy goes on to state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``A fixed percentage of Federal contracts be allocated to competent 
Aboriginal Government and Businesses''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I must seriously challenge your commitment to the Red Book Policies in 
light of the way in which your Department has handled this matter. The entire 
integrity of your Aboriginal platform is seriously called into question.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A key point of contention surrounding this contract is that your officials 
have ignored the competency of existing First Nations Institutions and 
Businesses-for example, the Saskatchewan Indian Cultural Centre, an 
accredited member of the Saskatchewan Book Publishing Association and, in 
fact, the current Chairman of the Association is a staff member from our 
Cultural Centre.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>First Nations must be given first consideration in all matters related to 
Aboriginal Curriculum and Cultural Projects including the application of 
Technology such as that represented by the CD-ROM project.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In conclusion, I read from the the concluding paragraphs of 
the letter sent to the minister earlier this year:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The question now that arises, then is, how can there be money for a non-First 
Nations organization to develop First Nation's curriculum when there is none 
for our First Nations?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think it is very important in our consideration of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage that we examine carefully the 
ways in which the department and the ministry are treating the 
people of aboriginal descent in our country and respect the 
wishes of the aboriginal community in developing a strong 
aboriginal curriculum that meets its needs as brought to the 
minister by the community.
<P>
	I believe this is an important matter that requires the attention 
of all members and I thank the House for its time this afternoon.

	The House resumed from November 1 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-55, an act to establish a board having 
jurisdiction concerning disputes respecting surface rights in 
respect of land in the Yukon Territory and to amend other acts in 
relation thereto, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to address Bill C-55, the Yukon Surface 
Rights Board Act. This bill is essentially a matter of legislative 
housekeeping and as such contains little of substance to either 
support or oppose.
<P>
	However, I would like to take some time to address some of 
the bill's shortcomings and even its positive attributes.
<P>
	As everyone in the House well knows, this bill is the 
companion legislation to Bills C-33 and C-34, two bills which 
the Reform Party strongly opposed. Our detailed reasons for the 
opposition to those bills are well documented from debates at 
the committee level and in the House so I will not revisit those 
arguments.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	However I would like to renew our opposition to the way the 
government first conceived and then rammed those bills through 
the House. In case anyone has forgotten, Bill C-33 and Bill 
C-34 were negotiated over a period of some 20 years, a period of 
closed door meetings and backroom deals typical of our old 
governments and old political parties.
<P>
	To make matters worse, the government then stifled debate in 
the month of June in the House by evoking time allocation. This 
entire process was wrong, indeed shameful. It was wrong for the 
government not to include Canadians and interested third 
parties in the negotiations. It was wrong for the government to 
proceed with debate just 24 hours after the voluminous bills 
were first tabled in the House. It was shameful for the 
government to limit debate on such crucial pieces of legislation.
<P>
	Unfortunately this type of action appears to be the rule rather 
than the exception when it comes to legislation affecting native 
or aboriginal land claims settlements.
<P>
	Just over a year ago, in June 1993, another shameful 
government with the concurrence of the Liberals and the NDP in 
opposition took the very same tack with Bill C-133. They 
passed that bill in one day in the House. There was only one 
member of the House who stood to speak against it. That bill 
resulted in the creation of Nunavut, a new territory 
encompassing one-fifth of the Canadian land mass. With 
one-fifth of Canada at stake because of Bill C-133 the House, 
with the concurrence of all political parties, took one day to pass 
it. There was no debate and no public input. That is a shame.
<P>
The Reform Party agrees with the need to correct past injustices 
and to treat aboriginals with the same respect and dignity 
afforded to all other Canadians, but we do not agree with the 
means chosen to accomplish this end.
<P>
	I said at the start of my address that I would also touch on 
some of the positive aspects of the bill. They are few and far 
between, but I have found at least one such example. To its credit 
the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has 
in fact consulted with the mining industry on Bill C-55. I know 
this because our critic in this area has also consulted with many 
interests with regard to the legislation.
<P>
	Through our discussions it was learned that changes to the bill 
were made at several stages based on input from the mining 
industry. That is good news. It is indeed encouraging, especially 
given the rough ride the mining industry has received in recent 
times from all levels of government.
<P>
	I might also add that I hope this spirit of co-operation will 
continue into the future and expand beyond the borders of Yukon 
to my own province of British Columbia where the interests of 
the mining industry have been forced to take a back seat to every 
lobby group with an axe to grind.
<P>
	At any rate I commend the government for its consultative 
approach. However I also know that the mining industry is not 
entirely happy with the legislation in Bill C-55 or with its 
companion Bills C-33 and C-34.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	While all these pieces of legislation are far from perfect, the 
uncertainty is over, an uncertainty which has stifled investment 
in Yukon for more than 20 years. At least the legislation defines 
the playing field and although that field is still uneven it is a 
field that can now be played upon.
<P>
	Another area of concern with the legislation on the creation of 
Yukon surface rights board is the question of appointments. The 
board will be appointed by the minister and therefore of course 
has the potential to become a patronage hotbed.
<P>
	Appointments to the board must be made according to merit. 
Individuals with the qualifications and the expertise to make 
sound, logical decisions must be the ones appointed to the 
board; not simply those individuals with the oldest Liberal 
membership card or with the largest campaign contribution, 
appointments that would compromise the entire process and 
throw the rulings of the board into disrepute. We cannot 
emphasize too often that patronage appointments must go. We 
must cease and desist on all of them, whether it is the 
immigration board or this particular one on Yukon surface 
rights.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7645"> 7645 </A></B>
<P>
	The board will also have the power to decide which cases it 
will hear. Its rulings will be final, binding and enforceable 
through the Supreme Court of the Yukon territory. This is a great 
deal of power which must not be placed in the hands of a few 
political friends and insiders. The Reform Party will be 
watching appointments to the board with a keen interest to 
ensure that such abuses do not occur.
<P>
	I have already outlined the callous way in which the 
democratic process was subverted during the conception and 
births of Bill C-33, Bill C-34 and Bill C-133 a year ago. This 
bill is an extension of the process and therefore must be viewed 
with a healthy degree of scepticism. However we can take some 
solace in the hope that the government has learned and is 
learning from its past mistakes.
<P>
	I would also like to urge the government to follow in the 
footsteps of my own province, British Columbia. I speak of 
Premier Harcourt's public pronouncement of September 20 
when he stated several principles for openness in land claim 
negotiations. The principles enunciated include that open 
negotiations must be the starting point and closed negotiations 
the exception. The next point made was that all British 
Columbians must have the opportunity to provide meaningful 
input into the negotiating process.
<P>
	His next point is that the negotiators' bottom lines would be 
made public and that the provinces would pursue the most 
effective means of opening up and sharing information about 
negotiating sessions as widely as possible. Finally the 
mandatory sign off of all treaty settlements would be made by 
the B.C. legislature.
<P>
	In this regard I have to say on a parallel track that I had the 
occasion to meet with the federal negotiator for Vancouver 
Island on native land claims and with the British Columbia 
negotiator. The two gentlemen met in my constituency office a 
month or two ago. If I can take them at face value, we are going 
to have open negotiations with native land claims and they are 
actively soliciting input from the general public. I truly hope 
this is so. If I take them at face value it is so. I hope that is the 
way we are going. If we are, the future looks much better than it 
has for some time.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	The people of Canada deserve no less from their federal 
government on these important issues. The old closed door 
negotiations, complete with mandatory confidentiality clauses 
and no public input, only breed hostility and undermine public 
confidence in the process. The public too wants native land 
claims to be settled justly for all parties.
<P>
	Bill C-33 and Bill C-34 are classic examples of old style 
politics. Admittedly Bill C-55 was conceived under less 
dubious circumstances, but it is still somewhat tainted by the 
earlier process.
<P>
In finishing I urge the government to carefully consider the 
comments made here today and the comments my colleagues 
will make. I hope the government will heed this advice as we 
head down the road of aboriginal self-government.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to speak on Bill 
C-55, an act to establish the Yukon Surface Rights Board.
<P>
	I do not speak often on aboriginal matters but I thought this 
bill merited comment. In fact the last time I spoke on aboriginal 
matters in the House was to argue for an amendment to the 
private member's bill which declared ice hockey as Canada's 
national sport. The amendment which was accepted declared the 
great aboriginal sport of lacrosse to be Canada's summer 
national sport.
<P>
	Aboriginal issues are important to me in particular and should 
be important to every member from British Columbia. As we 
know, most of the territory of the province of British Columbia 
is the subject of some form of land claim by our aboriginal 
peoples. It is my belief that the precedent set in Yukon may 
become the precedent for settling claims in British Columbia. 
Therefore it is important for me to address these issues.
<P>
	I have a few preliminary comments to make before I get into a 
detailed discussion of the clauses of the bill. The bill is the third 
in a trilogy of bills dealing with the settlement of land claims in 
Yukon. The Reform Party opposed the first two bills which 
established the settlement of the land claims. Logically, 
therefore, we oppose Bill C-55 which establishes the 
mechanism to implement these settlements, or alternatively to 
settle disputes relating to the claim.
<P>
	I understand the feeling that a mechanism should be found to 
resolve disputes without the necessity of going to court. Courts 
are expensive. Justice usually is not swift. However this leads 
me to make two comments.
<P>
	First, perhaps the inefficient slow moving courts would be 
useful in these circumstances because the possibility of going to 
court would be seen as such a detriment that settlements may be 
more easily achieved by the parties involved. I think that is what 
we would want. Perhaps in this instance the threat of going to 
court is one to be preserved, not put aside.
<P>
	My second point deals with the courts themselves. If the 
courts are in such a state that even the government does not want 
them involved in settling disputes of the kind presented by the 
Yukon land claims, maybe we should take a hard look at 
reforming the courts of the country.
<P>
	Courts were established to settle disputes between parties. 
They exist. The infrastructure is there. The salaries of those 
involved are already paid. Why should we not then use them to 
settle disputes such as the ones presented here? If the courts 
because of inefficiencies are not seen to be the appropriate 
vehicle then maybe we  should streamline our judicial system 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7646"> 7646 </A></B>
<P>
instead of establishing a new board. We should address reform 
of our civil law courts.
<P>
	However I realize that judicial and court reform will not 
happen before the bill is passed. The government has a majority 
in the House. We will soon be stuck with the Yukon Surface 
Rights Board. For this reason I wish to make the following 
general comment.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	I particularly wish to address the fact that this board will only 
deal with disputes after the parties themselves, the people 
involved in the dispute, have failed to reach an amicable 
solution. How will the board know the parties have failed to 
reach such a solution? Would it not be better if representatives 
of the board met with the parties prior to the parties going to the 
board? Such representatives could work with the parties in order 
to achieve an amicable settlement.
<P>
	I am suggesting a two step process. In this two step process 
the first step would be the disputants contacting the board 
requesting mediation or help from a representative of the board. 
A representative or a staff person, not a board member 
obviously, would be dispatched to meet with the parties. If this 
person was not effective in helping the parties resolve the 
dispute then the matter could go to the board for a hearing.
<P>
	Such a two step process, first by mediation with the help of the 
board representatives and second by a a board hearing if 
mediation failed, might tend to speed up the process. Let's face 
it, a board such as this will build its own bureaucracy. Let us 
give these people something to do beyond shuffling paper. They 
could engage in mediation.
<P>
	I wish to comment on some of the provisions of this bill which 
are especially disturbing to me. My first point, perhaps not 
surprisingly, is on the subject of clauses 8 to 15 which deal with 
the establishment and organization of the board. Some of my 
colleagues have commented on these clauses so I will keep my 
comments brief.
<P>
	The composition suggested in the statute seems to be a recipe 
for divisiveness and eventual disaster. Half of the members 
other than the chairperson are to be appointed by the Council for 
Yukon Indians, the others by order in council on 
recommendation by the minister.
<P>
	I hope it works and I wish those who designed this all the luck 
in the world. It seems to me that we are putting forward the 
possibility that the Council of Yukon Indians is simply going to 
become the judge of its own causes, conflict of interest or, if not 
the judge, then certainly an interested party at all hearings.
<P>
Virtually all disputes will involve one or more bands of Yukon 
Indians. Yukon Indians will be in a position of strength on the 
board and there is the possibility of block voting. As well we are 
establishing another organization to which Liberals can appoint 
Liberals. Surely we have enough of those already.
<P>
	It might be more appropriate to mention here that the 
Government of the Yukon Territory should have input into the 
selection of the board members. Perhaps even the chairperson 
and some of the board members should be appointed through a 
nomination of the Government of the Yukon Territory. The 
rationale would be similar to the territorial government being 
more likely to appoint people who represent the interests of the 
public at large than is the minister who might appoint Liberals. 
They could be Liberal loyalists and probably will be who might 
stack the board full of members of one politically correct 
interest group. The Yukon government is considerably closer to 
the people of the Yukon than is the minister. Hence it is far less 
likely to make poor choices.
<P>
	Barring the selection of board members through that process I 
offer an idea for a second selection process. The membership of 
this board could be appointed by the minister but on the approval 
of all three parties in the House of Commons. If the minister 
does not agree to appoint the whole board in this fashion at least 
the chair of the board should be approved by the two opposition 
parties in this House.
<P>
	I also do not like the fact that we are setting up another body to 
be paid out of the public purse. Surely if the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development had been listening recently 
to the Minister of Finance he would know how badly in debt the 
country is and how we cannot afford any more expenditures.
<P>
	Clause 19 gives the board the power to hire staff and 
consultants. Here we go again. We just cannot afford to give this 
kind of blanket authority without limiting the numbers to be 
hired. As well under clause 21 the board can acquire personal 
property in its name and dispose of it. This may be all right if we 
are talking about furnishing an office, but it might not take too 
long for this to be stretched into a major acquisition program. 
There should be some stipulation as to what the personal 
property is to be used for.
<P>
	Clause 23 deals with the financing of the board. We on this 
side of the House would feel more comfortable if the matter of 
annual financing was referred directly to the Standing 
Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. I know it will be contained in 
the estimates, but we want to know specifically the moneys 
allocated to the board and how they are spent.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Clause 24 of the bill requires that the board report to the 
minister upon his request. I would suggest that this clause be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7647"> 7647 </A></B>
<P>
changed so that the board reports to the minister on an annual 
basis and that these reports be  tabled in the House of Commons 
and referred to committee.
<P>
	Clause 26 on the subject of jurisdiction does not refer to the 
fact that the board should exercise its authority observing the 
rules of natural justice. Interestingly, this is one of the grounds 
for the appeal of ruling by the board, but it is not specifically 
listed as a requirement for its hearings. For greater certainty this 
requirement should be spelled out.
<P>
	Clause 40 gives the board the right to set fees. I am torn 
between suggesting that the fees be low enough so as not to 
prohibit anyone from taking advantage of the jurisdiction of this 
board or suggesting the fees be high enough to ensure the board 
pays for itself. I find my last suggestion to be quite interesting 
even though it comes from me, and in keeping with my remarks 
on the affordability of this board, perhaps we should pursue it.
<P>
	Clause 41 requires the rules made by the board to govern its 
operation to be published. I think this is a good requirement. 
However I am concerned that there may be significant 
disagreement among the stakeholders regarding particular 
rules.
<P>
	I believe a method should be found by which these rules could 
be objected to by major groups and a hearing held on the fairness 
of the rules. Perhaps the board itself could hear these 
complaints.
<P>
	Clauses 42 through 64 contain many areas which would better 
be the subject of discussion in committee. These clauses 
describe the main tasks which will be undertaken by the board. I 
am sure representatives of my party will have comments to 
make on them as the committee proceeds to clause by clause 
analysis.
<P>
	Clauses 74 and 75 give the board the final authority in relation 
to findings of fact and establishing an appeal procedure to the 
Yukon Supreme Court. I hope this right of appeal is not abused. 
We are looking here for quick settlements and the board is 
established to effect such settlements.
<P>
	It would be counterproductive to allow too many appeals to 
the courts. Also in relation to the issue on some judgments, 
perhaps the minister could consider placing a limit on the time 
the board has to make a decision, perhaps 30 days from the time 
the case is concluded.
<P>
	Clause 79 gives the governor in council authority to make 
regulations dealing with the board. Again, as with the rules of 
the board, a procedure should be suggested whereby these 
regulations could be the subject of objection by the major 
stakeholders and the objections heard and subsequently dealt 
with.
<P>
	Finally, I would suggest that this bill contain an automatic 
review clause so that we can be assured that it will come back 
before us so we can assess how effective it has been; perhaps a 
review in three years.
<P>
We are opposed to this bill. It has many deficiencies, but most of 
all the content is wrong. There should be no need to spend 
taxpayers' money to set up a body which is designed to do what 
courts are in existence to do, resolve disputes.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too would like to reiterate some of the comments my 
colleagues have made and possibly some new ones on Bill C-55.
<P>
	As we are aware this is the third component of the package in 
relation to the Yukon First Nations Land Act claims settlement 
and the Yukon First Nations self-government. This particular 
bill is essential for the effective implementation of the other two 
acts. It mainly addresses the federal government's legal 
requirements to facilitate these other two acts coming into force.
<P>
	This bill is to establish a board of directors that will handle 
disputes that occur. These disputes could involve three different 
components. They could involve owners of settlement lands or 
owners of non-settlement lands and of course businesses that 
would be involved. There are three components the board will be 
facing in relation to disputes. The other main aspect of this 
board is the determination of compensation in relation to the 
expropriation of settlement lands.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	The orders of course from this board are binding. The board is 
not going to address disputes unless the two parties or three 
parties involved have tried to come to some sort of a mutual 
agreement before this. Should that not occur it will come to the 
board. Therefore, the board is actually in an arbitration kind of 
situation and its decision will be binding. Except for limited 
reasons, it can go to the Supreme Court of the Yukon Territory.
<P>
	This brings us to the structure of the actual board which I have 
some concerns about. I realize that my colleagues have touched 
on some of this, but I think they are important enough to 
reiterate to some degree. Clause 8(1) of the bill gives us an 
overview of what the board will consist of: a chairman and not 
less than two members and not more than ten other members. 
That would make a possible total of 11 members including the 
chairman. All these members would be appointed by the 
minister.
<P>
	There are some conditions that apply on these appointments. 
Clause 8(2) indicates that the minister must establish a board of 
an odd number. That I would assume includes the chairman so 
that the board would also consist of an odd number of members.
<P>
	Clause 9(1) indicates that the chairperson is appointed by the 
minister but on the recommendation of the board. Clause 9(2) 
addresses the other members. It could be up to 10 members. It 
indicates that half of those members would be appointed by the 
minister based on nominations from the Council of Yukon 
Indians and the other half would be appointed by the minister. It 
does not indicate where the nominations or the suggestions for 
those appointments would come from.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7648"> 7648 </A></B>
<P>
	To round this up, clause 10(1) indicates that a majority in both 
of these components, those nominated by the council and those 
appointed by the minister, must consist of members who reside 
in the Yukon Territory.
<P>
	What this to my mind does is put the board in a position of 
being two components, one being suggested from the Council of 
Yukon Indians and the other from the minister, wherever those 
suggestions may come from. This in itself may divide the board. 
Also, the chairman of the board who is appointed based on 
recommendations from the board could put the balance of power 
on the board in either component. For example, if the chair was 
someone who was appointed by the minister then the bulk of the 
members on the board would be members appointed by the 
minister. If the chair happened to be someone who was a 
nominee from the Council of Yukon Indians then the balance of 
power would be on that side.
<P>
	I question why the chairman has to be appointed by the 
minister based on the recommendation of the board. To my mind 
that suggests a veto power by the minister. It would seem that 
the board could elect its chairman instead of making 
recommendations to the minister to appoint it.
<P>
	The other concern that comes out of that composition would 
be the right or opportunity for patronage appointments. Another 
concern would be that somewhere in the bill I believe it says that 
disputes do not have to be handled by the full board. We can 
subgroup the board into panels of three or more and handle the 
disputes based on that. Again we will look at the composition of 
the panel. Having these two components on the board, what is 
the composition of this panel and how they are selected is a very 
grey area.
<P>
	Another way of looking at the composition of this panel could 
be from a representation of the players involved, i.e. the three 
components: the businesspersons, the owners of non-settlement 
land or the owners of settlement land. One could possibly pursue 
having representation of these three components. Another way 
of looking at it would be representation from the two 
components, the membership from the Yukon council, or those 
appointed by the minister. That is a very grey area.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The fact it does not indicate how these panels are composed or 
selected is also something that should be addressed possibly at 
committee. It could be based on members available at the time. 
It could be members in town at the time or whatever. Again it 
could become a lopsided membership based on these two 
components.
<P>
	Another point that comes up would be term of office of the 
membership. Either clause 12 or 13 indicates that a member can 
stand for any number of terms. The appointment is for a three 
year period and then you can run again. There is no limitation. 
You can run for this as long as you are appointed and it can be 
any number of years. That in itself may not be a problem but it 
should  be looked at to see if there are any parameters or 
situations that may pose a problem.
<P>
	I would like to offer some suggestions on board membership. 
Again one of my colleagues mentioned that appointments, if 
that is the route we choose to go, should be made on merit or 
some criteria other than just being appointed by the minister. 
There should be some criteria in there. If that becomes the case 
we would definitely like to see merit included.
<P>
	Another way of looking at it would be to possibly elect this 
board as we do school boards or something along those lines. 
That brings up of course that we may have to have candidate 
qualifications so that all sides have representation depending on 
how you wish to look at it.
<P>
	It does not necessarily indicate that the panel composition 
would indeed be three members. It could possibly be any 
number of members, but of course it cannot exceed 11 which 
would be a full committee. It also does not seem to indicate that 
the panel would be an odd number. That should be looked at as 
well.
<P>
	Another thing to look at is the concept that this board will be 
independent from government. The way it is structured it 
certainly does not imply that is going to occur. Two main things 
come out that are very suggestive it will not be independent 
from government. Unless you get into the fine print of it or 
whatever and really search for a method as to how it is 
independent these two things come front and centre.
<P>
	One is that if it is funded by the government and if all the 
members on the board are appointed by the minister, i.e. 
government, that certainly does not suggest the board is 
independent of government. That in itself also brings up a 
number of possible concerns in relation to one's membership on 
the board. If the minister has this kind of power to appoint or not 
appoint then one really does not want to be in the position of 
opposing the majority opinion. I think one would rather tread 
lightly if they wanted to continue to participate on the board.
<P>
	Therefore we may in a way be inhibiting some members in 
participating in full debate in relation to disputes or 
compensation or whatever they are addressing. I see that as a 
potential problem. There may be some inhibition on 
membership participation. I would take that a step further in 
relation to membership and possibly clarification in these areas 
might help.
<P>
	Clause 11(3) indicates the minister can remove for cause. It 
starts out that one can hold their membership on the board for 
good behaviour. There is really no qualification as to what good 
behaviour is. The minister can remove that member for cause 
or-not and, but or-on grounds set out in the bylaws of the 
board.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7649"> 7649 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	What is happening is the board can be controlled from 
ministerial appointment, depending as I say on what background 
the chairman has and can set up what is grounds for 
membership. It appears that the minister for cause-and I do not 
know where this cause is coming from, if it is going to be a set of 
rules and regulations, but I think clause 18 makes reference to 
that and that implies to me that the board may be setting up what 
constitutes cause. It is very, very vague. I was first and still am 
of the opinion that cause is for the interpretation of the minister. 
That area is rather loose as far as membership is concerned.
<P>
	The other thing that is missing which should be included 
would be some sort of recourse if one is found to be in that 
position where membership is going to be or has been revoked. 
There should be some sort of recourse for an unbiased hearing 
into the circumstances of it.
<P>
	Some tightening up is needed in those areas. Many of the 
clauses seem to be all-encompassing and a lot is left to 
assumption.
<P>
	In the part that deals with meetings, one clause caught my 
attention immediately. That was the one that said participation 
in these meetings could be by telephone or some other 
communication device. I strongly advise when this bill goes to 
committee that we address the issue of having people attend the 
meetings in person versus a telephone conference in which there 
is perhaps one member sitting in the room and everybody else is 
on the telephone somewhere in the Yukon territory. There 
should be some indication as to what a quorum is for attendance 
in person at a meeting.
<P>
	A second very restrictive clause is where the meetings can be 
held. I believe it states they can be held in Whitehorse and/or 
other areas of the Yukon. I agree that is the most sensible area in 
which to hold meetings as that is the area it is related to but there 
may be cause to hold meetings elsewhere. If we are going to look 
at the letter of the law, which seems to be how our justice system 
is looking at things these days versus the spirit of it, I suggest 
that we open that one up a little bit so that meetings are not only 
held right in that area. That is what that clause suggests.
<P>
	Much of what I am saying today is clause by clause analysis of 
the bill which will come up in committee, but those are some of 
the points I wish to highlight. A number of my colleagues have 
come up with the same types of points and I think that speaks for 
itself that there is some concern in those areas.
<P>
	The last item would be the statement of accounts. I did not get 
the impression there would be open access to these accounts by 
the public. I got the impression they would be well documented, 
that there would be a very good system of accounts, that the 
appropriate people would do them, that they would be reviewed 
by the Auditor General, and so on, and submitted to  
government. However there is no reference anywhere for access 
to these accounts on request.
<P>
	With that I will close my remarks. Under the circumstances 
we realize this bill is the third part of the other two and it is 
necessary for this one to pass. However, in the composition of 
the bill there are a number of things that we should tidy it up 
before we actually put it out as the third part.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate, 
it is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House 
that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment 
are as follows: the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, 
Chemical weapons; the hon. member for Oakville-Milton, 
Tourism; the hon. member for Lévis, Carrefour 
Jeunesse-Emploi; and the hon. member for Chicoutimi, 
National Defence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my speech will be short if not particularly sweet for 
those across.
<P>
	As has been mentioned many times already, Bill C-55 is a 
continuation of Bills C-33 and C-34. This places the Reform 
Party and myself in somewhat of an awkward position. Any 
support we may give at some point on Bill C-55 should most 
certainly not be interpreted as support for the previous 
ill-conceived legislation.
<P>
	During his initial presentation of Bill C-55, the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development stated that just before 
the summer recess we dealt with the legislation of Bills C-33 
and C-34. That is false. We did not do that. What happened just 
before the summer recess was that the Liberals invoked closure, 
the very thing that when they sat on this side of the House they 
said was such a contemptible thing. It is interesting how their 
perspective changes as they walk across the floor. I sincerely 
hope it will not change our perspective when we walk across the 
floor three years from now.
<P>
	The legislation contained in Bills C-33 and C-34 is 
absolutely incredible. They place us in the position we are now 
when dealing with land in the Yukon. If land settlements were 
made with all aboriginal people in Canada on the basis of the 
settlement made in Bill C-33, we would be looking at a land 
settlement area four times the size of my province of British 
Columbia. I believe that is absolutely unacceptable to virtually 
everyone.
<P>
	On the matter of the intent of Bill C-55, I would first have to 
state that I support the slogan of the mining industry which is: 
keep mining in Canada. Certainly we would want to have some 
settlement of land disputes in the Yukon and we would like to 
see this move through the House quickly. However there are 
many flaws in Bill C-55 which must be corrected before it can 
proceed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7650"> 7650 </A></B>
<P>
	The government talks of consultation. It even lists in its 
presentation the consultation that supposedly took place in the 
preparation of Bill C-55. This is another of the Liberals' sleight 
of hands or flimflams. When one says they have consulted or 
have provided a list of people they have consulted someone 
looking at that document says: ``This is good. Here are all the 
people they have consulted with. I guess if they have used what 
these people have told them and come up with this, it must be 
okay''.
<P>
	There is absolutely nothing in the process of consultation 
especially with the Liberals that says they have listened to 
anything they have received as a result of these consultations. 
The very fact they have gone out and spoken with some people 
means absolutely nothing.
<P>
	Recently, after coming in from a rally on these very grounds 
of people concerned about the impending firearms legislation 
the justice minister said that this government will not base its 
legislation on head count. In other words: ``We do not care what 
the people say. We know what is good for them''. That certainly 
is a problem.
<P>
	Another of the problems in this bill that must be addressed are 
patronage appointments by the minister. Once again their 
perspective changes when they walk across the floor. These are 
the same members who sat in opposition and lambasted the 
former Prime Minister and the Tory party for patronage 
appointments. It seems however that they learned at the feet of 
the master. Now that they have formed the government they are 
anxious to show that they are bigger and better at everything, 
including patronage, than the former Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	The appointments being made to this board are going to be 
made by the minister. Is that not nice? He gets to put together a 
little patronage haven of his own so that now people can pay 
homage and maybe support him so they can get one of these 
plum positions. The board gets to say who they want and then the 
chairman appoints them, but remember who put the people on 
the board in the first place.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House, those who do not know can 
learn from this, of comments of a senior Liberal campaign 
official from a western riding who was anticipating his 
patronage appointment to the board of referees. When 
questioned on the fact that he had announced prematurely that 
he was getting this appointment and that it was clearly a 
patronage appointment, he was quoted in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> as 
stating: ``What's wrong with patronage? How else can we attract 
people to our party?'' What a disgusting turn of events that we 
now find ourselves in, a patronage appointed board to do the 
bidding of the minister so that the minister can claim that the 
government is no longer directly involved.
<P>
What about the composition of the board? This is really 
interesting as well. The composition of the board is racially 
motivated. It is interesting. Why are the Liberals doing that? If 
we assume that there are going to be 10 on the board-if the 
minister has the opportunity to appoint why not appoint the 
maximum number and that way he gets the maximum benefits 
back-five are going to be aboriginal people and five are going 
to be non-aboriginal.
<P>
	This brings into question first that they are dealing with all 
lands in the Yukon. That means that it should be Yukon people. 
There should not be a particular makeup that says there has to be 
a certain number of a certain type of people when they are 
dealing on land other than aboriginal land. If it were aboriginal 
land only, I agree that it should be aboriginal people who decide 
on their own land. When we are dealing with all of the Yukon it 
should be people in the Yukon, period.
<P>
	One side asks: ``Why should there be an arbitrary number of 
aboriginal people deciding on non-aboriginal land?'' On the 
other hand it is argued that aboriginal people are competent. I 
am not arguing that. In fact they are the ones who live on the land 
and may in fact at times be the best qualified to make the 
decision for land use in the Yukon. Why then should the board be 
limited to five aboriginal people if in fact they may be the best 
qualified people? If seven of the best qualified people are 
aboriginal, why should two of them be denied so that it can go 
the other way, just the same as it works in reverse.
<P>
	The final point that I have some concerns about is access to 
court. In the document it narrows and extremely limits access to 
court on appeal from the outcome of this board belonging to the 
minister of Indian and northern affairs. Why would one want to 
limit a person's access to court? Obviously the Liberal 
government is sort of predisposed to that. We have already seen 
the Minister of Transport do that in the Pearson deal.
<P>
	It comes to a matter of property rights-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Very wisely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Oh, yes, very wise indeed. Of course the more 
control you have, the more you can put in your own patronage 
people and have things the way you want totally unchallenged.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> You and the Tories wanted it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> We have property rights in Canada, at least we 
think we do. The reality is we do not have any property rights at 
all. All land belongs to the government. All we have is the right 
of continued possession. If the government starts limiting our 
access to the court, the government can bring out more and more 
arcane laws all the time and have its own people in place and ram 
them through, no access to the courts, no appeal.
<P>
	There are many flaws in this bill. I trust sincerely that if this 
bill makes it to the committee that the Liberals will do what is 
right. They will correct these injustices in the bill. They will 
start dealing with the accusations they  made when they were on 
this side of the House. They will get rid of patronage. They will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7651"> 7651 </A></B>
<P>
get rid of all the other ill-tasting things that are in this bill and 
bring out something that is legitimate, meaningful and 
justifiable to the people of the Yukon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a short question that I would like to put to the 
hon. member.
<P>
	He is opposing this bill as is his party. It seems to me that 
every time the government has brought forward a bill dealing 
with aboriginal claims or aboriginal interests or dealings in land 
in any area that is inhabited by aboriginal peoples in this 
country, he and his party members have opposed the bill.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	I wonder if he is in a position to reconsider his party's 
opposition and realize perhaps their opposition is not based on 
reason but on a bias or prejudice that is coming through in 
opposition to these bills. Would he not want to rethink his policy 
and take a little more fair view of the entire thing and realize that 
this bill is in fact good for the Yukon territory as was the case 
with the two previous bills which we heard announced earlier 
this afternoon in another speech and turn it around and support 
this legislation?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Good question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that whenever the 
Liberals take a page out of the Reform policy book to introduce 
legislation, they always seem to take only half a page and get it 
wrong.
<P>
	It seems that when the hon. member listened to my 
presentation he only listened to half of it. I would first point out 
that he should check back in his records on the Split Lake 
agreement and see which way the Reform Party voted on that.
<P>
	Second, I would point out that I said here that there is a bias, 
not by the Reform Party but on the part of the government on the 
racial makeup of the very board we are discussing here. It is 
limiting the number of people from any one race, and that 
includes the aboriginal people. If they are the best qualified, 
why are they limited to 50 per cent of the board? If they are the 
best people, let them be the the major part of the board. It is only 
because the minister wants to have absolute and complete 
control.
<P>
	We need something that is fair and totally honest. We are not 
going to have honesty when those numbers on the committee are 
both manipulated and appointed as personal patronage plums of 
the minister of Indian and northern affairs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am only going to 
speak briefly with respect to Bill C-55 because like much of this 
government's legislation it resembles the Bishop's egg. It is 
excellent in parts, but it contains a lot of tainted material.
<P>
	The administrative clauses of the bill are well drafted. They 
are quite similar to legislation in some provincial jurisdictions. 
The rules are comprehensible. I am perfectly aware that many 
mining industry executives regard acceptance of C-55 as 
preferable to continued regulatory uncertainty.
<P>
	Having worked in that industry for many years, I think I 
understand the corporate mind. If a company is effectively 
blocked by bureaucratic stalemate, it will accept almost any 
compromise in order to survive. As the crofter said: ``It is better 
to sleep with the devil than to lie a'cold''.
<P>
	My objections to the bill are based on the proposed 
composition and terms of the reference of the Yukon surface 
rights board. Like its evil older sisters, Bills C-33 and C-34, 
this bill is tainted by racial bias. The board will consist of a 
chairperson and from two to ten other members. Since these will 
be prize patronage appointments you can be sure that the higher 
number will prevail. At least half of the members shall be 
appointed, and I quote: ``on the nomination of the Yukon 
Council of Indians'' or to express it more crudely and directly: 
``They shall be Indians''. As my hon. colleague has just said, 
this is a double-edged sword. Not only is it expressly directed 
that five members of a ten member group shall be Indians but it 
is also expressly directed that five of them shall not be Indians.
<P>
	I thought I lived in Canada. Can anybody imagine the uproar 
that would ensue if the articles of a quasi-judicial provincial 
board, let us say in Ontario, required that a certain percentage of 
its members be Caucasian?
<P>
	Just in case the board is not sufficiently biased, there is 
provision in clause 23 of the bill to budget funds for and again I 
quote: ``cross-cultural orientation, education and other 
training''. That is to say for social brainwashing.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps in so far as the board's duties will deal partly with 
disputes involving native settlement lands, a little 
well-intentioned genetic bias can be justified, but why in the 
name of common sense should the colour of a person's skin 
determine eligibility to rule on disputes concerning 
non-settlement lands, that is to say on public lands?
<P>
	Even if the biases were applied only to settlement lands, it 
should be remembered that the board will arbitrate 
compensation for expropriation of these lands. Yet half of its 
members are required by law to be beneficiaries of such 
compensation. Does that make sense?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7652"> 7652 </A></B>

powers and its decisions will have the force of law. Should not 
its independence be protected?

	The House resumed from November 1 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-54, an act to amend the Old Age Security Act, 
the Canada Pension Plan, the Children's Special Allowances Act 
and the Unemployment Insurance Act, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to have an opportunity to speak on 
Bill C-54, an act to amend the Old Age Security Act, the Canada 
Pension Plan, the Children's Special Allowances Act and the 
Unemployment Insurance Act.
<P>
When I first had the chance to review the amendments contained 
in this bill it was immediately apparent that a good deal of time 
and effort have gone into determining ways in which the 
application rules for income security benefits could be made 
more flexible.
<P>
	It is obvious that clients have complained about some of the 
application requirements and certain restrictions in the current 
legislation. Undoubtedly each of these requirements or 
restrictions had a reason for being at the time they were 
introduced. However, by listening to the public the government 
has found ways in which both the client and the integrity of the 
programs can both be well served.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity to highlight some of the 
amendments where this is most obvious. Under the Old Age 
Security Act the 60 to 64-year old spouse of a low income old 
age security pensioner can, on application, receive the spouse's 
allowance benefit. Also eligible for this income tested benefit 
are low-income widowed persons in the same age group.
<P>
	The only requirement for the spouse's allowance apart from 
age and income is that the younger spouse must have lived in 
Canada for a minimum of 10 years after age 18. Because 
residence is a qualifier for the spouse's allowance benefit, 
applicants for the allowance provide a history of their residence 
in Canada after age 18 and up to age 60.
<P>
	When spouse's allowance recipients turn age 65 they become 
eligible for the old age security pension in their own right. 
However, the amount of their old age security pension is 
dependent on the total number of years they have lived in 
Canada after age 18. For those who were in Canada prior to July 
1, 1976, 10 years of residence in Canada immediately prior to 
age 65 entitles them to payment of the full pension.
<P>
	For those who came to Canada after July 1, 1976 the amount 
of their pension is equal to one-fortieth for each year they 
resided in Canada after age 18.
<P>
	For the most part the administration knows from the 
information provided on the spouses allowance application 
combined with the payment history of the spouses allowance 
how many years of residence the client has at age 65. Therefore 
it is possible to calculate the old age security pension 
entitlement without going back to the client.
<P>
	Currently, however, the client is required to apply for the 
basic old age security pension and to provide the administration 
with much of the same information and documentation that the 
individual provided with his or her spouses allowance 
application.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7653"> 7653 </A></B>
<P>
	Given that in the majority of cases the administration already 
has the spouses allowance recipient's residence history in 
Canada the requirement that this individual apply for old age 
security is unnecessary.
<P>
	Therefore I am pleased to see that this bill proposes to give the 
Minister of Human Resources Development discretion to deem 
an old age security application to have been made by the 64-year 
old recipient of spouse's allowance. In addition, given that the 
administration already has the income information it requires 
the income tested guaranteed income supplement form will also 
not be required for the remainder of the GIS payment year.
<P>
	Approximately 20,000 recipients of the spouse's allowance 
turn 65 each year. As the majority of these clients have lived in 
Canada for the required number of years to receive a full old age 
security benefit, this amendment will benefit a great many 
people.
<P>
	This automatic conversion from spouse's allowance to old age 
security is not a new concept. Currently under the Canada 
pension plan 64-year old disability recipients do not have to 
apply for their retirement pension to commence at age 65.
<P>
	A Canada pension plan retirement application is deemed to 
have been received because the administration already has the 
information necessary to put a retirement pension into play.
<P>
	I am pleased that we are now offering the same quality service 
to 64-year old spouse's allowance recipients.
<P>
	Another provision of the Canada pension plan is also being 
mirrored in the amendment in this bill which recognizes that 
some individuals because of incapacity are unable to apply for 
their old age security benefits on time. Specifically, the minister 
will be able to deem an application to have been received earlier 
than it actually was received if the lateness is due to incapacity.
<P>
	Benefit entitlement to the basic old age security pension and 
the income tested guaranteed income supplement and spouse's 
allowance is contingent on an application being made for these 
benefits.
<P>
	If this bill becomes law retroactivity for all of these benefits 
will be a consistent 12 months. Therefore anyone applying more 
than 12 months after the first month in which they could have 
received benefits loses some benefits.
<P>
	For the most part a limited period of retroactivity is 
considered fair.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	Individuals have a certain responsibility to come forward in a 
timely manner to receive their correct benefit entitlement. 
However, there are cases in which the individual is mentally or 
physically incapacitated and this incapacity renders them 
incapable of making an application. Unless these individuals are 
fortunate enough to have someone who realizes that application  
can be made on behalf of such an incapacitated person, benefit 
entitlement can be lost.
<P>
	The amendments in this bill would allow the minister to deem 
an application to have been made by or on behalf of an applicant. 
This would only apply if the applicant were at the time of 
application incapable of forming or expressing an intention to 
make an application.
<P>
	As I noted earlier, the Canada pension plan already has such a 
provision and this important protection is now being proposed 
for old age security clients as well.
<P>
	Another very interesting amendment contained in this bill 
would allow old age security pensioners to cancel their benefit 
entitlement. On the face of it one wonders why such an 
amendment is necessary. Surely if someone does not want the 
benefit all they have to do is not apply. For the small number of 
individuals who do not want to receive the old age security 
pension the majority do not make application. However, in some 
cases it is only after becoming a pensioner that an individual 
decides that he or she no longer wants to receive the old age 
security benefit. The current legislation, because it does not 
provide for benefit cancellation, cannot accede to these 
requests.
<P>
	As I am sure most people will agree, someone should not be 
forced to take the application they do not want. Therefore this 
bill would allow individuals to cancel their benefit. However, 
recognizing that circumstances can change, the bill will also 
make provision for a cancelled benefit to be reinstated if the 
pensioner should subsequently change his or her mind. The 
reinstatement would be effective the month following the month 
the request for reinstatement was made. A pensioner would be 
reinstated on the same calculation of residence that had been 
used when application for the old age security pension was first 
made.
<P>
	A very similar type of amendment is also being made to the 
Canada pension plan. Currently the Canada pension plan allows 
for an assignment of retirement pensions between spouses in an 
ongoing relationship. A Canada pension plan retirement 
beneficiary whose spouse is over 60 and receiving any 
retirement benefits he or she is entitled to under either the 
Canada or Quebec pension plans can apply for and receive a 
share of the retirement benefits they both earned during the 
course of the marriage.
<P>
	The legislation currently provides that the assignment ceases 
on the death of either spouse, on the twelfth month following the 
month the couple separates, the month the non-contributing 
spouse becomes a contributor or the month a divorce or 
annulment of marriage is finalized. Therefore, even though 
pension assignment is done at the request of the couple, the 
couple who remains together cannot cancel the assignment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7654"> 7654 </A></B>
<P>
	While the administration has received very few requests for a 
pension assignment to be cancelled, there is absolutely no good 
reason this should not be allowed. Therefore, I am pleased that 
this bill provides for cancellation at the written request of both 
spouses.
<P>
	This type of amendment emphasizes that the government is 
listening to what clients want and what they have every right to 
expect.
<P>
	The last amendment I want to deal with is another obvious 
example of listening to the desires of clients. As I am sure we are 
all aware, the Canada pension plan was amended in 1977 to 
provide for a division of pension credits between spouses should 
the marriage end in divorce or annulment. While these 
provisions have been extended and improved over the years, the 
amendment I want to talk about has to do with limitations that 
only existed up until 1987.
<P>
	Specifically because the administration had no experience 
with this type of provision in 1977 the division of pension 
credits earned by both spouses under the Canada pension plan 
during the course of the marriage was only allowed if very strict 
conditions were met. The marriage had to have lasted a 
minimum of three years. An application for a division of 
pension credits had to have been made within three years of the 
divorce or annulment.
<P>
	This latter requirement was felt necessary so that divorced 
individuals would have some idea of what their retirement 
benefits were going to be when they reached retirement age. It 
was felt at the time that a CPP contributor should not be left in 
limbo. He or she had a right to know if the pension credits were 
going to be divided. In this way the individual could better plan 
for his or her retirement years.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	Three years was considered to be long enough after the 
marriage was over for one of the spouses to make application for 
a division of pension credits. Unfortunately, what the original 
legislation did not provide was for an extension of the 
three-year time limit.
<P>
	I am pleased to note that there are many divorced couples who 
hold no animosity toward each other. These individuals still 
want to ensure that their ex-spouses are treated fairly.
<P>
	The administration has been approached by couples who were 
divorced prior to 1987 when the time limit was removed who 
would still like to have a division of pension credits. Such 
persons accept the fact that Canada pension plan contributions 
are a joint family asset to which both spouses contributed 
equally during the course of their marriage. Even though for the 
most part only the male partner made CPP contributions or at 
least consistently contributed to the plan during the course of the 
marriage, he recognizes that his ex-wife has as much right to 
these credits as he did.
<P>
The people who are coming forward do not want a three-year 
time limit to prevent them from dividing their pension credits 
with their ex-spouse. Therefore, an amendment contained in 
Bill C-54 will allow the three-year time limit to be waived 
where both spouses request this waiver in writing.
<P>
	The Canada pension plan is an income security program that 
truly belongs to its clients. The plan is totally funded by the 
contributions that employers and their employees make and the 
investment of any moneys not immediately needed to pay 
benefits and expenses. Therefore, this plan should definitely 
listen to the people to whom it belongs and the waiver of the 
three-year time limit for spouses who divorced prior to 1987 is 
proof positive that this government is willing to both listen and 
act on what it hears.
<P>
	This government has a commitment to improve the way it 
does business. This bill before us today exemplifies how this 
commitment can be acted upon.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-54, an Act to 
amend the Old Age Security Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the 
Children's Special Allowances Act and the Unemployment 
Insurance Act. In other words, this bill directly concerns social 
programs.
<P>
	I am puzzled since, throughout the election campaign, the 
Liberals kept referring to their red book and the creation of jobs 
and more jobs. However, the reality is that, since they took 
office, the Liberals are constantly looking at cuts in social 
program budgets.
<P>
	The social policy reform provides a good example of the cuts 
which this government intends to make. Under the 
circumstances, I feel that the current debate is essential, since it 
concerns the poor. This bill deals with the benefits of an 
important group in our society, namely our seniors, our fathers 
and mothers, to whom we owe so much. These people played an 
active role in the economic life of our communities, and they 
still do, often in a volunteer capacity.
<P>
	Seniors in my riding are of that calibre. However, they are not 
exempt from the problem of poverty which confronts many 
elderly persons. In 1992, the average income of seniors living 
alone was $18,434. Moreover, 21 per cent of seniors belong to 
the low-income group. It is tragic to see people who helped 
build this country being faced with the prospect of poverty.
<P>
	Regardless of what the Liberals in this House may think, the 
income level of many seniors coincides with the poverty line. 
These are real figures. Why then is the Liberal government so 
bent on getting tough and tightening up the social system by 
saving money at the expense of the poorest of the poor?
<P>

<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Some of the objectives of Bill C-54 are acceptable, namely, 
improving client services, managing programs more efficiently, 
and taking the necessary steps to harmonize programs. The Bloc 
Quebecois supports the objective of this bill which is to make 
the rules more flexible in order to make life easier for senior 
citizens. It even agrees with some of the amendments, which can 
only benefit seniors. However, the Bloc cannot condone the fact 
that savings are being achieved at the expense of already 
impoverished senior citizens. We must make sure that senior 
citizens do not lose what they have gained so far.
<P>
	Despite its Good Samaritan act and all its talk about fairness, 
the Liberal government does want to standardize the Old Age 
Security programs by limiting retroactive payments to one year.
<P>
	When we know that senior citizens can now receive 
retroactive Old Age benefits for five years, one must question 
what the government is doing. If it is not making it harder for 
senior citizens, what is it doing then? I say it is saving money by 
taking away from senior citizens what they had gained 
previously.
<P>
	The Liberal government is waving a carrot, but the Bloc 
Quebecois knows there is a stick. As to overpayments under the 
Old Age Security Program, pensioners are protected against any 
error by officials, that is to say they would not have to repay the 
sums received in excess of their entitlement. Presently, the 
legislation has provisions for a maximum two-year retroactivity 
period. Bill C-54 would abolish this, saving the government 
between one and two million dollars.
<P>
	I would like the minister to explain where these savings are 
coming from, and whether pensioners will be protected the way 
they were previously.
<P>
	I would also like the Minister of Human Resources 
Development to explain to me the provision of the bill granting 
the minister the right to acquire, use and manage assets. It is 
quite natural that I should question this provision since the 
intent of the minister is far from clear in this bill. He certainly 
lacks openness in this case, contrary to the openness he shows as 
far as personal information on pensioners is concerned.
<P>
	The Liberal government, although it denied against all odds 
that CSIS was spying, wants to increase the number of 
departments and agencies which will have access to personal 
information.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois considers that the collection of 
information is legitimate, but it believes that the access to such 
information should be limited.
<P>
The Liberal government should clarify the rules for access to 
privileged information and the provisions dealing with 
sanctions in case of disclosure.
<P>
	The integrity of this information must be respected. The 
government should be more specific and should demonstrate the 
need for a wider distribution of privileged information.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Considering that the bill in its present form fails to reinforce 
the confidentiality of personal information pertaining to 
beneficiaries of programs for seniors and that the government is 
saving money at the expense of the poorest members of society, 
and that certain measures seem obscure, I will support the 
amendment presented by my colleague for 
Argenteuil-Papineauville.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak today on Bill C-54, something 
we as Reformers would like to address in an enormous way and 
revamp.
<P>
	The bill is to streamline OAS, CPP and UIC systems. It is 
essentially a housekeeping bill. I hope these changes will result 
in increased efficiency and increased targeting for those who 
most need it, decreased expenditures and less abuse in the 
system, something we in the Reform Party stand for very 
strongly. However, given the usual situation with this and 
previous governments, I am very doubtful that will happen.
<P>
	Let me give some examples. The Liberal proposals in the bill 
are simply not financially sustainable. In 15 years or less, 
spending on social programs plus interest will consume 100 per 
cent of all federal revenues. I will get back to that a bit later.
<P>
	The proposals in the bill do not address the long term fiscal 
reality of declining dollars to spend on social programs and the 
dramatic increase in the numbers of seniors expected in the next 
15 years. This mindset occurs on just about every committee the 
Liberal Party has chaired. Never are the ideas of how we are 
going to pay for all the programs we ask for ever addressed in the 
majority of committees that we sit on.
<P>
	The Liberal proposals are not targeted to the truly needy. The 
Liberal proposals do not eliminate the duplication between 
various levels of government, a logical choice where we could 
officially cut costs to provide more money for other programs 
and to decreasing the deficit and the debt.
<P>
	We in this party support the following options proposed in the 
minister's paper, I must admit: moving the UI system closer to a 
true insurance program; starting to target assistance to those 
most in need; a voucher system for students to replace 
post-secondary education; an income contingent repayment 
plan for student loans which would put it on the legs of financial 
and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7656"> 7656 </A></B>
<P>
fiscal sustainability; and placing more responsibility on the 
province for welfare programs. The problem and the  single 
most important and fundamental threat to social programs is 
continued deficit spending by this and previous governments.
<P>
	We have been accused in this party of being the slash and burn 
party that does not care about the poor, the dispossessed, the 
wronged, and those in the lowest socioeconomic backgrounds. 
That is wrong. That is a fallacy that continues to exist in the 
public's mind. I will try to show the House, the government and 
the public what we really stand for and to put forth the only 
solution that will rectify these problems and save social 
programs for those who truly need them.
<P>
	Currently the debt and the interest payments are providing 
less money for social programs. I will explain how this happens. 
It will ultimately result in the collapse of all the programs 
because there simply will be no money for them. Who will that 
hurt? That will hurt those who are most needy.
<P>
	The problem, as I said before, is that as the debt increases the 
amount of interest on it increases. Currently a quarter of all 
government revenues is paid purely on interest. This serves no 
function whatsoever. A quarter goes to spending on government 
services and a half to social spending.
<P>
	Social spending is almost $80 billion. As interest payments go 
up one or two things happen: they can either take away from 
social spending or other programs or they can tax more, which is 
absolutely ludicrous. The people in the country are taxed to the 
hilt.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is the Liberal plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> That is right. 
However there is a backlash. If they increase taxes people spend 
less. Fewer people are employed. Jobless rates go up. There is 
more of a demand on our social programs. Our debts go up. Our 
interest payments go up. The cycle repeats itself. It is a spiral 
that ultimately results in the collapse of the financial, economic 
and social backbone of our country.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	To put this into a more stark perspective, by the year 2010 
interest payments and social spending will combine to swallow 
every single dollar this government or any government will take 
in. That is 100 per cent of revenues. That will mean there will be 
no money for government services including the armed forces, 
foreign affairs, RCMP, or the precious multiculturalism and 
bilingualism the government holds so dear.
<P>
	At best, with government services amounting to $42 billion, 
the most we can reasonably cut is between $8 billion and $10 
billion. The rest must come from social spending. There is no 
way around this fact of life.
<P>
	We in this party are not looking to slash social spending. We 
are looking to cutting a modest $12 billion to $16 billion which, 
in combination with the other $8 billion and the expected rise in 
GNP, will result in a balanced budget in the next three years.
<P>
The threat to government programs is already very evident. I 
will use the concrete example of health care that is close to the 
hearts of Canadians including my own. Our health care system is 
in crisis. The federal government is giving less and less money 
to the provinces and the provinces are funding less all the time 
because they simply do not have the money available. They are 
in exactly the same fiscal crunch the federal government is in.
<P>
	This results in the deplorable situation of rationing, 
particularly the rationing of essential health care services. Less 
money, increased demands, an aging population and more 
expensive medical technologies all combine to comprise 
people's health. The most essential of health care services right 
now are being withheld from people, which will result in people 
suffering and people dying.
<P>
	There is a five-month waiting list in Ottawa for heart surgery 
at the Ottawa Heart Institute. In the province of Quebec there are 
tens of thousands of individuals on hospital waiting lists, 800 of 
whom require urgent surgery now. That is absolutely deplorable. 
Seventy per cent of individuals in severe pain who need new 
hips, which generally applies to the aged, will wait at least five 
months and 40 per cent of them will wait 13 months to get hip 
transplants. Imagine ourselves, imagine our parents, imagine 
our grandparents suffering in severe pain waiting for a hip 
replacement that may never come.
<P>
	The federal government is taking away money on one hand 
and forcing provincial governments to adhere to the archaic 
Canada Health Act. It in itself philosophically compromises the 
health care of every Canadian.
<P>
	What do we propose to do in this party? We do not propose to 
destroy the Canada Health Act. We propose to amend the Canada 
Health Act to ensure that provinces have the ability to take care 
of their finances and to enable them to experiment with various 
funding models to be able to pay for the essential health care 
services people require.
<P>
	Right now people are not getting essential services. How do 
we prevent a two-tier system wherein the poor will suffer? The 
way to do it is to define essential health care services, which is 
the job of the government. We are more than happy in this party 
to help the government toward this realization of defining the 
health care system and ensuring that those services will be 
covered for every Canadian in the country regardless of 
socioeconomic situation.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Liberal compassion, keep on spending.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> This is Reform 
compassion. This is the way the Reform Party wants to deal with 
health care. The Reform Party wants to save publicly funded 
health care to ensure that all people in the country will receive 
the timely essential health care services they require. There is no 
other option. To further the health forum is going to take four 
years to make any substantive difference. It is only going to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7657"> 7657 </A></B>
<P>
offset  the decisions that we in this party know have to be made 
now.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	I beg this government to heed what is being said here today 
and to accept our hand in working toward a coherent, forward 
thinking health care policy and social policy for all Canadians to 
ensure that all Canadians, particularly those in the lowest 
socioeconomic circles, will have their needs met.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my turn to 
speak to Bill C-54. My speech will deal with two aspects. First, 
there is the whole issue of personal information. The reason we 
are opposed to this bill as it now stands is that the government 
wants to add Canada Post, among others, to the list of agencies 
and departments which already have access to this information. 
We may wonder why Canada Post needs to know this, but I think 
there is no reason to be concerned in this case.
<P>
	Correctional Service Canada is a little more disturbing. Why 
Correctional Service? They may need it for criminal 
investigations, and that would be okay, I suppose. But the 
RCMP, the Minister of Justice, members of Parliament? At the 
moment, the management of intelligence services is raising 
many questions and creating a great deal of uncertainty among 
the general public.
<P>
	I think that now is not the time to add to the list, especially 
when dealing with clients, in this case seniors, who may be more 
vulnerable to fuller disclosure of personal information or to 
allowing a larger number of government organizations, 
departments and agencies to look at seniors' files.
<P>
	We know that seniors-it will be our turn some day-live in 
insecurity, especially those with few resources. We in the 
Official Opposition are very concerned about the provisions 
adding a significant number of government bodies to the list of 
those with access to personal information. That is why the other 
day the hon. member for Papineau-Saint-Michel proposed an 
amendment which was rejected but which would have imposed 
some limits on the collection of personal information.
<P>
	The second aspect is, of course, the efficiency measures. They 
want to improve service to seniors-as stated in the objectives 
of the bill-and simplify access to old age pensions, while at the 
same time taking measures to recover money from clients who, 
as I said earlier, are very worried. I saw people again this week 
in my riding office who are worried about social program 
reform. I do not want to indulge in grandstanding, but old age 
pensions are excluded from this reform. Meanwhile, the 
Minister of Finance is travelling across Canada and telling 
everybody that there will be a reform of social programs but that 
spending will also have to be cut.
<P>
Seniors-for whom I want to speak out-are worried. Again 
yesterday, two seniors told me the same thing at a meeting of the 
Committee on Human Resources Development. Can we 
guarantee that old age pensions will not be affected? 
Unfortunately, we see here some measures that reduce the 
retroactive period for an application to one year from five. 
Previously, seniors could apply to the government and had up to 
five years to do so. Now it is reduced to one.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Eliminating the grace period would, it is estimated, save the 
government $1 to $2 million. The bill has a provision whereby 
the minister can stop making benefit payments while an appeal 
is reviewed.
<P>
	Imagine someone who wants to appeal a decision under this 
bill. Now, all of a sudden, as a result of the minister's 
discretionary power or the department's delegated authority, his 
benefit payments would stop. This means that the burden of 
proof is on him, because he is penalized right away, and his old 
age pension payments are stopped until a decision is made on the 
appeal.
<P>
	These economy measures are somewhat contrary to the 
purpose of the law, which it seems was meant to make the 
Canada Pension Plan procedures easier for seniors.
<P>
	For these two main reasons, especially the increased number 
of agencies, if the bill is passed as is, it would give access to 
private information on individual seniors. Moreover, the 
savings would be made on the backs of people who are among 
the most vulnerable in our society, seniors, most of whom, as we 
know, are barely scraping by.
<P>
	I think that the government-because the amounts saved are 
about $1 or $2 million in each case, for a total of around $4 
million for all of Canada-should not make seniors feel more 
insecure. These savings are not worth it. These people have 
contributed to society all their life and I think they deserve 
peace of mind and reassurance about their pensions.

	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should, in co-operation 
with the provinces, seek to put in place a process aimed at ensuring the 
portability of credentials obtained in and outside Canada in order to fully 
utilize the talents, skills and experience of all Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to open debate on my 
motion, No. M-303 as stated. This motion presents the House 
with the unique opportunity to assert its leadership and fulfil its 
duty to the people of Canada, to do them justice. This motion 
strikes to the heart of what Canada wants for its citizens and 
what citizens want from their Canada.
<P>
	This motion ought to transcend partisan interests. Why? 
Because Canadians by birth and by choice want and need the 
dignity of work. They want and need to contribute to the 
economic and social fabric of their great nation. They want and 
need to find fulfilment and a sense of personal identity in their 
chosen occupations. They want and need to support themselves 
and their families.
<P>
	I believe no one in this House or in this country would 
disagree that Canada wants her citizens to obtain these goals. 
Insuring the freedom, productivity, contentment and security of 
citizens is the chief interests of any democratic government. 
That is why I believe our federal and provincial governments 
must co-operate with one another and with other governments 
worldwide to see to it that Canada's citizens are able to 
maximize their productivity, their earning potential, their 
self-esteem and their creativity.
<P>
	Simply put we in this House must work together to make the 
accreditation of foreign and out of province credentials a 
simple, orderly and timely as possible without compromising 
occupational standards for even a moment to ensure the full 
realization and utilization of the talents, skills and experience of 
all our citizens.
<P>
	Professional and academic standards act as a kind of 
guarantee to the public. People can trust their affairs with a 
lawyer or trust their lives with a doctor, knowing that each of 
them has met local professional standards. As our children 
attend school from kindergarten through advanced degrees it 
seems only reasonable for us to believe that teachers are 
qualified in their fields. It is just as natural for us to want our 
children's academic achievements to be solid and substantial. 
We would like them to be as qualified as possible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7659"> 7659 </A></B>
<P>
	To retain the confidence of the public, regulatory bodies 
enforce a certain level of competence and knowledge. 
Professional standards are upheld. In general, most people in 
our communities accept that system.
<P>
	The fairness of the system is tested when newcomers to 
Canada request that their credentials be recognized. In fairness 
to the public and to members of the professions and trades here 
in Canada, the domestic authorities must conduct rigorous and 
comprehensive examinations of foreign credentials.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	People who are familiar with the credentials issue know how 
complex it is. My motion is in no way a criticism of the people 
now working in the field. My hope is that we can better support 
their efforts.
<P>
	There are costs associated with portability of credentials. I 
believe co-operation and co-ordination are the means to contain 
those costs effectively and to fairly allocate any expense that 
remains.
<P>
	My motion calls for co-operation between our federal and 
provincial governments and on the international level. In 
academic and professional areas where provinces and territories 
have jurisdiction, the resources of the federal government can 
minimize the difficulty and expense. The benefits of an effective 
recognition process fully justify the efforts governments make 
to create it.
<P>
	Job creation is the number one priority of this government. It 
is the foundation upon which this government has built a vision 
for Canada's entry into the 21st century. That vision 
encompasses the interests not only of Canadians here today but 
of those who will join us here tomorrow and rightly so.
<P>
	Canada can and should do much more to ensure that 
immigrants and all citizens are able to participate fully in the 
labour force. Canada is a land of immigrants. Over the years, 
over the centuries, first one group and then another have come 
here to make new lives.
<P>
	Some people were fleeing political turmoil. Many could find 
no opportunities in their countries of birth. Certainly, some of 
the people who came to Canada believed they would find 
adventure and excitement in the open spaces as well as 
economic and political freedom.
<P>
	Some people come to Canada empty handed as political or 
economic refugees. The only fortune they can carry is their 
knowledge. A good education might be the only inheritance they 
can give their children. In all fairness we should help people 
make the most of what they have, not the least.
<P>
	A Statistics Canada report released last July titled ``Canada's 
Changing Immigrant Population'' points out that the labour 
force participation rate for Canadian immigrants was lower than 
that of Canadians born in Canada, despite the similar 
proportions of university degree holders in the two groups. 
Based on this information, the report concludes that recent 
arrivals  ``may take more time to adapt to Canada's labour 
market''.
<P>
	I submit that the more plausible alternative explanation is the 
absence of an effective process or mechanism for accreditation 
of foreign-obtained credentials. As compelling as the statistical 
data in the report are, it is the people behind the numbers who 
make the strongest case for an orderly system of accreditation.
<P>
	I would imagine that all members of this House are familiar 
with cases in which highly skilled immigrants have come to 
Canada only to find their foreign credentials do not entitle them 
to work in their field of expertise.
<P>
	A striking example was recently documented in an <I>Ottawa 
Citizen</I> article titled ``Educated immigrants face work barrier''. 
This story detailed the case of a woman physician from 
Honduras who arrived as a refugee in Canada and has been 
forced to clean houses to support her family.
<P>
	In my home province of Manitoba there are now close to 100 
medical doctors who want to practise the healing art. Yet 
barriers exist to prevent them from doing so. I know of one 
physician who recently immigrated with his family from 
Ukraine. He is unable to practise despite his impeccable foreign 
obtained credentials.
<P>
	This doctor and his family are not the only ones who suffer in 
this instance. Indeed our Winnipeg community incurs a loss as 
well, a loss of expertise. There are many more examples in many 
other disciplines and fields.
<P>
	Throughout Canada there are hundreds and thousands of 
highly skilled engineers, technologists, technicians, teachers, 
accountants, lawyers, mechanics, electricians, plumbers, 
dentists, nurses and many more. They have one thing in 
common. They chose Canada as their new home in which to 
raise their families. They want to contribute to the development 
and prosperity of their chosen land. I ask, how can we in 
conscience turn a deaf ear and a blind eye to them? How can we?
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	The issue of accreditation of foreign obtained credentials has 
been before this House since at least 1989 when this member 
took the issue before the Standing Committee on Industry, 
Science and Technology and the committee on health and 
welfare, social affairs, seniors and the status of women.
<P>
	I am pleased to note that both the Department of Human 
Resources Development and the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration today have now seized on the importance of this 
issue. A four part report released last year states and I quote: 
``Few examples of mutual recognition of foreign credentials 
within an occupation and between countries exist. This is in part 
due to differences in standards and curricula that exist between 
provinces. Recognition of qualifications between provinces 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7660"> 7660 </A></B>
<P>
must exist prior to mutual recognition of professional 
qualifications between two countries''.
<P>
	The report adds, and I again quote: ``Given the provincial 
nature of education and occupation regulation, the potential 
exists for duplication of effort-any lack of co-ordination 
between provinces could lead to-a foreign-trained worker 
receiving recognition in one province but not another''.
<P>
	The acknowledgement in the report of the importance of this 
issue clearly illustrates the need for the federal government to 
assert its leadership role by co-ordinating the efforts of the 
provinces in the area of accreditation.
<P>
	I am particularly pleased to see that a new government 
strategy released just two days ago by the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration has reinforced the intention of 
another department of this government to do just that.
<P>
	In the new framework for immigration titled ``Into the 21st 
Century'' the citizenship and immigration minister clearly 
states his support of one particular objective of the Department 
of Human Resources Development as indicated in its social 
security review book released last October 5.
<P>
	This objective is and I quote: ``To facilitate adaptation so that 
recent immigrants who come to Canada with needed job skills 
and professional qualification can more easily gain access to 
employment services and succeed in the transition to the 
Canadian labour market''.
<P>
	Furthermore, the document states that the two departments 
will work together to develop a national clearing house on 
accreditation in which the federal government will and I quote: 
``work with the provinces, employers, unions and voluntary 
groups to develop a Canada-wide system of credits recognition 
to assist immigrants to find and keep meaningful employment 
commensurate with their skills and knowledge''.
<P>
	Portability of occupational credentials across provincial 
boundaries is an important and relevant part of my motion. I am 
therefore pleased the agreement on internal trade signed by first 
ministers on July 18 of this year contains a chapter on labour 
mobility which limits the use of residency requirements and 
establishes a process for mutual recognition of occupational 
qualifications and requirements.
<P>
	This is crucial since without a co-ordinated national system 
of national accreditation, the idea of working with foreign 
governments to achieve the ultimate goal of mutual recognition 
seems more remote.
<P>
	Why is this joint effort on the part of the provinces and the 
federal government necessary? I would submit that the sheer 
complexity of the issues facing those who seek accreditation of 
their foreign obtained credentials will need to be confronted 
head on by experts culled from all areas of the country and all 
sectors of the government and the labour force.
<P>
I am therefore pleased to note that at the immigration deputy 
ministers' meetings in July and September of this year, a 
federal-provincial work group led by the provinces on access to 
trades and professions was established to advance co-operation 
on this issue.
<P>
	This approach eliminates the potential for duplication of 
effort and ensures that all interested parties are pulling in the 
same direction and thereby saves cost, time and perhaps 
personal anguish.
<P>
	We should remember that bureaucracies have a different 
sense of time than the people waiting for them to respond. What 
is swiftness for a government office can be agonizing delay to 
newcomers who are eager to work at their professions and trades 
and become part of their communities. The stage has been set for 
federal-provincial co-operation in this matter.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	That is why I again call upon all members of this House to 
support Motion No. 303, to support the efforts already under 
way to make accreditation of foreign credentials a more 
effective and efficient process. Accreditation of credentials 
should be a dynamic process, linking governments, professional 
bodies and schools.
<P>
	New categories of employment and new professions are 
emerging faster than ever before. We know that. We need the 
creative energy, optimism and determination of all these players 
if the process of accreditation is to become an instrument for 
facilitating personal mobility, national productivity and, not 
least, human dignity.
<P>
	Ultimately a successful accreditation system can ensure that 
Canadians, especially young Canadians, have qualifications 
which are respected and valued throughout the world, a truly 
urgent need and in our national interest. Indeed accreditation 
can open the world to Canada and to Canadians. In return, we 
open Canada to the world. Canada has much to offer and much to 
gain.
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe those of us who have benefited from 
the portability of credentials have an obligation, a duty to make 
a case for so many others who are not here to speak for 
themselves.
<P>
	I hope I have done them justice in my own little way. I hope 
this House will do them justice.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at first glance, 
the motion tabled by the member for Winnipeg North may seem 
quite interesting, since it provides that the government should, 
in co-operation with the provinces, seek to put in place a process 
aimed at ensuring the portability of credentials obtained in and 
outside Canada in order to fully utilize the talents, skills and 
experience of all Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7661"> 7661 </A></B>
<P>
	In other words, the member wants skills acquired in a 
province to be recognized in the other provinces as well as in 
other countries. To that end, the member proposes that the 
federal government, in co-operation with the provinces, seek to 
put in place a recognition process of credentials. However, one 
can see that this motion is very much in the spirit of the social 
program reform.
<P>
	Indeed, one of the proposals made by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development in his discussion paper is the delivery 
of a learning passport. The passport would, in one place, 
document an individual's learning experience as well as any 
academic and vocational credentials, and would be recognized 
across the country by employers and learning institutions.
<P>
	Such an initiative would require national education standards. 
However, it just so happens that, according to the Constitution, 
and this is something the Official Opposition keeps repeating, 
education falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces. 
For the majority of provinces, except Quebec, manpower 
mobility does not pose any linguistic problem, since the English 
language is used. There might be a problem with New 
Brunswick, which has a large proportion of French-speaking 
people, but in the majority of provinces this does not present any 
problem.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	I have to relate an historical event, which occurred in 1990 
and which disappointed many Quebecers. There was the 
Charlottetown Accord but, before that, the Meech Lake Accord 
was also rejected. One thing which disappointed a lot of 
Quebecers has to do with the recognition of Quebec as a distinct 
society, based on its language and its culture. As sociologist Guy 
Rocher often points out, culture is a group's own way of 
thinking, acting and feeling. In other words, the difference is not 
merely of a linguistic nature.
<P>
	In Quebec, not only do we have a different way of thinking, 
acting and feeling, but we also have a civil code which, as 
members opposite know, is totally different from the one used 
elsewhere in the country. In Quebec, we have a civil code based 
on the Napoleonic Code. It goes back a number of years but was 
updated last year by the previous Liberal government, involving 
a lot of work and extensive changes.
<P>
	Incidentally, when we consider our legal system, all citizens 
are concerned and not just lawyers. We always go by the 
principle that everyone is supposed to know the law. But here, 
we have a whole collection of different standards.
<P>
	If we allow mobility in the case of education, for instance, 
what about language? To have a standard that is acceptable 
across the country, how many hours of second language or first 
language courses should be offered from coast to coast? I see 
this as a major problem.
<P>
If a proposal in this respect were up to the provincial Ministers 
of Education who could try to define minimum standards that 
would be acceptable to all concerned, we could go along with 
that, because the Bloc Quebecois does not think Quebecers 
should live in a vacuum. It has never been opposed to the 
principle of free trade, and I mean free trade in more than goods 
and services. Free trade also involves individuals who move 
around to sell and promote their products, for instance.
<P>
	However, when we get to the question of manpower training 
and professional qualifications, Quebec does not operate the 
same way the other provinces do, with a few exceptions.
<P>
	We do not want to be perceived as people who are against what 
English Canada wants to do, if it is against exchanges between 
the English-speaking provinces. And we are not, whether we are 
sovereign or operating under a federal system, against 
exchanges between individuals in Quebec and the other 
provinces, nor do we have any objection to Quebecers being able 
to work, for instance, in NAFTA member countries such as the 
United States, Mexico or elsewhere.
<P>
	It is an interesting principle, but to implement the proposal 
made by the hon. member for Winnipeg North, we must consider 
setting standards in the field of education. I understand the hon. 
member's emphasis on co-operation and I admire his 
democratic philosophy, but as far as implementing this approach 
is concerned, we must remember that for years there has been a 
very strong consensus in Quebec among all parties on 
professional training. However, for more than a decade, there 
has been no agreement on how governments should operate in 
this area.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Considering that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development was unable to get the provincial ministers 
responsible for education and professional training on side, 
co-operation would seem to be a major problem. If we consider 
education and financial assistance, we saw, for instance, in Bill 
C-28 that the Minister of Human Resources Development had a 
number of new provisions to increase his discretionary powers, 
while formerly, it was up to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council 
to determine who is the appropriate authority for education, 
while according to the new provisions, the minister himself 
would be able to designate the appropriate authority. He 
becomes some sort of a super education minister for the whole 
country, once again infringing upon an area of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	If the invitation from the member for Winnipeg North was 
well received by the provincial education ministers, together, at 
their own level, they could define a set of minimum standards, 
regardless of the political context, be it sovereignty or the status 
quo. If these ministers could agree on some minimum standards, 
they may not have to be wall-to-wall in agreement to have 
specific provisions for Quebec, and recognize Quebec as a  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7662"> 7662 </A></B>
<P>
distinct society, while having different standards for the rest of 
Canada.
<P>
	The more I attend the meetings of the committee on human 
resources development, the more I listen to people from across 
Canada, the more I realize that in this country, there are two 
different countries and people with a totally different mind-set. 
In English Canada, people identify more strongly with the 
central government, that is the federal government, whereas in 
Quebec, we identify with our provincial government. In English 
Canada, when there is disagreement between the agencies and 
the province, people favour the federal government; this is 
somehow what the proposal from the member for Winnipeg 
North does. I believe it deserves to be taken into consideration, 
but in its present form, it is unacceptable to Quebec. The 
responsibility should lie solely with the provincial education 
ministers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak on this well intentioned 
motion.
<P>
	I appreciate also the desire of my colleague to make the 
portability of credentials across the country easier for 
professionals and for those in the trades. There is no question 
that in our increasingly mobile society many people do 
experience difficulties and frustrations when trying to start a 
professional practice or to practise a trade in a different region.
<P>
	I also appreciate better than most I suspect the frustration 
many new Canadians have with the credential process that exists 
across the country. Many individuals in my riding have 
expressed this concern to me and I understand where my hon. 
colleague is coming from.
<P>
	However, I fear that my hon. colleague, the author of this 
motion does not understand the implication of the proposed 
measure. Further I believe we can conclude only one of two 
things about my hon. colleague and his government from this 
motion. Either he does not have a good understanding of how the 
business profession and trades work in this country or he does 
not care and is willing to see the imposition of a profound 
draconian government control over areas that should not be 
controlled.
<P>
	Should this motion become a bill I have no doubt that tens of 
thousands of people who belong to professions that would be 
affected by this measure would make the folly of this motion 
very evident indeed. Allow me to lay out how it is that trades and 
professions such as the ones that would be affected by this 
motion are credentialled and what effect this motion if it 
actually became policy, which it will not, would have. Let us use 
the examples of doctors, lawyers and engineers.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Doctors, whether inside or outside Canada, must receive 
degrees in medicine from recognized universities and then they 
must write exams under the observation of provincial medical 
associations. Only then will they be allowed to practise in the 
province and in Canada. Granted, recently some barriers have 
been placed in the way of doctors who want to practise in a 
province other than the one they have written an exam in, but 
those restrictions have happened because of a surplus of doctors 
in some areas and have reflected the best judgments of the 
provinces and the provincial medical boards.
<P>
	Engineers educated in Canada and receiving their degrees 
must write an exam in each province they wish to practise in. 
The exam deals with local safety codes and local standards. The 
province specific exam is necessary since each province has its 
own safety standards and its own building and engineering 
codes. These are standards and practices unique in that 
province.
<P>
	Should someone come into the country with a degree in 
engineering from a university that is not recognized and if that 
graduate has at least two years of experience they are permitted 
to write an additional examination more strenuous than the first 
for obvious reasons. It tests not only the knowledge of local 
codes and standards but also their general ability and knowledge 
of the field they are intending to practise in. After passing this 
exam they are able to practise in that province.
<P>
	It has come to my attention that there are many engineering 
graduates educated abroad who are not able to pass the second 
more strenuous exam. While that difficulty is undoubtedly 
heartbreaking for the exam taker, we cannot avoid the 
observation that it reflects a lack of knowledge of standards and 
of techniques and practices in Canada. Those who are not up to 
the Canadian standard of knowledge and excellence should not, 
with all due respect, be allowed to practise.
<P>
	I think my hon. colleague knows how the regulations of legal 
credentials work in Canada across the provinces. After an 
individual graduates from an English Canadian law school he or 
she must write a bar exam regulated by the provincial bar that 
allows him or her to practise in that province. My hon. colleague 
from the Bloc just pointed out some of the pitfalls in that region 
alone.
<P>
	Is this protectionism? Is it guarding one's own turf? Of course 
it is and for good reason. I know I am stating the obvious, but 
this motion is so contrary to common sense when one sits down 
and really looks at it. A statement of the obvious is necessary to 
demonstrate that it is not workable.
<P>
	Each province has its own laws, a wealth of laws, volumes and 
volumes of laws. Those specific laws require such a degree of 
specialized knowledge it is imperative that provincial bars 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7663"> 7663 </A></B>
<P>
protect the consumers of the province by requiring tested 
knowledge of those laws.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Not in criminal law.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Well criminal law is a partial exception but still 
there are requirements for the particular province. It is 
imperative to the consumers of the legal profession that local 
bars protect them from free floaters who would like to practise 
everywhere or anywhere in the country but would not have a 
degree of knowledge of the provincial laws that would allow for 
a proper and responsible practice.
<P>
	I will admit that things might be easier to manage if the 
credential process were centralized if the feds took it over, or 
regulated credentialing. Easier is not necessarily better.
<P>
	Yes, professionals and those with specialized trade skills are 
protected to some degree from overseas competition by strict 
credentialing. Granted, professionals in each province might 
even be protected to some degree by the control local 
professional guilds have over credentials but so is the consumer 
and so are standards of quality. The system is not perfect. 
Professional guilds can become protective and inward looking 
and there is no question about that. We have seen several 
examples of the barriers that are imposed.
<P>
	However, we must ask the philosophical question: Who can 
do a better job of looking after quality standards of a profession 
and the interests of consumers of specialized services, 
professional guilds or the federal government? Who should be 
allowed to impose regulations, those who are intimately 
involved in the delivery of the specialized service or product, or 
the federal government?
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Where should the onus for protection of consumers and the 
regulations of local standards be located? Locally or in Ottawa? 
Needless to say the Reform Party believes that things affecting 
provinces directly must be under the direct purview of the 
provinces. The more local the better; the more decentralized the 
better.
<P>
	There is a fundamental philosophical difference between 
myself and my party and my hon. colleague from Winnipeg 
North. We believe Ottawa should play as small a role as possible 
in the affairs of the provinces and in the affairs of business and 
the professions.
<P>
	We believe consumers must be protected from abuse not by 
Ottawa but by the provinces. Where the private sector can do an 
adequate job of something we believe the government at any 
level has no business whatsoever getting involved. I know that is 
not the opinion of my colleague. Obviously not.
<P>
The proof is in the pudding. The motion if passed, which I hope 
it never will be, would establish a bureaucrat monster not unlike 
so many of the bureaucratic monsters that currently lurk in this 
town.
<P>
	In closing I applaud the intentions of my colleague but this 
will not work and it should not be allowed to happen.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by applauding this initiative of 
my colleague from Winnipeg North. Why? Because it is a very 
important point. What is he seeking? He is not seeking any 
special power for Ottawa or trying to impose undue constraints. 
What he is trying to do is bring some justice to the men and 
women who come to Canada. He wants their degrees to be 
considered in a fair, objective and serious manner.
<P>
	Why is he proposing this? Because we have a number of 
Canadian men and women, born and educated abroad, who are 
qualified for specialized jobs, but cannot get recognition due to 
the lack of any mechanism to review their degrees.
<P>
	I am sorry, but the hon. member did not understand what my 
colleague is proposing. Why he is proposing this? Because the 
present situation not only creates injustices, it also deprives 
Canadians or landed immigrants from finding the job they are 
qualified for, the job that would challenge them, the job they 
really want.
<P>
	My colleague is seeking a process, a mechanism which will 
not only bring some justice to these people, but will also allow 
them to work in their field of expertise. That is what he wants, 
nothing else.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The motion would achieve a couple of very important 
objectives. It would address out of country qualifications which 
we must do. It is a mess right now. It does not ask that Ottawa do 
it; it asks that it be done. Bring the partners together and work it 
out. Of course we are going to be sensitive to language.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Clearly, except in an emergency, we do not want to send 
somewhere a medical practitioner who speaks neither French 
nor English, and will not understand his patients. Of course we 
will be sensitive to that, we have to, and that is what my 
colleague is proposing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It would also address the in-country qualifications. We are 
like 10 or 12 separate countries. My colleague and I understand 
that there are profound differences but there are also 
similarities. We are not asking anyone to give up their culture, 
their language, their constitutional responsibilities, or whatever 
it is they have to do. We are asking people if we can sit down and 
make it better for  Canadians whether they were born in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7664"> 7664 </A></B>
<P>
country or out of the country. That is what my colleague is 
recognizing.
<P>
	The previous speaker said that he hoped this would not 
happen. I have news for him. It may. I note that the Minister of 
Human Resources Development and the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration have recognized a need. I want to quote from a 
recent document which is a year old: ``There are few examples 
of mutual recognition of foreign credentials within an 
occupation and between countries''. In other words this does not 
exist. They have recognized that need. The report goes on to say: 
``Recognition of qualifications between provinces must exist 
prior to mutual recognition of professional qualifications 
between two countries''. They could have added territories.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	In a more recent report entitled ``Into the 21st Century'' the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration had this to say: ``To 
facilitate adaptation so that recent immigrants who come to 
Canada with needed job skills and professional qualifications 
can more easily gain access to employment services and succeed 
in the transition to the Canadian labour market''.
<P>
	That is what my colleague from Winnipeg North is trying to 
do. It is not to create a monster in Ottawa. It is not to try to crush 
people, to take away the constitutional responsibilities or to be 
insensitive to their cultural rights, imperatives, dreams and 
desires.
<P>
	There is more. This is a key for the speaker who just preceded 
me. These two departments will ``work with the provinces, 
employers, unions and voluntary groups to develop a 
Canada-wide system of credits recognition to assist immigrants 
to find and keep meaningful employment commensurate with 
their skills and knowledge''. That is what these two departments 
will do. I applaud that initiative and the insight of those 
ministers.
<P>
	I want to repeat, as my colleague said, that there was an 
agreement signed on July 18 by the first ministers, the 
agreement on internal trade which established a process for 
mutual recognition of occupational qualifications and 
requirements. A lot has been done.
<P>
	Here we are with 10 to 12 separate jurisdictions and we are 
going to quarrel about whether or not a doctor, teacher, plumber 
or electrician can come and work on my turf. If I am having a 
serious heart attack, Mr. Speaker, I hope you will not ask the 
doctor if he or she is from Manitoba; send him over very quickly.
<P>
	Why is it that the European countries, even though they have 
different traditions and different languages, can come to grips 
with it and can resolve the problem? I guess my colleagues 
really think that we are not as able as the Europeans. I assure the 
House, with all due respect to those gentlemen and gentle ladies, 
that we can do as much. Perhaps we can even do more because 
we can use their example and hopefully we can improve it.
<P>
I have more news for my colleagues. There is what we call the 
red seal initiative in Canada. It involves 42 trades and 
professions that can go from one part of the country to another. 
Nobody gives them any hassle. Why? It is because it was a 
process. They have the red seal. If we can do it in certain areas 
and we have done it, why can we not extend it? Where is that 
huge monster that has been created in coming to grips with that? 
There is no huge monster. It is in the imagination of men and 
women who sometimes do not let their spirits soar.
<P>
	There is also the Canadian Information Centre for 
International Credentials that helps people try to get some 
appropriate attention. I have more: the Council of Ministers of 
Education for Canada. I wish my colleague were still able to 
hear me; perhaps he can. There is so much information here that 
it may be overwhelming.
<P>
	There will be a report out by September 1995 on public 
schools to say how we might be able to transfer more easily. 
Thank goodness. That is common sense. The Council of 
Ministers of Education intends to remove university barriers by 
the fall of 1996. There is more. Then it is the colleges. I would 
think it was about time.
<P>
	I have some really good information for my friends in the 
Bloc.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
He may not know it, but one of the best mechanisms to evaluate 
credentials is in Quebec.
<P>
	I find it extraordinary, almost incredible, that he should be 
unable to support enthusiastically, energetically, my colleague's 
motion.
<P>
	We have international agreements. We have GATT, we have 
NAFTA. We have all kinds of agreements everywhere in the 
world and more coming every day.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	We are supposed to want to be more open to the world, yet we 
have barriers that prevent us from talking to each other, helping 
one another and working together. Barriers erected by men and 
women, because they did not know enough, because they wanted 
to protect their own little world rather than open up and say: 
``Here is what we have, what do you have? Can we work 
together?''
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to end on that note. We have all these international 
agreements and there will be more. We are opening up to the 
world and the world is unfolding. We need to unfold with it. We 
need to open our minds to the possibilities that are reflected in 
my colleague's insightful and very timely proposal.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7665"> 7665 </A></B>
<P>
	There is no monster here. There is a search for fairness and 
justice and equity for those who are born outside of Canada as 
well as those born in Canada so that we can move more freely 
from one area of our great country to another and so that we can 
move to other countries in the world and so that others who come 
into our country can be appreciated for their just worth. Let it 
not be an arbitrary process. Let it be a process that good thinking 
men and women have thought out and have applied so that we 
can treat our fellow human beings with dignity.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great regret that I follow the member for St. 
Boniface. I would have preferred to speak before him. He has 
certainly given a very passionate and powerful articulation of 
support for my colleague for Winnipeg North.
<P>
	In my own modest way I would also like to stand and give my 
own support to this member's motion. I have two personal 
situations I would like to put before the House with regard to this 
particular issue.
<P>
	I worked previously in the field of employment equity with 
the Ontario universities before coming to the House as a 
parliamentarian. I would like to congratulate the member on this 
motion because he addresses something of real concern to the 
academic communities in this country. By addressing these 
concerns we will realize more equitable employment practices 
in our universities.
<P>
	Often foreign credentials are rejected not on the basis of real 
difference in academic standards but have more to do with the 
perceptions that are based on stereotypes and lack of 
information.
<P>
	The member for Winnipeg North has truly recognized an 
opportunity to provide all Canadians, those who have been here 
for a long time or those who are new to this country, the ability to 
fully contribute all of their skills to Canadian society.
<P>
	The member has also identified another serious problem 
which is portability within this country. I draw an example from 
my own family to the attention of the House. My sister was a 
dental hygienist in Ontario. She moved to Alberta and had to go 
through a recertification and testing process. If the member 
opposite were concerned about bureaucracy and all of this I 
would suggest this is a real case of bureaucracy and wasted 
resources for my sister to have to go through this. As well, there 
was a considerable level of stress.
<P>
	I would also like to point out, as my hon. colleague on this 
side of the House has already done, there were a number of 
things ignored by the member opposite in terms of some of his 
remarks. A lot of professions and trades have standard practices 
and there are no problems with portability across this country 
for accreditation.
<P>
	With new Canadians coming to this country, particularly in 
the medical profession, he said they have to pass stringent 
medical tests. I agree with him. We want to ensure that we have 
capable and skilled individuals practising medicine in this 
country. However, in many  cases newcomers to this country are 
denied the opportunity to even take these exams.
<P>
	If the member opposite has read any newspapers in recent 
months he would realize that the federal and provincial 
governments are moving to harmonization on many different 
fronts. This is just one example of how we can work together 
co-operatively in this country.
<P>
	I mentioned bureaucracy. Let us talk about 11 kinds of 
bureaucracy in this country. We have to challenge those kinds of 
overlap and duplication.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	The costs. There is a cost to our society and to human talent in 
that they have to continually go through these things if they 
choose to move to another province.
<P>
	We had an idea in the red book which I hope this government 
will continue to act on called the national apprenticeship 
program. This was lauded by industry and a number of people in 
my riding. I campaigned on this. If we take a look at a country 
like Germany, one of the reasons it is so strong industrially is 
because it has a very strong national apprenticeship program.
<P>
	The process this government had proposed was to have these 
standards co-developed by industry, government and the 
educational sector. Again I would like to say that I fully support 
this member's motion. I thank him for bringing this very 
important issue to the attention of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak 
to this motion with great pleasure because I have been very 
privileged to have received an education and also to have 
worked in the education field all of my life to this stage, some 31 
years.
<P>
	I taught high school for four years. It is illustrative to what the 
hon. member is saying when we talk about the portability of 
credentials to tell members about an occurrence when I first 
started my teaching career.
<P>
	The hon. member for Saskatoon across the way will 
appreciate the fact that I am a graduate of the University of 
Saskatchewan in Saskatoon. When I first graduated from that 
illustrious institution and tried to get a job in my home province, 
because I had a high degree of loyalty, unfortunately most of the 
school boards in that province thought I was over qualified since 
I had two degrees. I was very young and inexperienced. They 
said they could get a teacher with some experience and less 
training for less money. I was not able to get a job, but they hired 
me in Alberta.
<P>
	It was very interesting. I went to a rural county in Alberta. I 
applied for a job in writing. The superintendent phoned and 
asked me whether I could come and work. He offered me a job. I 
sad: ``Ho, you have not interviewed me. You have not seen my 
credentials''. He said something that is very fitting to this 
debate: ``We have hired a great number of teachers from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7666"> 7666 </A></B>
<P>
Saskatchewan and we have not yet regretted one of  them''. We 
could all applaud that for the University of Saskatchewan.
<P>
	There are differences in credentials accruing to the place at 
which one got an education. The University of Saskatchewan 
built a reputation in western Canada that teachers trained in the 
faculty of education-it was called the College of Education at 
that time-were well trained and were able to compete.
<P>
	Hon. members are going to have to think very carefully when I 
state this statistic because it is a catchy one. One of the people 
who was from Saskatchewan who taught in that rural county in 
southern Alberta said that the worst teachers from 
Saskatchewan go to Alberta and the teaching standards in both 
provinces rise. If one knows statistics they will get the 
significance of that statement.
<P>
	I would like to also relate the fact that I taught at a 
post-secondary technical institute for 27 years. Here I have a 
point that is very important. We need to hear this. It is a waste of 
financial resources to try to train people who are not ready, who 
do not have the prerequisites. I believe it is very important as our 
students go all the way from kindergarten through grade 12 that 
at each level there be a good degree of quality control and that 
they be passed on to the next grade only when they have 
achieved a certain standard.
<P>
	Teaching in a post-secondary institute for 27 years, I have 
experienced receiving there many students, some of whom were 
really sharp, whiz kids with good intelligence and good prior 
education. They did very well. Some of those students however 
were not as intelligent. They did not have the same mental 
capacity. There is nothing wrong with that. It is the same when I 
run in a race. I am at the tail end of the race, physically speaking. 
Mentally there is also a variation.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	I am proud to say that many students who were of average 
intelligence in the post-secondary institute where I worked did 
very well because they were able to compensate for that by 
good, solid, hard work. They did very well. They graduated, 
some of them with high marks, and they went on and chose their 
careers.
<P>
	A number of my students passed me in earnings. A number of 
my students have already retired. They earned so much money 
they could afford to do that due to the training that they got. Not 
all of them were exceptional students. They were just hard 
workers.
<P>
	I want to come to this point of international education. I also 
experienced on a number of occasions foreign students. We had 
a number of students from foreign countries who excelled just 
the same as we had students from Alberta, from other provinces 
in Canada, some from the United States and many from other 
foreign countries.
<P>
We had them on the whole spectrum. Some were really good 
students. They breezed through the work. Some were average 
and there were some with difficulty. I am thinking of one young 
man from a foreign country who came to us. Our prerequisites in 
the programs I taught in required a grade 12 when they came in. 
That is from Alberta standards. I do not know how that compares 
with grade 13 here but it is probably comparable to grade 12.
<P>
	This poor student-I liked him-did not have the 
prerequisites. Somehow he got into this country on the 
credentials of his government. He enrolled in our institute and 
consistently got zero in his exams. It just tore me apart but I 
could not begin to give him marks because I was training a 
person who was going to work, providing services to other 
people. I could not give him marks that did not reflect his actual 
ability.
<P>
	I counselled him and tried to help him. I tried to persuade him 
to go backward, to take a lower level course, to get the 
prerequisites and to get up to speed. There we found a real 
problem because of the fact that there were no international 
standards, no agreement.
<P>
	That part of what the member is proposing in this bill in terms 
of standards between provinces-we could extend that-should 
simply be expanded so that we have a quality control system, a 
testing system. Before students move on and particularly before 
they graduate they should be required to demonstrate an ability, 
a competency that is truly worthy of the profession or of the 
trade that they have entered.
<P>
	My last comment is going to be with respect to the federal 
government's involvement. We all know that the constitutional 
mandate for education at the pre-post-secondary level is a 
provincial jurisdiction. We need to move in this country not to a 
federally mandated, federally controlled, federally organized, 
federal bureaucratic system but to a system whereby provincial 
governments will voluntarily get together in order to establish 
some national standards.
<P>
	The same is true for post-secondary institutions, whether they 
are technical institutes like the one I worked at or universities or 
trades. It is very important. We need to have national standards 
so that there can be free trade among our trained people as well 
as among our goods. We need to have free trade in this country in 
order to be strong economically and to be able to compete 
internationally.
<P>
	I would favour that. I would be opposed to the federal 
government doing that. Let it help in terms of getting the 
provinces together but let us not create another federal 
bureaucracy. I have found in my experience that when we work 
with a federal bureaucracy we all get pulled down to the lowest 
common denominator.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	Let us, rather, establish standards and allow the individual 
provinces to work and work hard in their organization, in their 
training, in their statistical quality control so that we have the 
very best trained people who we can possibly have.
<P>
	I am very grateful for the opportunity to be able to add this to 
this debate.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time has lapsed but I 
will underwrite a reply and recognize the member for Winnipeg

member to pose his remarks within the framework of no more 
than two minutes.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Thank you, 
Mr. Speaker, for your kind consideration. I would like to thank 
all the participants in the debate, those who supported the 
motion and even those who were not prepared to support the 
motion at this time. I am an optimistic person and I hope that in 
due course they will see the beauty and wisdom of this motion.
<P>
	My point is to ensure that an orderly process, a mechanism, be 
put in place. The best way that I can think of is to challenge and 
allow the federal government to play the co-ordinating 
leadership role, not to take from the jurisdiction of the provinces 
but to ensure that in this process we will attain the ultimate goal 
and that is what Canada can do for its citizens and what citizens 
can give to their country.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired.

the Order Paper.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CHEMICALWEAPONS">CHEMICAL WEAPONS</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on October 21 I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs 
when Canada would introduce legislation to ratify the chemical 
weapons convention and what Canada was doing to support the 
enforcement agency which was to be set up in The Hague.
<P>
	The chemical weapons convention is the result of 24 years of 
work at the Geneva disarmament conference and had its origins 
in the first world war when poison gas attacks caused 1.3 million 
casualties and 100,000 fatalities. Canadians will recall that 
many Canadian soldiers were killed by gas attacks in the first 
world war. Therefore this treaty should mean a lot.
<P>
Following the first world war and the horror of people all over 
the world at the use of gas during that conflict, there was an 
attempt to get a treaty to ban chemical weapons. We did get the 
1925 Geneva protocol which banned the use of chemical 
weapons in war, but there was no enforcement agency and there 
was no provision against the production or stockpiling or 
trading in chemical weapons.
<P>
	This treaty that I am talking about tonight was signed in Paris, 
France in the middle of January 1993. It bans the use of chemical 
weapons and also the development, manufacture, distribution, 
transfer and stockpiling of chemical weapons. It also provides 
for the monitoring, inspection and enforcement of the treaty and 
provides for penalties when the treaty is broken.
<P>
	It is the most complete disarmament treaty ever developed 
and has the most comprehensive system of verification and 
compliance of any multilateral disarmament treaty.
<P>
	The problem is that while the treaty was signed by 150 
countries, it requires 65 ratifications to make it enforceable. So 
far only 16 have ratified after nearly two years. Only 16 have 
ratified and we need 65 to make it enforceable.
<P>
	I put my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs: When 
will Canada table legislation to ratify this treaty and what is it 
doing to support the enforcement agency which is called the 
organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons to be set 
up in The Hague in the Netherlands?
<P>
	I would hope the minister's parliamentary secretary would 
have an answer for me tonight.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know that the hon. 
member is the past president of Parliamentarians for Global 
Action and is a continuing member on the international 
executive.
<P>
	Through that organization I know the hon. member has 
devoted much time and energy to convince leaders and 
politicians around the world to ban the production, stockpiling 
and use of all chemical weapons.
<P>
	In view of the fact that 150 countries signed such a treaty 
indicates that the will is there, but it must be disappointing to the 
hon. member that only 16 countries out of the 65 required have 
ratified the treaty in their Parliaments.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member though that with his assistance 
our government will likely table the required bill in this House 
in the new year, contingent on interdepartmental and industry 
consultations which are currently under way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7668"> 7668 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition to the information provided to the hon. member by 
the secretary of state I can tell him that pending ratification of 
the chemical weapons convention Canada pays a yearly 
contribution to support the activities of the preparatory 
commission for the prohibition of chemical weapons, the 
enforcement organization known as OPCW.
<P>
	Canada has also created the chemical weapons convention 
action fund which provides grants to organizations or 
individuals who undertake activities to raise awareness about 
and compliance to the chemical weapons convention either 
internationally or within Canada.
<P>
	In addition to this direct financial contribution, Canada has 
created two positions at our embassy in The Hague to participate 
in the various preparatory activities and to represent Canada's 
interests at the preparatory commission or the OPCW.
<P>
	Other Canadian officials with special expertise have been 
made available to the OPCW for work on special committees, in 
particular a Canadian chairs the committee on chemical 
weapons storage issues which is responsible for drafting the 
model facility agreement which will be the basis for all future 
facility agreements.
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce 
for taking international leadership in making this planet a safer 
place for our children and their children.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TOURISM">TOURISM</A></H4>
	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to take this opportunity to emphasize the importance of the 
Prime Minister's announcement of October 26 which created the 
Canadian Tourism Commission and added a new boost of 
federal funding to the tourism industry.
<P>
	Most Canadians do appreciate the features that our country 
has to offer from our shores to our plains to our mountains and 
the fact that these are simply backdrops for a variety of cultural 
and sporting pursuits that Canadians and visitors can follow.
<P>
	I wonder if Canadians are aware that the care of those visitors 
employed 1.2 million people in 1993 and generated $30 billion 
in revenue which lead to $11 billion in tax receipts. These 
numbers are impressive but we know there is tremendous room 
for growth here because Canada has recently slipped from being 
the sixth most popular tourist destination in the world to the 
tenth today.
<P>
	In this competitive world it is important to know your 
strengths and to emphasize them. That is why the Prime 
Minister has shown leadership here by recognizing this industry 
and this particular way that we might improve our economy by 
investing federal funds.
<P>
Today when most Canadians are concerned about the deficit and 
the financial situation of their country this is good news because 
this is going to be money well invested.
<P>
	It also is an opportunity for Canadians to help with that deficit 
reduction, with that increase in jobs and increase in the economy 
because Canadians make decisions about their tourism 
destinations, where they are going to go on their vacation and 
how they are going to spend their money.
<P>
	I think the Prime Minister is showing leadership and he is 
inviting Canadians to join in this effort to pick Canadian 
destinations, to show their children Canadian attractions, 
Canadian mountains, Canadian rivers, et cetera, and to help us in 
this pursuit.
<P>
	Canadians have been asking me in my riding how they can 
assist with the deficit reduction. They are showing tremendous 
generosity and a team spirit in this effort and I wanted to share 
this idea with them today because perhaps they are planning 
their vacations for next year right now.
<P>
	I would like to follow up my earlier question with a question 
to the parliamentary secretary, asking him what he sees as far as 
future job possibilities based on the Prime Minister's 
announcement of the Canadian Tourism Commission and the 
investing of a large number of federal funds in this industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to respond to the characteristically eloquent and excellent 
question asked by the hon. member for Oakville-Milton on the 
tourism industry in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	As the member has indicated, the government has recently 
announced a tourism strategy that recognizes the importance of 
this industry. Tourism is big business in Canada.
<P>
	As the member has also stated, it is an industry that provides 
hundreds of thousands of jobs and produces billions of dollars 
for our gross domestic product.
<P>
	We believe that tourism also has the unique ability to create 
jobs not at the entry level alone but, contrary to the perception of 
some, in higher skilled, higher paid categories.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's special advisor on tourism, Mr. 
Buchanan, stated in his report that a Team Canada approach is 
essential in the tourism industry. As the Prime Minister said, the 
federal government for its part accepts Mr. Buchanan's 
recommendations.
<P>
	Mr. Buchanan and the Minister of Industry will work together 
to establish a Canadian tourism commission by the new year. 
This commission will be a partnership of the industry and both 
levels of government with the board of directors made up of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7669"> 7669 </A></B>
<P>
representatives of the  tourism industry, provincial and 
territorial governments and the federal government. It will help 
us to co-ordinate our efforts and get the most out of limited 
resources.
<P>
	We agreed with Mr. Buchanan and the hon. member that for 
the tourism industry to be able to create new jobs the federal 
government should increase its spending on tourism promotion 
at home and abroad. The federal government is increasing its 
spending on tourism by $35 million to a budget of $50 million. 
The goal in this new partnership is to create a $100 million 
marketing fund that will re-establish Canada as a force in the 
global tourism industry.
<P>
	When we fully achieve the partnership between government 
and the industry that the Buchanan report has recommended we 
will create many thousands of new jobs for Canadians all over 
the country. We will generate considerable new revenues for 
companies, for Canada and for all levels of government. I might 
add that we will substantially improve our balance of payments.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CARREFOURJEUNESSE-EMPLOI">CARREFOUR JEUNESSE-EMPLOI</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday I 
tried to get an answer to my question. I hope to get one today. I 
am not sure who will answer. In any case, it is up to the 
government to decide.
<P>
	Yesterday, I asked the Minister of Human Resources 
Development about an incident reported to the media. It 
involved a young unemployed who had been told not to go to 
Carrefour Jeunesse-Emploi, in Gatineau, but instead go to 
another centre, to find work. The reason given was that 
Carrefour Jeunesse-Emploi had a job-search group which had 
lost its funding of $240,000. In spite of enjoying strong support 
from the community, that agency had not managed to convince 
the Department of Human Resources Development to review the 
decision. We know that the money thus saved was given to other 
centres, including a new one set up in the neighbouring riding, 
which just happens to be the riding of the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	So, this was not a real saving: It was a transfer of funds. One 
excuse made was that Carrefour Jeunesse-Emploi wanted to 
provide its services to people who were not getting UI benefits. 
In this case, the young man was entitled to unemployment 
insurance benefits, but could not avail himself of the new 
service provided by Carrefour Jeunesse-Emploi, because the 
civil servant concerned forbade him to do so. He wanted the 
young man to go to another centre.
<P>
	We asked the minister if he could justify this action. 
Unfortunately, the minister says that it is a judgment by 
employment counsellors as to the advice they give to clients of 
our employment centres as to the best services that can be 
provided to them.
<P>
In other words, having delegated his authority, the minister was 
saying that nothing could be done. He allows civil servants to 
resort to blackmail. He added that the La Relance project has a 
75 per cent success rate, which is why people were referred to it. 
Carrefour Jeunesse-Emploi also has a 75 per cent success rate.
<P>
	In the second part of his answer, the minister stated that cuts 
were made, but that Carrefour Jeunesse-Emploi receives 
$550,000 from the federal government, compared to only 
$100,000 from the province of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	On checking today, we find that the province contributes 
approximately $600,000 to Carrefour Jeunesse-Emploi and that 
the contribution of the constituency is $50,000. This is far from 
the five to one ratio that the minister mentioned yesterday 
during Question Period, which was more a question period than 
an answer period, since the answer was not satisfactory.
<P>
	As we can see, cuts are being made in youth training centres 
by the Department of Human Resources Development while 
consultations are being held on the social program reform. The 
government did not even wait for the consultation results to go 
ahead with these cuts. If only this was to achieve savings. But 
no. The money saved will be transferred to other ridings, and the 
province and the federal government will continue to wrestle 
with each other. This will only maintain the indescribable mess 
in manpower training in Quebec.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the federal government is trying to establish the 
Canadian Youth Service Corps at $10,000 per participant, when 
Carrefour Jeunesse-Emploi in Gatineau only cost $1,000 grant 
for each and every young participant. A survey of the people 
who found a job in previous years with the help of Carrefour 
Jeunesse-Emploi shows that, with an investment of $240,000, 
those who found a job paid $1,385,000 in federal taxes.
<P>
	So, it was profitable for the government. In spite of this, the 
government still continues to thwart Quebec's job training 
objectives, by going after a centre in Quebec which already was 
a one-stop service centre, and provided a great number of 
services to young people. And because one criterion to lower the 
number of people receiving unemployment insurance benefits is 
not being met, young men and women are being blackmailed.
<P>
	I am hoping for a satisfactory answer and especially a 
comment indicating that this will stop.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the 
priorities of this government is the training and adjustment 
needs of youths.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7670"> 7670 </A></B>
<P>
	Until recently two job finding clubs were in operation in the 
Outaouais region offering many of the same services. Given 
budget limitations and based on the needs of the local labour 
market in that area, the local Canada Employment Centre in 
consultation with the Outaouais community has chosen to 
finance La Relance which has a 75 per cent success rate in 
helping participants find a job within a three month period.
<P>
	This choice will enable us to serve 25 per cent more clients 
than we would have had we kept both contracts with reduced 
budgets. This decision was supported by the community. 
L'association des services alternatifs de développement de 
l'employabilité de l'Outaouais unanimously proposed that there 
be only one job finding club in the area and supported La 
Relance job club proposal.
<P>
	With respect to the hon. member's accusations, the 
department of human resources is responsible to Canadians as to 
the use of their tax dollars. Because of this responsibility, it 
must purchase the most effective programs available for its 
clients.
<P>
	When referring UI claimants for training, employment 
counsellors ensure that the needs of the clients are met. 
Counsellors always try to be flexible in order to accommodate 
their client's wishes.
<P>
	The local Canada Employment Centre will no doubt continue 
to refer some UI claimants to Carrefour Jeunesse-Emploi. Even 
though the club's primary objective is focused on non-UI 
claimants, each case will be examined individually.
<P>
	It will be noted that for 1994-95 Carrefour Jeunesse-Emploi 
is receiving more than $550,000 from human resources 
development to offer other training and job finding services to 
disadvantaged youth. This funding has been maintained.
<P>
	This government is committed to assisting Canada's youth 
through programs and services that will help them integrate into 
the labour market as quickly as possible.

	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, I put a question to the Minister of National Defence 
and did not receive a satisfactory answer. This evening, 
speaking on behalf of the people of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, 
I would appreciate a reply to this question.
<P>
	The Special Joint Committee on Canada's Defence Policy 
submitted its report last Monday. The publication of this report 
has caused some concern among many people, especially in my 
riding, and not without reason, I believe.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	The importance of the base in Bagotville for the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean area is ample justification for 
questioning the minister, to find out what his intentions are. The 
future of the base is closely linked to the development of the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, since several hundred people are 
employed on the base.
<P>
	Should the representative for this area not have the right to 
demand a clear answer from the minister? One can hardly expect 
a whole region to wait indefinitely, without knowing what will 
happen.
<P>
	Recent cuts in defence spending have led to the closing of the 
Collège militaire de Saint-Jean. Will this happen in the 
Saguenay as well? That is what we would like to know.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois dissociated itself from the report on 
Canada's defence policy on several points; one of the major 
points raised was of course the cuts which could further affect 
Quebec.
<P>
	Yesterday, in my question, I stressed Quebec's neglected 
status. Quebec is one of the most disadvantaged regions when it 
comes to economic spin-offs from the Department of Defence. 
It is important to emphasize that only 13 per cent of Canadian 
defence infrastructure is located in Quebec compared to 34 per 
cent in western Canada, 27 per cent in the Maritimes, and 25.8 
per cent in Ontario. And yet, Quebecers account for 
approximately 25 per cent of the defence budget.
<P>
	In a brief presented on May 9 to the Joint Committee on 
Defence by the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean consultation and 
development regional council, people from my area stated their 
position as follows: ``We believe that efforts must be made to 
bring some degree of fairness with respect to defence spending, 
infrastructure location, and personnel distribution in Quebec. 
The national defence policy review gives us the opportunity to 
take corrective action in favour of Quebec''.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has been asking the government to 
redefine its role within NORAD without delay.
<P>
	The future of the four F-18 squadrons depends on Canada's 
willingness to participate in the protection of the 
North-American territory in full partnership with the United 
States.
<P>
	Choices have to be made, significant cuts are required 
because of our economic situation and we think we have given 
the minister interesting suggestions on ways to save money, in 
line with a real redefinition of what our defence policy should 
be.
<P>
	Government members have come up with proposals which are 
basically cosmetic, while our mandate was to do an in-depth 
review of our policy.
<P>
	A fact remains, the government must answer to the people 
from my area and Quebec who are concerned with the future of 
Bagotville and the place it will have in the military infrastruc-
<P>

<B><A NAME="7671"> 7671 </A></B>
<P>
ture, since we get far less in military spin-offs than the 25 per 
cent we contribute.
<P>
	The people from the riding of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean are 
proud of Bagotville and they intend to keep it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to have a good idea of what the Department of National 
Defence spends in Quebec, you must look at all the facts.
<P>
	In 1993-94, 22.1 per cent of total military spending was in 
Quebec. This is an increase from 19.5 per cent in 1992-93.
<P>
	In fact, Quebec received 33 per cent of military capital 
spending in 1993-94.
<P>
	Of course, no single measure can provide an answer for such a 
complex subject as defence; the Canadian Forces do not exist 
primarily to ensure regional balance but to meet the defence 
needs of the country from coast to coast.
<P>
	The military presence in Quebec is quite significant: the 
headquarters of the land forces command is in Saint-Hubert, 
one of the three brigades is based in Valcartier and one of the two 
main bases of operation for the CF-18 fighters is in Bagotville.
<P>
	Six of 24 naval reserve divisions are still in Quebec. And a 
Naval Reserve school is presently under construction in Quebec.
<P>
	As the Minister of National Defence told this House 
yesterday, the government will carefully consider the special 
joint committee's report, including those recommendations 
made by Bloc Quebecois members. All recommendations will 
be considered in the development of a new defence policy for 
Canada. Once that is done, the minister will take any necessary 
action.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
