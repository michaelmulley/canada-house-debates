are concerned about cruelty to pets.  They point out that there 
is mounting evidence of a link between animal abuse and domestic 
violence, and violence against people in general, and that 
essentially the Criminal Code regards animals as property and 
offences against them as little more than property offences.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That 
Bill C-71, in Clause 4, be amended by deleting lines 13 to 43 on 
page 3 and line 1 on page 4. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, earlier I was listening to the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, who was not 
pleased because we want to delete some lines in his minister's 
bill. But we are extremely happy to propose the deletion of 
these lines. We hope that all parliamentarians in this House 
will realize that our motion only makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-71 includes measures that are clearly inadequate, such as 
those designed to fight poverty, particularly child poverty. 
The legislation also includes measures that are outrageous. I 
will just mention the unilateral change in how the Canada health 
and social transfer is distributed among the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for child poverty, one would have expected that, in this 
budget, the Minister of Finance and the whole cabinet would have 
shown a little more compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some improvement with regard to the national child 
benefit. This is clearly not enough, given that the Minister 
of Finance could have taken that measure as early as last year, 
let alone this year, with the huge surpluses that are 
accumulating daily in the federal treasury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, that is during the fiscal year that ended on March 
31, 1999, the Minister of Finance accumulated a surplus of $15 
billion. He used almost all of that money to pay off part of the 
debt. The minister could have taken a more balanced approach. 
There is balance and there is balance; a balanced approach 
should also be taken to making choices about how the tax dollars 
of Quebecers and Canadians should be spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance could have set aside a few billion 
dollars of this surplus of $15 billion, instead of handing it 
over to creditors who do not need it.  He could have waited a 
few more months.  He could have used this money to further 
increase the national child tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do people realize what this increase in the child tax benefit 
will mean in dollars for low and middle income families?  It 
will put an additional $180 to $350 a year into their pockets. 
This benefit for Canada's poorest children is not a lot when 
compared to the substantial tax relief the Minister of Finance 
made available to top income earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an example: the savings for someone earning $250,000 a 
year will be $3,000 a year starting this year and continuing in 
subsequent years.  A child who probably goes hungry every day 
gets an additional $350 a year at most, while someone with an 
income of $250,000 gets a $3,000 tax break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Minister of Finance make the right choice?  From the 
standpoint of equity, social justice, and compassion, it is the 
worst choice a finance minister has made in quite a few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the figures again: a surplus of $15 billion for the 
fiscal year just ended.  This year, if the tax dollars continue 
to come in at the same rate, the Minister of Finance will have 
over $20 billion in the surplus at the very least. 
It seems to me that he could have made an effort.  He could have 
kept back some of this money to help poor families.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clown rises just about every day in this House to proclaim 
his desire to improve the lot of the most disadvantaged members 
of society and of the children of Canada who are living in 
poverty.  He ought to walk the walk, not just talk the talk. 
For years we have been waiting for some action from this man, 
and none has yet been forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been very simple for him for several years, and 
this year even more so, to plug up the tax loopholes, as we have 
been promised every year since 1993.  He had even told us that, 
in 1999, the famous family trust loophole would be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that, in 1996, the auditor general had uncovered 
a scandal involving two family trusts with total assets in 
excess of $2 billion, which had been transferred to the United 
States without a single cent of tax being levied, a loss of some 
$600 million or $700 million in taxes to Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those trusts were allowed to escape.  This year, the Minister of 
Finance promised that this leak and the tax loophole that made 
it possible would be plugged.  This has not yet happened.  The 
Minister of Finance has not yet done anything about the tax 
loophole which makes tax evasion possible for millionaires and 
billionaires, with his blessing, while Canada's poorest children 
get $180 a year from him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unfair. 
It is not logical to see children going hungry, while tax 
loopholes are being maintained for millionaires. These loopholes 
save them hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. To give a 
tax saving of $3,000 to those with an income of $250,000 and 
over but only between $180 and $350 to the poorest families in 
this country does not make any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is also still talking about the tax 
reductions to middle income taxpayers.  These, however, are not 
real.  There is talk of broadening the base for GST credits, 
which is good news.  But when one looks at what this means at 
the end of the day, given how much taxpayers are paying out, 
since ours is among the highest taxation levels in the world, 
this is all smoke and mirrors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see, since 1986, how Quebec and Canadian taxpayers have 
had to pay out because the tax tables and the entire tax system 
are not fully indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1986 and 1996, the fact that income tax on supplementary 
income did not take into account the increase in the cost of 
living, the GST credits did not reflect the change in the cost 
of living above 3% inflation, federal family allowances were not 
fully indexed as they should be, the child tax credit had to be 
paid back, all this and the fact that all Canadian tax measures 
are not indexed meant that between 1986 and 1996 average Quebec 
families paying tax to Ottawa—for a while yet, perhaps several 
years—paid $7,000 more than they should have paid had the tax 
tables been fully indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Residents of Ontario subject to the same mechanisms as Quebec 
taxpayers paid $10,000 too much.  Had the tax tables been fully 
indexed, we would have had this as net income in our pockets 
over a ten year period from 1986 to 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cup is nowhere near our lips.  We are nowhere near 
substantial reductions in taxes, when our tax system 
systematically robs us because taxes are not indexed.  This is 
the first thing the Minister of Finance should have done when he 
took office, had he been a little more dynamic and stopped 
watching the economy work for him and the provinces and the 
unemployed doing his work by eliminating the deficit and 
increasing the surplus.  But he did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a lazy Minister of Finance, who lets things go as they 
will, but takes all the credit. 
He does not say that every year he creams off the employment 
insurance surplus, which represents several billion dollars.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now talking $20 billion that were literally grabbed by 
the minister from the fund. But he does not mention that. He 
does not mention that he starved the provinces, through the 
Canada social transfer, of cash needed to fund health, 
post-secondary education and social assistance. No, the minister 
says nothing on that score. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He does not mention that it is the unemployed, the workers 
contributing to the employment insurance fund and the provinces 
that did the job for him. He is taking all the credit. He is 
no doubt getting ready for the leadership race. This is 
outrageous. It is despicable to play petty politics on the backs 
of the poor, as the minister is doing, while taking credit for 
the sacrifices made by others. This is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Canada social transfer, the Minister of Finance had a 
little surprise in store for us in the last budget. Without any 
warning, without informing anyone, he decided that, to reward 
some provinces, particularly Ontario, which was so quick to get 
down on its knees to sign the social union framework agreement, 
but also British Columbia and Alberta, he would give them a nice 
present, again without informing Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario was probably in the know. Mike Harris reacted so 
strongly during the first few minutes of the budget speech, that 
he could not possibly not have known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister offered these provinces to change the method, 
based on population, used to distribute the money from the 
Canada social transfer. The result of this was that Quebec lost 
$350 million annually, while Ontario got about 50% of the Canada 
social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion today seeks, among other things, to change the 
calculation method announced without warning by the Minister of 
Finance, and to revert to criteria based on the province's 
needs, as was previously the case.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise and debate Bill C-71 today. I will start by 
addressing the amendment from the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the concerns expressed by my colleague from the 
Bloc but I simply do not know of any fairer way of dispersing the 
CHST other than on a per capita basis.  While I understand his 
concerns, I must disagree with him and say that per capita is the 
way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I certainly have grave concerns with Bill 
C-71.  I think it is an example of the failure of the government 
to understand the real legitimate concerns of Canadians.  To put 
this into context, I simply have to refer to the remarks by the 
Prime Minister that we read in the newspaper this morning.  He 
said that Canadians did not need to have tax relief in a big way 
any time soon, that he would basically take his time reducing 
taxes and that what we really needed was bigger government.  He 
said that we needed to spend more money on making government 
bigger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think I can find words to express how much I disagree 
with that whole approach that the government is taking.  We see 
it again in Bill C-71 where we have a piece of legislation that 
is absolutely bereft of tax relief at a time when Canadians have 
made it very clear that we need to have tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to back up for a second.  Last year we saw the government 
go about $3 billion over budget in its program spending; this 
year it was $7.6 billion roughly.  At every turn, the government 
is taking steps to ensure that the surplus never gets big enough 
that there is money to actually give back to Canadians in the 
form of lower taxes. It is critical that starts to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the hallway in the finance committee right now, we have 
experts from around the country who are coming to talk to us 
about the issue of productivity.  Again, the government seems to 
think that we can make the country more productive by spending 
more on social programs and by having a children's budget in the 
next budget.  We reject that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say that the way to make everybody better off, the way to 
make children better off is to start lowering taxes.  If we do 
that, people will not only have more money in their pockets 
directly because taxes will have come down, but we will have all 
this increased activity in the economy.  When that happens, there 
will be more jobs created, more people actually paying income tax 
and ultimately more revenues coming into the government for 
important things like paying down debt and even reinvesting in 
health care.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members seem to think it is a better approach to take 
that surplus.  They assumes it belongs to them and not the 
taxpayers, which I think is crazy.  It is standing on its head 
the idea of delegation to the federal government from the people. 
They take that money and spend it in a way they think is best, 
not realizing that 30 million Canadians have different priorities 
they want to spend that money on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize the government's approach is wrong headed.  The 
degree of tax relief it proposes to offer is of such tiny 
magnitude that it could not possibly have the impact it hopes it 
will have.  It is a question both of direction and of degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to refer to a red herring which the Prime Minister 
tossed out in his remarks as reported in this morning's 
newspaper.  He said that we do not want to be like the United 
States and if our taxes are cut to the degree of the United 
States we will somehow be like the United States and have all the 
problems it has.  I want to tackle those comments head on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reject the idea that prosperity is purely a United States 
phenomenon.  It is ridiculous.  It is a red herring.  The Prime 
Minister is desperately trying to create the spectre of a U.S. 
style economy with U.S. style health care and all the things 
Canadians have made very clear they reject, simply so he can get 
out of lowering taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the Prime Minister and to the government across the 
way that it was not very long ago when we were the economic 
betters of the United States.  We had taxes that were lower but 
still had our own country.  We had our own set of values and we 
were not at all like the United States.  We had prosperity that 
equalled and was even better than that of the United States.  Why 
can we not have that again?  I think we can.  We can have our own 
priorities and be prosperous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government have against an improved standard of 
living?  After all, the industry minister pointed out that our 
standard of living has fallen behind that of the United States. 
According to the industry minister our standard of living fell 
behind those of the poorest deep south American states of 
Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Louisiana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition believes we can have prosperity and 
still be uniquely Canadian.  Because we have low taxes we do not 
need to be exactly like the Americans.  The Prime Minister is 
dragging this issue out so he can avoid the whole debate about 
tax relief, simply because he would much rather spend that money 
and have his bureaucrats and people in government spend that 
money as opposed to leaving it in the pockets of individual 
Canadians who desperately need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standard of living of Canadians is being eroded every day. 
Canadians have made it clear they would like to see that money 
used to redress some of the inequalities in the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a debate in the House not long ago brought on by 
questioning of the junior finance minister by the official 
opposition.  We pointed out that single income families were 
discriminated against in the Canadian tax code.  We should be 
using that surplus to give some tax relief to single income 
families that are struggling to get by.  They have seen their 
standard of living eroded.  They want to give their children and 
ultimately their grandchildren a better life than they have had. 
I think that is exactly what all parents aspire to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will not get if if the surplus is used to build bigger 
bureaucracies, big social programs, and make government bigger at 
a time when government is full of waste and continues to misspend 
that money.  Government is not omniscient.  It does not know what 
people will use that money for in their individual private lives. 
People should be allowed to make those decisions for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all their talk across the way about compassion, I must point 
out that we could be using that surplus to reduce the 
unbelievable levels of taxation on Canada's poor.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Believe it or not, the government takes $6 billion a year from 
Canadians earning less than $20,000 a year in taxes: every year 
$3.7 billion in income taxes and $2.3 billion in payroll taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals talk a good game about cutting taxes and trying to 
help the poor but at the end of the day they tax the hide out of 
Canada's poor.  That is unbelievable.  It is time to reverse that 
trend.  It is time to start to push up those basic exemptions a 
lot further than the piddling tax relief they obtained from the 
government in the recent budget.  It is time to lower rates.  It 
is time to eliminate the inequalities in the tax system to get 
rid of bracket creep, the inflation tax the government has 
profited by over the last several years at the expense of 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-71 is inadequate.  I do not think it addresses the 
priorities of Canadians.  It continues to tax at ridiculous 
rates.  It is time to reverse that trend and use that surplus to 
start to ease the burden of long suffering Canadian taxpayers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was looking forward to speaking to report stage of 
Bill C-71.  I certainly understand the situation my colleagues 
from the Bloc and those from Newfoundland are encountering with 
respect to transfers to the provinces.  However we have to look 
at the issue in a broader way and use very understandable 
language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that poverty is increasing in the country.  I 
do not think anyone could argue that.  We have 500,000 more 
children living in poverty since the Liberals came to power.  The 
Liberals are bragging that the country is doing better than ever. 
I certainly would not want them to start saying that we are not 
doing very well, because then definitely there would be a lot of 
people in trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in Bill C-71 to help the children living in 
poverty.  The same children who were hungry before the last 
budget are still hungry today.   That will not change unless the 
government changes its direction.  Unfortunately we have an 
official opposition that is pushing the Liberal government to cut 
even further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier a Reform member referred to social programs as being a 
waste.  I find that very unfortunate.  I hope people who need 
social programs recognize what is being said in the House 
sometimes by the same parties that are trying to tell Canadians 
they care about what is happening to poor children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps some in the House would like to talk about the poor 
bankers, but I would rather talk about poor children and the poor 
parents.  My goal is to try to help the children and the 
teenagers who are living in great difficulty. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are serious problems in this country.  There are students 
who accumulate $40,000 in debt during four years of university. 
They have a mortgage on their home and have still not even found 
a job.  Someone should talk with them and begin to give them 
some hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since June 2, 1997, when I was elected, I have not seen much 
done to give hope to young people, to single parent families 
living on welfare or inadequate salaries.  These people cannot 
afford day care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at what the Liberals promised in 1993, a national day 
care program was right up there.  What became of this promise 
that was so important in 1993?  They have had enough time to 
implement this program.  But instead they decided to go after 
the surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And where did they look?  In the EI fund, which belongs to 
employees and employers and which is there to help employees 
through periods of unemployment when times are tough.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is quite a creative fellow.  The 
President of the Treasury as well is starting to take a pretty 
creative approach to the pension fund of federal employees.  The 
two of them went after $25 billion in the EI fund and $30 
billion in the pension fund respectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions are in order when people contribute to a pension fund 
and, overnight, the government can decide to lay claim to it and 
say that it belongs to all taxpayers.  A look needs to be taken 
at who actually contributed to this fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government cut the EI program, the result was 
widespread poverty. 
Today the 500,000 children who are poorer than they were in 1993 
have not benefited from a better economy.  That is not true.  It 
is a known fact that the ones who benefit from a better economy 
are the richest people in this country.  The gap between rich 
and poor is wider than it has ever been in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decisions taken by governments have helped one group, the 
people who already had money, while causing suffering to many 
families. We see the results in our communities.  We see the 
results of a lack of job creation.  We see the lack of 
understanding of the situation in the Atlantic provinces, when 
we hear comments made here about those people not wanting to 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality in our regions must be seen first hand.  We live in 
regions where the jobs are seasonal.  Last week, they were 
calling for 20 centimetres of snow down there, while people were 
going around in shorts here in Ottawa. 
The tourists wandering around Parliament Hill are not doing the 
same on the beaches of New Brunswick, at this time of year. We 
can still see ice on the beaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This must be understood: we live in a country of great 
diversity.  This requires a strong central government with a 
desire to continue to help the entire country, not just the few 
richest provinces, which is what we are seeing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great pity that we again had a budget that does not 
respond to the needs of everyone in the country, just those of a 
few provinces and a few groups.  The rich get richer and the 
poor get poorer.  Children who went hungry before the budget are 
still hungry, and will continue to be.  One day, I hope, we will 
have a government with a conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance should visit food banks, as I did a 
month or two ago, and meet the families that have to rely on 
these food banks. We must get it out of our heads that people 
are just pretending that they need to go to food banks. Not too 
many people get up in the morning and muse about which food bank 
they will go to, to get their groceries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of people going to food banks need help. The 
Minister of Finance should have dinner in one of these places 
every now and then, instead of eating with his friends, the 
bankers. He might reconsider some of the decisions he is making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem today is that too many people making decisions are 
associated with just one group. The Prime Minister put the 
Minister of Labour in charge of the homeless issue, but we have 
yet to see any related budget or structure. 
Very little action has been taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced the minister is prepared to do her job. However, 
she must be provided with the necessary tools to do it properly. 
I am convinced that, so far, she has not been given the 
resources she needs. She will not be able to do her job until 
she gets those resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that, in the future, opposition parties will start 
looking after the interests of the poor in this country. This is 
difficult to do when the official opposition's goal is to lower 
taxes. But at what cost? Some provinces need help. Our party 
says that a tax reform is in order, because there are people who 
should not be paying taxes, while there are others who do pay 
taxes but should be paying more. We all recognize that, but we 
must also recognize that social programs are needed. 
We need to help those who are suffering. 
The $42 billion deficit has been eliminated.

elderly and the young university graduates with debts of $40,000 
or $50,000. It is these people who eliminated the $42 billion 
deficit. We must help them, because they are in need. 
Bill C-71 clearly does not meet the needs of all Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise to speak to Bill C-71, the budget 
implementation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to address some specific and very important issues 
which I feel the budget has not addressed fully.  Then I will 
speak in a more general sense about tax relief.  The time 
constraint of 10 minutes does not allow for a detailed discussion 
of some of these issues, but I will focus on a few specific areas 
that I feel the government has failed to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first area the government had an opportunity to address more 
fully was EI premiums.  The government says that it has reduced 
EI premiums over a period of time, but the fact is it has 
maintained EI premiums at a rate that is significantly higher 
than the necessary rate of $2 per $100 contribution.  That rate 
would be enough to sustain the EI fund even during an economic 
downturn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that has to be asked is why would the government 
want to maintain a direct tax on jobs, a payroll tax that 
directly reduces the incentives for companies to expand and hire 
more workers at a time when we have unemployment rates in Canada 
at twice those of the U.S.  Why would the government want to do 
this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has slashed benefits to an extent that only 30% 
of those making EI contributions can actually withdraw or qualify 
for EI benefits when they are in need.  At the same time it is 
maintaining unnecessarily high premiums to create a surplus that 
can help pad the government's books in other areas.  The 
government is trying to make its numbers look better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is consistent with the government's actions in Bill C-78. 
That legislation will effectively provide the government a 
mechanism by which to access the $30 billion surplus in the 
superannuation fund.  Again the government is trying to find any 
means by which it can pad its books, use the money for other 
unrelated spending and create a less transparent process, a more 
Byzantine and circuitous fiscal process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government hopes that Canadians will not be able to figure 
out what is going on with the federal budget process and that 
Canadians will not realize the degree to which a real tax cut, 
significant broad based tax relief, is possible in Canada.  At 
the same time, this provides the government with the opportunity 
to spend more of Canadians' money on programs it deems are 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the issue of the seasonal worker.  In the finance 
committee we are talking about productivity issues.  I would 
assert that the issue of the seasonal worker in Canada is one 
that should be incorporated into this discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time in Atlantic Canada when much of the workforce 
was employed seasonally, particularly in the fisheries, forestry, 
agriculture, and other industries which are inherently seasonal. 
The government through its changes in the EI program has 
effectively eliminated the opportunities that once existed for 
seasonal workers in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government thought that if it eliminated the potential for 
seasonal workers to draw EI, more of them would be working.  I do 
not know where the government's leap of faith came from, but the 
fact is the result of its policy has been perversely to create 
disincentives for individuals who did work seasonally to work at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently these disincentives have been created for those who 
did work in seasonal industries in Atlantic Canada, Quebec or 
rural Canada.  Those people did work at least part of the time 
and contributed. 
They are facing a direct disincentive to working at all. Many of 
them are on provincial social assistance programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has caused an increase in poverty.  This has caused 
increased strains on the provincial governments which are facing 
other cutbacks and now have to face a higher social burden 
because the government has tried to create this huge surplus 
within the EI fund to pad its books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of high marginal tax rates in Canada has to be 
addressed. I recently participated in the Canadian Tax 
Foundation's annual conference.  The theme came up over and over 
again that our high marginal tax rates, particularly relative to 
those in the U.S., need to be addressed.  While the government 
has tinkered a little bit around the fringes, it has failed to 
deal not just with tax reduction but with a more holistic set of 
tax reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has not been meaningful tax reform in Canada since the 
late 1980s under the previous government.  This government is 
ignoring some of the significant issues we have, particularly the 
huge tax gap between Canada and the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Innumerable reports have provided information to the government 
on how to reform both personal and corporate taxes to create a 
more competitive environment, better productivity, less 
disincentives for Canadians who want to succeed here in Canada. 
The latest of these reports was the Mintz tax report that came 
out in June to which the government has not really responded. In 
all likelihood that report will collect dust because the 
recommendations are so good that the government is afraid to 
implement them.  The political will is not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 Industry Canada worked with the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business and other organizations to write the report, 
“Breaking through Barriers: Forging our Future”.  It was a 
great report that addressed tax issues and regulations and all 
kinds of policies that should have been dealt with.  Again, the 
government has shelved the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry minister said earlier this week that in the 
upcoming budget he would like to see 50% of the budget dedicated 
to productivity and 50% dedicated to lower taxes, the inference 
being that lower taxes have nothing to do with productivity. This 
is the same industry minister who said a few months ago that high 
taxes may help improve productivity because they would make 
people work harder.  They would have to work harder to pay the 
burden of a bloated government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday we read the Prime Minister's comments in the 
<I>National Post</I> that the so-called brain drain will not be 
reversed through lower taxes alone, that it would take the kind 
of positive actions we have already taken to foster economic 
dynamism.  Effectively the Prime Minister is saying that only the 
government can create positive action and foster economic 
dynamism.  The Prime Minister is still focused on a 1970s command 
style economy.  He is ignoring the fact that true economic growth 
can only come through unfettering the Canadian public from an 
over-burdening tax system that continues to pummel productivity 
and continues to pummel initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals still believe we can spend our way to higher levels 
of productivity and that somehow we can create initiatives 
through government that can somehow exceed the level of growth 
that is possible from the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that one of the members opposite said “Let's 
hear it for Brian Mulroney”.  I think he has an incredibly 
important point.  Former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney reduced 
the deficit as a percentage of GDP from 9% in 1984 when it was at 
$38 billion in 1984 dollars to around 5% by the time he left 
office.  He reduced government program spending growth from 15% 
to 0% by the time he left office.  He implemented the free trade 
agreement, against the wishes of the Liberals of course, and the 
GST.  By the way, I read recently the current finance minister's 
comments on the GST back when he was a critic, that the Liberal 
government would be tearing up and getting rid of the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is those were the types of policies and initiatives, 
the long term approach to very serious issues that Canada faced 
then, which this government should be trying to effect and 
produce now.

policies that will drive productivity and growth into the 21st 
century, the Liberals continue to focus on the short term 
politically palatable.  They ignore what in the long term will 
provide the type of growth Canadians need in the 21st century. 
They ignore the types of initiatives that will actually generate 
a Canada that in the 21st century will be leading the world in 
productivity instead of being embarrassed by the fact that Canada 
continues to lag and is underperforming relative to the other 
economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the comments of the other members. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the 
parties' representatives as they spoke on this motion. With the 
exception of the mover of the motion and the Reform Party which 
spent all of five seconds on the particular motion, I do not 
believe there is very much support in this House for a motion 
that attempts to gut the equal per capita formula that is in 
place.  That is in fact saying that what we are attempting to do 
in providing each and every Canadian with an equal amount of 
transfer from the federal government to the provincial government 
is somehow unfair.  Essentially the Bloc is saying that it is 
unfair for the federal government to treat each and every 
Canadian regardless of what province they come from in a manner 
that is fair and equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have done is eliminated the cap on CAP, a program and an 
initiative which was put in place in 1990 by the previous 
Conservative government.  It limited growth of the CAP payments 
to Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. Now that our fiscal 
situation has improved, this government is in a position to 
correct this inequity, which is what we are doing with Bill C-71. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All provinces, including Quebec, will get the same amount of 
money per person of the new CHST health money.  It is only fair 
that Canadians regardless of where they live receive equal 
federal support for health and other social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Bloc and the Government of Quebec cry foul, they are 
really distorting the facts to suit their purposes.  The figure 
they talk about does not in any way include the new funds the 
Government of Quebec receives under the equalization program. 
When we count the equalization programs, Quebec will be getting 
34% of the total increase in federal transfer payments announced 
in the last budget.  That is quite a bit higher than Quebec's 24% 
share of the Canadian population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it somewhat disturbing and obviously quite ironic that 
the Bloc would get up today and ask that members of this federal 
House support a motion that essentially says to Canadians that we 
do not want to treat them in a fair and equitable manner, that we 
do not want the federal government to transfer moneys to each and 
every province of this federation in a way that reflects their 
population so that an equal per capita amount of money is 
transferred.  I find that disturbing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon members of this House to support the bill and to 
vote against this motion.   Members would find it very hard to go 
back to their constituencies and say that they supported as 
members of parliament a motion in the federal House that said 
that we do not want to treat each and every Canadian in an 
equitable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that being said, there is not a lot more to say on the 
motion with one exception. The Bloc member said that there were 
unilateral changes made to the transfers to the provinces.  I 
must correct that statement with some fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point to the number of meetings over the past couple of years 
that our finance officials had with the finance officials from 
the various provinces and their counterparts. They dealt with all 
questions involving transfers to the provinces. At each of the 
meetings the subject of the CHST allocation among the provinces 
was raised. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1100"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a meeting of ministers of finance last June the province 
presented a document proposing an amended allocation formula, 
whereby all provinces were to receive an equal amount per capita. 
Two methods were proposed and the government chose one method 
that was the fairest to the less well off provinces.  The current 
legislation allows for moving in this direction and removing the 
disparities completely in the years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention the equalization program because it is important to 
note that along with the technical improvements being proposed to 
the equalization program again Quebec receives more than its fair 
share in that respect as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to turn for a second to each comment made by the various 
parties so far.  The Bloc talked about helping kids but did not 
feel that a transfer to the provinces was essentially 
responsible.  I am sure members of the Bloc would not at this 
time be proposing, in their minds at least, that the government 
intervene in programs of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transfers are a method of the federal government providing 
support to provincial programs, delivering social programs and 
helping children.  I find it ironic the hon. member would say 
that the government has not been able to assist children in the 
province of Quebec when it has been increasing equalization 
payments.  There are increases in the CHST allocation over five 
years.  These moneys are within the control of the provincial 
governments that support and deliver programs which help poor 
kids in the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc members also think the equal per capita formula was a gift 
to Ontario.  For some reason they feel that treating each and 
every Canadian in an equitable and fair manner is a gift.  I do 
not consider it a gift.  I do not think many members of the House 
consider it a gift.  I think members believe it is the very least 
government can do.  The expectation of Canadians is that 
governments will treat each and every Canadian in a fair and 
equitable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that motion will not receive very much support in the 
House, with the exception of members of the Bloc.  I do not 
profess to know how they think.  I think that is beyond my 
ability and probably the ability of most members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn to Reform Party members who indicated that they did not 
feel anything was wrong with this part of the bill.  However they 
felt other parts of the bill raised some concerns.  The Reform 
member went on to say that big social programs were the focus of 
the government and made reference to the Prime Minister's remarks 
in the paper this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure most Canadians would consider an $11.5 billion 
transfer to provinces for health care to be a return to big 
social programs.  Essentially we have restored cuts that were 
made to deal with the deficit.  We have indicated our commitment 
to continue to fund health care and to continue to provide 
transfers to the provinces.  I do not consider health care and 
education big social programs.  I consider them to be at the 
centre of what the country needs to continue to prosper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is a very important component of the country, as are 
education and skills training.  Many high tech companies talk 
about skills training.  If hon. members had an opportunity to 
look at the recent edition of <I>Maclean's</I>, they would see it 
talked about the recruiting methods of American companies, what 
Canadian companies need to do, and how Canadian companies need to 
compete and create that kind of work environment.  I agree we 
need to participate in that domain.  As a government we would do 
what we could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We continue to say that a balanced approach will continue to 
provide health care and education, which certainly are priorities 
of the government, as is the tax burden which Canadians continue 
to shoulder.  We have indicated that we will continue to reduce 
taxes.  We have provided $16.5 billion over the last two budgets. 
We will continue to do more. However, we will not turn around 
tomorrow morning and put forward a $10 billion tax cut that will 
put us back into deficit.  Canadians would not support that.  We 
have indicated that we will continue our measured approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy for opposition parties to say do it yesterday, but 
government has a responsibility to Canadians. 
Our responsibility is to ensure that we do not go back into a 
deficit and that we do not add to the phenomenal debt we had.  We 
pay an exorbitant amount of interest on that debt.  We need to 
continue to reduce it.  We need to continue to reduce taxes.  We 
will do so, but at the same time we will not jeopardize health 
care and education, which are Canadian priorities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Very quickly I will turn to what the Conservative Party talked 
about in terms of EI.  When we took office EI premiums were $3.30 
per $100 of employment income.  We have reduced the EI premium 
over $5 billion since coming to office.  We will continue to 
provide a very equitable way of dealing with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that Bill C-71 is crucially important for Canadians. 
It provides the tax relief for which they have asked.  We will 
continue to do more as we continue to reflect Canadians 
priorities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to discuss the ongoing assault by the Liberal government 
on the Canadian taxpayer, this time propagated through Bill C-71. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time I rose in the House to discuss the budget I 
chronicled the failure of the government to adequately protect 
the environment.  I told the House that despite the fact 
taxpayers were paying more, they were getting less in 
environmental protection.  I told the House how the budget for 
Environment Canada had been so deeply slashed that the department 
could not even enforce many of its current regulations, never 
mind any future considerations.  The House also heard of the 
failure of the government to take serious action to clean up the 
contaminated sites which spread like cancer across this beautiful 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I will speak to the budget in a broader sense, outlining 
the harm the government's reckless tax and spend policies are 
having on our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals came to power in 1993 the Canadian taxpayer 
was reeling from 30 years of excessive taxation.  Like a punch 
drunk fighter, the taxpayer was dazed and confused after repeated 
blows to his after tax take home pay and the level of government 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For year's the government sucker punched the taxpayer, nearly 
knocking him out with nickel and dime jabs, a 7% shot below the 
belt, an upper cut to health care services, and a resounding 
haymaker to the tax equality of single income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each time the taxpayer was nearly knocked out, the government 
showered cold cash on his nearly lifeless body offering up a coal 
mine here or some cheap western gas and oil over there.  No 
subsidy was too large, no project too small.  They were all 
showered with cold cash, cash that came from the blood and sweat 
of that same taxpayer.  Take it out of one pocket and give it 
back to another.  So it went for 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when the Liberals came to power in 1993 they had a 
chance to change all that.  They had a chance to clean up 
government.  They had what we call a golden opportunity.  They 
could have seized the moment and cut out government waste.  They 
could have followed through on their promise to scrap the GST. 
They could have taken charge of out of control government 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Best of all, they could have revived the taxpayer.  They could 
have given him the best health care that money could buy.  They 
could have helped his family by streamlining the tax system. They 
could have promised him a future by fixing his pension plan. They 
could have given him a safe secure job through increasing 
national productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the Liberal government blew that chance.  Instead 
of reviving the taxpayer with the sweet smells of tax cuts, the 
government body slammed the taxpayer by dropping the Canadian 
health and social transfers by 31%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These cuts in federal government transfers caused great distress 
across the country as the provinces had to scramble to make up 
for the lack of federal money.  Hospitals were closed.  Medical 
staff were let go.  Emergency rooms were filled to overflowing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians heard stories of patients sleeping in the hallways 
because there were not enough beds.  Patients were made to wait 
weeks, sometimes even months for surgical procedures.  Wealthy 
patients often elected out of the Canadian system and fled to the 
U.S. where they could buy the care they needed.  A two tier 
health system exists in the country today.  Year after year the 
assault continued with the cumulative reductions soon totalling 
over $20 billion with no end in sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government made a big deal out of the budget this year, 
boasting that it would increase government transfers to health by 
$11.5 billion.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance bragged that the budget was a well thought vision for 
tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a look at what tomorrow will bring. 
First, we will notice the increase in CPP premiums coming off our 
paycheques.  Under the government's proposals for the Canadian 
pension plan Canadians will see their CPP premiums skyrocket over 
the next four years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next Canadians can look forward to reduced after tax income, 
thanks to the government's refusal to fully index income tax 
brackets.  This insidious tax is costing taxpayers hundreds of 
thousands of dollars as brackets fail to keep up with the pace of 
inflation.  This is a way the government can increase revenues 
without seeming to increase taxes, but indeed it is.  This 
discriminant policy places a disproportionate burden of the 
increase on the shoulders of those who can least afford it, the 
poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can look forward to a reduced standard of living 
vis-à-vis their American neighbours.  High taxes and onerous 
regulations have stifled the Canadian economy and have driven 
many of our best and brightest educated at taxpayer expense out 
of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Name one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  I will.  Just pay attention.  In a rare 
scene of a cabinet minister coming to his senses, even the 
industry minister echoed the calls of the Reform Party for lower 
taxes.  Imagine that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that the parliamentary secretary's well thought vision for 
tomorrow?  In spite of the $11.5 billion the government is adding 
to the health care system, the fact remains that federal 
transfers are still $4.3 billion less than when the Liberals took 
power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I go back to our earlier analogy, how does the taxpayer feel? 
Is he still reeling from the effects after that 30 year beating? 
The Liberals probably think he feels pretty good.  After all, he 
was just given a free flag.  In case that did not cheer him up, 
maybe the heritage minister can give him a copy of the dumb 
blonde joke book that he is paying for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems a bunch of Liberals are going around western Canada 
trying to figure out how western Canadians feel.  As someone who 
is trained in the fine art of grassroots representation, 
something members across have a little trouble with, I can say he 
is not doing so well.  He is starting to feel the crushing burden 
of the national debt which has topped $580 billion, 94% of which 
was rung up since 1975.  Each year two out of every three dollars 
he pays in income tax are gobbled up by interest charges on the 
national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His family is feeling the pinch of these high taxes.  Despite 
having the same household income as his neighbour, he is paying 
24% more in taxes.  That does not even include the cost of living 
expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Feeling somewhat overtaxed and under appreciated, our friend 
went to the hospital to see what ailed him.  When he got there he 
was told there would be a small wait.  “No problem”, he said. 
Then he asked how many people were ahead of him.  “Only about 
188,000 or so”, said the nurse. “If you would please sit down, 
we should get to you within the next year”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of resuscitating Canadians with the tax relief they 
deserve, the Liberal government continues to spend, spend, spend. 
The budget announced $14.1 billion in spending initiatives over 
the next four years, including the remainder of this fiscal year. 
The government is expected to reap $156.5 billion for 1998-99, 
about $5.5 billion higher than what the finance minister 
predicted last year and about $12.5 billion higher than what he 
predicted the year before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister calls these differences errors of prudence. 
This sleight of hand accounting will allow for plenty of new 
spending initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent poll taken by Compas showed that between 96% and 98% of 
people in each of the provinces believe that controlling taxes, 
spending and debt are important.  Nine out of ten say that tax 
relief, not new spending, is their number one priority.  These 
numbers are not at all surprising when one considers that the 
average taxpayer pays $2,000 more in taxes today than what he did 
when the Liberals took power six years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The country needs to get competitive again.  In December 1998 
the chief economist of CIBC Wood Gundy said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a tax competitive standpoint, Canada ranks dead last in the 
G-7.  While virtually every other G-7 economy lowered its 
personal income tax burden over the last 15 years, Canada's rose 
sharply, both as a percentage of GDP and of household income. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one message that I want to hammer home today, it is 
that Canada needs a tax break and it needs it now.  Canadians 
cannot wait for the finance minister's grand plans of tax breaks 
spread over the next 15 years.  We need them now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here comes the person the parliamentary secretary was asking 
about.  Just a week or two ago a constituent of mine, Professor 
Kurt Ellenberger, an accomplished musician and respected 
instructor at the University of Lethbridge, accepted a position 
with an American university.  Kurt told me that he could not turn 
down the chance to double his after tax income. 
He said he could no longer bear to see his wage increases gobbled 
up by bracket creep.  As a result, the University of Lethbridge 
and the community have lost a talented musician and teacher. 
That is just one example of brain drain in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am delighted to support the motion of my colleague from 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot to delete lines 13 to 43 in clause 4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, this would re-establish the calculation formula 
planned at the time when the Minister of Finance announced the 
Canada social transfer in 1996.  I must point out what the 
Canada social transfer is, or what it was, since it has just 
been changed again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada social transfer is a set of transfers to the 
provinces made by the federal government in the past for health 
care, post-secondary education and social assistance.  I remember 
that the 1995 reform of the social programs took two years.  At 
that point, I was a member of the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development, which travelled around the country 
consulting people.  I recall the type of consultations we had. 
There were demonstrations everywhere, because people were 
concerned about what was going to happen with the cuts to 
employment insurance and the changes to the social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By putting all that into a single fund, the government seized 
the opportunity to cut payments to the provinces.  Quebec was 
hit particularly hard.  There was nothing to be proud of, but it 
is a fact.  There were more unemployed and poor people in Quebec 
than the Canadian average. 
I might point out as well that there is a link between cuts to 
employment insurance and the transfers to the provinces and 
today's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot in his 
motion is to bring things back to the way they were in the 1996 
budget.  It must have meant something.  It was planned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention it in conclusion, but we had not just the word of 
the Minister of Finance but his written word that the government 
perhaps did not agree to it all, because there were cuts, but 
there was a formula.  This is the commitment the Minister of 
Finance made to carry out this reform, to bring everything 
together in the Canada social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With its 1996 budget, the federal government established a 
mechanism to reduce current disparities in per capita 
entitlement between the provinces by half by 2002-03.  The 
mechanism in question would have increased the per capita 
weighting from 10% in 1998-99 to 50% in 2002-03. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was what the Minister of Finance promised. But, in the 1999 
budget, without a word of warning to Quebec, the federal 
government is proposing to completely eliminate these 
disparities in three years.  The new increases under the CHST, 
including the one for this year, will be distributed equally, 
per capita, in every province and territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget proposes a weighting of 70% in 1999-2000 and 100% in 
2002-03. 
Because of this unilateral decision by the federal government, 
Quebec will lose out on more than $350 million annually.  This 
explains why Quebec is getting only 8.3% of the $11.5 billion 
increase in the CHST over five years, while Ontario will get 
47.2% or almost half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the circumstances, we should not be surprised to see Ontario 
MPs take turns applauding this measure, because it is to their 
advantage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have short memories.  Now they have harsh words for the 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, when all he is saying is that 
this was not what was promised.  These were not just idle words 
from the Minister of Finance.  This was a promise made in the 
budget.  That is all the member is saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot is being called all 
sorts of things I would rather not repeat, is accused of being 
nuts, wrong, unfair, and told that the concept of need took 
precedence over the concept of per capita distribution.  That 
was the Minister of Finance's plan and philosophy in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot merely raises this 
point. Great consternation is stirred up on the other side. They 
say “My goodness, what he is proposing is insignificant, wrong, 
and far-fetched”.  Is the Liberal side saying that what the 
Minister of Finance proposed scarcely three years ago was 
far-fetched and wrong?  All those adjectives can be applied, for 
that is what the commitment by the Minister of Finance was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs claimed that 
the provinces had called for this change on June 15, 1998. 
There is a connection with the social union, which was accepted 
by the other provinces, but not Quebec.  The others accepted 
that in future provided there is advance notice of three months, I 
believe, the federal government can change provincial social 
programs as it sees fit. 
Quebec did not accept this, because it is unacceptable to 
Quebecers, and the premiers of the other provinces accepted so 
that they would get some money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that there are some words that cannot be said in this 
House, but when principles are cast aside in favour of money, 
there is a word that springs to mind: intellectual prostitution, 
at the very least.  This is terrible, scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs claims the provinces 
asked for this change.  This is no excuse for the government's 
not giving any advance notice of its intention to modify the 
transfer formula in its 1999 budget.  There was no advance 
notice.  At any rate, had there been one, it would have been 
only seven months, whereas the social union framework agreement 
calls for a minimum of one year.  The Liberals reneged on their 
own signature on social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all. 
The Prime Minister said that the premiers' letter of January 23, 
1999, concerning the reinvestment of the new transfers in health 
satisfied him and that he considered it a sort of agreement on 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister broke his word in the weeks before the 
budget, since the letter on health care asked the government to 
totally reverse, within a reasonable timeframe and through 
existing arrangements under the Canada social transfer for 
health and social programs, the cuts it had made in its 
transfers in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One aspect concerns me increasingly and that is respect for and 
the promotion of democratic process. One of the conditions of 
democracy is that information be provided.  There is, however, 
another condition. 
People who give their word or who agree on a commitment must 
honour it afterward.  Otherwise, it means nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again yesterday—I would just refer to this matter of particular 
concern to me, shipbuilding—we debated for an entire day a 
motion of the Progressive Conservative Party, which, in the end, 
had used word for word the resolution passed by Liberal Party 
faithful at their latest convention.  Most Liberal members were 
probably in the hallway, sipping coffee or something, but I 
asked whether they remembered being at that convention. They did 
not say yes, of course. They nodded their heads, but did not 
recall having voted on this resolution.  However, they did vote 
in favour of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in the House, that means nothing. 
It is like the election promises in the red book. They are 
meaningless. The Prime Minister said he would scrap the GST. He 
did not do it. At one point, he also said he would tear up the 
free trade agreement and change it. He did nothing of the sort.

promises. We could talk about promises made during election 
campaigns and at conventions, but the issue today is a 
commitment made by the Minister of Finance in his 1996 budget to 
reform the Canada social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put all this together and to make his cuts more palatable, he 
said “I will tell you in advance how the amounts will be 
calculated and how much the provinces will be getting”. He said 
that for two or three years and then, suddenly and unilaterally, 
in another budget speech, the minister said “This is it. It no 
longer works that way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must condemn this kind of about-face. 
People are losing confidence in the Canadian political system 
because they are increasingly aware that it is plain rubbish.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to speak today to Bill C-71, an act to implement 
certain provisions of the budget that was tabled recently in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this bill has many parts to it, I intend to speak 
primarily to concerns that I have with part 1, regarding the 
Canada health and social transfer, and part 5, regarding the tax 
on fuel and tobacco for some aboriginal bands.  I am particularly 
concerned with the sections of the bill that affect my riding and 
will therefore address these concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents in Nanaimo—Cowichan, indeed all Canadians, find 
it galling that this Liberal government has the intestinal 
fortitude to actually feel good about its historical actions with 
the Canada health and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are big on emphasizing that they are putting $11.5 
billion back into the health care system.  Let us be very clear 
about this.  This is money that the Liberal government took out 
of the health care system to start with.  This was money that was 
in the health care system to begin with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals came to power in 1993, the Canada health and 
social transfer per taxpayer was $1,453.  By the time this budget 
is fully accounted for, this amount will have dropped by 31% to 
$1,005 per Canadian.  Anybody who can do the simple math realizes 
that the Liberals are putting in less than half of what they took 
out of health care in the past five years.  These are the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals can point fingers in any direction they want in 
trying to spin doctor this, but the undeniable truth is that they 
have taken far more out of the Canada health and social transfer 
than they have put in.  They laid the groundwork for our present 
two tiered health system and they must be held accountable for 
their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know they will squeal and probably bleed over this accusation, 
but the truth must be spoken.  They have slashed the Canada 
health and social transfer to the point where it seems to be 
beyond repair without a major overhaul of our health care system 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that every member on this side of the House could tell 
horror stories about the quality of health care in their riding. 
Let me offer an example from my own riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nanaimo Regional General Hospital is the main hospital for 
central Vancouver Island.  It directly serves a population of 
approximately 85,000 people and offers support to a further 
60,000.  In the past weeks, the hospital has experienced a 
serious overcapacity of intensive care patients and patients on 
ventilators.  This is nothing new.  Due to Liberal cuts in the 
Canada health and social transfer, this life-threatening 
situation has been ongoing for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most perilous date recently was Wednesday, April 7, only a 
few weeks ago.  Chaos reigned supreme on that day.  At one point, 
four ambulances were lined up outside the emergency room. Inside, 
the intensive care patients and heart monitor patients were 
backlogged.  In total, the 12 intensive care beds were filled 
with critical patients.  Half of them were dependent on 
ventilating machines.  Another four intensive care patients were 
being attended to in the emergency department.  Six telemetry 
patients were in the recovery room because the hospital's ten 
telemetry beds were full. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this is beginning to sound like a very bad soap opera, 
but it gets worse.  In the waiting room there are another four 
patients experiencing chest pains who have not yet seen a doctor.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nanaimo hospital was so full that other Vancouver Island 
hospitals were looked to for assistance.  Guess where the only 
available bed was?  Port Alberni.  That hospital is almost two 
hours away by road, and it is not the best road either I might 
add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly this is not a Hollywood soap opera.  This is a real 
Canadian nightmare.  Elective surgery patients are being 
cancelled three, four, up to eight times.  Think of the mental 
anguish to those patients.  This is unnecessary pain and 
suffering.  It is lost productivity.  These are lives hanging in 
the balance.  Why is there such chaos?  Why are lives hanging in 
the balance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the Minister of Health would have a variety of 
excuses, but let us say it like it is.  There is a lack of money 
in the system and the system itself is in need of massive reform. 
The Liberal government has taken a world class medical system and 
ruined it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 12, almost three months ago, I called for a review 
of Canada's health care system.  Canada's health care system is 
in crisis.  We need an immediate overhaul of the entire system. 
Today, in the House, I reiterate my call for a full review of 
Canada's health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have decimated the level of health care for 
Canadians.  Something needs to be done, and done soon.  Although 
the Nanaimo Regional General Hospital is one of the most 
drastically affected in all of Canada, the same story may be 
heard at any number of locations all across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This simply is not good enough.  It is not acceptable in a 
country of our stature.  This bill is simply band-aid treatment 
for the life-threatening wounds the Liberals have inflicted upon 
the Canadian health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I turn my attention to part 5 of Bill C-71, which allows 
some first nations bands the right to impose a 7% value added tax 
on fuel or tobacco.  Besides being, as a Reformer, 
philosophically opposed to any new or increased taxes, I feel 
that I need to explain to the House one example of a similar 
situation in my riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago one of the local aboriginal bands wanted to impose 
a tax on all tobacco sales.  Under Bill C-93 they were allowed to 
make a bylaw imposing a direct tax on consumers of tobacco at a 
rate prescribed in the bylaw.  This was to be used as a means of 
raising funds for the band.  Under Bill C-93 clear guidelines 
were laid out as to how the band could proceed with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance, this may not seem to be much of a problem. 
However, to say that there was intimidation in this whole 
scenario would be an understatement.  In this case the band bylaw 
has never been published, nor was it publicly advertised as Bill 
C-93 stated that it had to be.  The contents of the band bylaw 
are then unknown.  Therefore, the tax collection, calculation and 
distribution are all unknown.  Talk about misrepresentative 
taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the vote by the band members was held on welfare 
cheque day.  Lo and behold, to receive one's cheque, one had to 
vote.  This kind of thing goes on time and time again at the band 
level and it is directly a result of Liberal bills like this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the information I have, as of last June the band 
had collected $1.6 million and the distribution of these funds 
was to include housing for individuals through the welfare office 
of the band.  Despite requests by band members, this information 
does not appear to be forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time no housing was being worked on and nothing was 
projected.  Big money and no action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This story has an all too familiar ring to it.  As we have seen 
all too often, if one is not a part of the chosen circle within 
the band, the support services do not come one's way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As can be seen in this case, and as has been brought up time and 
time again in the House, the real issue at stake is one of band 
accountability.  The media is filled with cases of band money 
disappearing, being unaccounted for or misspent.  This simply 
will not do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development can say 
all she wants, but the Indian affairs system is broken even worse 
than the health care system.  Today the health care and Indian 
affairs systems are prime examples of why there is such a high 
level of mistrust among many Canadians over the Liberal 
government's action.  Let us remember that 62% of Canadians voted 
against the Liberal government in 1997 and these are good 
examples of why they did.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Democratic leadership of all stripes must be accountable to the 
people it serves.  The grassroots aboriginal people are crying 
out for real leadership, accountable leadership, leadership that 
can look at the grassroots concerns and bring solutions to them. 
Accountability is a large part of such solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health care system affects everyone at some time.  Whether 
we use it on a regular monthly basis or sporadically every few 
years, we will all use it.  The problem is that in creating the 
crisis in our health care system the Liberals just do not get it. 
They do not have a solution.  They do not know how to get 
themselves out of the quagmire they have created.  It is out of 
their control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much the same could be said about the sad way the department of 
Indian affairs has paternalistically dealt with our first nations 
people.  This bill is only a small example of the problem that 
exists.  The Nisga'a agreement is another example. Once the 
doublespeak and rhetoric is wiped away we find another 
bureaucracy out of control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In matters of both health and Indian affairs the government has 
failed.  For these reasons I cannot support Bill C-71. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great 
pleasure that I take part in today's debate on Bill C-71, the 
Budget Implementation Act, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I must say that this is the first time I have spoken to 
the 1999 budget brought down by the federal government.  I am 
pleased to speak today because, through its budget, this 
government has implemented measures that have inevitably had a 
major impact on Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this based on what we see in our ridings when we visit our 
constituents during recesses, when we go door to door, when we 
meet with local citizens and organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, I met with representatives of the Comité logement de 
Rosemont, an organization that has for many years called on the 
federal government to invest in housing.  In ridings such as 
mine, the list of applicants for social housing grows daily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years now, these groups have been fighting to increase the 
availability of social housing for the neediest members of 
society, and have called on the federal government to back large 
housing projects and invest in housing. 
If poverty is to be eliminated, people must be able to do three 
things: put food on the table, clothes on their backs, and a 
roof over their head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994, this government has frozen all spending on housing. 
Quebec is not receiving its 25% share under existing programs 
and projects.  Local organizations have told me that the federal 
government must include new funding in the 1999 budget. 
Unfortunately, this budget contains nothing for the poorest 
inhabitants of my neighbourhood.  It contains nothing for 
Quebec's neediest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are nine different parts to Bill C-71 to implement the 
budget.  First, there are the fiscal arrangements between the 
federal government and the provinces. 
The second part concerns the pension plans of the Canadian armed 
forces and of the RCMP.  The third measure is the suspension of 
arbitration.  The fourth concerns the management of public 
funds.  The fifth involves the Sliammon first nation.  The sixth 
part concerns the child tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the ninth part concerns farm product marketing 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I would, primarily, like to draw the attention of the 
House to the changes in the formula for calculating the 
transfers the federal government established in the latest 
budget.  The transfer calculation formula in the 1996 budget 
provided for a demographic weighting of 10% for 1998-99. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT21"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT21"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1140

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This figure increased to 50% for 2002-03.  What we have to 
understand today is that the 1999 budget will have the effect of 
increasing the demographic weight criterion in the calculation 
of the transfer to 100%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of this House from Ontario, those on the government 
side, among others, are perhaps unaware of the effect these 
changes in calculation may have on Quebec, but the changes are 
significant and unacceptable.  They are unacceptable not only 
for the Parti Quebecois government of Quebec, but for the people 
of Quebec, in health care, education and social assistance 
services they will receive in the coming years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be pointed out that these changes in calculation will 
penalize Quebec considerably, by reducing its share of the $350 
million yearly.  Inevitably, other richer provinces will profit 
from this penalization.  Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia 
will get a larger share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the forecast increase in the 1999 budget, transfer payments 
are raised by $11.5 billion.  Only 8.3% of that will go to 
Quebec.  Let us look at what will go to the other provinces. 
Take a neighbouring province, Ontario, as an example.  Quebec 
will receive 8.3% of the $11.5 billion.  But what will Ontario 
receive?  It will receive 47.2% of the $11.5 billion.  This does 
not make sense.  The only consequence of changing the 
calculation is that the richer provinces will benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, while in my office, I heard the parliamentary secretary 
comment “What do these Quebecers have to complain about?  The 
decrease in transfer payments will be made up with an increase 
in equalization”.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Finance needs a reminder of what equalization payments are 
for.  They are there to help the poorest provinces.  Does this 
mean Quebec is a poor province? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government really wants to help the people of Quebec 
with health, education and social assistance, it will not only 
have to increase equalization payments, it will also have to 
increase what I might call productive spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what productive spending means in Montreal area ridings: 
they are what goes to purchase goods and services.  They are 
what gets the economy going and encourages economic growth. 
They are what makes cities like Montreal able to compete with 
other major world cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only consequence this budget will have for Montreal is to 
place it in a non-competitive position.  There must be major 
changes in this method of calculation, which has never worked in 
Quebec's favour.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is the formula unacceptable, so are all the measures in 
this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people hurt most by this budget are the unemployed. The 
Liberals opposite had promised help for the unemployed.  I 
remember hundreds and thousands of Quebecers rallying on 
Parliament hill five years ago to tell the government that the 
reform by the then Minister of Human Resources Development would 
have a major impact on women, youth and the middle class.  These 
Quebecers were looking for a sign of hope, some breathing room, 
in this budget.  They found nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be told that, five years ago, these people had no cause. 
But that was not the case.  The statistics speak for themselves. 
In the case of youth alone, 75% qualified for EI in 1990, as 
opposed to 25% today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, there is nothing in this budget to improve the 
situation of Quebecers.  The formula offers nothing for Quebec.

<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak on the motion by the Bloc party which says it 
would like to delete the component of clause 4 dealing with the 
provincial share of the cash contribution under the CHST from 
April 1, 1999 to March 31, 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I would like to say that my party opposes the 
motion.  While we are on the subject of the CHST, the Canada 
health and social transfer, let me dwell on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the government has been saying, that it is 
restoring funding to the CHST, it is actually restoring partial 
funding. In 1993 when the Liberals took power the CHST per 
taxpayer was $1,453.  Taking this into account, today the CHST 
transfer after what is stated in the budget will be $1,005. There 
is a decrease of $448, a 31% decrease compared to the year 1993. 
I fail to understand how the government can say that it has 
restored the funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps many of us saw the documentary on the CBC last night on 
the health care crisis in our country. The nurses across the 
country, the front line health care workers, are saying enough is 
enough on the cuts.  The documentary clearly pointed out what is 
wrong with our health care system. It all started with the 
federal cuts to the transfers to the provinces which resulted in 
the provinces cutting as well.  This was when the federal 
government could have easily changed its spending focus and 
capped the health care funding, but no, it elected not to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In last night's documentary the nurses were saying that they 
were sick and tired of cuts, of overtime, of part time jobs. The 
stress and the pressure were so heavy that they could not do 
their jobs.  The nurses feel they need to create a personal bond 
with the patient and they cannot do that because of all the cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the nurses pointed out that all the governments are 
saying that they will hire more nurses.  Where will they get the 
nurses? It takes four years to train a nurse. 
Where will the trained manpower come from?  Not to mention the 
fact that nurses are now moving south.  We have heard time after 
time that headhunters from the U.S.A. are in our country offering 
incentives, bonuses and career development for them to move 
south.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally we are facing this crisis in our health care system as 
a result of the government's cut in the budget. Now the Liberals 
will probably say they are going to throw some more dollars 
toward it, but it is not going to address the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got a call last night from a constituent of mine in Calgary. 
She said she was scared of the erosion of the health care and 
education systems.  This woman has contributed and lived in this 
country for over 70 years and she is expressing fear for the 
future.  Her exact words were “I do not know what is in store 
for my grandchildren”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are scared.  It arises from the fact that the 
government is not able to get its spending priorities in order. 
It has cut health care when it could have cut something else. Now 
it is putting money back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the education system as well.  Imagine the government 
coming out with this millennium fund.  It is only going to look 
after 300,000 students.  What about all the rest?  I have two 
daughters in university.  They are not going to be subject to 
anything. How are they going to be helped?  Right now their debt 
is $20,000 and they have not even completed their degrees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I got another call from a constituent who is fiercely 
concerned about high taxes.  Actually, I get calls every day in 
my office.  Constituents walk in every day with one single theme, 
high taxes.  They are tired of working harder and their standard 
of living does not seem to be rising.  Their disposable income is 
not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One constituent said something very interesting.  He said 
“Perhaps we should let Canadians have the gross amount they 
actually earn and then 15 days afterward they can send the taxes 
in that are charged to them.  Only then would Canadians recognize 
how much money they are losing in taxes, how much money the 
government has been taking from them time after time”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday we heard the Prime Minister say there is no bracket 
creep.  That is something new we have heard.  Canadians are 
facing higher taxes and deterioration of health care and 
education.  Canadians are saying enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lately we have heard the debate on productivity. One minister is 
saying productivity is low due to higher taxes. The finance 
minister is saying that everything is hunky-dory.  He was not 
taking anything seriously despite the fact that all evidence 
indicated there was something wrong with our productivity, that 
there was a brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Official Opposition talked about the brain 
drain last year and the finance minister would not acknowledge 
it.  He only woke up when Nortel and the big guys said “Yes, 
there is something wrong.  We are going to look at this whole 
situation”.  Then he woke up.  Now he has said he is going to 
meet with the high tech leaders to see what is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say what is wrong.  I was in Toronto last weekend and I 
visited individuals in a high tech training program.  The 
principal told me that in that class over the last six months 
they had lost six students who had moved to the U.S.A.  Canadian 
taxpayers are paying for it.  Why have they moved to the U.S.A.? 
Because of the lower taxes.  It goes back to their disposable 
income so they can address the needs of their children.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we come along and say “No, no, but we have the health care 
and you have got to pay for all those things”.  Yes, but there 
is also frivolous spending by this government.  There is the 
millennium project where the government is spending money. I do 
not know why we are spending money on that project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade today in committee said 
that he was very proud to take young entrepreneurs to the Silicon 
Valley. That is great. I applaud him for that initiative, it is 
good.  Our young entrepreneurs need that.  I understand he also 
said “We are a good exporter.  We are a good exporter of our 
bright young individuals”.  We are good exporters after we have 
spent so much money on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our economy has high taxes, brain drain and low productivity and 
the government has been refusing to acknowledge it but the 
government is slowly acknowledging it as the opposition parties 
keep hammering it.  It needs to be addressed, but not with a 
band-aid solution, not with the government saying that it will 
throw a little money here and a little money there.  It needs a 
comprehensive solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the finance minister when he wins his leadership bid 
will try to give tax relief as an election goody.  The days of 
election goodies are over.  Canadians will challenge that. They 
now know not to put their trust in the government any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I sit down I must say that something has to be done about 
Revenue Canada which is becoming more and more unreasonable in 
going after Canadian taxpayers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this particular 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say at the outset that we oppose this motion. We oppose 
this motion because it deals with certain provisions of the 
budget and it introduces provisions which are contrary to the 
priorities and values of the New Democratic Party. We recognize 
that the Liberals' political choices are certainly not the 
choices of our party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget was touted as a health budget.  The government put 
forth this health budget on the basis that it was injecting $11.5 
billion to health care funds.  We have to look very closely at 
what this really means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We note that this money is spread out over a five year span.  It 
will only bring health care spending back to 1995 levels in five 
years, and even then only back to 1995 levels. This budget is not 
attached to any comprehensive long term planning.  Rather it 
allows the pressure for two tier American style health care to 
grow. There is no delivery on the Liberal promise to build 
national home care programs or a pharmacare program.  In reality 
it provides only a perception that health care needs are being 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know when we look at our health care system that there is a 
lot of pressure.  People are overworked.  People are underpaid. 
More and more is demanded of the system. There are long waiting 
lists in various hospitals.  This budget does very little to 
address those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister has given the wrong prescription for the 
health care crisis.  The dosage is too low and the recovery is 
too slow. This was supposed to be a health care budget, yet we 
see no real leadership when it comes to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put this budget in perspective.  We note that the Liberal 
cuts to the Canada health and social transfers, that is, the 
entire social program funding envelope, since 1995 now amount to 
$21.5 billion and more than half of that has been in health care. 
This year's budget puts back only $2 billion, not quite the cause 
for celebration that we have been led to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the government keep repeating $11.5 billion, $11.5 
billion. 
In reality they have not emphasized the amount that has been cut 
from this budget.  What they want us to believe and to forget is 
that the $11.5 billion will be spread over five years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget also failed to address a number of very important 
issues.  It failed to help the hundreds of thousands of Canadians 
who are still looking for work.  It failed to improve benefits 
for the unemployed.  In fact what we have seen take place in the 
past is just the opposite of helping the unemployed.  We have 
seen the government seize funds belonging to the unemployed.  It 
wants to put these funds into the general account to pay down the 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget has failed to combat the homeless crisis.  All we 
have to do is walk down our streets.  Even as we walk from the 
House of Commons down Rideau Street we see many homeless people 
who are sitting by the side of the road.  Yet this budget does 
not really deal in any concrete fashion with that particular 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has failed to reduce the GST.  It has failed to provide 
federal funding for our highways.  In many parts of our country 
the highways are in severe need of repair.  In my home province 
of Nova Scotia there is a need for highway work.  We know that if 
the highways are not in good shape it reflects upon the potential 
for tourism.  Tourists do not want to come to a province or to a 
part of the country to drive on poor highways.  The government 
has failed to address that particular issue in its budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has failed to provide proper tax relief.  Instead it has 
eliminated the 3% surtax for people earning $50,000 to $65,000. 
It addresses the concerns of those who perhaps least need it, 
whereas the poorest in our country do not receive any real relief 
from this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One very important issue which has not been addressed by the 
budget is infrastructure money.  The government had a program, 
which has now come to an end, whereby infrastructure money could 
be shared among the federal government, the provinces and the 
municipal governments.  This program certainly aided in providing 
much need infrastructure in many of the small communities 
throughout our province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House of a need in my riding, a need that is felt 
by a small black community.  The families do not have adequate 
water.  We may think that in this day and age how is it possible 
that people do not have an adequate water supply?  What makes it 
even more striking is the fact that this community lives and 
borders the lake that supplies water to Halifax and Dartmouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main water supply is directly adjacent to this small 
community, yet it is not hooked into the water supply.  The 
people are drinking from wells where the water has been deemed to 
be unsafe and lacks the proper aesthetics that drinking water 
should have.  People have wells that run dry in the summertime. 
Quite often they have to call upon the local fire department to 
deliver water to them.  They live next to this large, pure lake 
which boasts the best treated water in North America and they are 
not hooked up to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people have been attempting to obtain a hook up to the 
main water supply.  Unfortunately, because they did not come in 
on time under the previous infrastructure program, they now do 
not have access to that kind of money to assist them with this 
project.  The cost of the project is very difficult for people 
who are living on fixed incomes, many who are widows, older 
people, people with only a small income.  To hook up to the water 
supply may cost many of them $20,000 or $30,000 because of the 
frontage charges for their properties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It comes down to a matter of priorities.  I have been pursuing 
this issue on the federal level.  I have tried to seek whatever 
funds might be available from any of the programs that the 
federal government might have in the area of health, the 
environment and so forth.  However, I have been unable to secure 
any meaningful funding from the federal government to assist in 
this project going ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does the government put its priorities?  Where are the 
priorities when it comes to serving the needs of people?  When I 
see projects being approved under the millennium partnership 
program, such as projects to fund a dumb blond joke book, 
projects to establish mermaids for western towns which are not 
even near the sea and various other projects, I question the 
validity of the priorities of the government in meeting the real 
needs of people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People can be without water, yet we can find funds to create 
books which poke fun at various segments of our society.  This, 
to me, is wrong.  The government has the whole process of its 
priorities wrong and this budget simply illustrates that fact. 
We have to start getting back to the meaningful things in a 
budget, the things that will assist those people who are 
unemployed, that will give aid to people who are in need of 
health care, that will provide home care for people who need it, 
medicare and so forth. These are the kinds of issues that must be 
dealt with in a realistic way in our budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for this reason that I find it very difficult to stand and 
support a motion which calls for CHST payments to be made to any 
province because the CHST payments are not being directed in the 
proper direction and they are not being used to help people.  We 
must get back to the real root causes of helping people to 
accomplish the things that must be accomplished to enable them to 
lead full and productive lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see right across our country all kinds of examples of things 
going wrong in our society.  A lot of these things stem from the 
quality of life within our communities and homes.  It is 
incumbent upon the federal government to provide the kind of 
financial support and programs that make it possible to have a 
good quality of life in our homes, communities and throughout our 
country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address Bill C-71. A number of things were said on 
this bill and many more could be added to stress the importance 
of this legislation, which deals with several aspects of the 
federal government's finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize three points. First, I will discuss the 
issue of the transfer of federal funds to the provinces. Then I 
will deal briefly with the national child benefit, before 
concluding with a suggestion to the government to improve public 
finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for transfers to the provinces, earlier, someone who is 
rather thick and who sits across the floor accused the Bloc 
Quebecois of not having any respect for the per capita formula. 
It goes without saying that the Bloc Quebecois and all the 
democrats in this House respect that principle, but this is not 
what is at issue when we are dealing with transfers to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government was petty and dishonest in the way it 
went about changing the formula. That formula was based on a 
number of factors, including population, but also on other 
factors that are not strictly related to the population. There 
were even some clearly defined agreements and announcements. In 
the 1996 budget, the government clearly stated that, if changes 
were made to the formula used to calculate transfers to the 
provinces, 50% would be based on population until 2002-03. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what happened. In fact, the federal government 
changed the formula used in the calculation of transfer payments 
without telling Quebec and the other provinces, and the new 
formula it imposes upon them will come into effect in 2001. Not 
only was this change not announced, but there was an agreement 
in place. At least, that agreement was mentioned in the 1991 
budget. Moreover, this was done only a few weeks after the 
signing of the social union agreement, which stated clearly that 
the federal government would not change the formula without 
giving the provincial governments at least 12 months notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the federal government did not keep its word and changed 
the formula, which means that Quebec will lose $350 million a 
year for three or four years. Quebec will lose nearly $1 billion, 
maybe more, because of a cheap trick by the federal government.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find particularly appalling is that the Prime Minister 
and the Minister of Finance, the two most powerful people in 
this government, are not protecting Quebec's interests, in spite 
of the fact that they both come from Quebec and that Quebec has 
the right to demand that the formula be maintained as agreed, in 
other words that it not be changed until 2002-03. This is a 
cheap and dishonest move, and the Bloc Quebecois has stirred up 
a lot of discussion on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see this as anti-Quebec behaviour on the part of the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Finance. And there are more 
examples of anti-Quebec behaviour. 
For example, I could speak for some time on the social union, 
the millennium scholarships, and the way the government is 
trying to harm Quebec's interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, these attacks have been more pronounced since 
1995 and the referendum. On the other, the Liberal government 
and the Prime Minister seem to lack the courage and political 
will to develop fair economic policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A case in point is the national child benefit. As we know, the 
needs are huge in Canada. In spite of the fact that the 
government had promised it would reduce it, child poverty in 
Canada is worse now, in 1999, than it was in 1993 when the 
government came to power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other examples. The member for Rosemont mentioned 
housing, from which the federal government withdrew completely. 
Employment insurance is another one. 
These are instances of gross social injustice. On the one hand, 
this government has been multiplying its attacks against Quebec, 
there are countless examples of this. On the other, it seems to 
be somewhat indecisive, weak, and lacking in courage when it 
comes to social and justice issues across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to suggest to the Prime Minister something that 
might help him be remembered in the future. I read this morning 
in <I>La Presse</I> that he was bemoaning the fact that very little was 
made of his accomplishments. The fact of the matter is his 
government did not accomplish anything. He has done nothing we 
might remember him by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime minister wants to do something that will stick in 
the memory of Canadians and Quebecers, I suggest he abolish the 
other place, where people sleep and snore, wasting $60 million 
of our hard-earned money. 
If the Prime Minister had the courage to do what has to be done 
to abolish the other place, he could recover the $60 million 
wasted on 104 senators, who do very little work, and use this 
money to meet the needs of the poor, the children and the 
unemployed, as well as for housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To illustrate how the $60 million could be better spent on other 
projects than for those 104 friends of the government, this 
amount could be used to create some 20,000 summer jobs for young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, as he says, the Prime Minister is really concerned by the 
future of young Canadians, he should take his political 
responsibilities and abolish the other place, take the money and 
spend it on summer jobs for youth. 
If 20,000 jobs could be created in one year, this means that 
over a period of ten years 200,000 jobs could be created for 
young people by using the money which is presently being wasted 
on the other place to maintain 104 friends of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are ways of doing this. Indeed, I sent a document in my 
riding of Quebec East, in which I proposed a way to empty the 
other place. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1215

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution would be to reduce the other place's budget, which 
now stands at $50 million, to $104, that is $1 per senator per 
year. There is not one single senator in the world who would 
accept such a budget. This would encourage senators to retire 
and to enjoy a comfortable pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister introduced in next year's budget for the 
Senate a provision allocating $104 for the next fiscal year, I 
am convinced that a majority of members of the House would vote 
for it. We have the authority to do so, because we have 
political legitimacy and we represent voters. 
This budget could not be rejected by the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senators do not represent anybody. They represent nothing but 
political parties, special interests, or the Prime Minister's 
interests. This would be a way to emptying with the Senate 
without abolishing it. This kind of budget would encourage 
senators to retire. Those who wanted to stay on with a salary of 
$1 a year could do it on a voluntary basis, or for the love of 
their country, but not to collect a big pay cheque and numerous 
costly benefits for very little work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, in 1999, we have no need—and it is even scandalous to keep 
it—for the other place, we do not dare and are not allowed to 
name in this House. 
In my view, it is an abomination that a proud democratic country 
should tolerate such an institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal is on the table, and concrete and realistic means 
have also been suggested. Now, it is only a matter of political 
will, a political will the government could muster to meet the 
needs of all Canadians. If the Prime Minister wants to leave an 
achievement of lasting memory, let him take up this challenge. 
Let him reduce the budget of the other place and use the savings 
to create jobs for young people. With 20,000 jobs a year, we 
could get 200,000 over a period of 10 years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak today to the implementation 
of parts of the budget and to the proposed amendment, which we 
oppose for many reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, I would like to talk about the budgets over the last 
six years and to what I feel budgets are supposed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For about 30 years, I have always felt that budgets were 
supposed to be drawn on a priority basis.  We were supposed to 
collect the money through revenue sources and then determine how 
to spend the money in a manner that would be beneficial to 
Canadians across the land.  It is not how we spend this money to 
benefit a few here or a few there, but how we spend the money 
where Canadians will receive the best benefit possible from the 
revenue collected, keeping in mind that we must determine what 
some of these priorities are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will come up with a list of priorities by saying we should add 
health care to that particular list.  It certainly plays a major 
role in the lives of most Canadians.  We all want to be healthy. 
We all want to have access to maintain that health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education certainly has to be high on the priority list.  It is 
something that will benefit all Canada.  The better educated our 
youth are and the more we offer in opportunities for education, 
the benefits will be felt throughout the country for the good of 
all Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most elemental duties of the House of Commons or a 
government is to make legislation that will provide for the 
protection and safety of the lives and property of its citizens. 
This is pretty elemental and should be a high priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have a military unit, the primary purpose forever being 
in existence for defence is to protect the sovereignty of a 
nation and to be ready to go to arms if ever necessary to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have our industries which we want to make sure provide 
good jobs that will make our communities feel much better in 
their standards of living and the lifestyles that we would all 
like to be accustomed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take a look at the industries around, we recognize 
agriculture as being the number one industry in the nation.  It 
has to be looked after, as most Canadians agree, because it is 
very beneficial to keep a vibrant industrial base going in this 
land, particularly at the agricultural level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we looked around the nation, we would see people who are in 
genuine need.  We would see the poverty and say “we must address 
this”.  There is no reason why we should live in the greatest 
country in the world and still have poverty to the extent that it 
is in many places, particularly on native reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the reserves I have visited, I have seen the conditions that 
our native friends are living in, the grassroots people who are 
fighting hard for some accountability and for a lifestyle that 
their children can grow up in and enjoy, that can give them some 
hope, education and opportunity for their futures.  Instead, we 
see people living in squalor and committing suicide.  We are 
doing a very poor job.  This should be a high priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the environment?  There is nothing better than to 
live in the greatest country in the world and have an environment 
that is liveable, with water that is safe to drink and air that 
is good to breath.  We have to work on all those things. Those 
are the kinds of things that I believe a budget should be 
addressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, over the last 30 years, I have seen a 
deterioration in these priorities, particularly over the last six 
years.  This federal Liberal government took around $20 billion 
in transfer payments from the provinces.  Instead of looking at 
the public accounts and finding out where the billions of dollars 
were being spent, and not necessarily for the good of all 
Canadians, it cut immediately from the priority lists.  This was 
done to the point where we now have a health care system with 
line-ups and people suffering because they cannot get the 
treatment they need.  I have a family member who will not get an 
urgent operation until August. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People begin to point at the provinces and say “Shame on, you, 
Mike Harris, Ralph Klein and all the provincial premiers, for 
having done this”.  Nobody remembers that it was this Liberal 
government that cut those transfers and put the pressure on the 
provinces to do something as a result of a decision made here and 
one that was not beneficial to the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear about all the difficulties in the education programs 
being delivered in our primary, elementary and secondary schools 
and what they are causing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the depletion in the police forces, they are no 
longer able to do the job.  The RCMP, where a number of officers 
are needed in the field, no longer have the staff available 
because their numbers have been decreased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are on the verge of a war and we have a military unit 
that is not properly equipped.  It is outdated.  That needs to be 
reinforced and helped.  It is a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an agricultural industry that is nearly collapsing in 
the west in particular, but in other parts of the country as 
well. There were people who suffered last summer.  We have 
debated in here on how to deal with it and we have done that 
dismally.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear of 1.5 million children living in poverty in this land. 
I heard that in 1993 when I came here.  Nothing has been 
happening there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day we get reports.  Recently, we received one from the 
auditor general stating how deplorable it was the way the 
government deals with aboriginal people on reserves.  It stated 
that there was no excuse for them having to live under the 
conditions they do and that we are not doing a good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that we are drawing up budgets that attack 
the very things that ought to be priority while we continue to 
fund special interests and give away free flags because it is 
such a wonderful thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We strike all kinds of weird committees.  When I look at the 
public accounts, I cannot help but wonder why we spend thousands 
of dollars for a committee to figure out what kind of recipes we 
can use blueberries in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one committee that always rips me up, I guess because 
of my age.  When we put together a committee to study seniors and 
sexuality and spend thousands of dollars for this committee to do 
that, it makes absolutely no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We give grants to big business.  Since when was a government 
ever supposed to be in the business of supplying money to the 
private sector big business companies in order for them to 
survive and thrive?  I always thought that in an entrepreneurship 
one invests and takes one's chances.  If one does a good job in 
management, it will work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CIDA comes up with all kinds of projects. It just amazes me when 
I look at public accounts and see where we spend the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Multiculturalism.  It is a wonderful thing that we have 
multicultural people in our country.  In the beautiful community 
of Strathmore, Alberta, they put on a program once every year, 
which I attend at a cost of $25.  I was more than pleased to put 
up my money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourteen nations were recognized in the community the last time 
I was there.  Many have different cultural backgrounds and 
different roots.  They put on illustrations of food from the old 
country.  They put on arts and entertainment to show us what kind 
of a background they come from.  They all had a great weekend 
working together and doing this.  These people were from all 
walks of life and from all backgrounds.  It was a great weekend 
and we all paid for it ourselves.  We paid admission and it went 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After it was all done, each one of the participants 
congratulated each other, patted each other on the back and said 
“Well done”.  They went back into their communities and became 
Canadians.  They are Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spend thousands and millions of dollars because we, the 
government, have to promote this or that.  It is time that we 
started lining up these priorities.  If we did that, and if we 
remembered what this country is all about, then we could take a 
look at these budgets and not only address these priorities, but 
also provide the kinds of tax cuts that the Canadian people 
deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are completely out of proportion with the rest of the world 
in taxing our people, and it has got to stop.  We have to start 
putting budgets together that implement addressing priorities. 
We must stop the foolish spending that the government is so 
capable of doing and start today to look after the needs of 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to enter the debate on Bill C-71, the budget 
implementation act, 1999.  I am pleased to enter the debate 
because what I hear from the opposite side is not really 
reflective of what the 1999 budget is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois continue to whine about the per capita 
adjustment in the budget.  Let me go over some of the history of 
the equalization payments and the CHST transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last number of years there has been a cap on the 
transfers from the federal government to the provinces of 
Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia to deal with health care, 
secondary education and welfare.  That cap was there because of 
the economic prosperity in those provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have returned to a point where we have some fiscal 
responsibility and have eliminated the deficit, it makes absolute 
sense to go now to an equal per capita payment on the CHST.  It 
means that we are returning to equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member of the Bloc Quebecois said that he would not support 
the aspect of the budget which dealt with bringing the budget 
back to a fair and equitable arrangement under the CHST.  The 
provinces of Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta would be put 
on an equal footing with the other provinces.  They have not been 
over the last many years.  His argument seems to be totally 
illogical, but we all know the motivation of Bloc Quebecois 
members.  They want to create an impression that Canada is not 
working and is unfair. Their agenda is to promote the single 
minded issues of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about equalization.  If we look at transfers from 
the federal government to the province of Quebec, not only do we 
have the CHST which deals with health care, secondary education, 
post-secondary education and welfare, but we have equalization 
payments.  The equalization payments for the province of Quebec 
in this budget are around $5 billion.  They are more than 50% of 
total equalization payments given to all provinces and 
territories in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a shame.  What a disgrace.  The province of Quebec was 
strong; it was an economic powerhouse before the separatists 
became engaged in Quebec.  What a tragedy that Quebec, because it 
is a have not province now, has to participate in the lion's 
share of equalization payments from the federal government.  Why? 
It is a poor province.  Why is that? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, Quebec is a poor province because of the policies 
the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois are implementing 
there. It is unfortunate. It is a tragedy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about some of the positive aspects of the 
budget because members opposite totally ignore them.  The member 
for Wild Rose spoke about the model he sees in budget building. 
In other words, a budget should reflect the priorities of the 
Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the member for Wild Rose did not read the last budget. 
It had $11.5 billion directed into health care, one of the 
largest single transfers under the CHST in modern history.  Of 
that $11.5 billion, $3.5 billion goes to the province of Ontario. 
The people of Ontario were saying very loudly that we need to 
deal with health care.  We have hospitals that are crowded.  We 
have waiting lists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The delivery of health care is a provincial responsibility, but 
we provide funding to the provinces through the CHST, the Canada 
health and social transfer.  I will try to clarify some points 
around that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the member for Wild Rose is from Alberta, he postulated 
that the reason health care was threatened in Ontario and other 
provinces was that the transfers from the federal government had 
been reduced.  What a neat little theory. I hear it in Ontario 
from time to time, more often than I would like, and I would like 
to correct the record on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the reduced transfers under the CHST to the 
province of Ontario since 1993, they amount to less than $1 
billion per year.  In contrast I will outline what the Government 
of Ontario has done.  It implemented tax cuts, which is great. We 
have been implementing tax cuts.  We would like to implement more 
tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget we had to redirect more money to health care 
because the Government of Ontario said explicitly and implicitly 
that it values tax cuts five times more than topping up federal 
transfer reductions.  The 30% tax cuts in Ontario, and I gather 
Mr. Harris will announce more today, are great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be announcing more tax cuts, but we have to keep topping 
up health care and education because the Ontario government keeps 
gutting those programs.  One day, hopefully in the next budget or 
the budget beyond, the federal government will get into massive 
tax reductions.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already provided for $16.5 billion over the next three 
years but we need to do a lot more.  When the Government of 
Ontario says it will reduce income tax by 30%, it costs the 
federal treasury about $5.5 billion a year.  Our reductions in 
federal transfers to the Government of Ontario were less than a 
billion a year.  That says tax cuts are five times more important 
than topping up the federal transfer reductions to the Government 
of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very simple.  When the member for Wild Rose talks about 
priorities, the Government of Ontario is reflecting those 
priorities.  In the next month or so the people of Ontario will 
have their chance to express their view on whether that was the 
right set of priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the gallery are some school children, young adults from my 
riding of Etobicoke North.  They attend Mississauga Private 
School.  I would like to give them an insight into what the 
government is doing about youth employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget builds on the Canadian opportunities strategy 
announced in 1998.  It makes available an additional $455 million 
over three years for the youth employment strategy used to create 
employment opportunities for young Canadians.  That money is 
providing youth internships and summer jobs.  In my riding of 
Etobicoke North right now I am signing off a Human Resources 
Development Canada program that will create 170 summer jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also shown some leniency with respect to student loans. 
We allowed tax deductibility of interest on student loans in the 
1998 budget.  We allowed for deferral of repayment of student 
loans.  We made tax provisions so that Canadian families could 
put more money into their registered education savings plans 
which are tax deductible, put together a little nest egg to help 
educate their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget the Prime Minister and our government 
announced the Canada millennium scholarship program of $1.3 
billion or $2 billion.  It is a huge amount that will be used to 
help students who have good academic records but maybe not the 
means to go through university or college.  Our government is 
responding to youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen youth internship work in my riding of Etobicoke 
North at Humber College which trains students to work in the tool 
and die industry.  Our government subsidizes the company which 
hires them so that they can be trained on the job.  They take 
classroom instruction and go to the tool and die company.  Some 
95% of those students get jobs.  I have been at some of the 
ceremonies where students receive awards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is a good news budget.  While the Bloc Quebecois 
keeps whining, if I can use that term, about the transfers, the 
province of Quebec is a net beneficiary and the province of 
Ontario is back to a fair and equitable transfer of funds under 
the CHST.

remain in the House to listen to my speech. I have rarely heard 
so many falsehoods. Maybe ignorance is bliss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, the <I>Globe and Mail</I> reported that Quebec business 
leaders are highly optimistic. I quote “Quebec business leaders 
are more optimistic than they have been in five years. Not since 
the election of a sovereignist government in Quebec has the 
province been basking in such optimism. 
Quebec anticipates increases in sales, profits, price 
reductions, an increase in employment and a drop in inventories, 
all conditions needed for economic growth”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member says that Quebec is poor, he is treating 
Quebecers like a colonized people. This is exactly why 
we want out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should come to Quebec. He should see how we 
live, how dynamic a people we are, how we are getting known, 
especially Montreal, as the best centre in Canada for the new 
economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members opposite should stop thinking that they are the 
fathers of Canada, that the rest of the country relies on 
them. I happen to think that the attitude of the federal 
Liberals from Ontario is one of the main reasons we will leave 
the country. We are sick and tired of their paternalistic 
attitude, especially when they convey falsehoods like the 
previous speaker just did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we so disgusted by the CHST? Because it will cost Quebec 
$350 million every year. The federal government has unilaterally 
decided to change the rules of the game and now Quebec will only 
get 8.3% of the extra $11 billion in transfers over five years. 
How can you expect Quebecers to be satisfied and say “we have 
24% of the population and we get 8.3% of transfer payment 
increases, so everything is fine and dandy?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is something positive in all of this in that it 
has inspired the Bloc's position. In our view, now that these 
types of transfers are based on the population, we will simply 
keep the GST payments and the federal government can keep the 
corresponding Canada health and social transfer, and that will 
allow us to put money into productive spending. This is a 
fundamental problem in Canada: for 100 years, productive 
spending has been going to Ontario and that province has been 
systematically benefiting from the establishment of high 
technology centres. The maritime provinces and Quebec have had 
to make do with transfer payments. That is the kind of balance 
that Ontario has imposed upon Canada, and it is unacceptable for 
the country as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the budget, yesterday, the Prime Minister told 
Quebecers “I do not understand why people are not aware of the 
good things we do. We are unable to show who we are”. When a 
bill that gives Quebec only 8.3% of the $11 billion increase in 
CHST payments comes before the House the very next day, one can 
understand why Prime Minister is not welcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can understand also why he is not welcome when he lets the 
issue of the millennium scholarships drag on for a whole year 
just to gain visibility. There were actions on the part of the 
Bloc Quebecois, the Government of Quebec and the Quebec National 
Assembly in this regard. The latter was unanimous on the 
millennium scholarships, not only the sovereignists, but also 
the Quebec Liberals, who are federalists, as well as the ADQ. 
The leaders of the three party wrote the Prime Minister of 
Canada to tell him “You absolutely must respect the resolution 
adopted by the National Assembly. Our jurisdiction over 
education must be respected”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we will finally get results because Quebec is united and 
able to formulate requests, but let us think of all the time lost 
because we must always spend more energy than Ontario to get our 
fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same thing with productive spending. Anybody here 
would be ready to replace transfer payments with productive 
spending. If the federal government gave us our fair share of 
productive spending, it would not take us long to outpace 
Ontario in terms of economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out what I would have liked to see in the budget. 
I would have like a new balance in EI. Last week's consultations 
in the regions by the federal Liberals regional prove me right. 
The Quebec section of the Liberal Party of Canada is travelling 
around Quebec right now. There, as elsewhere, their own 
grassroots members are telling them that what they are doing 
does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a former liberal candidate in the 1997 elections, 
Jean-Guy Doucet, asked the Liberal establishment to re-examine 
some aspects of EI. “There are major irritants and unfair 
elements that need to be corrected” he said during the 
preliminary meeting leading to the provincial convention of the 
Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message is coming from their own grassroots members. You saw 
it in Trois-Pistoles, where there were more demonstrators than 
people interested in the consultation. It was the same kind of 
reaction in Trois-Rivières. In Gaspésie, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development was even 
shut out. 
Are they waiting to be shut out, to be unwelcome everywhere in 
Quebec before acting and coming up with answers? We were hoping 
the budget would include something on employment insurance so as 
to give back some credibility to the program, but not so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were also hoping to find a shipbuilding policy. This is the 
kind of productive spending we had in mind. The federal 
government is sorely lacking in initiative and innovation; all 
it had to do is copy a number of measures that are implemented 
by the provinces, particularly Quebec, to revitalize the 
economy.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government not do so? Perhaps because the weight of 
federal Liberal members from Ontario is too heavy, they are just 
cruising along or they do not particularly care about nationwide 
development. Whatever the reason, the results are obvious. The 
government continues to want to send transfer payments to the 
regions while setting aside productive expenditures for Ontario. 
This is a fundamental option that leaves no choice to Quebecers 
but to leave this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also more concrete elements. Last week, a report was 
tabled on amateur and professional sports. I want to draw the 
attention of the House on a specific measure in that report. 
That measure could easily have been incorporated into the 
budget. We could have had the consent of the House to 
incorporate that measure and give it immediate effect. I am 
referring to the granting of a tax credit to parents whose 
children are involved in competitive sports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such action would have clearly reflected our belief that the 
physical and mental health of our children are perhaps the best 
way to avoid unacceptable situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could also have included measures to promote 
regional economic diversification. Again, there are no such 
measures in the budget. This is a straightforward budget, a 
budget that allows those who have more money to keep it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all these shortcomings of Bill C-71, clearly the Bloc 
Quebecois will be forced to vote against it.  The interests of 
Quebec are at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No member from Quebec will vote in favour of this bill and 
agree, with the increase in Canada social transfer payments, to 
Quebecers having only 8.3% of the $11 billion increase.  Not one 
of the members from Quebec voting in support of it, when 
visiting their riding and being asked whether they did their job 
this week, whether they defended the interests of Quebecers, 
will be able to stand and say “Yes, we did a damn fine thing. 
We arranged for Quebec to get only 8% of the increase in the 
Canada social transfer payments”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody on the other side will be able to say that. 
When the Prime Minister of Canada says “No one knows about the 
good things we do”, it is true, because, when it comes to good 
things like that, there is not one member on the other side with 
the courage to mention it in his or her riding and reveal that 
he or she has become more the defender of Ottawa in Quebec than 
the defender of the interests of Quebec in Ottawa.  That is the 
difference between the members of the Bloc Quebecois and those 
of the majority, who keep limiting our rights, trying to put a 
straitjacket on Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Ontario who spoke before me would do well to 
take note of this message.  Perhaps, in the next federal 
election, the federal Liberals in Ontario will hang on to a 
certain number of important ridings. However, the way things are 
going, they will certainly not have the small majority of five 
members they have at the moment. 
They will receive a clear message from all the regions in Canada 
“Out with the current Liberal government”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured to be able to stand in Canada's parliament this 
afternoon to debate the issue of the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I go by the things that people in my riding talk to me about, 
then the budget, taxes and the way the government spends our 
money are the biggest issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of standing at a couple of trade fairs a few 
weeks ago.  One was held in Sherwood Park in my riding, which is 
probably the largest trade fair in the province.  Around 25,000 
or 30,000 people came through in the two and a half days we were 
there.  In Fort Saskatchewan there was another very large sample 
of people.  Almost all of them brought up the question:  When 
will we ever get a tax break? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To speak to Bill C-71, which is a budget implementation bill, is 
indeed an honour and I think a high responsibility.  I will do my 
best to represent the wishes of the people in my riding as I 
speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a prologue to my speech I would like to comment on some of 
the things that have been said here.  Until today I have said to 
many people that one thing about the Bloc members is that they 
are very focused.  Their issue is one issue.  They want to take 
their province out of our wonderful country and every speech 
which they give, every time they rise to speak, is focused on 
their goal of separating from Canada. 
I profoundly disagree with that goal.  We know that the majority 
of people in Quebec do not want to leave Canada.  Bloc members 
are really riding a dead horse.  They are flogging it to try to 
make it run, but it will not go anywhere.  However, today they 
have switched horses.  Today they are not talking about 
separation.  Today they are talking about wanting more from 
Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the whole program of transfer payments to the 
provinces is very convoluted.  I have done a little study of it 
and the more I study it the more convoluted it seems to become 
and the more difficult to understand.  However, the public 
accounts indicate that in proportion to the population Quebec has 
had above average transfers, that is, averaged over the 
population of the whole country.  If we take the total number of 
contributions and divide that number by the population of the 
country, we get a smaller number than the contributions that are 
given to Quebec divided by its population.  Quebec is above 
average.  I do not think Quebecers would generally want to 
acknowledge that, but it is the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we hear them talking about being against this one part of 
Bill C-71.  In fact, what we are debating at report stage is 
their amendment to remove that part where the federal government 
transfers money to the provinces for health care, for the CHST. 
The reason they are giving, and it has been quite clear in their 
speeches, I do not think they have tried to obfuscate it, is 
because the amount of money they will be getting will be going 
down and they are against that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot of respect, not only for the people of Quebec, but 
for the members of the Bloc party who were sent here by their 
ridings to represent their ridings.  I have a lot of respect for 
them individually.  I believe they are doing well to speak this 
way and to put this amendment forward because they are doing it 
to protect their constituents, which is a legitimate role in 
debate in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we look at the larger picture for all of the 
country, and of course this is where they are sort of out of the 
picture, it seems to me eminently responsible and eminently fair 
that the amount of money that is transferred by the federal 
government to fund programs, which in some cases are administered 
by the provincial governments, should be equal with respect to a 
per capita contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that in the House we cannot use props.  I taught for 31 
years and I would have been lost without the use of a blackboard 
in the old days, or the whiteboard with all the colours nowadays 
and the overhead projector and the computer generated image on 
the screen.  I wish I could show a chart of some of these things 
because I think we would communicate much better.  It is 
unfortunate that we cannot do that in the House, as they do, for 
example, in the Congress of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had the ability to communicate in that way I would draw a 
picture of a huge barrel.  All of the taxpayers of the country 
would contribute money which would be put into that barrel.  Some 
time ago I computed at what rate we were putting money into that 
barrel.  Actually it is not a difficult thing to do.  I think we 
have around $150 billion a year in government expenditures. 
Clearly money goes into the barrel if we are going to spend it, 
either by borrowing or from another source.  We have in the 
neighbourhood of 15 million taxpayers, so it works out very 
easily to about $10,000 per person that we put into this barrel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the members of the Bloc party and to all members 
of the House is, what is an equitable way of distributing that 
money with respect to the support of education, health care and 
social services in the different provinces? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to health care and education, I really think an 
equal per capita grant for all of the provinces would be pretty 
fair.  The cost of educating a student, whether in British 
Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick or any one 
of the other provinces, would be reasonably close.  It would not 
be exact.  We know there are different costs of living.  There 
are different costs of getting an education in different parts of 
the country, but it would be really close. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true for health care.  There are some variances.  If 
there is an area with a dense population it is more economical to 
provide health care to that population.  If there is a larger 
area with the same population it costs a little a more.  There 
could be a small adjustment for a sparse population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we talk about a sparse population, I do not think that Quebec 
is more sparsely populated than any other province in the 
country.  We have more densely populated areas in the south of my 
province and in all provinces.  When we get away from the south 
there are sparsely populated areas where we have the costs of 
medical helicopters and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking specifically to this amendment, I think the House of 
Commons should be against it.  If I may be so bold, I am going to 
appeal to the members of the Bloc who represent their ridings and 
constituents to consider voting against this amendment, in the 
interest of fairness, in the interest of getting along with each 
other in our country.  Rather, let us look at budget 
implementation which gives fairness on a per capita basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say that while they want to amend this bill 
because their actual contributions are going down, that is a 
tacit recognition that their per capita contribution from the 
federal government is higher.  If we move to an equal per capita 
rate and theirs goes down, logically they have admitted that 
theirs is too high in comparison to other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that in the same budget, but in a 
different bill, we implemented the matters of the transfers to 
the provinces through the transfer payments.  In that particular 
instance Quebec is getting a great deal more money, while the 
transfers to provinces like Manitoba are being reduced, and we 
did not see those members proposing amendments to change that.

Madam Speaker, I am also pleased to have the opportunity to 
participate in the debate on Bill C-71 and in particular to 
address the amendment proposed by the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by starting where the Reform Party left off. I take 
some umbrage with the last speaker's comment.  What we are 
dealing with here is more than a mathematical equation.  When we 
address health care needs, if we are at all serious about 
formulating good policy, we have to look at need.  Surely the 
member from the Reform Party understands that a straight cap will 
not necessarily reflect the needs, particularly the acute needs 
in various regions of this country.  It certainly would not 
reflect the third world conditions that we now see in northern 
and remote communities in all parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must go beyond looking at a straight per capita formula and 
start looking at questions of ensuring that our publicly 
administered health care system can be funded to the extent to 
which it is the dominant mould by which we provide health care in 
the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge the members of the Reform Party to look very 
carefully at how the ratio between public and private spending is 
shifting.  Under the present system and under the formula 
proposed by the Reform Party, we will soon see private control 
over our health care system dominate completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would put at risk the fundamentals of our health care system, 
the very notion of a universally accessible health care system. 
Certainly if not in a direct way, in a most insidious way we 
would see the end of medicare, the end of the five principles 
under the Canada Health Act and the end of our system that is the 
envy of the world over, a single tier, universally accessible, 
publicly administered health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having made those introductory comments in response to Reform's 
proposition, let me say how important it is to have this 
opportunity to participate in the discussion on the 1999 budget 
particularly because it has been called the health care budget. 
It is important to have this debate because the government has 
denied us opportunities on every front to ensure that we hold the 
government accountable for its expenditures particularly when it 
comes to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say for the record that if it were not for this 
opportunity today, we would have little chance to scrutinize the 
government's expenditures in any area, particularly health care. 
The estimates process at the committee level has become a 
charade.  There is very little opportunity at the committee 
level, because of the way the government controls the committee 
process, to ensure that we have ample time to scrutinize the 
expenditures of the government.  That particularly applies in the 
area of health care.  Based on the committee of which I am a 
member, given the dictates of the Liberal government and its hold 
over the committee system, we will be lucky to have four 
sessions, maybe eight hours of discussion on an incredibly large 
and costly part of our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take every opportunity I can to speak on health care 
because of the arbitrary and autocratic way in which this 
government has operated. It has taken away so many opportunities 
for true participation by members of the House and for true 
democracy to prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has tried to portray the 1999 budget as a health 
care budget.  The question for all of us today is does it in its 
details actually accomplish that objective and meet that 
description? We have heard today and from Canadians everywhere 
that it does not.  One could actually say that the government has 
presented us with another example of smoke and mirrors, another 
attempt at illusory politics, another way to disguise the real 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government has done in this budget when it comes to 
health care is that in five years time it will get us back to the 
level we enjoyed in 1993 when the government began its very 
massive cutback and offloading in health care. I do not need to 
repeat the statistics.  Canadians are fully aware of them. They 
were as shocked as we were when we realized the full impact of 
this budget and what it actually meant in terms of federal 
support and federal responsibility for quality health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best way I can put it is to recognize that when all is said 
and done, federal spending as a percentage of all health care 
spending amounts to 12%.  Just think back.  That is a long way 
from the notion of 50:50 cost sharing as was once the case.  In 
actuality it truly happened; we used to have a 50:50 
federal-provincial cost shared arrangement on health care.  That 
is certainly a long way from the 25% goal that many experts in 
this field have recommended as the bare minimum for government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are we at?  We are at 12%.  Where is private spending in 
this country?  It has grown to 30% of all spending on health 
care.  It does not take much calculating to figure out what that 
actually means and what kind of system we end up with.  We end up 
with a two tier health care system, no ifs, ands or buts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would say that we already have a two tier health care 
system. Absolutely.  Why do we have a two tier health care 
system?  Because the federal government dropped the ball, 
offloaded responsibility, cut back to the point where it has 
created a wide open climate for private investment to insert 
itself and encroach on a whole area once considered absolutely 
sacred as a public service. How does that show up in the lives of 
ordinary Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It shows up in Alberta where the provincial government continues 
to advance the notion of a private hospital.  There has been no 
retreat from that despite public outcry. It shows up in Prince 
Edward Island in the form of the possibility of a hospital that 
will be run on one of the so-called public-private partnerships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It shows up in the fact that privately funded MRIs, magnetic 
resonance imaging machinery, are springing up all over the 
country and are available on a two tier basis.  People who have 
the money can get access.  Those who do not, tough luck. It shows 
up in the form of private eye clinics springing up all over the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  So blame them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Madam Speaker, yes, I blame the 
Liberal government.  But Reform members who are advocating and 
talking about accommodating the notion of a parallel private 
health care system are seeking the same objective as the Liberal 
government.  Both parties are seeking the dismantling and erosion 
of medicare to the point where we will have nothing but an 
Americanized, privatized two tier health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plea today is to reverse this agenda.  The federal budget 
made a tiny step in that direction by putting back some of the 
money it took out of the system in 1993.  But it is not enough to 
stop that encroachment on the private sector.  It is not enough 
to stop the waiting lists.  It is not enough to ensure access to 
quality health care services for all Canadians.  It is not enough 
to take the stress off nurses who feel they are not able to 
perform their lifelong goal of providing quality care for 
patients because of the financial pressures on the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we all share that goal and for the sake of medicare, if the 
Reform Party truly accepts this notion of the universally 
accessible publicly administered health system, then for 
goodness' sake let us join together in convincing the government 
that it must reverse the trend.  The government must ensure there 
is adequate support for the provinces in our health system.  The 
government must show leadership to ensure that the principles of 
the health care act apply to every aspect of our health care 
system to stop the emergence of a private two tier health care 
system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to Bill C-71 this afternoon.  This is a bill which 
addresses certain of the  provisions contained in the 1999 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of areas are involved; in fact, the bill has nine 
parts.  In the next few minutes, I would like to address one of 
them in particular, which concerns tax arrangements between the 
federal and provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the federal government collects taxes, lots of 
taxes.  Not just personal or corporate income taxes. 
There is also indirect taxation, the sales tax, the famous GST. 
As well, through employment insurance, it collects another large 
amount, far in excess of what is needed to operate the 
employment insurance program.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, when one sees all the tax and employment insurance 
collected by the federal government, one quickly realizes that 
the totals far exceed the budgetary requirements resulting from 
the federal government's responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is, moreover, what prompts the federal government to 
habitually and repeatedly, I am tempted to say sneakily, 
interfere in provincial areas of jurisdiction.  The federal 
government spends money where it has no right to even be 
involved, instead of the provincial governments whose 
responsibilities these areas are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consequences are obvious.  Individuals and corporations are 
being taxed excessively. 
Workers pay some 35% or 35% too much in contributions to 
employment insurance.  In all this, we can draw a simple 
conclusion:  the federal government should reduce its tax bases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also clear that, in the agreements on transfers between 
the federal and the provincial governments, the federal 
government gives them money so they may assume their 
responsibilities in the areas of health, higher education and 
social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very simply, what we realize is that, with one hand, the federal 
government recovers its money and, with the other, it gives it 
out, to a limited extent, to the provincial governments so they 
may assume their responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one justification for this approach, that of 
redistributing to the less fortunate provinces money collected 
from taxpayers in the more fortunate provinces so that each 
province may fully carry out the responsibilities under its 
jurisdiction in the areas of education, health care and social 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may have been the case in the past, but it is no longer so. 
In fact, in the budget brought down in February by the Minister 
of Finance, the concept of a redistribution according to need 
was dropped.  Redistribution is now according to the number of 
individuals living in each province.  That is what they call per 
capita redistribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the money is given to each province on a per capita basis and 
not based on its relative wealth, then the federal government no 
longer has any reason to collect from taxpayers money it will 
give them back anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since health, education and social services come under the 
jurisdiction of the provinces, it would be much better to let 
the provinces themselves adjust their taxes according to their 
needs, instead of watching the federal government act like a Mr. 
Know it all and take it all and then try to redistribute the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About two weeks ago, I attended the Bloc Quebecois general 
council, in Rivière-du-Loup. We talked about tax issues, among 
other things. We discussed the Canada social transfer, which is 
of course mentioned in the 1999 budget, since the government 
just changed its nature by redistributing the money under an 
equalization system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one of our workshops, it was suggested that Quebec should let 
Ottawa deal with the Canada social transfer and opt out of it, 
but be compensated by getting the full amount of the goods and 
services tax. The GST revenues are more or less equivalent to 
the Canada social transfer. In other words, under that 
arrangement, Quebec would neither win nor lose from a financial 
point of view. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, both sides would win in that the duplication of the tax 
collection process would be eliminated. In Quebec, rather than 
collecting both the GST and the TVQ, there would be only a 
single collection, and the total amount collected would remain 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we saw this morning, we often hear comments to the effect 
that Quebec benefits from the Canada social transfer and similar 
money transfers between the federal government and our province. 
This issue would become a moot point. It would no longer apply, 
since Quebec would no longer benefit—if you will—from the 
Canada social transfer, since it would get an equivalent amount 
through the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is more. 
It will be recalled that, when the federal government 
implemented universal medicare just over 20 years ago, it agreed 
to share the cost with each province. But, over the years, the 
federal government has reneged on this arrangement, with the 
result that it now pays just over 10% of provincial health 
expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big problem with the federal government is that its promises 
are never good for very long.  In fact, Ottawa's share of social 
transfer payments has dwindled over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no denying that, if Quebec were to opt out of the CHST 
and keep the whole GST, it would be safe from further erosion of 
the CHST by the federal government because it would control its 
own GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a good many advantages to the formula put forward in 
Rivière-du-Loup during the Bloc Quebecois' general council.  The 
first is that it eliminates double taxation from the outset. 
Taxes would be collected once in Quebec, and remain there.  The 
Government of Quebec could then adjust the amount collected to 
keep pace with its socioeconomic and cultural needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other advantage is that Quebec would be safe from the 
federal government's policy changes.  The federal government 
would be able to play around all it wants with provincial 
transfer payments. 
Quebec would not have to worry because it will have opted out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many who claim that transfers are a good deal for 
Quebec when, as they know very well, a per capita CHST would 
mean disgracefully disproportionate spending by the federal 
government on goods and services, and research and development. 
A per capita transfer would mean a 6%, 7%, or 8% increase in 
federal spending in Quebec, which is not what it is getting.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to follow the remarks of my colleague from the 
Bloc Quebecois although on some matters we may see things 
differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget that was brought down by the government can cause us 
to reflect on other times.  It can cause us to reflect upon times 
when there was a commitment by the federal government in Ottawa 
to ensure that there were national standards across the country 
regardless of what community one lived in, regardless of what 
city one lived in, and regardless of what province one resided 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It ensured that the harmony of Canada—and I think that is a 
word we can use with some sincerity—was kept in place because 
people across the country knew it was a generous country.  As a 
country we shared with one another.  Those provinces that were 
well-to-do because of certain government policies or certain 
natural resources shared with the provinces which found 
themselves not as well off for whatever reasons, because of 
government policies or because of transitions in industry and 
whatnot.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, changes adopted by this government and begun by the 
prior Conservative government began to erode public confidence in 
the harmony and in the fact that whether one lived in rural 
Alberta, Manitoba or Saskatchewan one had entitlement to the same 
benefits as those who lived in urban centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I discuss the new funding formula based on a per capita 
basis it leads into a discussion about who is entitled and who is 
not, and what is the real hidden agenda of a government that says 
it will pay so much money per person without taking into account 
all kinds of other factors such as unemployment in a particular 
region or health care concerns in one province or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reflects a move toward an urban Canada.  Not only the per 
capita funding but also the decrease in funding coming from the 
federal government over the last 10 years has forced the 
provinces to realign their priorities.  The downloading of cuts 
on to many provinces has meant that they have had to slash health 
care, about which my colleague in the New Democratic Party has 
already spoken so eloquently, and to cut back in terms of 
education and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people listening to this debate or who will read 
<I>Hansard</I> should be aware that there was a time when the 
federal government cost shared with the provinces on a 50:50 
basis the costs of social assistance.  This to me was only fair 
in light of the fact that many government policies have a direct 
impact upon whether or not people are employed.  If people are 
not employed they fall on to social assistance rolls, sometimes 
through no fault of their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a community and province which have a great 
understanding of that.  I can point to the recent announcement in 
January by the Minister of Natural Resources in my own community 
that will result in the end of the coal mining industry in Cape 
Breton, resulting in perhaps 1,100 people falling on to the 
provincial social assistance rolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has decided that it is no longer 
committed to the economic welfare of the people in Cape Breton. 
That is a decision it can make.  It has a majority.  It can 
decide if it wants to abandon those who are most in need.  That 
appears to be a decision it makes with very little remorse and 
indeed very little concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean for the province of Nova Scotia as the 
government turns its back on men and women who have been employed 
in a crown corporation in my community for some 25 or 30 years? 
There are men and women, miners who have gone underground, who 
have injured themselves and are no longer able to retrain in the 
new technological workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it mean when the government abandons such people in 
the cavalier and callous manner it has chosen?  Many of these 
families will fall on to the provincial welfare rolls or 
provincial social assistance rolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean for the province of Nova Scotia?  Not only 
does that province lose the $300 million a year spin-off from the 
Cape Breton Development Corporation mining industry.  It means 
that it has to come up with the social assistance money to 
provide for these families that have been abandoned by the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somewhere in the resources of a province that is already 
considered a have not province we have to find the money to 
provide for these families.  That means that the province has to 
cut further in other areas of its jurisdiction.  That means that 
the children of the families on provincial social assistance 
because of the abandonment of the federal government will go to 
schools with fewer resources than the children in Ontario. 
Perhaps I should say in Toronto because the northern parts of 
Ontario and Manitoba and the rural parts of Saskatchewan will 
find themselves suffering the same fate as we move to two 
solitudes. 
Those two solitudes will not be French and English but urban and 
rural.  Because of the measures brought in by this budget people 
who reside in large urban centres will perhaps find themselves 
with the necessary resources to complete the social safety net 
that we have grown to know.  By urban I do not mean cities of 
30,000, 40,000, 50,000 or 60,000.  I mean large urban centres of 
one million, two million, three million or four million.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, those who live outside those urban centres will find 
themselves in a struggle with scarce provincial resources for 
things like education and health care.  They will find themselves 
forced to migrate to the urban centres where those services may 
be provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is essentially what is happening if we look at the country. 
This is why the Liberal Premier of Newfoundland was so adamant in 
his objection to the type of funding and the formulas proposed by 
the government.  He understands that his province is suffering an 
outward migration, as are my own community, the province of 
Prince Edward Island and all other have not provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within provinces the rural communities are suffering from the 
migration of their young people, the greatest resource they have, 
to the urban centres, which I think is the underlying policy of 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to what will happen in my community, to the province 
of Nova Scotia, as a result of this federal government's 
abandonment.  I talked about the impact on schools.  Let me talk 
about the impact on the environment.  There was not a shred of 
evidence in the budget to indicate a commitment by the government 
to clean up the environment or to ensure that we have a 
sustainable environment for the next generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeared before the Standing Committee on the Environment to 
talk about a major concern of mine and I think of most Canadians, 
the tar ponds in Nova Scotia.  I urged members of the committee 
to see the tar ponds for themselves.  I was well received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair of the committee asked a pointed question of me.  He 
asked what was the municipality's commitment to clean them up. It 
told the chairman that the municipality had no money.  The 
municipality just had most of its tax base hived away by the 
Minister of Natural Resources when he decided to lay off 1,100 
coal miners in my community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the municipal commitment?  It is to try to sustain some 
sense of order in a community which finds itself reeling because 
of federal government's decisions reflected in its budget and 
budget priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a few other points.  There is a real lack of 
creativity in the budget.  We talk about how to stimulate 
economic growth, but there was nothing in the budget to look at 
community economic development.  There was nothing in the budget 
to talk about tax credits for investment in communities with high 
rates of unemployment.  We are not only talking about the 
maritime provinces.  We are talking about every province in this 
federation which suffers regions of high unemployment and unfair 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by saying that I welcome debate on this 
legislation on behalf of the constituents in Sydney—Victoria.  I 
urge the federal government to reconsider its commitment to 
ensuring that Canadians in every part of the country, whether 
they be urban, rural, eastern, western, French or English, have a 
national standard of which we can all be proud.

the Bloc motion that refers to the speed at which the government 
dispenses money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time in a long time I have heard the Bloc arguing 
that the government is dispensing money too quickly.  That is 
usually something Reformers are arguing in spades.  In fact, part 
of the reason I rose today was to talk about how the Budget

too much money once again and far too quickly for most people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of weeks ago we received a rather lengthy document sent 
out from Heritage Canada telling us about all the spending that 
has been done at the millennium bureau of Canada.  I remember the 
Prime Minister making the promise in the House a year or so ago 
that we would not be having a big send up party and nothing left 
at the end of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In looking through the spending at the millennium bureau of 
Canada I have come to the conclusion that it is an almost 
unbelievable binge of questionable spending.  To me, it looks 
like a bunch of giveaways that have absolutely nothing to do with 
leaving us something after the party. I can give some good 
examples.  The folder which came from Heritage Canada had each 
province in a separate booklet.  I made a quick scan through it. 
It was unbelievable some of the spending that was going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium bureau seems quite happy to have been dispensing 
$145 million on all sorts of crazy projects.  The bureau is quite 
proud of the spending. It is almost guaranteed that the average 
taxpayer would be appalled at what is going on with the 
dispensing of money to special interest groups, especially as 
many of the projects have only the vaguest connection to the 
start of the new millennium, especially when we consider that the 
true start of the 21st century is not until December 31 in the 
year 2000.  It is not at the end of this year, it is at the end 
of next year. Everyone has been caught up in this millennium 
fever in the wrong year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give some examples of the sort of spending at the 
millennium bureau which in my opinion and my constituents' 
opinion is the dispensing of money far too quickly and is a 
complete waste.  It should not have even been in this budget at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are impressive undertakings such as $15,000 to detail the 
experiences of garment workers in Canada.  Tell me how that 
relates to the millennium.  There is $300,000 for concerts 
featuring a separatist singer; $15,183 for the Apple and Cider 
Interpretation Centre in Quebec; and $5,333 to build two giant 
mastodons in Carroll's Corner, Nova Scotia. Any of these projects 
may be justifiable as standalone projects, but they do not have 
anything to do with the millennium.  They are an excuse to spend 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a few more examples from B.C. and Ontario in 
particular.  McDonald's Corners/Elphin Recreation and Arts will 
receive $2,003 to help organize the building of a labyrinth on 
the grounds of the 1868 McDonald's Corners schoolhouse.  They 
claim that the project will be constructed of willow bushes which 
grow about two metres annually allowing them to be harvested for 
use by local artisans, and that this living labyrinth with its 
roots in earlier millennia will provide lasting effects into the 
new age. Frankly I am absolutely convinced that the artisans will 
forget to harvest the willow, so we are going to be on the hook 
for more grants next year to trim the bushes.  Of that I am 
pretty sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a really big one in the Vancouver area.  The Vancouver 
Symphony Orchestra thinks it would like to break three Guinness 
world records with a grant of $129,667, almost $130,000.  They 
are going to amass the world's largest collection of musicians to 
perform O Canada, Beethoven's 9th Symphony and a new work which 
will reflect the music of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the project description “The orchestra along with 
more than 21,000 students and possibly as many as 40,000 from 
throughout British Columbia will enjoy a once in a millennium 
experience”.  We can be sure of that because the millennium only 
comes once in a millennium.  Listen to this, Mr. Speaker.  This 
is a project description to justify $130,000. “It will increase 
their appreciation for music and their self-esteem and over the 
long term discourage crime, drug abuse and participation in gang 
violence, a worthy legacy for a new millennium”.  That is a 
quote directly from the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example, “The Canadian Canoe Museum will steer 
unerringly into the new millennium”, says the millennium bureau, 
“with $1,057,933 to develop a new 15,000 square foot exhibit in 
the Canadian Canoe Museum in Peterborough”.  The project summary 
states, “The travelling and educational exhibits will focus on 
the canoe as a unifying national symbol that brings Canadians 
together as we enter the new millennium”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If members are not yet convinced that these projects are a 
complete and utter waste of money, let me give another one.  The 
Friends of the Ruins of St. Raphael's will spend its grant of 
$146,000 on ensuring that the fire gutted ruins of St. Raphael's 
Church survive as an interpretive site well into the new 
millennium. This church burned down 30 years ago.  I do not know 
why nobody has rebuilt it but obviously not too many people are 
interested.  For some reason a special interest group has managed 
to extract $146,000 from taxpayers to ensure that it remains as 
an interpretive site well into the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Waterfront Trail Artists of Etobicoke are guaranteed not to 
have any problems with bird droppings in its project.  The Flight 
of Passenger Pigeons, thanks to a $13,614 grant from the 
millennium bureau, involves only birds made of papier mâché.  The 
project organizers hope to convince, and they still have to do 
this, 2,000 students from 13 area schools to make life size 
replicas of the extinct passenger pigeon for display in their 
schools and public places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, “those too young to sculpt will draw their 
passenger pigeons”—sketch them instead—“and have their 
messages attached to the sculptures, bringing the total number of 
messages to 4,000”.   The project says “the replicas will 
remind people of the fragility of our environment and the 
importance of nurturing it in the next millennium”. I suspect 
that the papier mâché pigeons, once they get a little wet, will 
gradually disintegrate and the paper will blow all over 
Etobicoke, Ontario and make a huge mess, probably more than the 
real passenger pigeons would have made if they were alive today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another big one also in B.C.  Unfortunately, some of the 
big ones have gone to B.C.  The Leadership Initiative for Earth 
will use $599,514 to help finance the building and sailing of a 
sustainable Lifeship 2000 tall ship.  “The life story of every 
tree used in its construction will be documented”.  This is very 
worthy.  I do not how they are going to get the life story of 
every tree.  I know if we cut them in half we can count the rings 
and that tells us how old they are, but I have never read 
anything else in there that tells me what they were doing along 
the way.  I am not sure if we are going to get $599,000 worth of 
action out of that project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an absolutely rare display of common sense, the millennium 
bureau turned down a project that emanated from North Vancouver. 
It was called the Multicultural Mask experience.  It was 
submitted by Earth Muffin Productions of North Vancouver.  I 
think most of us know what earth muffins are.  It was submitted 
by Earth Muffin Productions but it was turned down mainly because 
the proposal, and I quote from the turn down letter, “did not 
demonstrate a sufficient level of support from the community or 
other financial partners”.  I wonder why.  I did read about the 
project and it was appalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the millennium bureau.  It is a big excuse to spend 
money and is a real example of the waste that is in this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last couple of weeks when we have talked about the west, 
members on the government side still seem to think that throwing 
money at things is the way to make friends.  They keep talking 
about the western diversification fund and how wonderful it is to 
throw away hundreds of millions of dollars, as if westerners want 
money spent on them.  They do not. They would get rid of the 
western diversification fund in return for tax decreases.  That 
is what should have been in this year's budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec and among Bloc Quebecois members, this budget was 
received with anger because, without any warning, the Minister 
of Finance changed something that had been agreed between the 
federal government and the provinces. I am referring to social 
transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finances has decided that the Canada social 
transfer, which used to be proportional, would now be calculated 
on a per capita basis. As a result, the Quebec government—whose 
health care system had been seriously affected by the federal 
deficit reduction efforts and cuts in transfer payments—is now 
shortchanged to the tune of $350 million over 5 years. 
That it angered the Bloc Quebecois, the Parti Quebecois 
government and Quebecers at large was to be expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that, so far, nobody has understood where I am coming 
from. I will try to explain in a straightforward manner what the 
finance minister has been doing since he came to power. I will 
start with a history lesson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the late 1960s, the federal government came up with the 
Canada Assistance Plan to help the provinces assume the costs of 
poverty. In fact, through the CAP, the federal government was 
covering 50% of the provinces' expenditures to provide help to 
people in need over and above benefits. This had been going on 
since 1969. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals took office in 1993, the first thing they did, 
in their first budget, was to cut social spending. They had just 
announced a major reform of social policies. They had asked a 
committee to travel across Canada to listen to what Canadians 
and Quebecers had to say about social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This great desire for reform, from which no specific proposals 
were really expected, led in 1995 to the announcement of radical 
changes by the Minister of Finance, who decided to group social 
transfers for education and health into one single transfer. Up 
to that point, the large amounts of taxpayers' money spent by 
the federal government on health and education and called social 
transfers were made on a per capita basis. In other words, until 
the Minister of Finance decided to make changes in 1995, federal 
transfers for health and education were based on the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, there was also a specific plan called the 
Canada assistance plan, which was based on poverty. 
It took poverty into account. What did the Minister of Finance 
do as he was getting ready to make drastic cuts? He grouped all 
transfers for education, health and poverty into one single 
transfer. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, population could no longer be the sole criterion, nor 
could poverty in each province apply completely either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the government announced that it would establish an average, 
with the result that Quebec, which had a little more than 25% of 
the Canadian population, received approximately 28% of the 
total. Why? Because when we had the Canada assistance plan, 
Quebec received 34%. This means there is a real poverty problem. 
It does not mean that Quebec does not have a great future as a 
state, but that there is a serious historical problem of 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was announced that we would very gradually go from 28% to 50% 
only of the population criterion. What did the Minister of 
Finance do in his budget? He decided that in three years poverty 
would no longer be taken into account. The federal government 
does not take poverty into account in the equalization formula 
and we know that the poverty level is different from one 
province to another. The federal government will no longer take 
that into account. This is what we wanted to condemn in all 
possible ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that the federal government used a trick to slip 
Quebec a lump of coal. The government took advantage of the fact 
that the equalization formula would allow Quebec to receive, 
because of good economic performance, in Ontario among others, 
an amount of $1.4 billion. Was this a novelty, a reform, a gift? 
No, it was the result of prior commitments and agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, taking advantage of what was Quebec's 
due on the one hand, took advantage on the other hand by doing 
away with something that had been in place since the late 1960s, 
and had been planned as something quite different: the 
recognition of the weight of poverty and assistance to the 
provinces with the heaviest burden of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under such circumstances, Quebec could not do otherwise than to 
react sharply, particularly since it had been hit especially 
hard by the employment insurance reform.  This reform was also a 
desire to do away with inter-regional subsidies, to use 
technocratic jargon.  This meant that, where employment 
insurance was concerned, Quebec got it in the neck, if I may put 
it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, in both social program reform and employment 
insurance reform, Quebec got more than its fair share of cuts. 
But it did not get its fair share on another level: productive 
spending. 
We must keep repeating this.  The reason we want sovereignty is 
to have control over everything we produce, all of our taxes, to 
use as we see fit, in order to develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people see sovereignty as a means of seriously addressing 
the phenomenon of poverty, which unfortunately—it must be said, 
shouted from the rooftops even, given the way the federal 
government has decided to fight the deficit—has increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs recently tried to tell 
us that Quebec was getting its share of federal productive 
spending.  He used science and technology spending as his 
example, saying that Quebec got 28.3%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was extraordinary was that he proposed that the Hull-Ottawa 
area be excluded.  What people need to know is that in the 
Hull-Ottawa area, 87% of expenditures are in Ontario, and 13% in 
Quebec.  So not taking it into account was how the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs could conclude that Quebec was getting 
its share of productive spending. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today we are talking about Bill C-71, an act to implement certain 
provisions of the budget that was tabled by the finance minister 
in February. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about some of the things that the finance 
minister has done in his reign of terror, as some would say, his 
reign of taxation.  The minister of high taxes, who sits across 
the way, has slashed and burned health care spending to the tune 
of $20 billion from 1993 to the year 2000.  Since he took office 
that is what the minister has done and that is unconscionable. 
This is also the finance minister who says that he is reinvesting 
$11.5 billion over five years and wants Canadians to be happy 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the big picture of what he is asking Canadians to 
do.  He is asking Canadians to accept the fact that he has taken 
away $20 billion in spending on health care and social services, 
the CHST, and is putting back $11.5 billion.  I do not know very 
many Canadians who would be happy to hear that they will lose $1 
from their pocket but that they may get 50 cents of that back or 
a little bit more.  That does not make sense, but that is exactly 
what the finance minister has done.  He has slashed and burned 
health care in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal finance minister, who stands in this place and tells 
us he is the defender of health care and the creator of 
everything good in the country, cannot run from his record.  He 
can run, but Canadians are not going to let him hide from his 
record, nor should they.  Members of the official opposition will 
continue to point out the facts of what the finance minister has 
done in his slash and burn approach to health care spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of the high taxation that we have in the country, 
and who has been the finance minister for six years, has also 
implemented or allowed a policy to continue for years concerning 
the whole issue of family tax fairness.  We brought this up not 
long ago in the House of Commons and had wide agreement on it 
from the members of the opposition and from members of the 
government as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a finance minister who says he cares about the tax rates 
in the country and the burden of taxation on families, yet he 
does absolutely nothing for those families who make the decision 
to have one of the individuals in the home stay home to look 
after and give care to their children.  There is an inequality 
that has been entrenched in policy by this minister of high 
taxation and he has not addressed that for six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at a person's words and actions, words can be empty 
after awhile if they are not followed up by action.  We must 
first listen to what somebody says and then look at what they do. 
If what they do, does not match up with what they say, then we 
should be questioning what it is they are saying to see whether 
what they say and what they do are actually the same thing.  In 
this case, they are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of high taxation has told us that he cares about 
families and about lowering tax rates for average Canadians. 
However, that is not what I am hearing from constituents.  That 
is not what I heard from the individuals I talked to in Hamilton 
last night or in Stoney Creek, Ontario a few weeks ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to individuals in Dewdney—Alouette and to many 
young families this past weekend at an event in Maple Ridge. They 
asked me how a government could be in place that says it cares 
about families yet has a discriminatory tax policy in place that 
favours one situation of care giving over another. They said to 
me, “It looks like the government does not see the value in the 
commitment we are making to have one of the individuals on our 
family stay home and look after our children.” 
That is a shame, because there are many families who are making 
that sacrifice and commitment to their families for the good of 
the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government and members of the government say such 
things, as the hon. member from Vancouver—Kingsway did, that 
mothers or families who would make the decision to stay home are 
taking the easy way out.  That is the response we hear from the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for St. Paul's referred to the individuals who came 
before the all party finance committee to plead their case as 
elite white women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are members of the Liberal government saying these kinds 
of things.  They can run and they are trying to run, but they 
cannot hide from their record and what they have done.  Canadians 
are waking up to the fact that the policies that are being put in 
place— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  More Canadians think they have been 
abducted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Even the Liberal members on the other 
side are echoing in agreement with me about their high tax 
policies and how they need to be lowered.  In fact, the Minister 
of Industry just yesterday and last week said that taxes are too 
high in the country and that taxes need to be lowered to the rate 
of the American model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the Prime Minister contradicting the Minister of 
Industry and the Minister of Finance looking both ways, as if at 
a tennis match, trying to figure out what is going on.  The 
Liberals cannot even figure it out over there.  The Minister of 
Industry has figured it out.  Taxes are simply too high and they 
need to be lowered.  There is a debate about that over on that 
side because they do not want to let go of those dollars. They do 
not want to provide the tax relief that is necessary to provide 
the care for families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the hon. member from Coquitlam chirping away, a man who 
said he was no yes-man during his byelection campaign yet voted 
with the government to punish families through high tax policy. 
He continues to chirp away, as do other members of the Liberal 
government who are trying to run from the record. Canadians are 
not going to let them hide any longer, because it is their high 
tax policy that is putting down a lot of people in the country, 
keeping them from taking their rightful place by working hard and 
providing for their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It used to be that individuals would work really hard to put 
some money aside for a second car or for a cottage at the lake. 
Today, families are working harder and harder to put food on the 
table and provide clothing and shelter for their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I simply say to my Liberal colleagues across the 
way, who seem to be deaf to the voices of their own constituents 
and Canadians across the country, that substantial tax relief is 
necessary to provide relief to Canadian families.  We would have 
hoped to have seen that in Bill C-71, but, alas, the government 
continues to punish Canadians with high taxes.

for over 877,000 Canadians, including some residents in my riding

contributor to our balance of trade, representing over $31.6 
billion in 1998.

Jason Lang. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday Jason's memory was honoured before 2,000 mourners and 
the national media in a remarkable way.  The service was 
conducted by the Reverend Dale Lang, Jason's father.  Dale Lang, 
his wife Diane and their children displayed tremendous courage 
and forgiveness, buoyed by their deep faith in God, as they asked 
that some good come from this tragedy so that Jason's death would 
not be in vain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There could have been bitterness and blame and a call for 
revenge.  As a parent, I would have understood.  The loss of a 
child is every parent's worst nightmare.  But the Lang family saw 
the chance to use the death of their son to challenge the people 
of Taber to take back their school where this tragedy occurred 
and to reach out to those young people who have lost their way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the House will join with me in expressing our deepest 
condolences to the Lang family on the death of Jason and our 
thanks for their wonderful example of the Christian faith in 
action.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Canada Post Corporation Act says that Canada Post is 
not expected to pay dividends to the government.  Instead, 
surplus revenues should pay for improved services and provide 
decent wages and benefits for postal workers.  However, Canada 
Post will be giving $200 million to the federal government as a 
dividend payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, Canadians are worried about their postal services. 
In Sackville there are super mailboxes which freeze in the 
winter. In Shediac there are long line-ups.  In Richibucto the 
post office building is for sale.  More and more it seems that 
Canada Post's only concern is to make profits.  Could it be to 
make deregulation or privatization easier? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP strongly believes that Canada is best served by keeping 
Canada Post as a public service.  Deregulating or removing the 
post office's monopoly would increase postal rates in rural 
areas, raise post office deficits and eliminate postal services 
and jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post should work toward offering better service to all

Canada's military commitment to Kosovo without a vote or a

he uses his party discipline to force his own members to vote

of the signing and he refused a national referendum.  In the end 
the Meech Lake accord failed and that prime minister alienated 
and embittered the very people on whose behalf he claimed to be 
pushing that accord.

question is for the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will be as aware as all of us of the tragic 
accident a week or two ago where two VIA crew members were killed 
as a result of a derailment when a passenger train went through 
an open switch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found out after the accident that there exists sections 
within the Canadian rail system where there are so-called dark 
zones, where there is not the appropriate technological control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister commit to the House today that he and his 
department will be making sure that this kind of situation exists 
for only a very short time hereafter and that he will do 
something about it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I said at the time, I know I speak on behalf of 
all members of the House in extending condolences to the families 
of the victims who were injured and killed in that particular 
accident.  The TSB will be investigating this matter rather 
thoroughly and will determine the causes of the accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a Transport Canada inspector on site who determined that 
a threat does exist.  As a result we have issued a notice to 
Canadian National Railways to have it deal with that threat 
within 10 days. 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are dealing with something after the fact.  I want to 
raise another matter with the minister and he has a chance to 
deal with it before the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Transportation Union and others are concerned with 
the way that marshalling requirements are being handled by the 
railway.  We have cases where crews are going out with trains 
that have more cars than are on the records that they have, which 
means that they can make mistakes with respect to sidings, with 
respect to what is on the train in terms of hazardous materials, 
and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the rail safety directorate has been contacted about this 
matter.  Could the minister make a commitment to look into it 
himself and make sure that something is done about it before we 
have to raise it after an accident?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this matter has been raised at the transport

of the various unions involved.  Certainly it is something that 
we take very seriously because safety is Transport Canada's top 
priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly will undertake to investigate more fully the

not, Mr. Speaker, but I am delighted to have an opportunity to 
respond to that question.  After all, after the nine years of 
deficits piled up by the party that member represents, we brought 
them to zero.  It enabled us to make tax cuts.  That is the

there is not much left but the Liberal government knows how to

time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all it creates a state within a state, an idea which I 
think the Bloc Quebecois would find fairly palatable.  This is 
sovereignty association in the heart of British Columbia.  Not 
just that but this new kingdom of Nisga'a actually has 
constitutional superiority in 14 areas. The new Nisga'a 
government will have incredible powers, including the powers to 
tax, regulate trade and even dole out civil rights, if it so 
chooses, based upon a person's race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since when did the Prime Minister become a booster for 
sovereignty association?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

that the Reform Party needs to take some time to understand how 
Canada was built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our Constitution, the highest law in our land, we recognize 
and protect aboriginal interests. Section 35 identifies 
aboriginal rights as not being better rights than ours but being 
different by virtue of the fact that they were here first. The 
challenge we have as Canadians is to find ways and means in 
modern Canada to reflect those rights in a real and substantial 
way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
always thought one of the cherished Canadian principles was 
equality of all citizens.  That is something this party has stood 
for for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote directly from the Nisga'a deal:  “In the event of 
an inconsistency between a Nisga'a law and a federal or 
provincial law, the Nisga'a law prevails to the extent of the 
inconsistency or conflict”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadian laws no longer apply, if parliament is no longer the 
supreme authority, and if the Prime Minister is no longer the top 
elected official, why have we created an independent state within 
our borders?  That is what we have done.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

shows its lack of credibility as it relates to understanding the 
treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through negotiations we have found ways and means to reconcile 
the interests of all parties.  The Constitution applies.  The 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies.  The Criminal

last night the Prime Minister warned Canadians that they should

for the benefit of first nations in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House of some of the approaches of 
the opposition.  First of all, members will remember that their 
solution to the devastating poverty on first nations communities 
was to cut $1 billion from my ministry's budget.  I would remind 
members that they were so committed to the Inuit in Nunavut that 
when we had the debate in the House, all they focused on was the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example of how the Nisga'a treaty hands out 
rights and privileges based on race.  If you are a non-Nisga'a 
you do not have a right to practice a profession on Nisga'a land; 
no lawyers, doctors, mechanics, shopkeepers without getting 
special racial permission.

take the time to read the highest law of our land, the

Canada has taken in building a strong partnership with the first

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>TAXATION

<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, from 
day to day I have no idea where the government stands on the 
issue of taxes.  We have the industry minister who says that 
taxes need to come down to U.S. levels.  Yesterday, we had the 
Prime Minister who essentially kicked the industry minister right 
between the pockets when he said that high taxes are the Canadian 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what the government's position is today. 
What is the government's position on across the board tax relief? 
<P><A NAME="LINK156"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
have made it very clear.  We want to bring taxes down, we have 
brought taxes down and we will bring taxes down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, there is no doubt as to where the Reform Party 
stands on a number of issues.  Last week, for instance, on health 
care, the member from Okanagan basically said that he thought 
health care spending was questionable and that we should not have 
done it.  The member for Elk Island, when asked, confirmed that 
spending on health care was totally irresponsible.  Yesterday, 
the member for Calgary—Nose Hill confirmed that opinion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK157"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
instead of words, let us look at the government's actions on 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cut $21 billion out of health care.  It cut more 
hospital beds than all the provinces combined.  That is the 
record of the finance minister.  He is the Jack Kevorkian of 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister get off saying that he cares about health 
care when it is people like Mike Harris who are putting money 
into health care while the government guts it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I did not really hear that 
statement because there was too much noise.  We are getting a 
little bit close to being injudicious.  I will go to the Minister 
of Finance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is sort of interesting watching the Tories and the 
Reformers trying to claim credit for Mike Harris.  They can have 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is we, on this side of the House, are going to stand 
behind a modern and effective health care system, one that is 
based on compassion.  We are going to stand behind an education 
system that works.  We are going to stand behind balanced cuts in 
income taxes and investments in the future of Canadians.  That is 
what this side of the House stands for.  We understand what the 
united alternative stands for.

<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government is linking its new CPP investment fund to 
the TSE 300 index.  That index includes Imasco, Imperial 
Tobacco's parent company, a company that profits from the 
targeting of young smokers.  The health minister should know that 
any plan for persuading Canadians not to smoke cannot and should 
not be good for tobacco profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Minister of Health agree with the Minister of Finance 
that it is okay for CPP funds to support tobacco companies like 
Imperial Tobacco? 
<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as stated in the House, the Minister of Health has, on a 
number of occasions, set out the very important measures that the 
Government of Canada has put in place to discourage young people 
from smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the Canada pension plan was set up on a joint 
agreement between ourselves and the provinces.  An essential part 
of that agreement is that there will not be political 
interference in the investment decisions made by the fund.  It is 
investing in the index.  Under those circumstances, we are not 
going to interfere with what they are doing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am wondering why the Minister of Health cannot speak 
for himself and why the Minister of Finance has to keep pulling 
rank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the Minister of Health specifically what he thinks 
about public money, Canadians' dollars, our funds, going into 
tobacco companies which prey on young people.  I want to know 
what he is going to do to ensure that he puts together a 
comprehensive strategy for preventing smoking among people.  That 
includes an ethical investment policy for the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, we all know that the question is 
asked to the government and any minister or parliamentary 
secretary on this side can answer.

level of smoking in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tobacco is a legal product, but we are interested in reducing 
the level of smoking and preventing young children from starting 
to smoke.  We have introduced the toughest, most effective 
anti-tobacco legislation in the western world.  There are 
countries around the world that are copying it and using it as a 
model.  We are investing $100 million over five years in 
enforcing that statute and in efforts to discourage young people 
from starting to smoke.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, every single 
Industry Canada document in the past several years has stated 
that productivity is essential to Canada's economic prosperity 
and social security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February, the Minister of Industry told the Empire Club 
“productivity is the most important determinant of our standard 
of living”.  This past weekend, he called for tax cuts to 
improve our productivity, the worst of the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister agree with his Prime Minister that more money 
spent on health care instead of tax cuts will improve 
productivity? 
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as members know, the previous government knew very 
little about productivity and laid the basis for this country's 
problems in productivity by running up a debt and a deficit of 
$42 billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the essence of a number of the problems we face.  It is 
the essence of the reason we have had to take our tax cuts as we 
have been able to afford them.  It is the essence of the problem 
we have had in making large enough investments in science, 
research and development, in the National Research Council and in 
the granting councils.  This is the source of a complex problem 
that we all have a stake in resolving, but they— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Markham. 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it sounds like 
the industry minister is wimping out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's own report, “Sustaining Growth:  Human 
Development and Social Cohesion” listed six productivity drivers 
and not a single one was health care.  The report cited a better 
business environment, trade, innovation and investment in 
research and development.  The report recommended personal income 
tax cuts as one of the best remedies to Canada's productivity 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Industry tell the House who Canadians 
should believe, his own government's productivity research or the 
ramblings of a Prime Minister who once thought he invented the 
GST? 
<P><A NAME="LINK168"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that was pretty convoluted.  There may be a question in 
there somewhere, but in essence these people in the Conservative 
Party want to talk about tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us do a rough calculation of the interest we pay every year 
on the debt that the Conservatives accumulated during their nine 
years in office.  That in itself would finance a 25% tax cut 
across the board.  That is the essence of the problem.  If he 
thinks productivity has to do with anything other than quality of 
life and standards of living, then he fundamentally 
misunderstands the debate.  The reason we want to talk about 
health care is because it is part of our standard of living.

the government is still all over the map on taxes.  Yesterday the

us high taxes are good and the next moment he is telling us that 
we should cut them.

research.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>1999 BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK192">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-71, an act to implement 
certain provisions of the budget tabled in parliament on 
February 16, 1999, as reported (with amendment) from the 
committee; and of Motion No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise to speak to Bill C-71. But first I would like to set the 
record straight regarding some disparaging comments the members 
for Elk Island and Etobicoke North made this afternoon on Quebec 
and Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They took advantage of today's debate to demean Quebecers in the 
House; for Orangemen like these two, the temptation is great, of 
course. While my colleague, the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques was pleading for 
productive spending, the member for Etobicoke North seemed 
dumbfounded and asked “What is he talking about? What does he 
mean by productive spending?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the member for Etobicoke North and several 
Ontarians who have been on the political scene for 25 or 30 
years, and who cannot understand what a productive investment is 
because of their partisanship, I will explain by giving an 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was founded by today's Quebecers, who were called French 
Canadians at the time, but when English Canadians arrived in 
this country in 1760, it was said that there were two founding 
peoples, despite the fact that one was there 250 years before 
the other one, whether the member for Beauce likes it or not. 
And it is his own people he is trying to disown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were reportedly two founding peoples: the francophones, 
who arrived in 1534, and the anglophones, who arrived in 1760, 
226 years later. However, to please everybody, it was said that 
there were two founding peoples who were equal, and I accept 
that. But we cannot brush away our past and our history so 
readily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the four provinces that formed Canada joined together to 
found the Canadian federation, Ontario was not what it is today. 
It even had huge budget deficits. 
Ontario needed money under the Union Act, 1840, and Quebec, or 
Lower Canada as it was called at the time, agreed to lend 
Ontario considerable sums of money, which were never repaid as a 
matter of fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the moment the Canadian Constitution came to be—and this is 
where productive spending becomes important—for example, when the 
automobile was first introduced at the turn of the century, the 
federal government started to invest a lot of money in the 
Windsor area, in Ontario. It supported the establishment of the 
automobile industry in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years later, Quebecers were told to be patient, that it 
would soon be their turn. They were told that, for them, it 
would not be the automobile industry, but the aviation industry. 
The francophones waited patiently, knowing that there were 
plenty of francophone MPs, mostly Liberal, at the time, for 
their turn to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 25 years ago, Michelin Tires 
wanted to set up business in Quebec.  They were told “No, go to 
Nova Scotia.  We will give you $52 million if you do”.  That was 
a good incentive.  They were paid not to set up business in 
Quebec.  Yet this was a French multinational which would have 
had a natural tendency to gravitate to Quebec, where their 
language was spoken.  But no, the government of the day invested 
$52 million to send them to Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History has not yet 
shown whether this was a good decision, but we do know that, 
over the years, relationships had been particularly complicated, 
if only from the language point of view.  Michelin's investment 
in Nova Scotia was not the best investment it ever made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At around the same time, Quebec was again being told “Your 
future lies in aircraft construction.  Ontario has its 
automobile industry, Quebec has aviation”.  But when the famous 
CF-18 contract came up, the rule changed once more.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They were told “Too bad, the planes will also be built in 
Ontario, but there will be economic spinoffs for Quebec”.  What 
kind of economic spinoffs?  There was talk of $850 million, 
maybe $900 million.  That was acceptable, but once again when 
the project was completed and the planes were being flown—and 
there were some crashes, but that is a whole other story—there 
were between $250 million and $300 million in economic benefits 
for Quebec.  All the radio control knobs we made pretty well 
accounted for that $250 million.  So much for the technological 
spinoffs, the productive spending.  Once again, none for us.  We 
just got the crumbs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard what the hon. member for Elk Island had to say. 
He takes the cake.  He needs a lesson in history.  Between 1880 
and 1900, 1.2 million Quebecers were forced to leave Quebec. 
They left the country and went to the northeastern American 
states and New England, because they were starving in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the Government of Canada populated western 
Canada.  It brought people from eastern Europe and gave them 
land, two horses, sheep, a cow, chickens, all paid for by the 
taxpayers of Quebec and Ontario at the time.  And now the member 
for Elk Island is telling us that Quebec is asking for too much 
and that our claims for equalization payments are unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1870, Canada bought what was then called the North-Western 
Territory from the Hudson's Bay Company for 300,000 pounds 
Sterling, a considerable sum for Canadians at the time.  But 
when the ancestors of the member for Elk Island, and probably 
those of many members here, settled there they were given land 
paid for in large part by Quebecers.  In those days, Quebecers 
constituted about 50% of Canada's population.  In other words, 
they paid about 50% of the taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Elk Island is denying this.  While we cannot live 
in the past and constantly relive history, we can recognize that 
Quebecers can hold their heads just as high as anyone else. 
They contributed more than their share to this country.  They 
anted up when it was time to do so. 
In wartime, they risked their lives in the battlefields of 
Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need offer no excuses to the member for Elk Island.  Because 
of the policies of the federal government, which has always 
given Quebec the wrong end of the stick, we have a population of 
poor children in Montreal, which presupposes poor parents as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the member for Beauce watching me all in a state.  This is 
what is happening in Quebec.  It is the result of the policies 
of the Liberal Party of Canada, which started in 1973 to get 
into overblown deficits with its Minister of Finance at the 
time, who is now, ironically, the Prime Minister, the one most 
opposed to accumulated deficits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am in a state over the hon. member's comments because he has 
not once mentioned the aboriginals— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> This is not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> This is not a point of 
order but a point of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> Madam Speaker, the truth hurts, as evidenced 
by the reaction of the member for Beauce. It may not always be a 
good thing to tell the truth, but it is more often hard to hear 
it. This is why the member is getting all worked up. Every now 
and then, he demonstrates to us that the truth is not always 
easy to hear, and that it would be much easier, out of extreme 
courtesy and abnegation, not to say anything. Perhaps the 
members of the Liberal Party would be less frustrated, but that 
is the way things are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History keeps repeating itself. In 1867, Quebecers were fooled 
into joining a federation and have never been able to get out of 
it. This is the impression we have. Why? Because of things like 
this.

This is when they decided to unilaterally patriate the 
Constitution, without the agreement of Quebecers. Incidentally, 
the Constitution has yet to be signed by Quebec. If they are 
waiting for Quebec's signature to share the equalization system, 
it will never happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise on behalf of Canadians, and my constituents in particular, 
to oppose the Bloc motion which would delete a component of 
clause 4 dealing with the provincial share of cash contributions 
and CHST from April 1, 1999 to March 31, 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc members believe that this disbursement of funds occurs too 
quickly and would like to spread it over a longer period of time. 
They believe that the time line criteria for cash contributions 
should be weighted in favour of demographic changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion amends the bill we are debating today, Bill C-71, 
which is legislation intended to implement many of the programs 
announced by the government in the 1999 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just for the information of those who are watching, the bill is 
divided into nine parts.  Part one amends the Federal-Provincial 
Fiscal Relations Act to implement $11.5 billion, which is an 
increase in the CHST for the purpose of health care.  It is an 
important part because it is dealing with the health care aspect 
on which I will be elaborating later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part five enables some first nation bands to impose a 7% value 
added tax on fuel or tobacco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part six increases the maximum national child tax benefit by 
July 1, 2000 to $1,976 for the first child and $1,775 for each 
subsequent child.  The other measures are simply housekeeping 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about the health care and child tax benefit aspects, 
but before doing so I would like to talk about the CHST. In 1993 
when the Liberals took power the CHST for each taxpayer was 
$1,453.  In gross terms this was $18.8 billion.  Taking into 
account this budget, the CHST for taxpayers now will be $1,005 or 
$14.5 billion that they will try to restore.  There is still a 
$448 decrease, which is 31% per taxpayer compared to what it used 
to be in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compared to the $11.5 billion that they will put back over the 
next five years, the Liberals are removing $3 billion from the 
system for every $1 billion they are putting back.  It is a ratio 
of 1:3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will raise the income threshold at which the 
child tax benefit begins to be phased out to $29,590 from a front 
level of $25,921.  The child tax benefit was announced in the 
1998 budget and implemented in July 1998.  It replaces the child 
tax benefit and working income supplements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Canadian child tax benefit began clawing back benefits 
at lower levels of income than the existing system.  When 
announced in 1998, the CCTB clawback began when a family's after 
tax income exceeded $25,921. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget states that spending would increase by $14.1 billion 
over the next four years, including the remainder of this year. 
We also know that the revenue is now expected to rise to $156 
billion for 1998-99. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am driving at is that our tax system is failing.  We 
heard already the debate on productivity.  The Minister of 
Industry is on one side and the Minister of Finance is on the 
other side, and the Prime Minister is somewhere.  We do not know 
what the government is doing.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are hiking taxes.  Productivity is falling.  The standard 
of living is falling.  The government has no sense of where it is 
heading or what it is doing.  We pay the highest personal taxes 
of all G-7 countries.  This is killing jobs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents agree that what we are looking at is a pay more, 
get less budget.  The Liberals balance the books on the backs of 
the taxpayer.  I do not call it balancing the budget.  It is not 
balancing the budget at all.  It is matching the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals try to match the revenue to the spending level. 
That is how they balance the budget.  If that were the criteria 
to balance the budget on the backs of the taxpayers without 
reducing spending, without eliminating duplication or waste, it 
could have been done 29 years ago.  Why did the Liberals wait for 
29 years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real balance in the budget is reducing tax levels, reducing 
spending and trying to match them.  This is matching of the 
budget, not balancing the budget at all.  The Liberals have not 
made the size of government smaller.  They have not controlled or 
significantly reduced spending levels.  Duplication and waste are 
not eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is boosting the health care budget.  Let us talk 
about the record.  The Liberals must pay back the billions of 
dollars they have been taking out of health care spending.  As 
the new official opposition deputy critic for health, I will not 
allow the Liberals to forget that hospitals are closing, there 
are fewer beds in hospitals, waiting lines are longer and longer, 
1,400 doctors and 6,000 nurses have left the country since the 
government took over.  There are about 200,000 patients on the 
waiting lists for medical services. Waiting times for Canadian 
patients to see a specialist, for example, are up by 38%.  That 
is appalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are the people who are waiting?  They are our loved ones. 
They are our relatives.  They are real people.  They are human 
beings who are waiting on the lists to get treatment.  What have 
the Liberals done to help Canadians since they caused the health 
crisis?  They have done absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget for 1999, which is the pay more, get less budget, 
Canadians are paying $2,020 more in taxes than they did in 1993. 
Let me tell the parliamentary secretary that the Liberals have 
increased taxes by that amount but in return they have $1,500 
less to spend per Canadian on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has its priorities wrong.  It caused this health 
care crisis by slashing health care spending.  It is the root 
cause for what we see happening currently in the health care 
system.  Now they are trying to act very generously by trickling 
money back into health care, not even restoring what they have 
cut so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they are not restoring is the $21.4 billion they cut from 
health and social spending since 1993.  They are simply putting 
in $11.5 billion over the next five years.  That is peanuts to 
improve the system.  That is half of what they owe Canadians for 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cumulative decrease in federal funding will grow to $21.4 
billion in 1999 from $17 billion in 1998.  Canadian taxpayers are 
paying $42.1 billion more in taxes in 1999 than when the 
government took over in 1993.  In my view, which is shared by the 
Auditor General of Canada, by leading accountants and by economic 
editors around the country, the Prime Minister and the finance 
minister are cooking the books.  The auditor general has refused 
to sign the books for two years in a row. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals were running the government at a budgetary 
deficit they backloaded the federal government's annual budget. 
Then they were busy cooking the books.  They started frontloading 
the budget.  Whatever the surplus was, they are trying to show 
that the surplus is getting smaller and smaller.  The Liberals 
even budgeted the millennium scholarship endowment fund money, 
which is supposed to be spent in the year 2000, in this account.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, this is a pay more in taxes and get less in 
health care and benefits budget.  Despite the increase in CHST we 
should remember that it was the Liberals who gutted and savaged 
the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget did not contain any significant debt or tax relief 
measures, increase disposable income, or create investment 
opportunities for entrepreneurs.  It completely ignored small 
business.  The budget perpetuates the discrimination against 
single income, two parent families in the tax code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples I could give but just to summarize— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid the hon.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
February 16 of this year, the Minister of Finance tabled his 
sixth budget in the House on behalf of the Liberal government. 
Year in and year out, Quebec pays over $30 billion on a budget 
of some $160 billion, including borrowings and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will certainly agree with me that Quebec is a real cash cow 
for this government in that, according to the books, we pay a 
lot more than we receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give you an example. In my riding, an asbestos 
mine, the BC Mine, was closed. It employed 300 workers, 200 of 
whom were over 52 years of age at the time of the closure. 
On June 26, the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
accompanied by the godfather of my riding, the good member for 
Beauce, came to announce that $1.1 million would be spent to 
help workers aged 55 and over. This spring, there were coal mine 
closures in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. The same Minister of Human 
Resources Development has allocated $111 million. The $1.1 
million for Thetford became $111 million for coal miners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another $68 million will come from Canada Economic Development 
and $80 million from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency. 
Add it all up and you will get a total of $259 million for Cape 
Breton coal miners, compared to $1.1 million for asbestos 
miners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the Prime Minister, who addressed last night 1,500 
guests who paid $450 each to attend a fundraising dinner in 
Montreal. 
He urged Liberal senators and ministers to criss-cross Quebec to 
spread the good news. Try to go and ask the Minister for Human 
Resources Development to come back to Thetford. He is scared to 
go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the advice of the godfather, he went there as bearer of bad 
news, but he got so scared he had to flee in the car of the 
member for Beauce. Do you really believe that these ministers 
and senators who rely on the system to pay them fat pensions 
even if them do not make any effort are going to criss-cross 
Quebec? They are scared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take the millennium scholarships for example. It would appear 
that Ottawa is always trying to duplicate structures. In Quebec, 
there was and always has been an excellent system of loans and 
bursaries for post-secondary and university students. 
The Prime Minister and member for Saint-Maurice wants to 
interfere and, over a 10 year period, only 10 years, he will 
invest more than $2 billion in scholarships. Once again, he is 
duplicating structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two agriculture ministers. If your cow produces 
processing milk, it comes under the federal agriculture 
minister, but if it produces fluid milk it is up to Minister 
Trudel in Quebec to deal with it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Same farmer, same cow, but two different agriculture ministers. 
Dairy farmers now have what is called mixed quotas. So both 
ministers have jurisdiction over the same cow. Two revenue 
ministers, two finance ministers, two health ministers for the 
same patient, the same Quebecers. Two natural resources 
ministers and we could list scores of departments which are 
duplicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To issue cheques with a maple leaf, the Prime Minister is 
prepared to duplicate our system of loans and bursaries, which 
is working perfectly well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to save on taxes, the millionaire Minister of Finance, 
who is very familiar with the legislation, will register his 
boats in tax havens, and then he will tell us to tighten our 
belts. This is the same individual who helped himself to the $21 
billion EI surplus, and who is going to grab the $30 billion 
surplus in government employees' pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, who yesterday urged his ministers and 
Liberal senators to spread the good news throughout Quebec, 
should have a look at the article in today's <I>Le Droit</I> about the 
increasing unavailability of low cost housing.  Not in the 
riding of Saint-Maurice in Shawinigan, but in the nation's 
capital, in Ottawa-Carleton.  One in five tenants—or 20%—are 
spending more than 50% of their income on rent.  Can we imagine 
having to spend more than half of what we earned just on 
accommodation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is news to the Prime Minister. 
He has no living expenses, because he has an official residence. 
I imagine it has been years since he set foot in a 
supermarket.  If a couple has to spend half of their income on 
rent, there is no way they are going to be eating steak once a 
week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the topic of the GST—I see the member for Beauce listening 
closely—at least two of the women who elected the Prime Minister 
call me regularly, and they called again last month, to ask when 
he would keep his promise and abolish the GST.  I told them that 
he made the promise in order to trick them into voting for him, 
but that he lied.  So that he could save face once he was in 
office, the member for Hamilton East resigned, only to be 
re-elected three months later at a cost of $500,000 to taxpayers. 
These are the reasons I will be voting against the sixth budget 
brought down by the Minister of Finance. 
These are only a few of the things I want to mention, during the 
ten minutes I have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could also talk about the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, the man who is often out to throttle the neediest 
in society, our young people. Did members know that 100% of 
working youth contribute to the EI fund? They pay $2.55 for each 
$100 earned. Even though all the young workers pay, only 15% of 
them qualify for EI benefits. That represents a net profit of 
85% for the government, on the backs of our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals will go around Quebec spreading the good news. When 
he came to Thetford Mines, on the steps of the town hall, the 
hon. member for Beauce saw what the good news was. 
He is the one who so badly advised the Minister of Human 
Resources Development by inviting him to make his $1.1 million 
announcement on the steps of the town hall.

<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-71 at report 
stage.  I speak in opposition to the Bloc Motion No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of health care it is ironic that the Liberal government 
on taking power in 1993 at that time basically trashed the health 
system and now claims it is saving it from what it did back in 
1993.  I remember very well.  The Liberals took away $22 billion 
from health care which had a huge impact back in 1993-94.  The 
provinces had to deal with this crisis.  They shut down hospitals 
and closed beds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spring of 1997 I had a personal experience with a health 
care system that was in tatters. I got sick in the spring of 1997 
and ended up in the hallway of a hospital waiting for care. 
Believe it or not, at that time I was the mayor of the community 
in which I lived.  It shows that even the mayor back in those 
days had to experience the hardships of the health cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately we still have the same problems.  Even though the 
government has reinjected many millions back into the system, it 
is going to take at least two years.  I am sure the Liberal 
government expects that by the time the next election comes 
around the system will have solved many of its own problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not understand that the taxes it collects 
really do not belong to the Liberal government. They really 
belong to the people.  That is where the government gets them 
from.  In today's question period it was ironic that the health 
minister stood in the House and said that he gave $900 million to 
Mike Harris, the premier of this province.  It certainly sounded 
like it was the Liberal government's money. We all know that this 
$900 million really belongs to the people of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I have found in the House is that governments at the 
federal level do not understand the meaning of planning regarding 
our debt.  This country's debt is an extreme hardship on all of 
us as taxpayers.  Last year I believe we spent about $42 billion 
of hard-earned taxpayer dollars on debt interest.  We all know 
that personally we certainly could never operate or succeed if 
our debt was at that level. The government needs to plan in terms 
of how to retire that debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite obvious from the estimates this year and as we talk 
about this bill that the government is back to free spending.  We 
know that the annual budget has been balanced from a deficit of 
$42 billion.  The government keeps pointing a finger at the 
Progressive Conservative Party.  The PCs should be accountable 
for half the national debt, but so should the Liberal government 
which, starting in the 1970s, created the first half of the 
almost $600 billion worth of national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no shortage of money.  The money keeps flowing in. 
People should check their monthly statements and their cheques 
and they will know how much the government gets.  It still gets a 
big pile from the GST, the CPP, and EI.  In fact, the government 
is so tax hungry it wants to rob us of the $30 billion in the 
pension fund.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased, as a member of the Bloc Quebecois, to speak on Bill C-71 
and more specifically on Motion No. 1 introduced by the hon. 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget is always an important issue, though it may be dry. 
But it is very important, in particular for Quebecers who give 
the federal government $30 billion in taxes every year, without 
being sure of reap all the due benefits from this annual 
collective effort, which is a huge effort on the part of 
Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot be said that the federal government is greatly 
involved in Quebecers' everyday lives. However, if there is one 
area where it does get involved, it is employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the federal government in recent years has been appalling, 
not to say dramatic, for thousands and thousands of Quebecers 
and Canadians. In 1990, about 90% of those who contributed to 
employment insurance were eligible for benefits when they had 
the misfortune—because it is a misfortune, something those on the 
other side and specifically the Minister of the Human Resources 
Development tend to forget—to lose their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be there as a community and as a government to support 
those individuals who have to go through such dire straits. 
In 1990, about 90% of those who contributed to insurance 
employment had the good fortune or privilege to receive 
benefits. Then the Conservatives began to fiddle with employment 
insurance, and the Liberals merrily carried on. Yet, the members 
opposite, who were then in the opposition, had condemned this. 
In spite of that—and this is typical—the government is still 
fiddling and only 36% of those who contribute to employment 
insurance are now eligible for benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, as we know, allowed the government to eliminate the 
deficit at the expense of low income taxpayers, low income 
earners and the most vulnerable people. The government took care 
to protect the interests of the wealthy. It has always found a 
way to justify the existence of tax shelters and, most of all, 
tax havens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Liberals took office, there has been one scandal here, 
in Ottawa, in the Conservative-Liberal tradition. I am talking 
about the family trust scandal that allowed a well known family 
to avoid paying somewhere between $400 and $700 million in 
federal taxes. These are not mere details. This happened in 
spite of the fact that the government and particularly the 
Department of Finance were fully aware of what was going on and 
in spite of the fact that the Auditor General of Canada 
expressed his disagreement before being put in his place by the 
accounting gurus, in particular those who develop tax schemes in 
Toronto. The auditor general—and I witnessed it personally—was 
simply told to mind his own business by these thinkers from 
Toronto who protect the interests of the rich in Canada and who 
develop these tax schemes to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget has also created a precedent in Canadian history in 
that the rules of the game have been changed with regard to 
federal transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has decided that, from now on, these transfers 
will be made on a per capita basis according to the population 
of each province instead of being based on the needs of each 
province. It is a fundamental change and the results are 
brilliant. This means that, over the next five years, Ontario 
will get 47% of these transfers, whereas Quebec will get 8%. 
With this kind of management, it is no wonder Quebecers want 
out. It is one reason among many.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On of the reasons Quebecers want out and will be increasingly 
eager to get out—and this budget is part of that Canadian 
process—is the social union framework agreement, which is a 
major event in Canadian history, even though its name does not 
appear to mean much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term social union is a rather insignificant one, one that 
does not generate much discussion, but does imply an enormous 
impact on the new Canada of tomorrow, the new Canada of the year 
2000 and beyond, the new Canada built here in Ottawa, which will 
be centralized and unitary. The provinces have recently given 
the federal government legal authorization to intervene in areas 
in which they have sole jurisdiction: health, education and 
social programs.  These, according to the 1867 constitution, 
which we respect, were the exclusive jurisdiction—important 
words—of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that recent consent by the provinces, the federal 
government has been given authorization to get involved in these 
areas in order to turn this country in the future into a 
centralized and unitary country, one in which decisions will be 
made—efficiently, let us hope—so that it can have a competitive 
edge internationally, where it has been rather lagging behind 
until now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new Canada is looking for ways to be competitive, but 
everyone will pay a price as far as structure is concerned. 
This means that, slowly but surely, the provincial governments 
will find themselves turning into regional governments, with 
considerably diminished powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that Quebec is not only a province, but one just like 
the others.  This means that the Quebec people has never been 
recognized as a distinct entity by the rest of Canada, and never 
will be.  There is no such thing as a Quebec people in the 
context of a new unitary Canada.  Such notions will have no 
place in the new Canada of tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that there will be national standards in all sectors 
in which the federal government has a hand, including education, 
which was what Jean Charest, former leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada and now leader of the Quebec 
Liberal Party, argued for in 1997.  There will be national 
standards to evaluate students and schools from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the Canada of tomorrow will look like, with 
national standards set by Ottawa applying to all the provinces, 
which will become regional governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, Canada has to centralize because of international 
pressure.  Countries dealing with Canada want clearer rules. 
They want to know if there are disagreements between the 
provinces and the federal government. 
The government is in the process of clearing the way, without 
debate, for the federal government to have a free hand to sign 
whatever contracts it wishes, particularly international ones, 
legitimately and with full jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a necessity for Canada, but it is a disaster for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Quebecers remain in Canada, they will slowly disappear.  It 
is Louisiana all over again.  As the member for Saint-Maurice 
said, and it was perhaps the only time he showed any vision in 
his entire career, Quebec would be a larger version of New 
Brunswick.  If Quebec decided to remain within the new structure 
of the Canada of tomorrow, it would become a larger version of 
New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we Quebecers must ask ourselves if this is the kind of 
Canada in which we want to live, or whether it would not be 
simpler for Quebec to govern itself the way it wished, and 
Canada to do the same, and for both parties to enjoy the best 
possible relations that the good neighbours we have always been 
can have.

<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, last month the government finally recognized the 
seriousness of the housing crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think everyone in the House applauds the appointment of the 
Minister of Labour as the federal co-ordinator on homelessness. 
Her personal commitment to housing issues is well known and no 
one doubts that if she was given the tools to do the job she 
could make a real difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a clear indication that the government does not 
intend to allow its co-ordinator on homelessness to do more than 
attend conferences on homelessness.  All the way through this 
bill are provisions that remove direct government involvement in 
providing housing for those in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of parliament or the cabinet making decisions about how 
to best provide affordable housing, authority has been delegated 
to an appointed CMHC board of directors.  A basic democratic 
principle is that decisions should be made by elected officials. 
This bill ignores that principle.  Once we have voted to allocate 
money for housing, the only means this bill gives us for 
reviewing decisions made on social housing is when the House of 
Commons receives CMHC's five year corporate plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am a little curious about the wording of the 
amendment of my Reform Party colleague from Kelowna to remove 
section 101. 
This is the only section left in the National Housing Act 
allowing for the regulation of the CMHC. I have heard the hon. 
member express concern about the need to make the CMHC more 
accountable and I hope he will reconsider his motion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All through this bill are provisions allowing the CMHC to set 
terms and conditions for programs that provide loans or 
contributions for housing.  If we pass this bill, decisions about 
how these programs will work will not be made by parliament. They 
will not even be made by cabinet.  Instead, they will be made by 
an unelected board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not take much of an imagination to picture the response 
of the government when an unpopular decision is made by the CMHC 
board.  “Oh, that has nothing to do with us,” it will say. “It 
is all the fault of CMHC”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they were in opposition, the Liberals would have found this 
unacceptable.  My colleagues who have been here more years than I 
have can remember Liberal MPs condemning legislation as 
undemocratic because it transferred decision making power from 
parliament to cabinet.  Of course, this was when they were in 
opposition and it was the Conservatives who were introducing the 
legislation. Today with this legislation they are going even 
further than the Conservatives could have imagined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be made clear that the government is not just 
turning over the power to make decisions about mortgage insurance 
to CMHC.  Under this legislation the government is abandoning its 
decision making role in almost all parts of the National Housing 
Act.  Whether it is the eligibility criteria for housing renewal 
programs or setting national standards for public housing, this 
government is abandoning its responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments the NDP will introduce require approval by the 
governor in council for terms and conditions for housing programs 
set by CMHC.  This does not mean that the cabinet has to approve 
every last project the CMHC assists.  Given this government's 
record on patronage, there is no way we would suggest that.  What 
it will do, however, is to ensure that the conditions under which 
projects receive support are approved by the governor in council. 
This is already happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the National Housing Act sets out the terms and 
conditions for loans, grants and other forms of assistance.  The 
goal of the amendment is to restore the principle that rules 
about how taxpayers' money is spent should be approved by 
parliament or by regulations approved by those who are 
accountable to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to touch on some of the specific problems with 
the bill and what they mean for the federal housing policy now 
and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands, the National Housing Act has a number of 
provisions stating how programs to provide housing should be run. 
These measures ensure dollars spent on housing do what they are 
meant to do:  help those in need of affordable accommodation find 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current restrictions in the National Housing Act seem 
nothing more than basic common sense.  These restrictions include 
provisions to restrict rent increases for housing projects which 
have been built or repaired using federal dollars, a reasonable 
measure if the goal of federal housing programs is to increase 
the supply of decent, affordable housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It includes restrictions saying that only housing projects 
sponsored by non-profit or co-operative associations qualify for 
full funding, another measure that seems necessary if the goal of 
the housing program is to provide affordable housing and not line 
private developers' pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this bill, these provisions are gone.  This bill paves the 
way for the privatization of social housing in Canada.  Current 
statutes contain very clear definitions of what a public housing 
project is and what an eligible contribution recipient is.  These 
definitions have ensured that funding for housing goes to the 
groups best able to build and operate affordable housing: 
non-profit groups and co-operative associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill eliminates these definitions and others from the 
National Housing Act and puts them at the discretion of CMHC. 
This opens the door for private for profit corporations to be 
recognized as social housing providers.  With social housing this 
can be a very expensive proposition.  Building housing units is 
only part of the cost.  The other part of the cost is subsidies 
for rent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For non-profit and co-operative housing, all we are subsidizing 
is the operating and capital costs.  If we allow private for 
profit corporations to provide social housing, we will pay for 
their profit margin as well as for the cost of the housing. 
Instead of housing dollars assisting Canadians looking for 
decent, affordable accommodation, we will be subsidizing for 
profit developers. 
In case there is any doubt about this, I would like to touch on 
what happened in Ontario in the late eighties in cases where 
private for profit developers received social housing funds.  For 
private developers it was the equivalent of a blank cheque.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Liberal government the subsidy paid for the difference 
between what the tenant could afford and the market rent for the 
apartment. The rent review guidelines made it easy for landlords 
to raise rents and every time the rent went up, so did the 
subsidy the government was having to pay. In some cases the rents 
being subsidized in private for profit developments were over 
$2,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast, co-operative and non-profit housing have not seen 
such dramatic increases in the cost of rent subsidies. There, 
rent covers the cost of the mortgage and maintenance, not a 
landlord's profit margin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments that the NDP has put forward ensure federal 
funding for housing goes to those with a proven track record: 
non-profit corporations and co-operatives.  In other words these 
amendments ensure any federal funding for housing goes to where 
we know it will be used for its intended purpose and where we can 
keep track of how it is used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is also concerned about the elimination of national 
standards for public housing.  In section 78 of the existing 
National Housing Act, there is a requirement that public housing 
provide decent, safe and sanitary housing accommodation.  Bill 
C-66 removes this provision.  The explanation given was that 
flexibility is required.  There are some things where I do not 
think we should be flexible.  Ensuring that public housing in 
this country is decent, safe and sanitary is one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also has been suggested that standards are not required in 
the section of the National Housing Act dealing with public 
housing because they are present in the definition of low rental 
housing project.  I am not a lawyer but as far as I know a 
definition has to be stated to have any effect.  Under this bill 
low rental housing project is defined in section 1 of the 
National Housing Act but will not appear anywhere else in the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the Minister of Labour in her role as federal co-ordinator 
on homelessness, the definition sounds good, wants to do 
something and is not being allowed to do it by this government. 
What our amendment in Motion No. 16 seeks to do is to restore 
standards for public housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I emphasize that New Democrats recognize the housing 
problems in Canada are serious enough that there must be a 
federal role.  We are also concerned about the restrictions the 
amendments moved by the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve would 
place on this role.  I would hope it is not his intention but the 
effect of his motions is to give provincial governments 
ideologically opposed to social housing a veto over the 
construction of new housing projects.  Given the seriousness of 
the housing crisis we face, this is not something the NDP is 
prepared to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it gives me pleasure to rise today and speak to the 
bill. I have a number of concerns as I am sure many members of 
the House have about certain provisions in the bill.  There are 
also things that I like about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read into the record words that were spoken by 
Mr. Laird Hunter, the counsel for the Co-operative Housing 
Federation of Canada.  I want to do that because in my riding of 
Delta—South Richmond there are many co-operative housing units. 
They are a very necessary part of the housing requirements in my 
constituency for a very simple reason. People in the lower 
mainland of British Columbia, who in other parts of the country 
would be making fairly good wages, find they are in a high cost, 
high rent marketplace. They cannot afford to buy a home and they 
cannot afford to pay the high rents in some of the accommodation 
that is available. The alternative has been the co-operative 
housing marketplace.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As someone who has visited many of those co-operative housing 
locations, I can assure the House that the housing is simply 
delightful.  It is a pleasure to walk through. Housing co-op 
members have stated to me on many occasions that they feel very 
safe in their environment.  They know their neighbours and there 
is stability in the neighbourhood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who participate and live in the co-op housing units 
have a commitment to the co-op.  They ensure that the place is 
well-maintained because it is their home and it is their 
investment.  They look after one another's children.  It is not a 
concern when their kids are playing in the street in front of a 
co-op housing unit or in a unit itself. People have some 
assurance that their kids are safe because they know their 
neighbours are watching them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of old times in small-town Ontario where I grew up. 
When we were out playing in the streets our parents were not 
concerned because they knew the neighbours were looking out for 
us.  Quite often that is something which is missing today. 
Certainly in busy urban settings that is not the case, but it is 
the case in these co-op housing units.  There is that kind of 
security. As far as providing homes for people who need them for 
economic reasons, I do not think there can be a better setting 
than these co-op houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Hunter noted that the bill contains certain provisions which 
they are pleased with.  He notes and expects that the CHF of 
Canada welcomes the bill's proposal to strengthen the Canadian 
system for residential mortgage insurance.  He says:  “We also 
support the reinforcement of Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation's international role both in the exporting market and 
in helping developing countries to build secure and affordable 
housing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to say:  “We have concerns about Bill C-66.  We hope 
to offer some comments that will help to improve this bill and 
prevent some of the potential harmful effects that arise through 
unintended consequences on the affordable housing that now 
exists”.  He outlines the three areas of concern.  He said that 
they have concerns about the mortgage insurance, the 
international housing matters and the accountability framework. 
Those are concerns the Reform Party has as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One other concern should be mentioned.  It is a serious concern 
for many of the co-ops in my riding.  It is an important issue, 
one which I do not think the bill has addressed at all.  It is 
the problem many of the co-ops have where the mortgages have been 
locked in.  They entered into mortgage agreements in times of 
high mortgage rates. Unlike others, they cannot simply go to the 
bank and pay the penalty and buy into lower mortgage rates. They 
are stuck with the high rates. Some co-ops are paying 10% and 11% 
mortgage rates, with some probably paying higher rates. They 
cannot take advantage of the newer lower rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a fundamental problem. The co-ops are owned 
collectively.  In that sense individuals own their own units, but 
because the title is a collective title for the whole 
organization or complex, these people are prevented from going to 
the bank collectively and saying “We do not want to continue to 
pay these high rates; we would like to pay the penalty and 
renegotiate at a lower rate”.  That is fundamentally wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not dealing with the Rockefellers of the world when we 
talk about this bill. We are dealing with people who are working 
hard and trying to put the bread on the table for their families 
and their children. We are making it tougher for them to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention one other thing when I say that this point is 
unfair.  I was visiting one of the co-ops in my riding within the 
past year.  One of the ladies told me that she had lived in co-op 
housing for years and that she had paid one of the higher rates. 
She had a pretty good job and was paying a pretty high rent. 
Then she had a physical health problem and was unable to work. 
When she could not work her rent dropped and she paid a little 
less than she had before.  She said that it was not a concern to 
the other people as they knew she had done her best when she 
could and now she could enjoy that security. 
It is only right that happens.  The group is looking after its 
own and that is correct.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we in the Reform Party are great supporters of the 
notion of co-op housing, we believe there is also a place for 
private sector builders that want to build low cost housing. That 
is a concern to me and to my friend from Okanagan who is our 
critic in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I live on the lower mainland where there is a need for lower 
cost housing.  Lower cost housing does not mean lower quality 
housing. It may mean smaller housing and smaller yards, but it 
certainly does not mean lower quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a place for government in providing low cost housing, 
whether it be through co-ops or assisting private sector builders 
that want to build low cost housing.  The government should be 
making every effort to ensure that private sector builders have 
access to land in our municipalities where they can build smaller 
homes on smaller lots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I grew up the home in which I was raised was not very big. 
It probably was about 1,000 square feet.  It was certainly 
adequate for my parents and four kids.  Nowadays it seems that in 
the area where I live a small home is about 1,200 square feet and 
many of them are in the 2,000 to 2,500 square foot range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, with size comes expense.  There is a problem when laws 
restrict size and do not allow builders to construct smaller 
homes on smaller lots.  It prices people out of the market.  The 
motions the NDP is proposing will do just that.  Its series of 
motions will restrict the value of the bill to providers of on 
reserve rental housing, non-profit corporations and co-op 
associations.  It does not want to allow private sector builders 
access to funding.  I think that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government is concerned about providing housing 
to low income Canadians, it should be taking the lead in ensuring 
that municipalities make land available where smaller lot sizes 
are okay.  It should encourage municipalities to provide areas 
where smaller homes can be built.  There is a place in our 
society for them.  Many of the houses that were built in the 
thirties, the forties and before were built on smaller lots in 
many of our cities.  They were smaller and affordable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise today to speak to Bill C-66, an act to amend the National 
Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act 
and to make a consequential amendment to another act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke in the debate on the motions in Group No. 1 and I said 
then that the Bloc Quebecois did not support this bill.  My 
friend from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve focussed particularly on 
social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened earlier to the member for Frontenac—Mégantic, who 
spoke in the debate before this one.  He read us statistics that 
indicated some people in the national capital region were 
spending over 50% of their income on accommodation.  This is 
appalling, especially when this country has had since 1946 an 
organization to make it easier to acquire residential property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could say that the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
has failed thoroughly in meeting its objectives.  The public 
housing crisis is not just here in the national capital, in 
Ottawa, it is pretty well everywhere.  There are people who, for 
reasons it is not up to us to judge, are now needy and must have 
help from others and society to get housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not take the opportunity provided by this 
bill to acknowledge a reality. While I do not know every major 
Canadian city, I am nonetheless aware that homelessness is a 
growing Canadian issue. Even Toronto is not immune to this 
problem, which affects increasingly younger people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now find entire families—father, mother and two or three 
kids—sleeping wherever they can, under bridges, or over subway 
air outlets, in Montreal or Toronto. Yet, this legislation has 
been very helpful to Canadians in the past. I cannot understand 
the attitude of this minister who introduces a legislative 
amendment but totally ignores the whole emerging issue of 
homelessness in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill amends the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
Act, which was meant to make it easier for Canadians have access 
to real estate property, by requiring smaller downpayments from 
them. Since Bill C-66 amends a number of acts, I cannot 
understand why the minister did not take this opportunity to 
also amend the Interest Act. I read about 10 articles on this 
issue. I tried, through a private member's bill, to have a limit 
of three months' interest set as the penalty charged by lending 
institutions to get out of an existing mortgage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reformers, whose generosity and magnanimity are legendary, 
are opposed to such a measure. I was quite surprised by that. 
After all, western farmers are not all millionaires or 
billionaires. Some have mortgages or liens on their farm 
equipment, which is getting bigger all the time, but costlier as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When after a good harvest or a stroke of luck a farmer wants to 
change vehicle, as some couples change houses, and goes to pay 
back his loan, the lenders, who are all faithful contributors to 
the Liberal Party coffers, hit him with a huge penalty for 
cancelling the loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the minister, who is sensitive to the plight of 
prospective home owners, had taken this opportunity to bring 
penalties back to a more reasonable level. I believe a three 
month penalty is adequate, especially in view of the mobility of 
capital and the speed with which one can reinvest. It is 
instantaneous through the Internet and other electronic means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a notary in Longueuil, especially during the worst 
years of the interest crisis, in 1982, I knew someone who was 
forced to sell two small income properties. A bank I will not 
name, out of kindness, even though it showed none to others, 
charged this individual a $28,500 to $29,000 penalty to cancel 
the mortgage. It squeezed something like $58,000 out of a person 
who was already in dire straits and had to sell his income 
property at a loss because he could no longer pay the interest. 
It stomped on someone who was already down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked the minister to be a bit more aware of what 
is going on in the housing industry and to put a stop to what 
his friends who contribute to his campaign funds are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP member who spoke before me also talked about—and it is 
worth mentioning—the way people are appointed to the board of 
directors of the CMHC. It will be another patronage haven, and 
this Liberal government has become a master at making 
appointments. It is one of its specialties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day, as critic for Public Works Canada, I receive a list 
of appointments to Atomic Energy Canada, Canada Post Corporation 
or some other agency. I checked in the book I had ordered from 
the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada. The first 10 names I 
found were the names of individuals who had contributed to the 
election fund of the Liberal Party of Canada. Granted, these 
were not always large contributions. We are talking about $150, 
$200, $250, $300. Contributions from companies are always a bit 
larger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, one can wonder whether having contributed to the Liberal 
Party's election fund is a requirement to get appointed to the 
CMHCs board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Soon we will have a new board in charge of managing the $30 
billion in misappropriated funds from public employees pension 
programs. Those who will sit on that board will also be friends 
of the government. The same goes for the millennium scholarship 
foundation. The Liberals have become masters at this. Mind you, 
I do not envy them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pork barrelling has taken unprecedented proportions with the 
Liberal Party. There is no holding back. The Liberals are in 
office. They criticized the Progressive Conservatives for being 
too generous in that regard, but the Conservatives look like boy 
scouts compared to the Liberals, who have been in office for 
nearly six years now. They sure know how to make patronage 
appointments. They have it down to an art. 
It is often subtle, but it is well done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What interest is there for the taxpayer?  In introducing a bill 
such as this, at least the Interest Act could have been 
modified.  The big banks could have been told “We are not still 
in the last century; speedy investments are the way things are 
done now”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no great interest in supporting this bill, particularly 
since it is responding to the new criteria of universality.  As 
the hon. member for Trois-Rivières has already remarked, the 
federal government is the one that will call the shots, the one 
who is boss, because CMHC is heading into the international 
forum, and it is the one setting standards. 
There is quite simply nothing doing as far as social housing and 
negotiations with the provinces are concerned.

</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Madam Speaker, in the last few months we have heard 
two very conflicting messages from the government.  The 
government has talked a good line on housing.  Last month, 
finally recognizing the seriousness of the homelessness crisis, a 
federal coordinator on homelessness was appointed and sent off to 
speak to housing activists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Liberal members stand up to speak on Bill C-66, they talk 
about the need for the Government of Canada to play a leadership 
role in housing.  Unfortunately, with Bill C-66, it is not just a 
case of the government's actions not matching its words.  The 
Liberal government's actions actually contradict what it says it 
is trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time as the government's homelessness coordinator 
talks about a national housing program, Bill C-66 is changing the 
National Housing Act to allow existing social housing to be sold 
off by this government or provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National standards for public housing are being eliminated. 
Future social housing programs may end up as little more than 
subsidies for private, for profit landlords.  The government is 
surrendering the power to make decisions about housing programs 
to an appointed board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not surprised at the Liberal government's decision to turn 
its back on the homeless at the same time as it pretends to 
befriend them, but I can not help but be disappointed. 
One would hope the need to act on something as serious as 
homelessness would cut across party lines.  Instead, with Bill 
C-66 there is every indication the government will make this 
situation worse.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area of concern is the changes to the sections of the 
National Housing Act dealing with programs to assist with the 
repair or renovation of housing.  The way these programs work is 
currently spelled out in the act and in regulations.  Among the 
conditions for receiving assistance in the National Housing Act 
is the requirement that landlords who receive assistance limit 
rent increases for a set period after the work is completed.  In 
addition, the CMHC is given the power to impose financial 
penalties when this or other conditions are not met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-66 this wording has been significantly weakened. 
Instead of requiring that landlords who receive grants or loans 
for repairs to rental property limit rent increases, there is a 
vaguely worded provision limiting the financial return which may 
be made from a project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the government, we should support this change 
because CMHC needs flexibility.  I ask, flexibility for what? Why 
does the CMHC need the flexibility to allow landlords who receive 
assistance to raise rents through the roof? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Programs to assist with housing repairs are meant to preserve 
the supply of affordable housing.  Without restrictions on how 
much landlords can raise rent after receiving assistance rents, 
in areas with a low vacancy rate, could easily be increased to 
the point that current tenants would no longer be able to afford 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without restrictions on rent increases, federal programs 
intended to ensure affordable housing is safe and well maintained 
could actually reduce the supply of affordable housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While New Democrats share the government's view that programs to 
assist with repairs to affordable housing should include grants 
as well as loans, we disagree with the government's assertion 
that we need to change the National Housing Act for this to be 
possible.  Currently the act allows loans to be forgiven.  This 
has the effect of allowing the CMHC to make contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In case members opposite do not accept my interpretation, I 
would like to draw their attention to a media release sent out in 
January of last year by the minister of public works with regard 
to the repair and rehabilitation assistance program, one of the 
programs authorized by the sections of the National Housing Act 
dealing with assistance for housing repairs.  In its release, the 
minister described this program as providing both loans and 
grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned about the impact of Bill C-66 on programs to 
assist Canadians with home ownership.  Currently, assistance in 
buying a home or paying expenses related to owning a home is only 
available for houses costing less than a set amount.  Grants, as 
opposed to loans, are only available when a person's financial 
circumstances make it difficult for the person to repay a loan. 
The intention is clear:  to ensure assistance with home ownership 
goes to those who need it.  These specific requirements are 
removed by Bill C-66 and the power to set eligibility 
requirements is handed over to the CMHC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The usual justification is given, the need for flexibility. 
Again, one is forced to ask why flexibility is required.  There 
is nothing unreasonable about requiring that government 
assistance to buy or maintain a house go to those who really need 
help.  This is what the NDP amendment restores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is not just about what housing programs will look 
like in the future that should worry us.  Clause 34 of the bill 
gives CMHC the ability to enter into joint ventures with other 
organizations, including for-profit corporations.  What is of 
particular concern are provisions allowing other levels of 
government or corporations to assume the powers of the CMHC under 
these agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions have been raised about whether, in provinces where the 
federal government has downloaded responsibility for housing, 
provincial governments could now privatize existing social 
housing units.  What has added to the fears of housing activists 
is clause 38 of the legislation which allows the CMHC to waive 
provisions of existing agreements.  Under this section an 
agreement between the CMHC and a housing co-op or non-profit 
corporation could be ripped up, leaving residents to see their 
homes sold out from underneath them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the NDP Motions Nos. 34 and 36 do is remove provisions that 
allow existing social housing to be privatized.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take this opportunity to address the 
amendments to Bill C-66 which deal with the other major concern 
the NDP has about the bill; the lack of accountability.  It is 
one thing to give the board of directors of a crown corporation 
the power they need to do their job.  What this bill does, 
however, is hand most of the decision making power for federal 
housing policy over to the CMHC's board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with other amendments we have moved, Motion No. 32 seeks to 
restore the degree of accountability present in the existing CMHC 
Act and National Housing Act.  These acts require ministerial 
approval for housing research programs run by CMHC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean the minister must approve every single 
research project CMHC supports. That power rests with the CMHC 
which has the authority to decide which projects get funding. 
What it does do is ensure accountability by requiring that 
decisions about how housing research programs work must be 
approved by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats are also pleased to support the amendments put 
forward in this group by the member for Kelowna.  As with 
amendments we have moved, his proposal helps to restore 
accountability to federal housing policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 31 and 33 both improve the accountability of the 
CMHC. The existing section 16 of the CMHC Act sets the capital of 
the corporation at $25 billion and requires that parliament 
approve any increase. As the CMHC is a crown corporation, there 
is no question that any change to its capital is a decision that 
belongs to elected representatives.  It is a basic principle of 
parliamentary democracy that budgetary decisions be made by 
parliament.  Giving the governor in council the power to set the 
capital of the CMHC, as Bill C-66 would do, is a clear violation 
of that principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 33 also restores a provision of the CMHC Act which 
Bill C-66 is attempting to remove.  In this case it is the power 
of the Minister of Finance to place conditions and restrictions 
on the type of investment and financial transaction the CMHC can 
enter into.  Again, if crown corporations are to be accountable 
to citizens through their government it seems only reasonable 
that the Minister of Finance continue to have this authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These motions approve the accountability of the CMHC and are in 
the spirit as the NDP amendments to require the governor in 
council to approve the terms and conditions of housing programs 
under the National House Act.  For this reason, New Democrats 
will support these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has made accountability even more of a concern in this 
debate are the changes the government proposes to make to the 
composition of the CMHC board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the existing provisions of the CMHC Act, the CMHC board of 
directors consists of the chair, the president, a vice-president, 
two members selected from the public service and five from 
outside the public service.  Bill C-66 will change the board from 
five civil servants and five people appointed from outside to two 
civil servants and eight others.  Giving the government more 
freedom of action in appointing the board will, based on the 
government's track record, result in more patronage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had a choice when it decided to change the 
National Housing Act.  It could have chosen to strengthen the 
federal role in housing and approve programs for people with 
limited means.  This is what the Liberal government would have 
done if its expressions of concern and compassion for the 
homelessness were the slightest bit sincere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, with Bill C-66 the Liberal government is reducing the 
ability of the federal government to provide safe, affordable 
housing.  It is helping to ensure the fine words— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Resuming debate, the 
hon. member for Mississauga Centre. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rise to speak to the motions presented by my hon. colleagues from 
Cape Breton and Kelowna pertaining to Bill C-66, an act to amend 
the National Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from Cape Breton has presented amendments to 
Bill C-66 that would reduce her own constituents' access to 
renovations and home ownership assistance programs. I can only 
presume she does fully understand the implications of her 
suggested amendments.  On some of the comments she just made I 
would like to address a few at the end of my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Few regions in the country have benefited more from the 
residential rehabilitation assistance program than Cape Breton 
has.  Yet the member from the region is proposing amendments that 
would prevent CMHC from ensuring that this vital program is as 
responsive as possible to the needs of Cape Bretoners and to all 
Canadians.  I do not understand her position. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT82"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT82"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1645

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As they stand, CMHC's renovation assistance programs are in a 
straitjacket.  They need to be able to respond more effectively 
to the needs of the very Canadians for whom these programs are 
intended, low income Canadians who need to make repairs to their 
homes to bring them up to minimum health and safety standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member from Cape Breton deny this to her 
constituents?  I would like to think not.  Yet the changes she is 
proposing would do exactly that.  They would seriously undermine 
the government's ability to modernize its provision of services 
to its clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Cape Breton is proposing changes that would 
effectively entrench the administrative red tape that hampers the 
CMHC from offering improved forms of assistance that Canadians, 
and Cape Bretoners in particular, need and they need it now. 
They would also prevent CMHC from working co-operatively and 
effectively with the other provinces.  Again, what would be the 
motivation behind such a proposal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same fashion, the member's proposed changes would prevent 
the CMHC from introducing measures to make home ownership more 
affordable for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must conclude that the member does not fully understand the 
consequences of her suggested changes.  There would be 
consequences, serious consequences for many Canadians, Cape 
Bretoners included, who would not be able to gain access to 
decent, affordable, safe housing for themselves and for their 
families.  The government has no intention of denying such 
important benefits to Canadians.  Bill C-66 is intended to ensure 
that the CMHC has the ability to continue to provide renovation 
and home ownership assistance to Canadians who are in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to comment on the suggested changes to the 
bill which were made by my colleague from Kelowna, which he 
brought forward in committee.  What the hon. member is proposing 
would impede the government's ability to create jobs for 
Canadians through export promotion.  My hon. colleague has 
proposed that Bill C-66 be amended to restrict CMHC's ability to 
carry out its export promotion mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot agree with this amendment either because it would 
seriously jeopardize the government's job creation efforts.  The 
expansion of CMHC's export promotion activities is a fundamental 
element of the government's ability to create jobs for Canadians 
in Canada.  We all know that export plays a key role in the 
development of our economy.  CMHC's export promotion role works 
to strengthen our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMHC must have the mechanisms it needs to continue to help 
the Canadian housing industry to take advantage of international 
trade opportunities.  Several members opposite have taken 
advantage of going on some of these missions and have seen how 
successful they have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-66, as presented by the government, will enable the CMHC 
to continue to lead the way in housing export trade promotion and 
to better promote Canadian housing products and services abroad. 
This activity will result in job opportunities for Canadians here 
and for our trade partners abroad.  Canada's housing industry has 
excellent prospects of expanding its exports of housing systems, 
technologies, products and services, while contributing to the 
federal objectives of job creation and economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will ensure that Canadian entrepreneurs will be 
able to use the CMHC for marketing support for projects overseas 
and access CMHC's 55 years of expertise in the housing industry. 
The CMHC will also be able to help Canadians sell their expertise 
to foreign countries.  This will open the door to further 
opportunities for Canadian entrepreneurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMHC has a good track record in helping the industry achieve 
success in export markets.  Last September a group of over 30 
companies, provincial governments and industry representatives 
travelled to Chile with the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, who is also responsible for the CMHC, to 
take part in one of the biggest trade shows in South America.  We 
expect that within one year following that mission these 
exporters will generate over $35 million in new business.  This 
will have a major impact on job growth in Canada.  I might add 
that the delegation to Chile also included the member for 
Kelowna, who now proposes to limit CMHC's ability to undertake 
such important export promotion functions such as organizing and 
leading trade missions to foreign countries.  What are we to make 
of this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMHC has also recently returned from a trade mission to 
Poland and is developing with the housing industry other trade 
missions to Korea, Germany, Japan and others later this year. 
Given the significant impact of export on the domestic economy it 
is obvious the CMHC must be able to continue to support the 
housing industry in its efforts to improve its export 
capabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I thank the hon. members for their interest in the bill, I 
believe that Bill C-66, as it stands, is the best possible 
solution to ensure that the Government of Canada, through the 
CMHC, has the ability to provide appropriate, essential 
renovation and home ownership assistance to Canadians, to 
generate economic growth and job creation in Canada, and to 
ensure that Canadians remain among the best housed people in the 
world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to add that the whole discussion this 
afternoon seems to be revolving around homelessness.  That is not 
the subject of this bill.  This bill is about the renovation of 
the National Housing Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I find quite fascinating is that the CMHC has 
been in existence for 55 years.  It has been there to help the 
Canadian public and it has a fabulous track record.  I do not 
understand why members of the opposition assume that there is 
some sinister plan afoot in this bill to actually do some harm to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also find it interesting that the hon. member who spoke 
previously talked about accountability to citizens and then went 
forward to object to the board of directors having a reduced 
number of bureaucrats and more individuals from every walk of 
life in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rent controls, which were also mentioned by the hon. member who 
spoke previously, are under provincial jurisdiction.  If one 
reads the bill carefully, all interests that the CMHC has in 
partnerships with the private sector and provincial governments 
also give it the ability to supervise such things as rent 
increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the bill, as it stands, is in perfect shape.  It 
is upgrading old legislation that has to come into the 21st 
century.  It is here for the Canadian public.  It is an excellent 
bill and it requires no amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot 
help but respond to the hon. parliamentary secretary.  I think 
this is absolutely the first bill that the Liberal government has 
introduced which is perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have noticed that the feeling of arrogance, the feeling of 
completeness and the feeling of superiority to everyone else is 
beginning to grow and develop on that side of the House.  That is 
the first sign that there is something wrong.  If there was 
nothing wrong, then they would not have to say they were perfect. 
Everybody would know it.  I believe one has to take issue with 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also struck by the comment the hon. parliamentary 
secretary made about the mission to Chile.  I certainly concur. I 
was a participant in that particular mission.  It was an 
excellent mission, which was extremely well organized and very 
well done.  I think it will produce jobs in Canada and it will 
move the housing market forward in Chile.  However, I submit that 
was done under the existing Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation Act.  It was very successful.  The Canada Mortgage 
and Housing Corporation can indeed and has entered into those 
particular activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw to the hon. member's attention the 
particular clause that would be amended by the proposed 
amendment.  Clause 29 on page 20 would replace section 14 with 
the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Corporation may establish branches and employ agents. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a carte blanche to establish branches and employ agents 
anywhere, wherever the CMHC wishes to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation is to 
implement and to make operational, to administer if you will, the 
National Housing Act.  That is the purpose of the Canada Mortgage 
and Housing Corporation.  The mandate of the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation is to implement and to put into operation the 
housing policy of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this corporation can establish branches and agents, and an 
agent can act as if it were the government or the corporation, 
and in this case it would be an agent of the corporation, it 
means that the agent is the corporation wherever that branch or 
agent sets up office.  That is the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment is not intended in any way, shape or form to 
restrict the operation of the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation to do the kind of thing that it did in Chile or in 
other parts of the world. 
However, it definitely is the intention to restrict the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation to insure mortgages in Canada, 
not in Germany or Japan or Chile or anywhere else in the world. 
That is a totally different issue.  The hon. member should review 
that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be an honest disagreement in opinion and perhaps legal 
counsel ought to be sought.  However, it is abundantly clear to 
me that the intent and purpose of the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation is to serve Canadians first and foremost.  That is 
its purpose.  If that purpose is going to be jeopardized by 
diverting its attention to other countries in the world, then it 
has lost its primary function.  Let us keep that very clearly in 
mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue that appears in this bill with the amendments 
and the new proposals is that there is absolutely no transparency 
in the financial dealings of the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation.  There is no indication of where the profits will 
go.  It simply says that the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation shall pay, for example, from the mortgage insurance 
fund to the consolidated revenues of Canada a fee, or moneys.  It 
does not even call it a fee.  The clause states that these shall 
be considered expenses.  At the moment there is a $602 million 
surplus in the mortgage insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can money be paid to the consolidated revenue fund?  Under the 
current provisions of the act, no.  When we asked the officials 
of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation how much it had 
paid to the consolidated revenue fund, they said there had been 
no payment.  We asked if that would change under the provisions 
of the new act and they said that, yes, it would.  Then we asked 
them what the guidelines would be and what the policies and 
principles would be that would determine how much money would be 
taken from the surplus either in the mortgage insurance fund or 
from any other operation that the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation would get into.  The president began to speak and 
immediately the minister interrupted and said that would be 
determined at some later time and they did not know.  That is not 
transparent, nor is it responsible and accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no provisions in this bill.  It simply says that the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation may invest.  It does not 
say where, it does not say how much, it does not say from what 
sources, but it may invest money somewhere, somehow, in land, 
buildings, stocks, bonds or other mortgages.  It is not clear at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither is there a provision that these investments, whatever 
they might be, have to be guided by the same kind of guidelines 
that exist for the insurance companies under the Insurance 
Companies Act.  Neither are there any guidelines as to what it 
has to do in terms of maintaining a prudential portfolio.  All of 
this is left wide open and the administration of the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation can do whatever it wants to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that is an inherent flaw in the bill.  As a minimum 
the bill ought to subject the financial operations of the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation to the same restrictions that 
are there for insurance companies and other financial 
institutions in Canada.  That is the minimum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the final analysis, if the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation invests its money improperly and loses money, who is 
going to pay?  The taxpayer is going to pay and that is a 
terrible intrusion.  If a bank or an insurance company acts in a 
fiduciary and responsible manner and must abide by the rules and 
regulations of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions, then surely a crown corporation should be no less 
concerned about the security of the money it invests.  That is 
one provision that is not in the bill which I think should be 
included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak briefly about capitalization.  It is interesting 
that the corporation has capitalization of $25 million.  There is 
a new provision in the proposed bill that capitalization may be 
increased by the governor in council.  There are two problems 
here.  First, why should the governor in council determine the 
capitalization of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation? If 
it is going to be changed, then it ought to be done by parliament 
and not by the governor in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it seems almost a nonsensical kind of provision in the 
first place because the capitalization of the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation is simply a paper entry. 
Behind Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation are all the 
resources and the financial clout of the federal government. To 
capitalize the corporation at $25 million or any other number is 
simply a book entry.  We need to be very careful in that regard. 
Let us face it.  The corporation has huge investments and 
exposure in the marketplace.  It has insured something like $280 
billion worth of mortgages.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point we need to look at is the way in which CMHC can 
actually intrude into and become an intermediary in the financial 
marketplace.  Why should a crown corporation enter into the 
financial marketplace and intrude directly with all the clout of 
the federal government and thereby virtually override and bully 
every other financial institution simply because it has all the 
resources of the nation at its disposal and the other companies 
do not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation is to be on a 
fair and equal playing field with the others on a commercial 
basis, it ought to have the same operational principles and 
guidelines governing its operations as other institutions, and it 
does not.  Therefore I believe CHMC has an unfair advantage and 
it should not have that advantage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to make a few comments following those of 
the parliamentary secretary.  She wondered why we could not trust 
the government with this bill.  We could provide a long list of 
why we cannot trust the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could look at what the Prime Minister said when he came to 
Beauséjour to get elected in the riding that I represent, which 
was once the safest Liberal seat in the country.  He promised 
seasonal workers that he would make the UI program better for 
them, to better reflect their needs.  When he came back to Ottawa 
he actually said everybody was drunk in taverns collecting UI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then they were to scrap the GST.  We all remember that.  What 
happened was that in New Brunswick we ended up with an extra 8% 
on the electric bill, on the oil bill, on children's clothing, 
and it goes on and on.  Now we have a 15% tax on everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the national child care program.  That was also a 
great promise in 1993, that we would have a national child care 
program, and we are still waiting for it.  Yet she wonders why we 
cannot trust the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about pay equity?  There were signed letters by the Prime 
Minister to women who have actually passed away due to illnesses 
since his promise to them.  They kept his letter in their desks, 
hoping that the Prime Minister would keep his promise and give 
them what was rightly theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tribunal said that these women and men, federal public 
servants, deserved equal pay for work of equal value.  We have a 
Liberal government that condemned the Conservative government for 
not wanting to recognize that.  The Liberals made promise after 
promise to get elected and were elected, but again they did not 
honour the promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no problem justifying to the parliamentary secretary why 
we cannot trust the government.  We just cannot trust it.  It 
will say anything to get elected, and that is what it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the parliamentary secretary mentioned decent affordable 
housing.  What is the real definition of decent affordable 
housing when there are 200,000 homeless people in the country? 
Single parents are using 50% or more of their income to pay their 
rent.  Low income families are doing the same.  Low income 
seniors are using 50% of their income on housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget was brought forward in February and it showed a 
surplus.  What did the government do with the surplus?  It did 
not put it in health care.  The government pretended to put it in 
health care, but it really put it on the debt.  It had all the 
chance in the world to address the homeless situation and first 
nations across the country that desperately need housing. 
Does the government really care?  It comes up with a bill, but do

at the first nations across the country living in desperate 
situations.  I look at poor families outside reservations living 
in desperate situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February the Liberal government had a chance to do something 
about these things.  What happened?  It actually implemented the 
Reform Party's position: cut tax, reduce the debt; cut tax, 
reduce the debt; cut tax, reduce the debt.  That is what we saw 
and to hell with social programs.  This is what is happening. 
Again the poorest people in the country are suffering, and that 
is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the bill will not improve anything. Technically 
we have heard everything that is wrong with the bill.  I think it 
is important to talk about the real issues such as what is really 
happening in our areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day we receive phone calls from people looking for a place 
to live.  We have to make phone calls all over the riding trying 
to find places for people to live in order to be able to work. If 
one does not have a home, how can one hold a job?  That is a 
serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Brunswick is paying the lowest social assistance payments in 
the country to its recipients.  Two single moms cannot share a 
house or an apartment in order to try to make life better for 
their kids because it is not allowed.  It is not allowed because 
it might make their life a little easier.  It is sad.  These 
people are smart enough to get together and do something that is 
especially good for their children.  Then they could go to school 
with food in their stomachs and wearing proper clothing, but the 
provincial government says it is not allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think everything we could say on the bill has been said. It is 
clear it is something we cannot support.  Hopefully the 
government will find a conscience some day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had occasion to 
speak earlier to the motions in Group No. 2, and now, like the 
other members, I will move on to the motions in Group No. 3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder where the government is headed with Bill C-66.  It has 
decided to go into business abroad.  It wants to build low cost 
housing abroad and probably wants to get into housing 
development abroad. But is this the role of a government?  Must 
the government not first and foremost defend the interests of 
Canadians and look after their welfare? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, through the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation, is getting involved in a commercial operation it 
has no business in.  The structure was not designed for that. 
This was not the intent of Canadians in establishing the CHMC; 
rather, it was to help Canadians who wanted to acquire a house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, when I finished my last intervention, I spoke of the 
context of the negotiation of world trade agreements, the WTO 
and all that.  My colleague from Trois-Rivières spoke of the 
government's new mentality with respect to its foreign partners, 
the famous negotiation with the other provinces on the social 
union framework agreement.  It is proof the federal government 
is literally going over the provinces' heads and leaving them 
off to one side in all aspects of the daily lives of Canadians. 
It is now positioning itself as the only real government for 
Canadians, and the provinces are being left out in the cold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That can be seen in Bill C-66, when my colleague from 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve proposed amendments to the text of it to 
permit agreements with the provinces on public housing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They were, of course, rejected by the committee, and the 
parliamentary secretary followed the party line on this issue. I 
wonder if she listened to us. In any case, it does not change 
anything, because the decisions are made long before anything 
happens in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when the committee heard witnesses, including GE 
Capital, on the eve of the clause by clause review of the bill. 
A document was given to us in English only. I asked that it be 
translated, because I wanted to read it and make comments. The 
committee, with the support of the government majority, had 
already decided which amendments, which changes to the bill 
would be acceptable or unacceptable, this before even having 
heard the last witnesses. 
The hon. member to my left can attest to that, because he was 
sitting on that committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, this bill was rammed through. We were not given an 
opportunity to assess its impact on Canadians as regards social 
housing and housing development. The bill was rammed through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kelowna, who spoke before me, alluded to the 
issue of accountability. With this bill, who is responsible for 
what? The regulations will no longer be made through an order to 
the governor in council and notice will no longer be given in 
part II or III of the <I>Canada Gazette</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, everything will be done in secret. This legislation is 
similar to Bill C-47, Bill C-48 and Bill C-49, in the previous 
parliament. Former Bill C-84 changed the whole procedure and the 
responsibility concerning the making of regulations. Now, the 
government wants to run things informally. 
This is often a cause for concern.  It becomes a real maze. 
Even the experts will get lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without strict rules, no one will be accountable.  Not all 
ministers will operate the same way. There will come a time when 
one will overturn another's decision.  The reason there were 
stringent rules for passing regulations was so that the 
procedure would be clear.  Now, all that has gone by the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the name of efficiency, the rules of the game are going to be 
changed by means of a mere notice on behalf of the minister in 
the <I>Canada Gazette</I>. 
A few days later, the regulation will take effect, but no one 
will comply because it is no longer announced.  This is one of 
the biggest problems with Bill C-66 and as responsible members of 
this House we cannot go along with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Appointments to the board of directors are also a farce.  The 
parliamentary secretary did not go into any detail.  I know she 
is an honest women and I suspect she is quite uncomfortable with 
this bill, with this way of appointing friends of the regime to 
the head of a crown corporation.  Will the CMHC be audited in 
future, given that it will be independent of the government per 
se?  It will pay dividends and therefore becomes a crown 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will it be subject to audit by the Auditor General of Canada?  I 
do not know, but Atomic Energy of Canada Limited is not, nor are 
a number of crown corporations. 
Canada Post Corporation is no longer audited by the Auditor 
General of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crown corporations are all exempted from auditing by the Auditor 
General of Canada. The government says nothing about this. We 
end up with corporations here and there, as Nav Canada, etc. 
There are large ones, small ones, corporations of all sizes, but 
they all have one thing in common: they no longer have a boss.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They are no longer managed by 
parliament. It does not make decisions for them. Crown 
corporations make their own decisions and from time to time the 
minister makes decisions, when relations are good. If things are 
not going well, the minister does not seem to have much more 
authority because parliament no longer decides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what is tragic in the current Liberal approach. 
Literally, they push parliament to the sidelines when the time 
comes to make decisions and they do so in the name of efficient 
management. However, efficiency does not justify everything. We 
cannot bypass parliament in the name of efficiency. We cannot 
work around parliament in the name of efficiency and cost 
effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill reassures no one. For various reasons, Reformers, 
Bloquists, New Democrats and Progressive Conservatives are 
against this bill. Not for the same reasons, but it still proves 
that this bill is flawed. This is what happens when a bill is 
rammed through and amendments are drafted even before the last 
witnesses have been heard in committee. This is steamroller 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot support such a bill. It has become a real joke. I see 
the government member laughing because he knows this bill has 
become a real joke, but he is paid to do that. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased once again to speak on the amendments proposed to 
Bill C-66, this time on Group No. 3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first of all like to speak in support of some of the 
motions presented by the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton and 
the member for Kelowna. I will then have some general comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been proposed in Motions Nos. 25, 27, 28 and 29 by the 
member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton that the board of directors of 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation remains as it is 
currently structured rather than change it as has been proposed 
in the bill. These are amendments with which I wholeheartedly 
agree. Section 25 of Bill C-66 would alter the structure of the 
CMHC board, a structure that was put in place and has remained 
unchanged since December 18, 1945. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 6(1) of the CMHC Act states: “The board of directors 
shall consist of the chairman, the president, a vice-president 
who shall be designated by the governor in council, and seven 
other members, two of whom shall be selected from the Public 
Service of Canada and five of whom shall be selected from outside 
the Public Service of Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words the board of CMHC as it currently exists consists 
of five highly qualified housing professionals from CMHC and the 
public service, and five people who are appointed by the Liberal 
cabinet who may or may not be qualified or even have any 
knowledge of the housing industry.  Although it concerns me that 
nowhere in the act does it stipulate the qualifications these 
Liberal appointees must have in order to sit on that board, at 
least the legislation strikes a balance between housing 
professionals and the Liberal appointees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government is suggesting we do with Bill C-66 is to 
throw out the structure of the board that has worked so well for 
the last 54 years and appoint three more Liberals to the board. 
If we allow this bill to pass unamended, the Liberals will remove 
the vice-president of CMHC and two public servants from the board 
and replace them with three Liberal patronage appointees. 
Presently the board has a good balance among its 10 members, 
being one-half housing professionals and one-half political 
appointees. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two problems with the changes to the board as proposed 
in the bill.  First, the balance will be upset in favour of the 
government.  Second, there is no way to guarantee that the 
politically appointed Liberals will have any qualifications 
whatsoever to be able to make important decisions affecting 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want to speak disparagingly about the Liberals, but 
the government has developed a reputation, deservedly so, of 
appointing Liberals to government boards, qualified or otherwise. 
Aside from the distasteful nature of this change that could put 
three more Liberals on the CMHC board, it could also threaten the 
independence that CMHC enjoys as a crown corporation.  Just 
think, now CMHC management has to answer to a board that at least 
has some balance between five highly qualified professionals and 
five Liberals.  But under the new board, CMHC management will be 
under the direction of a board comprised of a majority of Liberal 
appointees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an opportunity to question the minister responsible for 
CMHC on this bill.  When I asked him what necessitated this 
change, he had no answer.  When I asked him what problem existed 
with the present board that required this solution, he could not 
offer an explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals want to have a board composed of eight patronage 
appointees and two housing professionals.  This is entirely 
unacceptable to our party, as are the accompanying changes in 
clauses 26, 27 and 28. I am also pleased to support the amendment 
by the member for Kelowna that would delete clause 30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, CMHC cannot unilaterally raise the capital limit of 
the corporation without coming back to the House of Commons and 
getting the approval of the members of the House. The bill 
proposes that this change can be made by cabinet without the 
input of Canadians or their elected representatives. This should 
stay as it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a note on Motion No. 30 that was moved by the member for 
Kelowna.  Clause 29 of the bill broadens the mandate of CMHC to 
allow it to establish branches and appoint agents outside Canada 
to better serve customers.  This is particularly important when 
it comes to fulfilling the corporation's mandate to promote 
Canadian housing products and services outside Canada.  I believe 
this proposed change in the bill would be of benefit to the 
Canadian housing industry and I must therefore oppose this 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point I want to talk about.  I heard the 
parliamentary secretary on the government side when she said that 
this bill was not about homelessness.  I am part of a task force 
organized by the PC Party of Canada.  I travel across the 
country, not that I like to do it.  Mr. Speaker, you know I do 
not like to travel, I do not like to fly. Hon. members cannot 
imagine the Canadians we meet on a daily basis while we travel 
who do not have a roof over their heads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What disturbs me is that this bill will take $197 million out of 
the corporation and hand it over to the government, whereas that 
money should be used for social housing. The budget that Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation has right now should be 
increased substantially to deal with the problem of homelessness 
in this country.  It is not being increased.  It is being 
downgraded and $197 million will be given to the government so 
that it can waste it somewhere else.  That is what the government 
has been doing since 1993, wasting taxpayers' money.  It is a 
real shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other week a Reform Party member asked a question of the new 
minister responsible for homelessness, who was supposedly 
appointed by the Prime Minister about a month ago.  In her answer 
she told the member that she was not the minister responsible for 
homelessness.  Last week in New Brunswick in a meeting she 
claimed that she was the new minister responsible for 
homelessness.  Can she make up her mind?  We have a minister who 
does not have a mandate, who does not know her mandate, who does 
not know she is minister and who all of a sudden knows that she 
is minister, yet people out there are hurting.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a better housing policy.  We need to help those people. 
We need to put more money into different programs. I am not 
saying that the existing programs are all that bad.  RRAP is a 
program which helps senior citizens and disabled people stay in 
their houses.  It is a good program.  We need to put more 
emphasis on and more money into that program so that we can help 
those people stay in their houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to find some money somewhere to put into social housing 
so that we can help people who do not have homes.  In New 
Brunswick in my riding of Tobique—Mactaquac I know some really 
nice people with young children who literally live, eat and sleep 
in their car.  Is that a house?  It is not a house to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government doing about it?  The Liberals are half 
asleep over there right now.  It is time to get to work.  We were 
elected as members of parliament to represent our people and it 
is time we did the job.  Put the partisan politics aside.  Let us 
all work together because this is not a problem we have, it is a 
crisis. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, you will have heard me speak in the House many times 
about the smoke and mirror tactics of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I have to begin my 
speech today by saying it is in the area of housing, specifically 
when it comes to Bill C-66, that we have probably the best 
example yet of a government that is prepared to trick Canadians 
into believing it is providing a great service on housing, while 
in fact it does the reverse and does as little as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary tried to suggest that we have a bill 
before us with the great noble intention of reducing red tape. If 
that were the case, in the context of good public policy on 
housing, I would say bravo.  But when we are left with a choice 
between reduced red tape and not having any good public social 
housing, then I would rather take the red tape, as would all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to see this government assume responsibility for 
an issue in society today of fundamental human rights, which is 
adequate shelter for all Canadians regardless of where they may 
live. This bill is about fundamental differences in viewpoints 
and philosophical approaches. Behind it all is absolutely without 
question a deliberate policy, a deliberate approach on the part 
of the Liberal government to abdicate responsibility for meeting 
its obligations of adequate shelter for all Canadians and 
offloading as quickly as possible onto other levels of government 
and onto Canadian individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-66 complements the government's agenda of completely 
abdicating the field of social housing, of transferring 
responsibility for co-operative housing to the provinces.  The 
government is clearly on record as stating it is not prepared to 
increase by one cent in the area of meeting the necessary housing 
requirements of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments before the House are designed specifically to 
require the government to get back into the housing picture, to 
resume its responsibilities, to restore federal involvement in 
such a vital social policy area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many connections to be made today between this bill 
and the Liberal government's illusory politics.  It is smoke and 
mirror tactics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must interrupt the 
hon. member.  She will have approximately seven minutes left when 
the bill is brought back to the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.)</B> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the parliament and crown 
agencies should be subject to scrutiny under the Access to 
Information Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I rise today to propose this very 
straightforward and simple motion.  It is not votable but I 
believe that does not detract from the importance of this 
subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have come to this place I have put forward several bills 
on access to information.  I have been told by several ministers 
that it is a matter of a very short time and there will be some 
major reforms to the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In doing the research for my motion today I found a number of 
agencies that are not subject to access to information.  For the 
benefit of the House it is fair to note that all new crown 
corporations being created are not subject to access to 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time I have spoken on this subject and I 
assume it probably will not be the last.  I will continue to put 
forward private members' motions which try to address this 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five times in the past six years individual members of the House 
have put forward motions which tried to address different parts 
of the deficiencies of the current legislation.  My caucus 
colleagues from Wild Rose and Dauphin—Swan River, just to name a 
couple, have also put forward motions on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well known that on the opposition side of the House there 
are a great many people who feel the current legislation needs to 
be improved.  In my case this motion simply carries on with some 
of the other areas I have identified as problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982 the Access to Information Act was passed and the 
following year it was given royal assent.  Some 17 years ago that 
piece of legislation was brought forward.  At that time it was 
based on “the principle that government information should be 
available to the public”.  It is a very straightforward and 
simple premise with which most Canadians and most 
parliamentarians hopefully would agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important principle and it is very important that 
we do not forget it.  I do not think any one in opposition in the 
House could put up much of an argument in opposition to access to 
information.  I do not think anyone in the House would not 
basically agree with an open style of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had many political documents over the course of the 
years which have bragged about the open style of government that 
was coming.  Those who might be tempted to reject this kind of 
principle would probably be running the risk of a great deal of 
public rebuke in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this should be a non-partisan issue.  The fact that we 
are spending taxpayers money and doing things in this place 
should be open totally to the scrutiny of people who pay the 
bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a democracy such as ours government accountability is 
essential to the preservation of our freedoms and to the 
protection of the public interest as defined in many different 
ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might ask why this issue is so important and why I should 
be spending so much time and effort in questioning access to 
information.  After all we have an information commissioner and 
the bureaucracy in place.  Most Canadians probably assume that 
the main people who benefit are parliamentarians and journalists. 
That is not true.  A growing number of Canadians are using access 
to information.  It is certainly true that the media and 
parliamentarians use it as much as possible, but using this act 
can force the government to reveal information which parliament 
and other places cannot get hold of.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House, regardless of on which side of the aisle 
they sit, can use the act to discover, to unearth or to reveal 
what the government and the bureaucracy are doing behind the 
scenes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent speech the information commissioner noted that 
members of parliament are increasingly relying upon the current 
access law to help them with their responsibilities and 
parliamentary duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems to me perfectly understandable as the House is 
overwhelmed by the amount of business that it must conduct.  The 
ability of its members to fulfil their duty to scrutinize 
legislation requires new tools.  Debate and questions are simply 
no longer adequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past 17 years access to information has become a 
crucial part of our democratic system.  It has become an 
essential means of guaranteeing government accountability.  A 
recent report released by Queen's University school of political 
studies has noted the tremendous increase in the requests 
targeting government ministries and agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to list all these results but let me list a few 
examples.  According to this study, between 1993 and 1998 the 
number of access requests directed at Health Canada increased by 
72%; at national defence, by 74%; and at correctional service, by 
79%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These requests are not the work of crackpots who are simply 
trying to make the public service look bad.  They do not 
represent a concerted effort to reveal dirt about government 
officials, corruption and such things.  Instead the vast increase 
in requests simply reflects the growing complexity of government 
and the growing awareness among Canadians of the breadth and 
range of ongoing government activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of ministerial accountability, a concept the 
government seems not always to like, has been supplemented by the 
Access to Information Act.  What question period and ministerial 
inquiries cannot reveal might very well be discovered through an 
access to information request.  That is an important addition to 
the system of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently on a television program a statement was made that 
Canada had one of the most secretive democracies in the world.  I 
do not believe that comment should be used in a country like 
Canada and the reform of the Access to Information Act therefore 
becomes even more important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sir Francis Bacon once said that knowledge itself was power. 
That may be an old adage but not all wisdom is new wisdom. Access 
to information, to knowledge about government activities, is a 
means of preventing too great a concentration of power in the 
hands of anonymous and unaccountable public servants.  It also 
means devolving power back to those from whom it is derived, the 
common people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Access to Information Act is currently inadequate.  It does 
not meet the standards of open government which the Canadian 
people expect and deserve.  The 1982 Access to Information Act 
states that “necessary exceptions to the right of access should 
be limited and specific”.  This seems to be a relatively 
straightforward aim of this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite all hon. members to take time to read through the 
legislation to refresh their memories.  Without going into 
detail, the current legislation permits exceptions to access in 
three basic areas:  first, where national security might be 
threatened by the release of information; second, where the 
fairness of a judicial process might be prejudiced; and, third, 
where the release of information might reveal trade secrets or 
place Canadian business in an unfair situation vis-à-vis foreign 
firms.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These seem to be very reasonable restrictions.  I think all of 
us would agree with them.  They cannot be used as an argument 
against changing the access to information for crown 
corporations.  There is an existing appeal process should someone 
disagree with the assessment by a department or government agency 
that access must be denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could quote a number of legal representations but I am not a 
lawyer by training so I will forgo that.  The 1984 decision of 
the federal court seems to make crystal clear how this should 
work and how exceptions and exemptions should be handled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people have a right to know and those who would deny it must 
explain themselves before the most appropriate authority.  In 
other words, open government is more than a privilege.  It is a 
basic principle of our political system in a modern Canada going 
into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This principle is not being properly respected by those whose 
duty it is to uphold it.  According to one report, only about 
one-half of the 12,000 access to information requests filed 
annually are replied to within the statutory time limit of 30 
days.  This tardiness increases when the request comes from an 
opposition member of the House, and again statistics back that 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally know that government departments seek to discover 
the identity of many of the people who file requests.  That is 
also a violation of the existing law.  I believe some of the 
ministers responsible for that should be held accountable in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few moments ago I cited some figures from a very recent 
Queen's University study on access to information.  I will now 
cite others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the study, the number of full disclosure responses 
provided by government ministries and agencies has shown an 
alarming decline in recent years.  Despite all the controversy 
surrounding it and the current minister's micromanaging of access 
to information requests, the Department of National Defence has 
seen a decline of only 8.8% in full disclosures between 1993 and 
1998.  A decline in meeting access requests is not good, but 9% 
is not at all bad when compared with the worst offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same period the privy council saw a decline of 40% in its 
disclosures.  The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency saw a 
decline of 39.4% and the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, a decline of 22%.  All these are declines 
in willingness to respond to access claims.  At a time when we 
are asking for more accountability and more open government, 
obviously none of these should be declining in terms of responses 
to access to information claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information commissioner recently stated that “many public 
servants have simply decided that when it comes to the access law 
illegal behaviour is the norm”.  Make no mistake, refusing 
access is quite clearly against the spirit and the letter of the 
law of the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps some day we will learn why the Minister of National 
Defence needs to supervise the response to each access to 
information request of his department.  He personally must 
approve every one of them that comes into his office before 
access is given.  Does he think we will find out that the troops 
are not combat capable?  Does he think that the Canadian people 
might be shocked at the information about the decline that has 
occurred? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose the wheat board is one thing I will not have time to 
talk about, but many of my constituents are upset that they, the 
shareholders, cannot have access to the board, the salaries and 
the information.  They would be happy to get it even from last 
year or the year before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of reforms are needed to the Access to Information Act. 
Canadians are asking for them and I do not understand why the 
government has not brought forward the reforms it promised in 
1994.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the motion put forward by 
the member for Red Deer proposes that parliament extend coverage 
of the Access to Information Act to federal crown corporations 
and the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to recent lists, there are 49 parent crown 
corporations of which 29 are subject to the act.  For example, 
the Bank of Canada and the Canadian Film Development Corporation 
are subject to both the Access to Information Act and the Privacy 
Act. The Canada Post Corporation and the Export Development 
Corporation are covered only under privacy legislation.  Atomic 
Energy of Canada Limited and the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation, on the other hand, are not subject to either act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee on justice and the solicitor general 
examined this issue in 1987 during the review of the Access to 
Information Act and the Privacy Act.  In the report entitled 
“Open and shut:  Enhancing the right to know and the right to 
privacy”, the committee made three recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first recommendation was to extend coverage of both acts to 
all crown corporations and wholly owned subsidiaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second recommendation was to apply the legislation if the 
Government of Canada controls a public institution by means of a 
power of appointment over the majority of the members of the 
agency's governing body or committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the committee proposed that the acts apply to the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation but provide an exemption in 
relation to its program material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government responded to the committee's report by promising 
to review the proposals from the perspectives of the need for 
openness, to promote government accountability, the role of the 
institution involved and the need to ensure that any extension of 
the act will be in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to support openness, needs to consult with 
organizations which potentially could be affected by this motion 
and also needs to ensure that there are provisions within the 
Access to Information Act to protect the legitimate commercial 
interests of the crown corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public is sending us the same message.  They want a 
more open and accountable government.  They believe that they 
have a right to obtain information controlled by federal 
institutions whether the institution is a department, an agency 
or a crown corporation.  It is important to note that this right 
is already afforded to them in other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent provincial freedom of information acts have established a 
precedent for including crown corporations within the scope of 
their legislation.  Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec 
laws, for example, cover provincial and municipal agencies, 
boards, commissions and corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last spring Bill C-216 was debated in the House.  Bill C-216 
also proposed that crown corporations be included in the schedule 
of the Access to Information Act.  Both Bill C-216 and Motion No. 
2 complement a private member's motion that the government make 
all crown corporations subject to the Privacy Act.  This motion 
was debated in the House in April 1997 and passed with all party 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 complements the government's commitment to 
enhancing privacy rights which are outlined in a public 
discussion paper entitled “The protection of personal 
information:  Building Canada's information economy and 
society”. This paper examines the privacy issues surrounding 
electronic commerce and associated consumer transactions.  It 
addresses the need to develop legislation that will permit 
Canadians to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by 
advances in technology.  At the same time, it proposes a means by 
which the security of personal information can be protected in 
the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the extension of access to information legislation is 
contemplated, there is frequently a reaction that such an 
extension will result in increased costs to the institutions.  In 
fact, the principles underlying the provision of access reinforce 
the principles of good information management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sound information management practices ensure that all 
information holdings are created and organized in accordance with 
recognized standards.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, they require that organizations properly schedule 
their records for preservation, retention and disposal.  As a 
result, information is readily available for current decision 
making purposes as well as for the future study of decision 
making in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before supporting extending coverage of the Access to 
Information Act to the category of crown corporations, we must 
take into account the other two elements to which I referred to 
earlier:  the need to consult with the crown corporations, and 
the need to ensure that there are provisions within the 
legislation to adequately protect their legitimate interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recognize that it would be absolutely necessary to 
consult with the affected crown corporations and to identify any 
unique circumstances under which they operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be absolutely essential that we consider adjustments to 
existing legislation to avoid causing damage to the commercial 
interests of one or more of the organizations.  One of the cruxes 
of this particular piece, I think, is that we do have to consult. 
There are no two ways about it.  I see the member nodding yes, 
agreeing that is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Determining the impact of subjecting parliament to the 
provisions of the Access to Information Act would require 
extensive study to ensure that basic democratic principles would 
not be undermined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although extending the act to cover the administrative functions 
of parliament has often been suggested, it is unlikely that 
complete coverage would be feasible.  This is particularly 
pertinent to operations that directly affect party affairs or the 
affairs of constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the perspective of encouraging openness in government, we 
appreciate the intent underlying the motion presented by the 
member for Red Deer.  However, it does not strike an appropriate 
balance between promoting the accountability of public 
institutions on the one hand and, on the other hand, the 
requirement to protect the public interest in ensuring that the 
operations of its crown corporations and parliament are not 
unfairly compromised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, at this time we cannot support this motion. 
However, it is important to note that the intent of the hon. 
member from the Reform Party is a good one.  I think everyone 
does want openness and transparency.  For that I commend him.  We 
do not believe the balance is quite right yet, but certainly the 
intent is a good one.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talked about raw milk cheese, during the previous 
parliament, I tried to get information on available raw milk 
cheese import quotas. 
I went to the Access to Information Commission, but the minister 
imposed a veto. He used all his energy to keep this information 
from me. Is there anything more harmless than this information 
on cheese import quotas? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another occasion, I asked for information from another 
department. I got the information, but it made no sense. Much 
had been covered with a big black marker, and this was probably 
the gist of the document. I was left with the date at the top 
and a signature at the bottom, but hardly anything in between. 
And they claim they are abiding by the Access to Information 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some ministers screen just about any request for information on 
their department. It is a sign of fear. 
Why would a minister bother to read, in some cases up to 95%, of 
all such requests? Does the minister himself cross out 
everything he wants to keep from us? In that case, the Access to 
Information Act is pretty much useless.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything we want to know or everything that is likely to be of 
interest to the person who made the request is crossed out by 
the minister, his assistants or his staff, which makes the 
Access to Information Act almost totally ineffective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crown corporations that are separate legal entities from the 
government should be subject to the application of the Access to 
Information Act. However, and I agree with the parliamentary 
secretary on that point, there are types of commercial 
information that cannot be released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take, for example, the Canadian Investment Corporation, 
the corporation responsible for managing the federal 
government's housing stock. If a competitor had access to its 
list of prices, its costs and other information of a purely 
internal nature, information related to the daily management of 
its affairs, we can see the damage the corporation could incur 
if it were forced to provide these details to its competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not always MPs who request information, it is not always 
people who are concerned with protecting a certain part of the 
internal affairs of these organizations. Therefore, there is 
some danger in that and it could cause a lot of damage. I think 
the member for Red Deer, who made the proposal, agreed with what 
the parliamentary secretary said earlier, and I have to say that 
I share the same view. I am greatly concerned about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In parliament, we, the members, would be compelled to provide 
information. I believe there are things all would want to keep 
confidential. That is what we call the right to privacy. When we 
consider issues that have nothing to do with management but only 
with members themselves, it means that, pursuant to the Access 
to Information Act, one could ask individual members of 
parliament how much money they have in the bank, whether their 
house is mortgaged, how much money they owe. The motion before 
the House could be construed to mean that this kind of 
information could be obtained through the access to information 
commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that is the purpose of this motion nor the goal 
of its sponsor. No one in the House would want this either. It 
would be rathr difficult to apply the terms of such a motion. Of 
course, we respect and understand the sound principles on which 
it is based. 
My party share the concerns of the members of parliament and 
especially the hon. member for Red Deer who brought forward this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But maybe we are overshooting, as my grandfather used to say. 
Some people could be affected and hurt if this motion were 
passed. Fortunately, it is not a votable item. It could have 
very undesirable if not deleterious effects, which would make us 
regret the day we passed such a motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the principle is sound. When I was co-chair of the joint 
scrutiny of regulations committee. When we asked to examine the 
bylaws of crown corporations, our requests were often turned 
down. We were told “We are an independent agency. The bylaws 
that we pass and publish are none of parliament's business”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was pretty frustrating, because these 
crown corporations are government creatures run on public funds. 
But when they are asked to give us information, they pretty 
well tell us to drop dead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Chambly, there was a post office sandwiched 
between two malls.  There was a rumour that it was up for sale. 
The two mall owners came to my office. They asked me whether 
they could be assured that they would be notified in order to 
put in a bid, to purchase the post office business, which would 
have to move.  Fortunately, it did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, I had recently been elected and I was not very 
familiar with how to handle this. I phoned Canada Post 
Corporation and talked with an official. I wanted some 
assurances. Would there be a call for tender? Would it be 
public? I was told “Listen sir, if Canada Post decides to give 
away its post office, the government has no say in that 
decision. As long as we submit a positive balance sheet to the 
government, it does not ask any questions”. I thought it was 
totally appalling to get such an answer, but it was the truth. 
The person who gave me the information did not want to mislead 
me. He was telling me that the act, as it was worded, allowed 
Canada Post to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, the Access to Information Act could be used 
in that situation. We could ask bodies, organizations or crown 
corporations to appear before a House committee or someone to 
justify their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we agree with the principles behind this motion. But 
it would have to be amended before we could support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I similarly am pleased to add but a few remarks to 
the motion put forward by my hon. colleague from Red Deer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is truly not a new debate certainly in this House.  I submit 
that it is a very admirable attempt to address an issue that has 
become of increasing concern to parliament.  I know that my hon. 
colleague personally has been very persevering on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us is whether to make parliament and crown 
agencies subject to scrutiny under the Access to Information Act. 
The Freedom of Information Act itself and the laws are built 
around the basic principle “that government information ought to 
be publicly available whenever possible”.  This comes from the 
secretary of state in 1977 on the issue when the Freedom of 
Information Act was first enacted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is aimed at helping to keep government itself 
honest and certainly to bring about greater accountability.  I 
think we can all agree that this should be entrenched and 
wherever possible there should be transparency.  It is something 
I believe that the public is now expecting and further to that, 
demanding of parliamentarians. There is a growing degree of 
frustration among members of parliament in this session and 
certainly the public as well that this is not the case.  The 
current legislation is not achieving that end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private sector restructuring has affected current freedom of 
information laws.  Currently the freedom of information laws do 
give citizens, including obviously members of this House and both 
provincial and federal members, the right to obtain government 
held records, except in certain cases where it is in the public 
interest to maintain some secrecy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's freedom of information law is known as 
the Access to Information Act.  However, there are times when 
that information is not accessible, so there is a bit of an 
anomaly there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is consistent I suppose with the back and forth debate that 
went on when this type of legislation was first enacted, the 
balance that had to be struck, and it is a proper word to be 
used. It was used by the parliamentary secretary in her remarks. 
There is obviously a need to balance the right to protect an 
individual's privacy or a business's privacy in some instances 
versus the general public's right to know.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit that cutbacks to the public service have caused 
an increasing delay in government processing of freedom of 
information requests.  The federal information commissioner has 
made remarks along these lines calling this a festering silent 
scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit that further to that, this is consistent with 
some of the results that we have seen coming from the government, 
that there is a delay.  Delay can be the deadliest form of denial 
when there is a need for information.  A certain policy approach 
is developing that seems to grind citizens down and perhaps grind 
even individual members of parliament down in their attempts to 
find out information from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has obviously taken the position that it has to 
be accountable fiscally.  No one denies that and certainly the 
attempt to achieve this result is going to result in cuts.  I 
think these cuts account for much of the delay that happens 
within the federal government.  However, experimenting with new 
methods of delivering public services, privatization of former 
government controlled agencies, has been a necessary means to the 
desired end of that fiscal responsibility, but there is a risk of 
efficiency and risk of delay in taking this approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All governments are constantly searching for ways to transfer 
functions out of government departments and back into the private 
sector.  Contracting out on the delivery of public services has 
obvious problems as it relates to freedom of information 
requests.  I suggest that there is also a creation of mistrust if 
the contracting out to these private sector companies results in 
the government's ability to say that it can no longer give this 
information because it is out of the government's hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Activities that are being delegated to industry run 
organizations that then become exempt from freedom of information 
laws are of a real concern.  One example is Nav Canada which 
provides traffic control services.  Like politics, private 
industries are very competitive and there are occasions when they 
will fiercely guard certain trade secrets.  Bids for government 
contracts would be a perfect example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crown corporations, single purpose agencies that are still 
wholly owned by the government have been created to allow for 
these formerly government controlled industries to operate. In 
some cases they operate free from access to information requests 
even when technically they are covered by the freedom of 
information laws, the thought being that compliance could decline 
as the traditional public service is fragmented.  This would 
leave them free, one would suppose, from government influence yet 
they are still being funded by the Canadian taxpayer. That 
element of taxpayer support should outweigh the government's 
ability to hide behind the supposed arm's length relationship 
they have with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There we are on the horns of the dilemma.  There is a need for 
the public to know, certainly on most occasions, but the 
government has obviously distanced itself from this obligation by 
saying it is a private sector company.  The Canada Customs and 
Revenue Agency and Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation are 
other examples of where the government has moved toward 
privatization of a formerly publicly run agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government services are run like private industries on many 
occasions.  Efficiency has improved as a result when the private 
sector enters in.  Still there is this competing issue of the 
bottom line fiscally versus the need to be accountable in the 
public sector.  This is the case in private industry as well. 
There are occasions when the government has to step in and demand 
information.  When there are issues of environmental concern and 
certainly when there are potential Criminal Code violations, then 
the government has to actively pursue even private sector 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As governments attempt to find new non-tax revenues, they may 
also undermine access rights.  An example is that several 
governments may sell information and this information would then 
be exempt from freedom of information laws regardless of the 
price. Information protected for a price undermines equal access 
to government information.

that when there is increasing demand from the public that we as 
parliamentarians be more accountable and more open in that 
regard.

picture is something the public and members of parliament 
sometimes wrestle with when it comes to an access demand.  The 
balance that must be struck is something we must constantly 
strive for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should parliament itself be subject to the scrutiny of access to 
information?  Obviously it is public money that is paying the 
salaries of individual members of parliament and I would suggest 
there is already a great deal of public scrutiny toward members 
of parliament.  I would also suggest there is a higher degree of 
accountability on the part of the government to meet that 
obligation.  There is a higher degree of accountability when it 
comes to disclosing decisions that not all members of parliament 
have participated in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With access to information, I would suggest the Canadian public 
do have a certain degree of a right to know.  There are obviously 
occasions which have been mentioned previously, national 
security, trade secrets, the concerns that individual 
constituents might have about access to information requests that 
would affect them, those considerations are always going to be 
kept in mind by the information commissioner himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information commissioner should have the authority to review 
reasonableness for fee schedules for freedom of information 
requests.  There should also be a release if that price continues 
to be unreasonable.  There should be a release of records where 
citizens' complaints are justified.  Monitoring of the system as 
a whole is something I believe would be a very worthwhile 
exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally support the initiative of the hon. member.  I 
believe there is a huge public appetite for this type of exercise 
to occur.  If it happens in some small way, we might contribute 
to the restoration of a degree of public confidence in parliament 
and politics generally as an honourable profession.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
Motion No. 2 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the Parliament and Crown 
Agencies should be subject to scrutiny under the Access to 
Information Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is brought before the House for debate by my 
colleague, the hon. member for Red Deer, who is also our foreign 
affairs critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is access to information?  Any Canadian should be able to 
write a letter asking for information from a federal government 
agency and get that information within 30 days.  That is the 
Access to Information Act.  We should be able to see the books or 
get minutes or papers relating to why a certain decision was made 
in the administration of the policy and programs of our federal 
government and crown agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be nothing to hide about the Canadian Wheat Board, 
for example.  Canadians know about the mess this Liberal 
government either created or at least allowed surrounding the 
Somalia inquiry.  In that case documents were altered, severed, 
lost or destroyed.  Canadians will never know what really 
happened because the Liberal government did not want us to know. 
It shut down the Somalia inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We use access to information to track the Liberal government's 
mismanagement of the expenditure of our tax dollars. The Somalia 
debacle is the prime example of the importance of the Access to 
Information Act.  A CBC reporter using access to information 
received two copies of the same documents from national defence. 
The copies were different but they were supposed to be the same 
documents.  The Somalia inquiry is a very sad chapter in Canadian 
history in terms of the Liberal Party's lack of respect for 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our access to information laws should be reviewed and 
strengthened.  That is what this motion is asking.  We should 
constantly be pursuing a freer and more democratic government and 
society.  That is what the official opposition is trying to 
accomplish with this motion. 
We should not risk our national security, but we should try to be 
as transparent and open with the Canadian taxpayers as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian taxpayer finances federal government endeavours. 
Where are the details?  Why are the details concerning the 
expenses of the operation of the Canadian parliament not covered 
by ATI?  That is a big question.  Why are other important 
agencies protected?  We need to know that.  That is why we are 
debating Motion No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals could have taken action concerning this matter as 
soon as they saw that my colleague's Motion No. 2 was on the 
order paper.  Rather, he had to wait for the lucky draw for his 
motion to be debated.  The Liberals forced the debate to take 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another way the Liberals could have proceeded.  If the 
Liberals had looked through the lens of issues and not through 
the lens of political stripes, they would have read Motion No. 2 
and done something about it.  However we know they do not do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is forcing the government to talk about 
accountability as it relates to crown agencies as well as 
parliament.  There should not be a Liberal in the House who would 
oppose my colleague's motion.  Every Liberal should want their 
constituents to have access to information concerning crown 
agencies and parliament.  As our federal government contracts out 
more and more work, the records of these contracts become more 
and more important.  We need access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the Prime Minister strangle a taxpayer.  We heard 
him talk about an imaginary friend.  We have seen him apparently 
throw away the rights of Canadian university students in favour 
of a foreign dictator.  Most recently we saw all parties in the 
House, including the Liberals, agree to televise all House of 
Commons committees.  Yet the Prime Minister and the elite 
Liberals do not want it to happen.  Maybe the report on televised 
committee sittings is in the same place where Motion No. 2 was 
before the member for Red Deer forced the Liberals to take it off 
the shelf and debate it in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The democratic record of the government is abysmal.  Members 
across the way should be ashamed of their record on democracy. 
They have moved closure or time allocation to limit debate in the 
House more than 52 times.  The government does not like the 
democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was deputy critic for foreign affairs I tracked the 
shenanigans at the Canadian International Development Agency, 
CIDA.  When my staff requested studies from CIDA, ATI requests 
came back saying “no such study was ever done”.  Did CIDA 
change the name of the study?  Or, was there really no such 
study?  It is difficult to tell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our ATI laws are so weak it is difficult to know the facts 
and the truth.  It makes it difficult to track the government, to 
hold the government accountable, to make the government more 
efficient, to find out where our money is being spent, where 
there is duplication and where there is waste.  Canadians have 
the right to know what is happening with their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all wrong.  It should be easy to track the government so 
we can be proud of our record and proud of the way the government 
is run.  In conclusion, I urge members of the House to support 
Motion No. 2 and let us ensure that the Liberal government does 
not continue to make a mockery of democracy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, when we talk about access to information what we are 
really talking about in the final analysis is the good of the 
general public but very specifically the need for the watchdogs 
of government, parliamentarians and the media to be able to have 
the instruments and the tools to scrutinize government to make 
sure it is honest and efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly that is the role of both backbench government MPs and 
opposition MPs.  We need good information.  We have to be able to 
get that information from government so we can do our job.

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same with the media.  The media must have the tools of 
good freedom of information legislation in order to do its job 
for all Canadians and for parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of the media I cannot tell of my surprise when 
after the member for Red Deer submitted his earlier bill, Bill 
C-216 that would do the same thing, open up crown corporations, I 
received a letter in November 1997 from the chief operating 
officer of the CBC, in which the chief operating officer appealed 
to me as a member of parliament—and I imagine this letter went 
to every other member of parliament—to resist Bill C-216 because 
it threatened the independence of the CBC under the Broadcasting 
Act and it threatened journalistic integrity and it threatened 
the CBC's competitive position.  The CBC, we understand, is a 
billion dollar plus crown agency operating primarily on 
government funds, so I was surprised by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former journalist I fired a letter back very quickly in 
which I said to the chief operating officer of the CBC that as a 
former journalist I knew that his concerns were unwarranted and 
that in fact I myself had a private member's bill, Bill C-264, 
which put in enhanced protections to corporations and 
organizations like parliamentarians and the CBC in the sense that 
Privacy Act considerations would prevent any damage to 
journalistic integrity, and that he had no fear of losing the 
independence in the Broadcasting Act simply because the CBC would 
be required to disclose its administrative procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a huge issue here.  As I pointed out to the chief 
operating officer of the CBC, the issue here is that it is the 
one organization in the country that is completely outside any 
kind of government scrutiny even though it gets money from the 
government.  We cannot see any of the salaries in the CBC, as I 
explained to the chief operating officer.  We cannot see any 
mismanagement in the CBC, as I explained to the chief operating 
officer.  We cannot even see nepotism in the CBC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as parliamentarians are subject to all kinds of scrutiny. 
When we undertake patronage, which is the source of all kinds of 
controversy in the country and which the opposition is constantly 
attacking the government on, we are talking about a form of 
nepotism that is at least public.  In the CBC we can see none of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote him back and got a letter back from him again.  He 
simply said that he was sorry, that the CBC's administrative 
procedures must remain secret because exposing CBC records under 
the access rules for administrative purposes would in fact expose 
all CBC records whether gathered for administrative, creative, 
journalistic or programming purposes.  That is not true, not true 
at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote to Peter Mansbridge, one of the top journalists in this 
country.  In my letter I said “Peter, as a journalist would you 
disclose your salary as an example to the rest of the CBC to show 
that you as a journalist believe in the principles of access to 
information”.  He wrote me back a letter in which he said 
“Given the kind of scrutiny, both real and imagined, that public 
figures are faced with in this country, there are few things that 
remain private.  In my case I am fortunate that my employer 
chooses to at least keep my salary details private”. And so it 
goes.  The top journalist in the country, while he demands 
transparency and accountability of parliamentarians, is not 
prepared to submit to it himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the journalism community is not prepared to have the same 
kind of transparency it demands and asks of government, then it 
should not criticize those bureaucrats who are afraid of the type 
of legislation we all know is very necessary in this country for 
the efficiency and honesty of this country.  I say to the member 
for Red Deer, way to go. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank 
all members who have spoken today, in particular the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington for his example.  That example is probably 
what it is all about.  While there are many things I would like 
to say in conclusion, I think that says it all. 
While the member was talking about the CBC, I could make exactly 
the same statements about the wheat board and other crown 
corporations in my constituency.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While working on this for some six years now, I discovered that 
the criteria for a crown corporation being subject to the Access 
to Information Act was not under the jurisdiction of the 
information commissioner or the justice department, but under the 
jurisdiction of the governor in council.  In other words, the 
cabinet decides which crown corporations are subject to the 
Access to Information Act and which ones are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that in a day when we pride ourselves on being 
democratic and when we pride ourselves on going around the world 
democratizing other countries, that it is acceptable to have our 
openness subject to the decision of just the cabinet.  As we have 
more crown corporations because of government downsizing, it is 
time to open this up.  Yes, we should protect competitiveness and 
those kinds of things, but that is a lame excuse for not having 
crown corporations open to the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 I was told by the then justice minister that this was 
about to be changed.  I was not to worry.  We would not have to 
work on access to information for more than another year and it 
would all be opened up.  That has not happened.  We are still 
waiting. Canadians are waiting.  As we into the 21st century, I 
think it is critical that government open up and let people know 
what in fact their tax dollars are being spent on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The time provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired 
and the order is dropped from the order paper.
