<P>
	The report, entitled <I>It's About Our Health! Towards Pollution

member's bill entitled an act respecting social insurance 
numbers.
<P>
	In introducing this bill, I would like members of the House to 
note the federal government has never placed controls on the use 
of the social insurance numbers by other levels of government or 
by the private sector. The private sector may currently deny a 
service to an individual who refuses to divulge his or her social 
insurance number.
<P>
	This bill would require other levels of government and the 
private sector to state exactly why this information is needed 
and will give an individual an opportunity to refuse to divulge 
his or her social insurance number unless required by federal 
statute to do so.
<P>
	The bill would also impose penalties on groups, individuals, 
agencies or businesses which divulge another person's social 
insurance number without that person's consent.

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to introduce 
this private member's bill which I have called the taxpayers bill 
of rights. The actions of Revenue Canada are often consistent 
and fair but from time to time the administrative practices get 
out of hand, so much so that one of my constituents actually 
suffered a heart attack over some of the actions taken by 
Revenue Canada. Things like rights of seizure without proper 
notice and arbitrary change of collection arrangements are only 
some of the aspects which the bill deals with.
<P>
	Most important, it creates an ombudsman who will act as a 
buffer between taxpayers and Revenue Canada.

Canadians we often use warning labels on items such as 
cigarettes, antihistamines, cleaners, bags and other items which 
may affect the health of Canadians. This does not apply to 
alcoholic beverages and this bill seeks to have a warning label,

	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple

present from residents of my riding, pursuant to Standing Order 
36. It has been duly certified by the clerk of petitions.
<P>
	The petitioners state that since the Bloc Quebecois has 
publicly dedicated itself to a disloyal objective, since it is 
comprised solely of members elected from one province and 
since the Reform Party represents constituencies in five 
provinces and has constituency associations in every province 
of Canada, the current situation is a travesty on the institution of 
Parliament. The petitioners therefore call on Parliament to 
preserve Canadian unity, parliamentary tradition and protect the 
rights of all Canadians by prevailing on the Speaker of the 
House to recognize the Reform Party of Canada as the official 
opposition.

	The first petition concerns the use of the legal defence that has 
become known as the drunk offence. The petitioners believe that 
in committing the act of choosing to consume alcohol, the 
individual must also accept all the responsibility for his or her 
actions while under the influence.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> The second petition 
is about the subject of the family.
<P>
	The petitioners request that Parliament oppose any legislation 
that would redefine family, including the provision of marriage 
and family benefits to those who are not related by ties of blood, 
marriage or adoption where marriage is defined as the legal 
union between a man and a woman.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

petition is on the subject of sexual orientation. The petitioners 
request that the Government of Canada not amend the Canadian 
Human Rights Act to include the phrase sexual orientation.
<P>
	The petitioners fear that such an inclusion could lead to 
homosexuals receiving the same benefits and privileges as 
married people.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I wish to present a petition that is 
circulating across Canada.
<P>
	This petition comes from Alberta and also from Windsor, 
Ontario. The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of 
the House that managing the family home and caring for 
preschool children is an honourable profession that has not been 
recognized for its value to society.
<P>
	They also state that the Income Tax Act discriminates against 
families that make the choice to provide care in the home to 
preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to 
pursue initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against 
families that decide to provide care in the home for preschool 
children, the disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANDAIRYCOMMISSIONACT">CANADIAN DAIRY COMMISSION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-86, an act to amend the 
Canadian Dairy Commission Act, be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take a few minutes this morning to add some final thoughts to 
the consideration by the House to Bill C-86, an act to amend the 
Canadian Dairy Commission Act, and reaffirm my support and 
the support of the government for this industry driven initiative. 
I am pleased to say that the bill reaffirms the support of the 
House of an industry driven initiative.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	As my colleagues from all sides of the House have 
acknowledged, the Canadian dairy industry will not be 
untouched by the global market transformation under way. The 
Canadian dairy, egg and poultry industries or the supply 
managed industries are evolving in ways that are necessary to 
meet the global market transformation that is in progress. I am 
proud and pleased in the way in which they are doing that. They 
have shown in the past they can roll with the punches. They can 
evolve as necessary to maintain economically viable industries 
that provide safe food in sufficient quantities to the Canadian 
consumer.
<P>
	Major changes are now reverberating throughout the 
economic sectors of the world's major trading nations. That is 
not an exaggeration. Competition is and will be fierce. However, 
opportunities for success are at hand. In order to take advantage 
of those opportunities, changes will be required in the way we do 
business.
<P>
	Bill C-86 represents one of the best of these changes. The new 
milk pricing and pooling of returns approach enabled by these 
legislative amendments evolved from within the industry itself. 
That is what it is all about.
<P>
	The new system was developed as a result of intense 
consultations with a good deal of give and take. These give and 
take negotiations among the dairy stakeholders took place from 
coast to coast. These discussions remain ongoing as the dairy 
sector fine tunes and reshapes the way milk and milk 
components are sold both within and outside of our borders over 
the next five years and beyond.
<P>
	The administration of pricing and the pooling of milk 
marketing returns by the Canadian Dairy Commission and 
provincial authorities offers significant advantages. It will 
permit retention of the equity currently offered by levies while 
allowing us to keep and possibly expand important domestic and 
export markets in the face of strict new rules under GATT and 
the World Trade Organization.
<P>
	While the possibility of a trade challenge by the United States 
can never be categorically ruled out, Canadian trade officials 
have advised that as long as Canada does not use producer 
financed assistance to support exports of Canadian dairy 
products to the United States, as long as Canada does not use 
levies beyond the levels of gradual reduction for export of 
commodity specific groups, our system will then conform with 
the provisions of the international agreements we have signed. 
August 1 is the date of implementation of Canada's dairy 
commitment under GATT and the WTO arrangements.
<P>
	It is important to emphasize again that this is an industry 
driven initiative which is shaping its future on this key issue. 
While governments will continue to have an important role to 
play, that role is facilitative. The shaping process is an ongoing 
one and the passage of the amendments now before us will assist 
the process. It will not define the process. It will not limit the 
process nor will it hinder the process with over-regulation
<P>
	This bill provides the necessary legislative authority to 
permit the Canadian Dairy Commission, in close co-operation 
with the provincial milk marketing authorities, to implement a 
new milk pricing system with the pooling and market returns 
from different classes of milk.
<P>
	I wish to remind all members that under the pooling 
arrangements, the Canadian Dairy Commission will simply be 
administering a pool of producer moneys on behalf of the 
producers. No government financing is involved.
<P>
	Bill C-86 is enabling legislation which does not specifically 
define the extent or timing of a particular milk pooling system or 
systems. The dairy industry will do this for itself in the weeks 
and the months ahead.
<P>
	With the passage of the bill most aspects of the new dairy 
approach will be implemented on a national basis within the 
next two months. Negotiations remain ongoing in all nine 
provinces. It is only nine provinces because Newfoundland is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14191"> 14191 </A></B>
<P>
not part of the national milk supply management system as it 
produces only a limited amount of industrial milk. The other 
nine provinces have agreed  to a national pooling of market 
returns from special classes of milk as of August 1 of this year.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	These nine provinces have also agreed to a harmonized milk 
classification system and all nine provinces have agreed to 
implement uniform pricing for special classes of milk destined 
for United States export and for certain domestic products 
containing diary ingredients.
<P>
	Six of the nine provinces, namely Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, 
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island have 
decided to proceed more immediately to the pooling of market 
returns for all classes of milk. British Columbia may join this 
broader pooling arrangement as well and it is still considering 
the option.
<P>
	Alberta and Saskatchewan have indicated that they wish to 
implement pooling arrangements on a more limited scale. At the 
outset nothing precludes their joining the all milk pool at any 
point in the future.
<P>
	Again, I urge my fellow members to fully support and 
expedite the passage of Bill C-86. Such action will clearly 
demonstrate our recognition of the dairy sector's commendable 
initiatives. As well, it will demonstrate our willingness to 
facilitate this industry driven means of successfully competing 
in the post-GATT environment.
<P>
	We look forward to the support of the House in expediting this 
bill for the good of the industry.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a privilege and an honour for me to speak this morning on a bill 
that is extremely important to Quebec farmers, particularly 
dairy producers.
<P>
	It is also an honour to speak immediately after the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, the member for Prince Edward-Hastings, who 
really is quite familiar with agriculture.
<P>
	As you know, Quebec alone produces 47.5 per cent of 
industrial milk. Furthermore, Quebec has always played a 
leading role in Canada's dairy industry. Quebec does a very 
good job of carrying out its responsibility as a leader among the 
other provinces where milk is still produced in Canada.
<P>
	Canada's present dairy product supply management system 
was initiated by Quebec residents. Without the determination of 
Quebec dairy producers in the 1970s, we would not have supply 
management in this industry and, let me tell you, it would be an 
indescribable mess.
<P>
	I am therefore especially pleased to note that the constituency 
of Frontenac has over 15 per cent of farm producers, the vast 
majority of whom are dairy producers.
<P>
	Since we have been discussing Bill C-86 in this House, we 
have addressed the possibility of changing the Canadian Dairy 
Commission to a standing committee. Recently, on June 8, we 
had a chance to hear people who have worked very hard to 
ensure that this proposed change does benefit the dairy industry 
in Quebec and Canada, particularly our dairy producers. So it 
was that we met Claude Richard, president of the Fédération des 
producteurs de lait du Québec; his counterpart from Ontario, 
John Cor; and Richard Doyle of the Dairy Farmers of Canada.
<P>
	I also visited a great many dairy producers in the 
Saint-Hyacinthe area: the Martins, the St Laurents, the Gouins, 
the Vigneaults, the Barils, the Pellerins, the Lessards, the 
Poulins and the Loiselles.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	These farmers explained to us once again the ins and outs of 
Bill C-86 that will allow the six provinces to come to an 
agreement.
<P>
	In light of that information and the answers we have obtained 
to our questions, I am able today to reiterate to my colleague 
opposite that the Bloc Quebecois supports Bill C-86.
<P>
	Without rereading Bill C-86 in detail or clause by clause, I do 
want to explain what the change consists of, and note that the 
dairy industry has been required to adjust rapidly to the context 
of the free trade agreements. The GATT negotiations in Geneva, 
and the campaign to defend article XI, as well as the discussions 
about the relevance of maintaining a supply management 
system, have indicated major upheavals to come in the dairy 
industry. Clearly, Canada's dairy producers had to find a 
solution quickly if they were to be competitive in the context of 
free trade and the globalization of markets. The challenge was a 
big one.
<P>
	Bill C-86 will make it possible to implement the agreement 
signed by the six provinces-Prince Edward Island, New 
Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba-, 
which, I remind you, produce over 82 per cent of all milk in 
Canada. This agreement is a solution that will maintain our 
system and comply with the new requirements of the GATT and 
NAFTA.
<P>
	Pursuant to the GATT definition of an export subsidy, under 
the free trade agreement, dairy producers must eliminate their 
system of export levies by August 1. That is the problem Bill 
C-86 solves by making changes to the Canadian Dairy 
Commission Act.
<P>
	At present, producers of industrial milk pay a levy of 
approximately three dollars per hectolitre of industrial milk that 
is to be exported, mainly in the form of butter and skim milk 
powder. If we make a quick calculation, three dollars per 
hectolitre is three cents per litre, which  represents 
approximately 7.5 per cent of the value of the milk and which 
each producer of industrial milk used to pay in order to promote 
exports.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14192"> 14192 </A></B>
<P>
	Even though it comes out of the producers' pockets, not out of 
public funds, under the GATT and the free trade agreement, that 
levy is an export subsidy and, as such, illegal. Starting on 
August 1, GATT and our partners in the free trade agreement 
would not have accepted our continuing to operate in that way.
<P>
	More specifically, this bill implements a national system for 
pooling market returns that will be used to support the export of 
dairy products. The pooling permitted under Bill C-86 will 
comply with the international agreements, while allowing 
producers to maintain the advantages of the present system.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	However, we must be aware that there is a possibility that the 
United States, which is challenging anything and everything 
these days, may decide to challenge this two-price policy for 
milk: one price for milk for the domestic market, and one price 
for milk destined for export. In that case, the dairy industry in 
Quebec and Canada could be accused of dumping.
<P>
	In order to be successful, however, the United States or the 
country that considered its interests harmed would have to prove 
that exports from Canada were harming its market. Since our 
exports are relatively small, and since we export an increasing 
proportion of value-added processed products, that harm may 
be very difficult to prove. Bill C-86, which we are discussing 
today on third reading, is the solution that will enable producers 
to face the upheavals in their industry resulting from the new 
international context.
<P>
	We, the MPs of the Bloc Quebecois, therefore support Bill 
C-86, since it meets the needs of producers who want to adjust 
to the requirements of the international trade agreements signed 
by Canada. Of course there are certain shortcomings in this bill; 
in-depth discussions are going on, in Quebec at least. 
Apparently the bill is creating a bit of a problem for processors. 
The discussions are not sticking on dozens of points, only on a 
few specific ones, and in a few days there should be-at least we 
hope there will be-an agreement between the Quebec 
department of agriculture, the UPA, the federation, and the 
Canadian Dairy Commission.
<P>
	At present, the dairy industry is managed partly by the 
provinces and partly by the federal government, as are many 
industries that appear to have two heads. In these cases, of 
course, two heads are often not better than one. At present, the 
provinces have jurisdiction over fluid milk, and the Canadian 
Dairy Commission has jurisdiction over industrial milk only. 
The bill provides for a delegation of powers between the 
Commission and the provinces in order to administer the pooled 
market returns. If the agreement were not signed, the 
Commission would administer the pooled market returns for 
industrial milk only.
<P>
	Those, then, are the technical changes made to the Canadian 
Dairy Commission by Bill C-86; I call them technical changes 
because they are regulations that will allow dairy producers to 
achieve their objective of adjusting the system as we now know 
it to the new standards of our international commitments, such 
as the GATT and NAFTA.
<P>
	Mainly, we must remember that six provinces have signed an 
agreement in principle to pool their entire milk supply system. 
The initiative comes from the dairy industry; that point must be 
emphasized. The initative comes from the dairy industry, whose 
producers decided that they had to take the necessary action in 
order to make the most of the resources available to the dairy 
industry. The distinction made between industrial milk and fluid 
milk will be eliminated; the provinces' present quotas will not 
be changed.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	I am particularly proud to state in this House that the concept 
of single-price milk was initiated in my region, the Eastern 
Townships, and that the then president of the federation in 
Sherbrooke was Jacques Blais.
<P>
	I remember very clearly indeed the initial meetings, at which 
people wanted very serious discussion of a future single price 
for fluid milk and industrial milk. Those discussions were 
lively-and sometimes even physical. I attended one of those 
meetings and I certainly was not at ease. Those farmers had 
some powerful arguments. The Eastern Townships played a 
pioneering role in this debate.
<P>
	It should be noted that, at the time, there was a difference of 
more than 10 per cent between the prices for fluid milk and 
industrial milk. It was practically the same milk. At the time, the 
farmers were told: streamline your operations; become more 
productive and more competitive; lower your production costs. 
And they did.
<P>
	At the time, you could encounter three tank trucks on the same 
concession road, which might have only three dairy producers 
along it. You could see a truck for fluid milk, a second truck for 
industrial milk belonging to the Coopérative fédérée, and a third 
truck that might belong to an independent company like 
Lactantia, for example.
<P>
	Today on that concession road, there are still only three dairy 
producers, but only one truck. So we have managed to reduce 
transportation costs. Fluid milk, the price of which, as I was 
saying, was 10 per cent higher, is now carried in the same truck. 
I can even tell you that the same cows, the same milk, and the 
same consumers are involved, and so, 13 or 14 months from 
now, the price should be exactly the same.
<P>
	I have here a document showing Quebec's dairy production, 
from 1950 to 1994, in fact. In 1994, there were 11,763 dairy 
producers in Quebec. These 11,000 dairy producers produce 
pretty well the same volume of milk as was produced in 1970. 
But wait a minute. In 1970 there were 43,669 dairy producers. 
That means that, with one quarter of the number of dairy 
producers, we  are producing practically the same volume of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14193"> 14193 </A></B>
<P>
milk. Better yet. If I take one cow as an example-I am sure the 
member for Drummond will be pleased-, in 1970, the average 
cow in our herds in Quebec produced 3,324 litres of milk per 
year-and without hormomes, without being shot up, just 
through improved breeding and better livestock feed. Look at 
this: in 24 years, the average cow in Quebec has gone from 
producing 3,324 litres of milk to producing 5,336 litres. The 
figure has not doubled, but it is at least 75 per cent higher.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	I was reading in <I>La terre de chez nous</I>, the magazine for 
Quebec farmers, that a 3 per cent production increase was 
anticipated for the current year. So it is possible to up the 
quantity of milk given by our dairy cows each year without 
``boosting'' or shooting them up, without altering the milk, 
without risking animal and human health.
<P>
	I would remind you that the milk produced in Quebec and in 
Canada is a credit to us. We have some of the cleanest, freshest 
milk in the world. Within minutes of leaving the cow's udder it 
has already been refrigerated to a temperature where it can be 
properly kept. We are proud of that. Our facilities prove beyond 
the shadow of a doubt that without exaggeration we can increase 
milk production by 3 per cent without increasing the size of our 
herds.
<P>
	The farmers in my riding tell me that if their milk quotas 
could be upped by 10 per cent per year, they could meet the 
demand without having to struggle.
<P>
	What would give me the greatest pleasure would be if all our 
farmers in Quebec could have a chance to read the text, or a part 
of the text, that we received a copy of on June 2, 1995, signed by 
an Assistant Deputy Minister at the federal Department of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food. It was a copy of a letter addressed to 
the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Bob Speller; it is signed by J.B. Morrissey.
<P>
	A question had been raised by my colleague, the honourable 
member for Champlain, Réjean Lefebvre of the Bloc Quebecois, 
and I'm going to read you a sentence from it: `` -with respect to 
expenditures on primary agricultural research relative to 
research into finished agrifood products, for a period going from 
1990 to roughly 1998, the projections, as Table I shows-''
<P>
	Quebec's farmers are responsible, in terms of Canada as a 
whole, for about 18 to 19 per cent of agricultural production. 
Quebec has about 24 per cent of the population and it pays 
between 23 and 24 per cent of Canada's income taxes.
<P>
	And at this point I would hope that the farmers in my riding 
are listening closely, when I talk about the share that this 
government-and when I say ``this government'' I do not 
necessarily mean the party currently in power. Quebec 
agriculture has always been shafted by the federal system and I 
have another  egregious case here, where Quebec has been 
cheated year after year.
<P>
	For instance, in terms of the resources allocated to full-time 
equivalents in research and development, Quebec in 1990-91 
received 12.4 per cent of the total research and development 
budget allocated among all the provinces by Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada. In 1991-92 we got even less, and that was 
under the Conservatives, which is why I say that it is not 
necessarily the current government. In 1991-92 the 
Conservatives gave us 12.04 per cent of the total, or let us say 12 
per cent.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	I would remind you that Quebec's relative participation in this 
Department's activities is from 17 to 19 per cent, so we are being 
cheated out of 5 per cent every year. The pattern is the same right 
up to 1995-96, the current year, where Quebec's share is 13 per 
cent. At 13 per cent, we are still having a minimum of 4 per cent 
in research and development resources stolen from us.
<P>
	It is not the sovereignists, the Pequistes, the Bloquistes, who 
are inventing these figures. This is an official document. I see 
here the logo of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and it is 
signed by an Assistant Deputy Minister of that department.
<P>
	In October 1993, when I was campaigning during the last 
election, I said to the people of my riding, ``Send us to Ottawa. 
We will audit the books and we will come back and tell you what 
we find. If they are giving us too much money, we will tell you 
that and we will give it back to them. We will be honest with the 
rest of the country''. This document from Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada that I have just read to you has its 
equivalents in all the departments.
<P>
	Quebec's farmers have to understand that the federal 
government is not necessarily the modern Messiah. The federal 
government serves western agriculture well, but when the time 
comes for it to serve agriculture in Quebec and the Maritimes, 
there is nothing left in the coffers.
<P>
	Here is another example. In the Magdalen Islands, the UPA 
arranged for a special quota so that the Islands could be 
self-sufficient in egg production. A special quota was awarded 
to an egg producer in Etang-du-Nord. Now that assistance to 
eastern grain transportation is being abolished, the price that 
this egg producer will have to pay for meal will shoot up by over 
$50 a tonne. Is it going to be more cost-effective for the 
Magdalen Islanders to import eggs from the mainland or to 
continue to import meal?
<P>
	Many more crazy situations like that can be found in Quebec. 
No, the federal government is not a Messiah, and when 
Quebecers want information or help they head first for the 
Quebec Ministry of Agriculture. Last week I just asked a 
number of farmers whether they knew the name of Quebec's 
Minister of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14194"> 14194 </A></B>
<P>
Agriculture. Eight out of ten of them could name him, but not 
one out of ten could name the federal Minister-he is 
completely  unknown. When people do know his name, they 
massacre it so that if you did not know it yourself you would not 
be able to decipher it.
<P>
	It is a pity to have two Ministers of Agriculture for the same 
farmer, the same cows. One of those ministers is very expensive 
to keep and never, ever, gives Quebec the share to which it is 
entitled.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Whether you look at it in terms of Quebec's proportion of the 
population, which is 24 per cent of the Canadian total, or in 
terms of the percentage of income tax we pay to Ottawa, or in 
terms of GDP directly related to agriculture, Quebec is not 
getting its fair share.
<P>
	Worse still, it is the taxes Quebecers are paying to the federal 
government that are paying, compensating, the western grain 
producers so that they can diversify and compete against us in 
our own province, and we are paying with our money for the 
privilege of getting booted on the backside. You all know that 80 
per cent of Quebec's farmers are in livestock production. When I 
say livestock production, of course I include eggs and dairy 
production, because to get eggs you have to raise hens.
<P>
	The opposite holds true in the west. There it is grain 
production that predominates. But diversification is changing 
the stakes. Obviously it is easier to work six or seven months a 
year and then to garage the machinery and wait for spring to start 
work again, crops and seed-if you raise livestock, it is not five 
days a week, it is seven out of seven, 365 days a year. It would be 
unthinkable for any of our dairy farmers or egg producers in 
Quebec to treat themselves to vacations in the south the way 
some of those western grain farmers can, for two or three 
months, you will agree with me on that.
<P>
	So it is a choice, and the choice has been entirely decided by 
successive governments in Ottawa. Eastern Canada, Quebec, 
Ontario and the Maritimes, were directed into livestock 
production while the west grew grain; that was the arrangement 
and it was accepted. The building of the railway that tied the 
country together was of course done to satisfy the farmers.
<P>
	So the dairy farmers know what a fair deal is, and in the 
budget and in Bill C-76, which passed a couple of days ago, we 
identified unfairnesses and we criticized them in this House on 
more than one occasion, such as the way the industrial milk 
subsidy is being cut by 30 per cent, in two 15 per cent cuts. The 
budget makes it clear that the remaining 70 per cent will be done 
away with sooner or later. No compensation is provided for, no 
$300 or $400 million is going into an adjustment fund for our 
farmers, to help them change direction.
<P>
	In August our farmers will be going on a pilgrimage to the 
Canadian Dairy Commission to request an increase to 
compensate for the subsidy cuts. The result will be that you the 
consumers will be paying more for milk, butter, cheese, yoghurt, 
ice cream. Just as with gasoline, the increase will be greater than 
the increase in the cost of living. The government is washing its 
hands of the whole affair and saying, ``Oh, we are not raising 
taxes. The prices of butter and cheese and yogurt and ice cream 
are going up, and gasoline taxes are pushing up the cost of 
gasoline''. And it proudly announces, ``We have not raised 
anything''. The consumer price index is going up by 2.9 per 
cent. There has not been an increase like it in four years.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	We are very comfortably installed in this House or elsewhere 
in Canada discussing the benefits of the pooling arrangement 
agreement reached by six provinces, but the negotiations that 
led to the agreement should not be left unmentioned. I want once 
again to emphasize the hard work done by people from my 
region, as Quebec had a strong voice in the negotiations, 
particularly the Fédération des producteurs de lait du Québec 
and its president, Claude Rivard, its vice-president, Jean 
Grégoire, and their senior economist, Guylaine Gosselin.
<P>
	One question came up repeatedly during the committee's 
hearings, and that was: why have only six provinces joined the 
pooling agreement? We were told that certain provinces were 
taking advantage of the opportunity to get the CDC to review the 
way it treats them, that others did not operate the same way at 
the provincial level and that the jump involved in pooling all 
their milk with the other provinces was too great. But the most 
interesting thing to emerge from the discussions was that these 
six provinces are powerful enough without the rest, because they 
represent, as I mentioned earlier, 82 per cent of total milk 
production. So the other provinces can always join later, and 
their abstaining, at the moment, will not jeopardize the success 
of the agreement as it now stands.
<P>
	This historic agreement will have a much more far-reaching 
impact than appears at first glance. If we take the example of 
Quebec, in 1996 the dairy producers should enjoy an increase in 
income varying from 60 to 70 cents per hectolitre. And because 
of GATT, Canada will have to accept imports of butter this year, 
which will probably affect quotas.
<P>
	Since the six provinces will be spreading out the market 
variations over all the milk produced, the impact will not be felt 
too strongly, because it will not be just one province that has to 
absorb the costs. More clearly, if there were to be more butter or 
cheese imported into Canada from other GATT members, each 
of the provinces could see its quota drop by, say, 1 per cent. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14195"> 14195 </A></B>
<P>
would not be just one province that was affected. The same thing 
would happen if, for example, consumption,  or our exports, 
went up: it would not be just one province that saw its quota 
increase but all the provinces.
<P>
	I could perhaps remind you that under this agreement dairy 
quotas will no longer be confined to one province. A dairy 
farmer in Quebec could buy an Ontario quota, or a Nova Scotia 
quota, or he could sell his quota in Alberta. And if ever too great 
a proportion of our quota were to go outside the province, the 
province could withdraw for a year or for the current year, as 
soon as 1 per cent was reached. So no province could have more 
than 1 per cent of its quota siphoned off, unless it was willing to 
sell its quota to other provinces.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to recall the political context that 
underlay the signing of this agreement. This kind of 
arrangement may well turn out to be a prototype for similar 
agreements in other sectors, since its basis is the one that is 
likely to predominate in the years to come. Why? Because it is 
an economic agreement.
<P>
	The agreement banks on the advantages that all partners will 
derive from working as a team. With a referendum coming up 
this very year, the producers in many provinces have not 
hesitated to enter into an association with Quebec, because it is 
in their best interests. When it comes down to reality, not some 
hypothetical disaster situation, it is clear that logic counts for 
more than political considerations.
<P>
	Rest assured that our prize cow in the Plessisville region will 
still be a prize cow, even after a ``Yes'' vote in the referendum. 
There are those who would like to frighten people by saying, 
``Your quotas will not be worth anything, your cows will get 
mastitis, they will injure themselves grazing, they will have 
more trouble calving in the spring''. These are scare tactics, and 
increasingly our dairy farmers realize this.
<P>
	One scare tactic the federalists use a lot is saying that if 
Quebec becomes sovereign, its producers will immediately lose 
their sale quotas in Canada: that is not true.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say that the Bloc Quebecois is 
proud to be associated with Quebec's dairy producers and to 
endorse Bill C-86 in this vote at third reading, for the good of all 
dairy producers everywhere in Canada. And I hope that Canada 
will give Quebec more of a share in research and development 
funding. The people who will not go beyond 12 per cent and who 
laugh at our farmers should be ashamed of themselves, 
especially when they visit our farmers or turn up at auctions, 
Encan Lafaille for example, and swagger around trying to 
impress people and then come back here and make fun of them. 
They laugh at them and will not go beyond a miserable 12 per 
cent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vanclief:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, toward the end 
of the speech by the hon. member for Frontenac he made the 
statement that in the 1995 budget the support to the industrial 
milk producers was cut 30 per cent twice over. I wonder if the 
hon. member would like to take the opportunity to correct the 
record. It was 15 per cent each year for two years, not 30 per cent 
twice over.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary will 
know that was not a point of order as much as it was a question of 
debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I said was that 
over the next two years 30 per cent is going to be cut from the 
subsidies to industrial milk producers: 15 per cent in the 
1995-96 budget and 15 per cent in next year's budget. Fifteen 
plus fifteen equals thirty. The subsidies are being cut by 30 per 
cent. If the honourable member can prove me wrong, I will 
apologize to the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
certainly not pleased to be interrupting that interesting 
exchange, but I am here today to speak on Bill C-86, an act to 
amend the Dairy Commission Act.
<P>
	This bill is significant. It provides for the replacement of the 
existing system of levies with a system of pooling market 
returns for different classes of milk.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	The government claims the move to a pooling system will 
maintain equity among producers and will be consistent with 
Canada's international trade agreements, namely NAFTA and 
the GATT. Changes are needed to supply management to 
continue while meeting the requirements of our trade 
agreements. Dairy farmers I have talked to and others in the 
industry have told me they feel this legislation is necessary to 
allow supply management to continue under the GATT and the 
NAFTA. For this reason, I support the stated intent of this 
legislation.
<P>
	However, I do have a major concern with clause 2, which 
affects section 9 of the Dairy Commission Act. The bill extends 
the powers of the Canadian Dairy Commission and will diminish 
the authority given to the provinces under the present act. 
Therefore, to guard against this possible erosion I proposed an 
amendment that would have affected section 9 of the Dairy 
Commission Act. Last night my amendment was voted down in 
this House, which is very unfortunate.
<P>
	Once again the Liberal government has shown its desire to 
intrude in areas of provincial jurisdiction. This is one more 
move of many we have seen over the years. It is a revolt against 
this intrusion on the part of the federal government into areas of 
provincial jurisdiction that led to the existence of the Bloc 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14196"> 14196 </A></B>
<P>
Quebecois in this Parliament.  We need to move in the other 
direction and return some of the powers that belong rightfully to 
the provinces under our Constitution. This is one more move in 
the opposite direction, the wrong direction. It is another 
example of wrong thinking on the part of this Liberal 
government.
<P>
	I will take a few minutes to talk about what Bill C-86 is and 
what it does. C-86 is an act to amend the Canadian Dairy 
Commission Act. The purpose of the bill is to amend the 
Canadian Dairy Commission Act to provide for the replacement 
of the existing system of levies with a system of pooling market 
returns from different classes of milk. The government claims 
the switch to a pooling system will maintain equity among 
producers and is consistent with Canada's international trade 
agreements.
<P>
	As part of Canada's system of supply management, the 
Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee, which is 
chaired by the Canadian Dairy Commission, oversees the 
application of the national milk marketing plan. The Canadian 
Milk Supply Management Committee sets national production 
targets, establishes each province's share of the national quota, 
and exports surplus milk through planned marketing programs. 
The orderly export of surplus production is an essential element 
of ensuring the integrity of the supply management system; 
without it the system would falter.
<P>
	Currently producers assume the cost of exporting dairy 
products that are not consumed in Canada through a system of 
levies collected by provincial marketing boards and agencies as 
deductions from payments to milk producers. Once remitted to 
the commission, these levies are used to finance special 
programs intended to increase the domestic use of dairy 
products and to cover the commission's administrative costs. 
During the 1993-94 year a total of $141.5 million was collected 
from the industrial and fluid milk sectors. Such levies, however, 
are now considered to be a form of export subsidy under the new 
GATT deal and must be reduced or modified.
<P>
	I have a few observations on Bill C-86. Through this bill 
Canada's dairy industry would abandon this established system 
of producer levies on industrial milk. The levies would be 
replaced by a system of national pooling, which allows all 
stakeholders-the farmers, the processors, and the 
commission-to equitably share the costs and benefits of 
pooling revenues and the effects of fluctuations in market size 
for both fluid and industrial milk.
<P>
	Through a system of pooling the producers who export milk 
into the U.S. would receive smaller returns for their milk, but 
the burden would still be shared by all dairy farmers across the 
country. Instead of a levy being taken off the farmers' cheques to 
subsidize exports, a national pool would achieve the same end 
since the net return to farmers would be identical. For its part, 
the processing industry would still pay a lower price for 
industrial milk than consumers pay for fluid milk.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	These amendments to the Canadian Dairy Commission Act 
add a certain amount of new pricing and funding distribution 
authority to the CDC, the Canadian Dairy Commission. 
Although the new pricing and pooling approach for milk has 
received agreement from all provinces in principle, negotiations 
are ongoing as to whether there will actually be one national 
pool, which at the moment appears very unlikely, or two 
separate pools, one for B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan together 
and the other for the other six provinces that are covered by the 
act.
<P>
	Ontario dairy farmers who supply most of the industrial milk 
to further processors and Quebec farmers who are the biggest 
exporters would receive less than other dairy farmers unless 
there was some form of national pooling. On the other hand, 
under a national pooling system, producers in the non-exporting 
provinces subsidize those who are exporting. It really amounts 
to a form of equalization payment from one sector of the 
industry to the other or from one province to the other. This is 
perhaps the biggest obstacle to achieving an agreement which 
will include all provinces for the pooling regime for all classes 
of milk.
<P>
	I would like to speak briefly about the relationship between 
Bill C-86 and the Reform Party policy and position on supply 
management and various particulars.
<P>
	Reform policy in this area has been and still is that all 
producers should be able to structure and manage their 
organizations in any manner which they believe will best serve 
their interests. The matter of regulating production and setting 
prices for products under the organization's jurisdiction is a 
producer issue which should be dealt with by farmers.
<P>
	Reformers acknowledge that the agriculture industry, 
including the supply managed sector, is moving toward a more 
competitive market driven system. We have proposed tough, 
positive measures to ensure fair competition, such as tougher 
anti-combines legislation which would help reduce the input 
costs to farmers.
<P>
	The anti-combines measures have been demonstrated in 
agriculture over the years, particularly in the fertilizer industry 
where there have been court challenges by farmers against 
companies which appeared to be price fixing. Unfortunately 
these cases drag on in court until they are eventually dropped. I 
know the last case dragged on for about 10 years and then 
eventually died.
<P>
	That is not the kind of anti-combines legislation and fair trade 
legislation we need. We need tougher action by government in 
this area. We need tougher laws first and then we need tougher 
enforcement. Canada has some of the weakest anti-combines 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14197"> 14197 </A></B>
<P>
legislation in the developed world. A stronger approach needs to 
be taken and some new policies made in this area.
<P>
	In terms of trying to reduce input costs we need fair trade 
policies which would help protect against dumping by other 
countries and which would guard against unfair subsidies in 
other countries, for example, the United States. I will speak a 
little more about this later in my presentation.
<P>
	Too often when politicians and others involved in supply 
managed industries talk about the fact that the industry is 
moving toward a more competitive type of industry-by 
competitive I mean more products will be coming in from other 
countries to compete-we forget to say that it is absolutely 
critical that the products coming in are under a fair trade 
environment. This means that where there is unfair subsidy in 
other countries, as there is in the United States in this industry, 
our government must protect against these products coming into 
our markets. Again, it is an area where government has to 
strengthen its resolve and be tougher when it comes to unfair 
trade, particularly dumping.
<P>
	Another area of Reform policy regarding this industry relates 
to general changes which will reduce government overspending 
and which will lead to lower taxes and lower input costs in the 
future. I am thinking in particular of a plan we presented in the 
taxpayers budget. I will talk about that later.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	With respect to supply management, I believe change is 
inevitable. The fact is dairy farmers will be forced to compete 
more and more with American farmers. The odds are that this 
competition will come sooner than this government is willing to 
admit. I am not saying this is what I necessarily want, but it is 
the way I see it. This is what is most likely to happen.
<P>
	The rules are changing and dairy farmers will need transition 
time in order to adapt to the more open trade of the future. This 
bill will allow a supply managed system to continue for some 
time but there is some doubt about the reality of border 
protection continuing over the long run.
<P>
	Members of the dairy commission claim this bill properly 
reflects the changes affecting dairy farmers. What the bill 
actually does is maintain the status quo. Given the fact that a 
change to supply management is inevitable, I see this as a 
problem over the long run.
<P>
	The method this government has been presenting along with 
this legislation is an area of real concern to me. Yesterday in 
debate on report stage of this bill the parliamentary secretary to 
the agriculture minister made some disparaging remarks about 
my knowledge of the dairy industry.
<P>
	I fully acknowledge that I am not a real expert in the dairy 
industry, but I am starting to realize that maybe I know a lot 
more than the parliamentary secretary does when it comes to 
acknowledging that this industry will change and that there will 
be more competition. It is important to acknowledge this so that 
farmers do get a reasonable transition time from the protection 
they have today to the reality of a more open market in the not 
too distant future. While the parliamentary secretary made some 
comments about my lack of knowledge, I believe his lack of 
publicly acknowledging the move to more open competition is 
wrong because farmers need forewarning of what is to come.
<P>
	My main concerns regarding Bill C-86 do come from the 
discussions surrounding the whole supply management area. 
They revolve around talk I have heard from the minister of 
agriculture, the parliamentary secretary, leaders of farm groups 
and farmers themselves. This discussion has generally said that 
this legislation will allow supply management in the dairy 
industry to continue in a form quite similar to the present form 
indefinitely into the future.
<P>
	This legislation would allow that, it is true, but this does not 
mean that supply management will continue in a form that is 
similar to the present system well into the future. There are 
several trade issues in particular which may lead to a lot more 
direct competition from the United States by allowing more 
access to dairy products from the Americans.
<P>
	Before I start discussing these trade issues which will have a 
substantial impact on our present supply management system I 
would like to make one thing clear. I am not talking about these 
issues because I want to see the demise of supply management or 
because Reform wants to see the demise of supply management. 
I will discuss these issues because they will have a dramatic 
impact on the dairy industry in the future.
<P>
	This discussion will provide an important service to dairy 
farmers and others in the industry. Even though this is a difficult 
message to deliver and the reaction is not always favourable, 
especially the immediate reaction, it is something that should be 
done. Reform will continue to do this and I hope this Liberal 
government will start to do it.
<P>
	Reformers have had the courage to talk about probable 
change, while the minister, the parliamentary secretary and even 
the leaders of some farm groups have publicly pretended that the 
present system will exist indefinitely. This seems a dangerous 
message to send to dairy farmers, that they will be protected 
against further competition, in particular from the American 
dairy farmers.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Publicly they hide what they privately and in small groups 
acknowledge. Change is inevitable; it is a question of how much 
and when. That is what we have to talk about. I will take a little 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14198"> 14198 </A></B>
<P>
time now to talk about why I  believe change is inevitable and 
why it may be sooner rather than later.
<P>
	The first reason is that the new GATT negotiations start in the 
year 2000. That is only five years from now. In the agreement 
there will be a lot of pressure from the Americans in particular to 
allow their products more free access to the Canadian market. 
There will be a lot of pressure, as there has been already, on our 
government to accept the freer access on the part of the 
American government. The GATT agreement and the 
negotiations starting in the year 2000 certainly will put pressure 
on the industry. Seven or eight years from now, considering the 
GATT alone, we will see an industry which will be competing 
against a lot more imported products, in particular from the 
United States.
<P>
	The more immediate threat comes from the NAFTA. The most 
immediate concern under the NAFTA agreement has to do with 
the panel decision which will be coming down within a year. If 
the panel determines that the NAFTA takes precedence over the 
GATT with respect to supply management and trade between 
Canada and the United States, then the borders will be open 
much sooner than they would be under the GATT agreement.
<P>
	In two to three years if the panel rules that the NAFTA takes 
precedence over the GATT, we could see a lot more free access 
from the United States with respect to dairy products. That is a 
much more immediate threat. It is very important for the 
government to start acknowledging it publicly in order that 
farmers get the proper transition time which they need to 
prepare for the change.
<P>
	Another possible threat under the NAFTA will come with the 
inclusion of Chile in the NAFTA group. Our Prime Minister and 
the President of the United States have said it will probably 
happen within a year. That leads me to believe that there 
probably will not be significant negotiations taking place which 
would allow Chile into the NAFTA group. There just is not time 
in a year to carry out meaningful negotiations. Therefore, I 
believe that Chile will come in under the current agreement with 
very little negotiation. Maybe that threat is not quite as 
imminent as it was a few months ago.
<P>
	There are several things which the government can do for the 
sake of dairy farmers in the dairy industry. I will talk about five.
<P>
	First, the government can acknowledge that there is a high 
probability of more access from American products and 
therefore a move to more competition. I have stated this many 
times already in my presentation today and I will continue to 
state it.
<P>
	Second, the government can help to ease the dairy farmers' 
legitimate fear that the Americans will not compete fairly unless 
they are forced to by tough action on the part of the Canadian 
government.
<P>
	Third, the government should start working toward levelling 
the playing field between Canada and the United States before 
more competition occurs.
<P>
	Fourth, the government must recognize that there are 
different concerns about change to the supply management 
system within different groups of dairy farmers. Each group 
must be listened to and asked for its recommendations as to how 
it can deal with its particular problems which will result from 
the move to more competition from imported products.
<P>
	Fifth, the government must talk about the positive side of 
opening the borders. There is a huge American market there for 
the taking and it will take a healthy attitude on the part of dairy 
farmers to ensure they take full advantage of the available 
market.
<P>
	I would like to take a few minutes now to talk about each of 
the different areas which government should be discussing with 
dairy farmers.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	First, they must acknowledge that there is a high probability 
of more access for American dairy products and therefore a 
move toward more competition. It is critical to allow or even 
encourage dairy farmers to prepare for the change, because that 
will be necessary. There will be a transition time that will be 
necessary to allow dairy farmers to compete with the 
Americans. There is no doubt that the Canadian dairy farmer can 
compete very well with the American farmer if they are given a 
level playing field to work within.
<P>
	Second, help ease the dairy farmers' legitimate fear that the 
Americans will not compete fairly unless they are forced to by 
tough action. I hear this all the time. They are afraid that dairy 
farmers who recognize-there are many now-that change is 
coming are really quite concerned that the Americans will not 
compete fairly. They say they can compete with anybody in the 
world if they are given a fair chance, but Americans do not have 
a good record of competing fairly. This is what dairy farmers tell 
me. They tell me that the American industry is highly 
subsidized, which it is, and that many of these subsidies are not 
acknowledged by the Americans themselves as subsidies, which 
is true. Some of these are the school milk program, the farm bill 
set aside program, irrigation subsidies, and on and on. There are 
an awful lot of subsidies that give the Americans an advantage, 
or will in an open border situation between Canada and the 
United States, and are not fair. These have to be dealt with.
<P>
	Third, start working toward levelling the playing field 
between Canada and the United States before more competition 
occurs. An example of this is pesticides, which are used in all 
sectors of agriculture. Over the past months, as I have been 
travelling around in southern Ontario, there is a common theme 
I have heard from farmers from the dairy industry and from 
other industries. That theme is that if we are going to compete 
we need access to pesticides and drugs very soon after the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14199"> 14199 </A></B>
<P>
Americans have access, or even before the Americans have 
access. To accommodate this, why can we not have a reciprocal 
agreement? If a pesticide or drug is given approval through the 
regulatory system of one country, then why can that not be all 
that is necessary for this product to be used in the other country?
<P>
	Both Canada and the United States have a very trusted 
regulatory system. I see absolutely no practical reason we 
cannot have an agreement between the two countries so that 
when a product is approved in one country it can be approved 
almost immediately in the other country when it is being used in 
a similar environment and for the same purpose.
<P>
	This is a common theme. This and other moves have to be 
made to level the playing field so that the Americans do not have 
access to these pesticides or drugs years before Canadian 
farmers can take advantage of these products. In the agriculture 
industry this is absolutely a critical area, which must be dealt 
with.
<P>
	Another way in which the playing field must be levelled has to 
do with the broader economic considerations. I am talking 
about, for example, tax levels. Tax levels in Canada are 
substantially higher than tax levels in the United States. This 
means that Canadian farmers are competing in an unfair way 
with American farmers because of the higher tax component of 
every dollar they earn.
<P>
	The only way, of course, this can be dealt with, that taxes can 
be lowered, is by lowering government spending and 
eliminating completely government overspending.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	Reform did present in February the taxpayers' budget, which 
was a detailed three-year plan that would eliminate government 
overspending. This plan is still a valid and sound plan. This 
Liberal government has to move toward this plan, the taxpayers' 
budget, or a similar budget over the next year so that we can 
move over the next several years toward the lowering of taxes so 
that tax levels become very similar in Canada and the United 
States and so that labour costs come into line. One of the reasons 
labour costs are higher in Canada than in the United States is 
because the tax level is so high, such a large portion of the 
paycheque goes to the taxman, the Government of Canada.
<P>
	There are these broad economic considerations that must be 
dealt with to level the playing field so that Americans are 
competing fairly with Canadians.
<P>
	The fourth area government must talk about and must deal 
with is to recognize that there are different concerns about 
change to the supply management system within different 
groups of dairy farmers. Each group must be listened to and 
asked for their recommendations.
<P>
	I would like to spend a little time now to talk about these 
different groups I have been able to identify as I met with dairy 
farmers around southern Ontario, in Alberta, and other places 
across the country. The first group I will call the older dairy 
farmers, dairy farmers who are fairly close to retirement. They 
want to hold on to their quotas. In many cases their retirement 
fund is in quota value. They know that as soon as the border 
starts to open and the Americans can send more of their product 
into the Canadian market their quota values will start to decline 
rapidly. They know that their quotas could be worth nothing in 
the not too distant future. They are concerned about that.
<P>
	I can understand that completely. Their retirement was built 
in large part on quota value, which can so quickly disappear and 
for which they have paid dearly throughout their expansion 
phase in the industry. It is a problem that will be very difficult to 
deal with, but it has to be dealt with and it has to be talked about.
<P>
	The second group I will call the middle group. They are still 
expanding in many cases. This group has in many cases 
borrowed a lot of money to buy a quota. They have a couple of 
concerns about the possible loss in quota value. The first is that 
as quota value drops, while it does mean on the positive side that 
any new expansion they bring into their business will be less 
costly, it does mean that the value of quota they may have 
financed right now will drop in value dramatically. Their 
concern is that this will make them become insolvent in their 
businesses. In some cases it will.
<P>
	Will they be undersecured by lenders? Will they because of 
lower equity levels not be able to borrow the money they need 
for expansion? These are questions that have to be dealt with and 
answered. Certainly it is different in every different dairy 
farmer's operation, but this is a common concern I have heard 
from this middle group.
<P>
	As well, this middle group will be losing some of the value, 
some of the equity they have been counting on to use in their 
retirement and indeed to help with the transition of the farm 
from this generation to the next. That concern is there with the 
middle group as well.
<P>
	In one of my past lives I worked as a farm economist. I worked 
with farmers in the business management area. I worked with 
100, 200 and 300 farmers who were in severe financial 
difficulty. Each case is gutwrenching and very difficult to deal 
with. I had to learn to separate myself from the emotional impact 
this was having on each of those families.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14200"> 14200 </A></B>
<P>
	So often in the dairy industry the difficulty started with 
paying a lot of money for quota, which provides nothing of 
productive value. It just does not improve productivity in any 
way. I saw so often where that led to the downfall of these 
operations.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	I also worked in times when there was no value to quota. In 
Alberta in the late seventies and early eighties quota had no 
value. Farmers could get into the industry. They had to buy their 
cows, their buildings, their feed, and everything else that goes 
along with the industry, but at least they did not have to buy 
quota.
<P>
	I have presented that so dairy farmers can remember that 
change has occurred in the past. Quota has lost and gained value 
in the past. In most cases dairy farmers have been able to deal 
with that, but in some cases they have not and it has led to their 
downfall.
<P>
	There is a third group of dairy farmers that is important for 
government to work with or at least listen to: the people who are 
just getting into the business. Many of them have told me they 
would be all too happy to see the supply management system 
completely disappear. In some cases the people that message is 
coming from have quite shocked me. I have been surprised 
because often their parents are in the industry and they are just 
getting in. They know this quota is a very fragile thing in terms 
of value. They know that in many cases they will not even be 
able to get into the industry because lenders know there is a real 
risk to them with a reduction in quota values.
<P>
	These young producers have said they do not want to have to 
pay for quota, something that may have no value in the not too 
distant future, and ask how they can get around that. That is the 
concern of the third group.
<P>
	I do not pretend to know how we can ever deal with the 
varying concerns of these three groups. We have to start talking 
about it and it has to be dealt with. By ignoring the problem and 
by pretending change is not going to come quickly, the 
government is putting these farmers at an unnecessary 
disadvantage. By acknowledging the problem and giving the 
transition time they can deal with the change.
<P>
	It is so important that the farmers in all three of these 
groups-break the groups down any way you like-start talking 
about some possible solutions to their problems. We need to 
know from them how we as parliamentarians can facilitate their 
solution, what we can do to help them accommodate the change 
they will be facing. That is the fourth area politicians and the 
government actually have to talk about and start dealing with.
<P>
	The fifth area is to talk about the positive side of opening the 
borders and opening competition. There is a huge American 
market there for the taking. So seldom in this discussion is that 
positive side talked about. We are always defensive. How is it 
going to hurt us? We allow the Americans to bring their products 
in to compete with ours. How are we ever going to deal with it? 
We know  the Americans are not fair traders. These are the 
comments I hear from dairy farmers, and they are legitimate 
concerns, but what about the opportunity that comes with this 
change? There is an absolutely incredible opportunity and the 
possibilities are mindboggling.
<P>
	If members think that is just some talk that is not based on 
what has happened in the past, let us talk a little about the beef 
cattle industry in Alberta. When there were problems, as there 
always are problems when moving cattle back and forth across 
that border, the cattle industry went through some rough times. 
With the signing of the first free trade agreement, western 
Canadian farmers saw the opportunity and the cattlemen saw the 
opportunity. The attitude they have is that they can compete with 
the best. And they are absolutely right.
<P>
	We have seen an industry grow in Alberta beyond what I 
would even have believed would be in the realm of possibility 10 
years ago. I would not have dreamed it. I was really concerned 
about the future of the beef industry ten years ago. Cattlemen 
said they have the opportunity, mostly it is fair trade but there 
are still some things that have to be dealt with but they are doing 
great.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	When we hear cattlemen say they are doing great, things are 
going very well. One thing farmers are not very good at is 
looking on the positive side. They like to talk about the negative 
a little more. They are very positive people but they like to talk 
and dwell a little more on the negative. I am also like that. It is 
built into me by my life as a farmer.
<P>
	I acknowledge that change is difficult. Very few people like 
change especially when it affects them directly in their lives and 
in their business. Change is a lot easier when it affects someone 
else. The change in supply management will be particularly 
difficult because it will reduce the protection that has been in the 
industry for some years, protection which has been available to 
very few businesses besides supply management.
<P>
	In the whole supply management question and in the dairy 
industry we have to talk a lot more about the positives of change 
and how we can take advantage of change. We have to talk about 
how farmers in different situations can deal with and prosper 
from change. I know, as many dairy farmers know, if farmers are 
given a fair chance to compete, which is all they ask, they will 
compete successfully.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure today to speak to Bill C-86. I will use the 
opportunity to pay tribute to the good dairy farmers of my own 
region, Fraser Valley. I will talk about the bill and some of the 
solutions the Reform Party sees to the ever changing and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14201"> 14201 </A></B>
<P>
evolving world of supply managed agricultural industries in 
Canada.
<P>
	Farmers in the Fraser Valley are among the best in the world 
not only in the diary industry but also in the poultry industry. We 
now have an ever expanding greenhouse industry.
<P>
	Instead of going into a decline as many people had predicted 
some years ago, our agriculture industry has a very bright future 
and has shown to be very innovative, creative and very willing to 
change, which is what they must be in order to survive in the 
1990s and into the next century.
<P>
	If dairy farmers in what is probably richest growing area in all 
of Canada, the Fraser Valley, are given an opportunity they will 
continue to be a major milk producer for British Columbia and 
in essence could be a major milk producer for areas around the 
world.
<P>
	I will state for the record what the bill will do. It is a change 
that will allow Canada's dairy industry to abandon its 
established system of producer levies on industrial milk. The 
levies would be replaced with a system of national pooling 
which will allow all stakeholders to equitably share the costs 
and benefits of pooling revenues and the effects of fluctuations 
in market size for both fluid and industrial milk.
<P>
	It is an evolving system from what was once allowed and 
acceptable, the idea of national levies, to a system more GATT 
sensitive into a national pooling system. That is an inevitable 
change and it can be a good thing.
<P>
	It is important for producers to know what the Reform Party's 
policy is because there has been a lot of misinformation 
circulated about it.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	The Reform policy, from our policy manual, states: ``All 
producers should be able to structure and manage their 
organizations in any manner which they believe will best serve 
their interest. The matter of regulating production and setting 
prices for products under the organization's jurisdiction is a 
producer issue and should be dealt with by producers''.
<P>
	The second part of our policy, which the previous speaker 
elaborated on at considerable length and in great detail, states: 
``Reformers acknowledge that the agricultural industry, 
including the supply managed sector, is moving toward a more 
competitive market driven system''.
<P>
	Those are two truths I campaigned on during the 1993 
election. We were up front with Canadian consumers and with 
producers about what we saw as the inevitable changes that 
would have to come to the milk production system in Canada.
<P>
	For one farmer to produce a steady supply of milk takes a lot 
of care and planning. It is not a quick fix way of going into 
business. Cattle must be purchased, sheltered and fed and all the 
machinery required is bought. Farmers need to make sure the 
cows are impregnated at a certain cycle. They must have dry 
cows at some part of the year and fresh cows at the same time  so 
that they have a steady supply of milk and so on. It takes all that 
planning. That I would even have to go through the lactation 
cycle of a cow shows the changing demographic face of Canada.
<P>
	My father and a lot of our fathers grew up with dairy cows, 
helped to milk cows and understood that whole system. That was 
a big benefit for Canadian farmers. There is a residual 
understanding, even in the House, about what it takes to be a 
farmer, especially a dairy farmer.
<P>
	It is unfortunate now, as our cities are growing and the number 
of farmers is shrinking, that more and more in the future it will 
be incumbent upon those of us who are concerned about the 
agricultural industry to take the time to explain to school 
children and to other politicians about the difficulties of farming 
and why one cannot suddenly increase milk production by 20 per 
cent or why one cannot be a miracle worker especially in the 
dairy industry. It takes some planning.
<P>
	The government has to play a role in allowing for steady and 
incremental changes to occur so that cataclysmic changes do not 
have to happen overnight. It is the role of government to provide 
that. If it fails in that role, with the understanding in general 
society, then it will have failed Canadian farmers. Therefore we 
need to make sure the government does that.
<P>
	I urge the government to not soft pedal inevitable change. It 
has to come. Those of us familiar with the agricultural industry 
want it to come in an organized fashion, not in a chaotic fashion.
<P>
	I think of our call for a triple E Senate. People might ask how 
that affects the agricultural industry. However, there is a reason 
for that. One of the reasons is to give outlying and less populated 
regions more clout in our national decision making. It will be all 
too easy in the years to come, as more and more people move to 
the mega cities and we get one big city after another along the 
Great Lakes. Even in my area of Vancouver, which is now 
expanding and pushing out to become one big city, it is 
important we have the regions and agricultural producers 
represented with some strength in Ottawa.
<P>
	One of the ways that could be done is through an elected 
Senate which would allow people from varied backgrounds to 
represent different regions.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	It would be a pleasure to know that after the bill left the House 
it would go to an upper house where four or five members from 
Saskatchewan, four or five from Manitoba, and so on, had a keen 
interest in the agricultural future of the country. It would be a 
pleasure to know the bill would be under the scrutiny of people 
who want the best for agricultural producers. That is something I 
hope the upper place will do. However, it is more difficult 
because that area is not represented in the same way as it would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14202"> 14202 </A></B>
<P>
be under a triple E Senate. If it were properly handled it could 
give a better voice to Canadian agricultural producers.
<P>
	It takes two years before a cow has a calf and freshens and 
supplies milk. The farmers therefore need to know they will 
have a market down the road for their product. A farmer can 
grow a broiler chicken in a few weeks but it takes two years to 
get the first bottle of milk in the dairy industry.
<P>
	Fluctuating demand is a problem, especially in the period 
following the second world war when producers and farmers 
could not be sure of selling their milk. There was a problem with 
a glut on the market and then a shortage. Consumers saw prices 
going up and down. That resulted in unhappy producers and 
consumers alike.
<P>
	Supply management was introduced, a uniquely Canadian 
version, and to its credit it has made the market very stable and 
has helped producers to prosper all over Canada, including in 
Quebec where 50 per cent of the industrial milk is produced. The 
industry has done well under the supply management system. I 
hope Bloc members are thinking of their dairy farmers when 
they talk about cutting off the borders from Canada.
<P>
	In any supply managed system there is a tendency to become 
stuck in one group where it has worked. If it worked well in the 
1960s and it has continued to work then it should stay the same. 
However, it cannot stay the same.
<P>
	During the election campaign I am sorry to say there were 
candidates on the Liberal side who said that if Article XI 2.(c) of 
the GATT went ahead without being strengthened and clarified 
they would lay on the railroad tracks, they would resign their 
seats if they were elected, and so on. They did not get elected in 
my area. Weeks after the election the GATT was signed without 
a strengthened and clarified Article XI 2.(c).
<P>
	The change was inevitable, as was noted in the Reform Party 
campaign. It was not an attack on the supply managed industry, 
it was an acknowledgement that change must happen and could 
be good. We went through the campaign and many of the 
innovative farmers in my area understood they would have to 
deal with the new trade realities of the 1990s.
<P>
	Farmers still must be prepared for increasing market forces 
against the traditional system of supply management. The bill 
addresses that in a small way because it talks about why we must 
change to the pooling system as opposed to keeping the old levy. 
They will not be subjected to local pressures. They will not be 
worried about an influx of cheap milk from Alberta or about 
Washington state. We are now talking about a global shift in 
trade laws which will bring global pressure on the dairy 
industry. Fluctuations in demand and supply will mean stiff 
competition down the road.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	There are many examples of how this global change is going 
to be a good one for the dairy industry. I envision a day when the 
producers of the Fraser valley will no longer make the bulk of 
their milk sales to the local consumer. However, I envision a day 
when the bulk of sales will be offshore, to markets throughout 
the developing world where our products can be marketed at a 
profit. The milk industry will expand outside our borders and 
take on the world.
<P>
	There are many examples of that. In B.C. the grape growers 
were afraid their industry would be swallowed up. Remember a 
few years ago when the grape industry said that it was just a 
matter of time before it would be swallowed up by the cheap 
products from the states, the California wine makers and so on.
<P>
	The growers grabbed the bull by the horns, if I can mix my 
metaphors a little, and asked themselves why they could not be 
innovative. They would be on the leading edge of the new 
grapes, the new technology, the new way of making wine. Now 
they are taking on the world.
<P>
	Last year the wine producers from the Okanagan valley 
produced the world's best wine. I know there are some other 
good wines in Canada. I do not downplay them, but the B.C. 
wine producers were able to produce by not being afraid of the 
competition, the best wines in the world. My hat is off to them.
<P>
	They did a good job. They took on the world. They can 
compete both price wise and especially in quality. They are 
among the best in the entire world. That is the way the 
agricultural industry is moving.
<P>
	My own area is not known as an apple growing area, but an 
interesting phenomenon is happening. In British Columbia 
apple growers have always come from the Okanagan. In the 
Fraser valley an interesting thing has happened. The farmers are 
not growing apples in an orchard any more. They grow apples in 
straight rows four feet apart, with certain pruning techniques, 
certain pollination techniques and so on. They can produce as 
many apples on an acre as other growers do in 10 acres in a 
conventional orchard.
<P>
	They are able to do that with innovation, by taking on the 
world, by exporting to Japan. They produce an excellent product 
at a good price. That allows them to make a living even in the 
Fraser valley where it was unheard of to even in a serious way 
grow apples just a few short years ago.
<P>
	Innovation is coming and producers know they must change. 
There is evidence of that in my own riding. Recently the 
producers have agreed to allow some of their potential profit to 
go into the Agassiz Research Station as a joint venture project 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14203"> 14203 </A></B>
<P>
with the federal government, producers and industry in general 
to find new and better ways to produce milk.
<P>
	They are going to increase the herd size in Agassiz. The 
University of British Columbia is bringing its herd out to 
Agassiz. They will get them all together and have a good sized 
herd, a real production herd of a couple of hundred cows.
<P>
	They have huge new manure handling facilities there. They 
are being innovative on how to handle manure storage, 
composting, injection and all the things that we are going to 
have to do. We cannot live in a society where the cities are 
encroaching on the farms and think that the old honey wagon is 
going to be able to do the same job it used to do just a few short 
years ago.
<P>
	It has to change and it is not bad that it changes. In fact, 
farmers are finding as they change that not only can they handle 
manure storage, for example, in a way that does not offend the 
encroaching neighbours but also have a better yield and better 
crop production by being more careful and more innovative on 
how they handle manure.
<P>
	Change is inevitable and it is not bad that change comes. 
Another example, if I can use a local example, is the B.C. AI 
centre, the artificial insemination centre. It has changed. It used 
to be that cows and especially bulls were rated on how much 
butterfat would be produced. Everything was rated on butterfat. 
One wanted a cow that produced a lot of butterfat and one 
wanted a bull whose offspring produced even more. Butterfat 
was the key to the future.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Times have changed. The AI centre now has realized that 
people want a low fat product. Fat is not considered something 
to be paid extra for. The centre is now tinkering with their next 
crop of bulls whose offspring will produce milk that has more 
protein and less butterfat. It is the wave of the future. There is no 
use sitting and crying over spilt milk. The hon. member for 
Vegreville enjoyed that comment.
<P>
	Producers are saying that they have to plan. With a bull, it is 
not just a couple of years to see how it checks out. It takes the 
first crop of offspring, then the tests on those, making sure that 
the protein count and the butterfat is trending the right way and 
so on. It takes years and years to develop a good genetic 
program.
<P>
	BCAI is one of many groups that has realized that changes 
must come. It does not look just to the lower Fraser valley, not to 
British Columbia where its roots are. It looks around the world 
to market its products, to market its bulls around the world. It 
has been very successful in being a leading example of what it is 
going to take to compete in the next century. It is not going to be 
the status quo. It must change and this change will be good.
<P>
	Through the free trade agreements which the government has 
signed, both the GATT and the NAFTA agreements, tariffs will 
be reduced over the next few years. American products will be 
able to compete as time goes on more and more, head to head 
with Canadian products.
<P>
	We have had a period of grace where the low Canadian dollar 
means that we have not had in the last year and a half to two 
years a lot of cross border shopping. We have not had a large 
influx from the United States as far as dairy products are 
concerned. We cannot plan a long term agricultural policy based 
on the fluctuations of the Canadian dollar. We must be 
competitive. We have to be competitive and ready to go head to 
head with the Americans over the next 10 years.
<P>
	There is no sense saying that it is not going to happen. It will 
happen. The low Canadian dollar best not lull us into 
complacency. We have to be ready for the Americans when they 
start aggressively challenging us. They are doing that as we 
speak. They are challenging us hoping to prove to us that 
NAFTA will supersede GATT.
<P>
	We can take on the Americans. We can take on the world. We 
will do it all if we are willing to change. This bill is a change. We 
will support it because it shows that change is inevitable. It can 
be a good thing and I am happy to support it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the speech of the hon. member. He 
referred first to the length of my comments, by the way, which I 
really appreciated. I think he wanted me to expand on them a bit. 
Next time I will try to do that. As he was talking about being 
raised on a farm that had dairy cattle, I would like to ask him 
about the pastoral scene which must have surrounded milking 
time.
<P>
	In his constituency over these past couple of years as he hears 
from dairy farmers, I would like him to relay some of the key 
concerns which he has heard from them.
<P>
	I have had correspondence from the Mainland Dairymen's 
Association which is in the hon. member's riding. Its members 
were concerned with some of our comments on supply 
management. When I wrote them a letter responding to that they 
published the whole letter in their newsletter. I think they 
appreciated our point of view on it.
<P>
	I would like to hear from the hon. member the comments he 
has been hearing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to do that.
<P>
	The hon. member would be right to call the Fraser valley area 
one of the more pastoral scenes in all of Canada but we will not 
get into that so much as we will to the comments that I hear from 
farmers in the Fraser valley.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14204"> 14204 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	I may have more milk producers in my riding than probably 
anywhere west of Ontario. There is a huge concentration of 
supply managed industries. Both poultry and dairy products are 
concentrated in the lower Fraser Valley for good reason, because 
of the weather and proximity to markets.
<P>
	However, there are two or three things that farmers keep 
raising as major concerns as they head into the next century and 
try to plan their lives and plan for handing off the farm to the 
next generation.
<P>
	First, they say they are willing to go head to head with the 
Americans or with anyone else as long as it is on a level playing 
field. Farmers keeping telling me: ``If you make sure the 
Americans do not subsidize their product, if you make sure we 
have anti-combines legislation in place, if you can make sure 
the health standards are the same and so on, then we will 
compete with the Americans. But you have to help us in a couple 
of ways. The help we need is not just from the federal 
government but all levels of government, to make sure 
governments get their own houses in order. They have to get 
taxes down. They have to get regulation of bureaucracy in hand 
so that we do not have to fight both with the federal and 
provincial fisheries and the federal and the provincial 
environment offices as we go about our business''.
<P>
	They need to know that the changes coming are not just 
dumped on them overnight. They are willing to change. If they 
have to go bigger, they will go bigger. If they have to bring in 
new technology, they are happy to do that. However they cannot 
handle sudden cataclysmic change where they will wake up one 
morning and find sudden change, as the Canadian wheat farmers 
found that the Crow rate was gone. Government should have 
warned them.
<P>
	If we do not warn the Canadian farmers and help them plan 
over the next few years during the reduction in tariffication they 
will come back and curse this Parliament and the government 
for not having raised the warning flags to show where they must 
inevitably go.
<P>
	There is no sense saying that things will stay the same. 
Farmers want to change. They are, first of all, good business 
people. They use technology. They are using computers and 
innovative feed rations. They are using market analysis and 
playing to the consumer's choices. They can do all of that. 
Government must not pull the rug out from under them suddenly 
down the road and tell them they should have been told that 
something was coming.
<P>
	The change that Bill C-86 proposes is good. It points the way 
to something that is GATT friendly. But the government must be 
honest with the farmers and say: This is the change and we must 
move this way.
<P>
	There are also other changes. Let us be honest. The changes 
are here. Be forthright. The farmers just ask for the rules to the 
game and they will play. Do not change the rules suddenly 10 
years from now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when we talk about dairy farmers I always have to take 
my hat off to these people. I realize how dedicated they are to 
their jobs. I grew up on a farm and my dad had about 20 milk 
cows. I know what milking is all about. I did it for about 15 years 
before I went out on my own.
<P>
	I sometimes cursed those dairy cows. I did not know why God 
invented them because He said: ``Work six days and rest one'', 
but these dairy farmers never rest.
<P>
	If we had a ball game planned for Saturday night or the middle 
of the week we knew we milked first. Six o'clock was milking 
time and the ball games were postponed. We also knew that if we 
came in late after the ball game at 5.30 we would be off to the 
pasture to fetch the cows and do the milking. There was no 
fooling around.
<P>
	That continues today. The dairy farmer is on schedule. He 
cannot be five minutes late or five minutes early. Those cows 
have to be milked at the right time.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	It sometimes amazes me when I look at another aspect of 
government legislation. Where is the overtime? Where is the 
triple time for working on holidays that these dairy farmers 
deserve? Everybody wants to have at least two days of the week 
off but the dairy farmer is dedicated. He is there seven days a 
week and probably 24 hours a day.
<P>
	It is a real credit to the dairy farmer to see the product he has 
produced. There is no better product in the milk industry 
worldwide. The American milk products cannot compete in 
terms of quality. We as consumers must recognize that and 
reward the farmer for it somehow.
<P>
	Yesterday when I heard the parliamentary secretary to the 
agriculture minister say we should give farmers the right to 
make decisions, I was wondering whether he had bought a 
Reform membership because that is exactly what we said 
throughout the election. The farmer should have the right to 
decide how to market his product and how it should be priced.
<P>
	We have often been accused of being anti-marketing boards, 
anti-supply management. We have always said the farmer has 
the knowledge and expertise. He knows how to set the quotas, 
how to set the prices and what has to be done to keep up with the 
times.
<P>
	During the election I experienced something surprising. I 
went through some of the Liberal propaganda saying that they 
would preserve article 11: ``That has to stay. There is no other 
way. It will not be negotiated out of the World Trade 
Organization. Vote for the Liberals''. The Conservatives said 
much the same thing, that they would negotiate supply 
management: 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14205"> 14205 </A></B>
<P>
``You will have your quotas''. I received a nice  brochure in the 
mail from the Canadian dairy farmers saying: ``Vote anything 
but Reform. These guys do not know what they are talking about 
when it comes to the dairy industry. Their saying we have to go 
to tariffication is a bunch of beans''.
<P>
	What has happened? Nobody in this House has taken off his or 
her hat to the Reform to say that we were right. We have it in 
black and white that we were right. We will say again to this 
House that the dairy farmer has to be protected and his 
livelihood has to be guaranteed. If we lose the dairy farmer we 
lose one of the most precious things this country has.
<P>
	I must give credit to the Bloc members. When it comes to 
attending meetings where farm issues are being addressed they 
seem to give credit where credit is due. They are always 
concerned that agriculture is looked after, which is something 
we have failed to do in the west. We sometimes think we are 
independent and as farmers we will do everything on our own 
but it means working together. That is why I think these dairy 
farmers have to be complimented.
<P>
	When I talk to dairy farmers now they are taking a different 
view of what Reform policy is. During the spring break I had a 
meeting with Manitoba's milk marketing board and a number of 
farmers. I was pleasantly surprised when they started talking 
about the problems of the high priced quotas. I was surprised 
when I heard someone say that something had to be done.
<P>
	A quota of $3,000 per cow cannot work. We have to start 
realizing that financing a piece of paper at today's interest rates 
cannot be done. It is hurting us and we have to change. I must 
give the members on the Manitoba milk marketing board and the 
farmers who were present credit that they finally acknowledge 
this. Why do we have those huge quotas and the prices on those 
quotas? Because of government regulations. Because provinces 
tried to protect their territory. Innocently, without wanting to we 
got into a situation where this thing crept up into the system and 
the prices on these quotas became higher and higher.
<P>
	Today we know that has to change. Consider a dairy quota of 
$3,000 per cow. That is $300 of interest a year that new farmers 
will have to pay. It is not feasible. They cannot do it and 
therefore the change will come. We can depend on the dairy 
farmers to make the right changes. They have the knowledge on 
how to restructure and to be competitive.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	We are now in the 1990s but thinking back to the 1970s and 
1980s, when it comes to dairy commissions, the government 
really is a dairy commission. It has been milking the public for 
so many years it has almost milked it dry. The consumers and 
taxpayers are getting very thin. If somehow the government 
does not use some of that BST on the taxpayers, they will all 
disappear. The BST that needs to be injected into consumers and 
taxpayers is that they have to pay less in taxes, produce a  little 
more and become a little more competitive than some of the 
industries.
<P>
	When talking of industries, I am talking about grain handling 
which is probably one of the main ones. I was surprised the other 
day when dairy farmers were before the subcommittee on 
transportation. They told us that they cannot survive as dairy 
farmers in Atlantic Canada because the feed costs are way too 
high. One gentleman told me that they were paying over $4 for a 
bushel of barley in Atlantic Canada. I asked how that could be 
because as a farmer in Manitoba, I barely get $2. Something is 
wrong somewhere.
<P>
	Then I started to think about the hearings we had in Thunder 
Bay. The taxation on the grain handling system, the terminals, 
the property taxes alone are 25 times as high as down the road at 
Duluth. These costs are added onto the cost of a bushel of barley. 
I am wondering why the government does not realize this. When 
the National Transportation Agency told the minister a year ago 
that there should be no increase in pilotage fees, he overruled 
that. He gave the pilotage authority another 9 per cent increase.
<P>
	Why, when we know that we have to start making things more 
efficient would that be done? Not only that but when the pilotage 
authority heard about that, it started charging these fees two 
months ahead of schedule. It ripped off the shippers another 
million dollars or so.
<P>
	There might be a court case over it. The shippers want that 
money returned. What does the transportation minister say? The 
government will change the legislation and make it retroactive. 
The government will make the illegal thing legal. Is that the way 
we are going to build efficiencies into our system? Is that the 
way we want to run our country? If that is the way we are going 
to do it, then I am very sorry that we will not be able to compete 
with other countries. It is very important that the Liberal 
government along with the opposition start realizing that and 
keep on hammering with that.
<P>
	It makes me wonder when I look at this bill whether everyone 
read the fine print. I hope they did because I know a number of 
red book promises were given to us during the election. One of 
them was the barley plebiscite that was supposed to be held to let 
farmers make decisions on how they wanted to market their 
barley.
<P>
	It astounds me today when I read quotes in the paper that there 
will be a huge loss in the barley pool because we have been 
selling our grain to other countries at prices below the cost of 
production. When I see barley being shipped into the U.S. for 
about $60 a tonne less than we can deliver it to Atlantic Canada, 
I am wondering who it is we are really protecting. Are we doing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14206"> 14206 </A></B>
<P>
what we say we will, protecting our supply management, or are 
we really trying to destroy it?
<P>
	If we are not going to look after our own producers, why 
worry about the others? It is astounding that we do not start 
realizing that we have to look at issues at home first before we 
start to address the problems of the rest of the world.
<P>
	Looking at unfairness, a level playing field, the taxation, it is 
killing us. When I look at fuel taxes five miles away from where 
I farm and I can buy gasoline for almost half the price that I can 
in Canada and all of it is due to tax, something has to change.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	The government said in the budget that it would cut back. 
What did it do? It put another 1.5 cents of tax on a litre of 
gasoline, which amounts to 6 cents a gallon. We are supposed to 
be having a level playing field. How can that be?
<P>
	The issue which the Liberals do not seem to realize is that we 
have to solve our problems at home first before we can point our 
finger across the border at what the Americans are doing wrong. 
It does not make sense when I can pick up a bottle of propane in 
Hannah, North Dakota for half the price that I would pay two 
miles away in Snowflake, Manitoba. It just does not make sense. 
I do not know how the country will keep running with that kind 
of discrepancy.
<P>
	It is not the production units which are bringing on the costs, 
it is taxation on taxation. When I look at the deficit and the fact 
that by 1997 we are going to be paying $1 billion a week in 
interest, how can we ever have a level playing field? Why has 
this come about? Because of mismanagement by previous 
governments and because previous governments would not 
listen to the grassroots people. They always told the grassroots 
people: ``Vote for me. Everything is in order. We will make it 
better''. Now we have ourselves in a mess which we do not know 
how to get out of, so we are starting to point fingers at other 
areas saying: ``They are to blame''.
<P>
	I was in Saskatoon at the beginning of February when the 
dollar was plummeting. I talked to some financial people. That 
little town has about 180,000 people. Seventy million dollars 
went out of that little town into the U.S. for safe keeping because 
of the fear of our dropping dollar. How can our economy survive 
if that is the kind of fear we are instilling in the grassroots 
people of our communities, in the entrepreneurs and the 
developers? It just will not work. That is why I am concerned 
about dairy farmers. If something does not happen to provide 
them with a level playing field, whether it is supply management 
or free enterprise, they will never survive the same as grain 
farmers or other industries.
<P>
	I met with some of the railway people during our 
subcommittee hearings. I heard them say that they pay $654 
million more in fuel taxes, property taxes and sales taxes than 
their counterparts in the U.S. How can they compete? It all goes 
back to the primary producer. Eventually that is where the cost 
gets carried. That is why  it is very important when we debate 
this bill that we really mean what we say, that we want to provide 
a level playing field. That is not to say that this farmer has to 
have the advantage of producing more or that he has to receive 
more for his product; it means that we have to bring the input 
costs down to what the input costs are in the competing areas.
<P>
	When the American farmer travels on roads that cost half the 
taxation for fuel, when the American farmer has half the 
property taxes to pay and when the American farmer's income 
tax is 30 per cent lower than in Canada, how can we make a level 
playing field? Cut back government spending. Bring the deficit 
under control. Pay down the debt and let our farmers take 
control of their industries. I have never seen a farmer who could 
not handle his problems if he had a level playing field. That is 
what we have to work on.
<P>
	When I look at the barley producers today taking a loss in 
their pool, if that is correct, how can we say we have a level 
playing field for the grain farmers? How can we say that they 
can produce a product for the dairy farmer so that he can 
survive? One goes hand in hand with the other. That is why it is 
so important that we provide a level playing field for the dairy 
farmer and the grain farmer.
<P>
	It must also be there for the machinery salesmen, related 
industries and labour. Labour is a prime expense to everybody. 
When labour gets taxed to a point where it takes until the end of 
June to pay their income taxes and property taxes, they have to 
have a price to do it. This adds into the cost of production. This 
is what is creating an uneven playing field. I think that is what 
we have to address.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	I am always amazed when we go to a store and pick up a 
product and say it is too expensive, it is unaffordable. I think this 
struck home to me a year or two ago when I was at an 
agricultural conference in Winnipeg. The head honcho from 
Cargill Grain was talking to us and he said: ``You know, I never 
realized what is really going on in the food industry. I know what 
corn costs in the United States and I know what some of the other 
raw products cost. But my wife sent me shopping the other day 
and I picked up a box of corn flakes and went home and priced 
the corn that was in the box by the weight of it. Do you know 
what the farmer should have got if he had got the price? $1,800 a 
tonne. That was the price of the corn in the corn flakes box. 
Where did all the costs go? Not to the farmer. He is getting 
around $100. So eighteen times what the farmer got was added 
to the cost of that box of corn flakes.''
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14207"> 14207 </A></B>
<P>
	How can people survive with those types of costs, even if you 
are a labourer? Something is wrong in our system. I look at the 
dairy farmer today, who is getting about 30 per cent out of a litre 
of milk for his costs. He has to produce a calf that has to grow for 
at least two and a half years before it starts producing milk. He 
has to build the barns, buy the equipment, do the work, and then 
get one-third of his costs just to ship the milk to the processor 
and to the shelf in the store.
<P>
	Something is wrong and it has to be changed. I am wondering 
how we can do it. I do not mean to say that it has to just be done 
by the Liberal government. It also has to be pointed out by the 
opposition people that there is something wrong. If we do not do 
it we fail our commitment to this House. I am hoping we will 
take it seriously, especially when we look at the food products.
<P>
	I was on a phone-in show one day with one of the agriculture 
people from Manitoba. They were complaining about a few 
things like the cost of fuel, which they thought should be 
brought down, and I agreed. One person said: ``Well, as long as 
we have the production of fuel and hydro we will be all right''. I 
asked the minister: ``How are you going to keep on producing, 
Mr. Minister, if you do not have the farmer? How much oil can 
you drink to sustain life? Will it help you much?'' I then asked 
the manager who was there from the Royal Bank: ``How long 
can you chew on your silver coins and stay alive?''
<P>
	These are the things we are forgetting. We have to start 
realizing where this country really comes from. It comes from 
the agricultural sector. This is why people came here, to earn a 
living, to raise a family, and to produce food for their 
neighbours. It is important that we start realizing that we have to 
supply our own needs and we have to be competitive on the 
world export markets because we are an exporting country. Once 
we can solve those problems and lower our cost of production, 
the price itself will determine how successful we are in foreign 
markets.
<P>
	I appreciate this time to speak on these issues. I hope the hon. 
members have been listening, because when we fail to put food 
on our table we can see what happens in other countries. Two 
prime examples are the Soviet Union and the African countries. 
When agriculture gets abused and goes down the tubes, so does 
the country. I do not want to see that happen to this country. I 
hope this House can do something to provide level playing fields 
for the primary producers, whether dairy, grain, or one of the 
specialty products.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to speak to Bill C-86 today.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	I certainly appreciated the comments from my seatmate, the 
member for Lisgar-Marquette, about the need for a healthy 
agricultural economy in Canada. Like him, I operate an active 
grain farm and know that we contribute very much to the 
economy of Canada in terms  of providing a good food supply at 
a very reasonable cost.
<P>
	I want to premise my remarks today on Bill C-86 by saying 
that what I am trying to do and our party is trying to do today is 
to outline what we think is the need for leadership to provide the 
environment for opportunities for those farm industries that 
operate under supply management, how they can make the 
change, how they can adapt to go into the 21st century and be 
productive members of our society, keep their farms and operate 
on a very sound economic basis.
<P>
	Bill C-86 is an attempt by the government to change the 
present levy system for industrial milk by implementing a 
pooling system for all industrial milk among six provinces. This 
bill's purpose is to enact the obligations of the Uruguay round of 
the GATT.
<P>
	The present levy system is considered an export subsidy under 
GATT and is not permitted under the agreement. The new 
system will pool all earnings for industrial milk and will take the 
cost for exporting excess milk from those earnings. The 
revenues the farmers receive will remain unchanged.
<P>
	This bill simply keeps the present supply management system 
in place. The government openly acknowledges that this is the 
case. But supply management and free trade are very much 
opposing systems.
<P>
	The last time I checked, the trend in the world economy was in 
the direction of a more open trade. Supply management is totally 
out of step with the times. It is like a horsedrawn buggy and it 
needs a redesign so we can move as quickly as the rest of the 
world.
<P>
	Recently our quotas for products made with industrial milk 
ended due to GATT and were replaced with astronomically high 
tariffs, 351 per cent in the case of butter, which is the highest. 
They are all in that range of some 250 to 350 per cent.
<P>
	Members will probably know that the United States is 
presently challenging our sky high dairy tariffs. They are 
viewed by the United States as a violation under NAFTA and the 
United States has called for a NAFTA panel to hear arguments 
on this issue during the summer. So the process has started.
<P>
	A challenge under NAFTA takes between two and five years. 
If Canada loses the transition time for the elimination of tariffs, 
domestic quotas would have to be negotiated. The chances of 
Canada winning the present challenge to the new dairy tariffs 
are questionable, in my view. Our American sources are quite 
confident they can win this one.
<P>
	Even if Canada feels it has a good case, the future for the 
pooling system cannot be ensured. Many would like to believe 
that the pooling system can solve all of our problems in this 
industry, that it can make supply management secure. That is not 
realistic. What we need is some realism here. The future of an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14208"> 14208 </A></B>
<P>
entire industry cannot be focused on such a weak system. The 
time has  come to move on and to move this industry beyond 
supply management.
<P>
	NAFTA negotiations to include Chile as a new partner have 
already begun. These new negotiations will be an opportunity to 
resolve old issues. Our partners in NAFTA want to finalize those 
old issues before admitting a new member and signing a new 
agreement. The supply management dairy issue is one of those.
<P>
	The United States has good reason to push for an end to our 
present supply management system. The Americans want to 
have access to our markets for dairy products. On the other hand, 
Canada has a chance to end the notorious back door subsidies the 
U.S. hands out to its farmers. This is an opportunity, and I stress 
it is an opportunity that cannot be lost, to push for an end to all 
United States subsidies, which totalled over $10 billion U.S. per 
year in 1993.
<P>
	We can also shape the time period for phasing out our present 
supply management system in Canada. We have to seize this 
opportunity to do some hardball negotiations where Canada says 
yes, we will give up some of our high tariffs on the supply 
managed industries, but only in exchange for you reducing your 
subsidies that you do through the back door. Then we would 
have the level playing field my colleague from 
Lisgar-Marquette spoke about, the need for this level playing 
field.
<P>
	I believe that our farmers can compete with anyone as long as 
they have the same conditions. In fact, I believe that with the 
high population base in the United States and with most of our 
supply managed industry located within this 100-mile corridor 
we can function very well. I believe we can make the most of 
opportunities. We cannot lose this important opportunity that 
has been presented with the United States challenge to NAFTA 
to say yes, we are willing to give up something, but only in 
exchange for your backing off your subsidies.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	I think we should work toward a continental free trade zone 
for dairy products, a sectoral approach. One sector may be able 
to move faster than others, and I believe this is one of them. This 
will place all dairy farmers on an even footing. No one farmer 
will have an unfair advantage based on the country in which he 
lives or produces. I believe that is to the advantage of our dairy 
farmers.
<P>
	The world is moving to a new open market. There are 130 
countries that signed the Uruguay round of the GATT agreement 
and there are more countries that want to get in. Canada is part of 
that free trade world. The time has come for government to 
recognize that a transition to a free market in this hemisphere is 
important to all of us. The government needs to help dairy 
farmers to make the necessary transition, not hold them back.
<P>
	The industry needs time to adjust. Dairy farmers have 
invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in their operations. 
The government must negotiate a new deal for farmers or all 
their hard work could be lost in the blink of an eye. I for one 
know of the hard work that is involved in running any type of 
farm operation, but in a dairy farm operation, as my colleague 
has just said, seven days a week is the norm. We must take this 
opportunity to give them some kind of a future, not one where 
we have the blinkers on and pretend the system will always be in 
place, but one where we can help them to move to this. Many of 
these farms have been handed down from generation to 
generation, and farmers want that to continue. It is a way of life 
they enjoy.
<P>
	This industry needs to develop an economy of scale to 
compete with producers from other countries. The industry must 
develop into a system that increases efficiencies and lowers the 
cost of production. For example, the diversity of herd size and 
yield in Canada is not set up to meet that need. The same holds 
true for the United States. The average size of a cow herd in 
Canada is 47, and in the United States it is 45. But in British 
Columbia, the model province in the industry, the average herd 
size is larger, at 78 milking cows. They are starting to make the 
adjustment. As a result, the yield in B.C. is over 20 per cent 
higher than that in the rest of Canada or the United States. The 
industry in British Columbia is considered to be the most 
advanced in North America. But under the present system the 
industry cannot operate at full capacity. The B.C. quota is not 
high enough.
<P>
	I believe it is ludicrous that the provinces that are the most 
efficient cannot benefit from this efficiency. The supply 
management system is only coddling the inefficient producers 
and hurting the industry as a whole.
<P>
	The U.S. dairy industry is not making the transition to free 
trade either. Farmers in the U.S. are paid to keep their herd sizes 
down. This policy is meant to limit output. U.S. farmers receive 
more subsidies from the government than their Canadian 
counterparts. In fact, dairy farmers are the most highly 
subsidized in the United States.
<P>
	In Canada, subsidies for industrial milk were decreased in the 
February budget by 30 per cent over two years. There is even a 
possibility that the entire system of direct government subsidies 
will end in the near future. The rebate to manufacturers using 
Canadian dairy products will end in August. This is due to our 
GATT commitments. We need to continue the trend.
<P>
	I know that Canadian farmers need to stay one step ahead of 
their American counterparts. The phasing out of internal quota 
would be a next logical step. There has been discussion that one 
possible option would be a partial buyout of the quota. Farmers 
should be fully functioning members of a free enterprise system 
and should stay ahead of the competition. They would not lose 
all the time and money they have invested by taking  this approach. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14209"> 14209 </A></B>
<P>
With the negotiation of a new deal for NAFTA they would be 
able to compete.
<P>
	Canada needs to take this further in the next round of the 
GATT as well, in five years. But first we must start with the new 
opportunity I spoke of earlier that is presented by the NAFTA 
talks and any possible expansion to include other countries.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	I understand the fear of the dairy industry and dairy farmers. 
Grain farmers went through about 15 tough years when there 
was a massive trade war on in agriculture. Trade rules have 
really helped. The World Trade Organization and the GATT have 
really helped. As long as we can phase down subsidies 
worldwide we can compete with anybody.
<P>
	A new system would be open and entirely different. There 
would be no guaranteed price for their product but some farmers 
would not be able to adjust. They would have to go. As a whole, 
the industry would have to benefit.
<P>
	The economy has changed and the way to do business must 
change as well. If the dairy industry does not change, I fear it 
will be harmed very substantially. This would hurt all Canadians 
regardless of which province they live in, regardless of the level 
of dairy production in their area.
<P>
	We do have a very important example of an integrated 
economy in agriculture, the beef industry. It is a North American 
integrated market. The next logical step for Canada is to do the 
same thing with the supply managed industries, specifically the 
dairy industries.
<P>
	If we can negotiate subsidies down in the United States and 
our tariffs, Canadian dairy farmers can compete. Members of 
Parliament have an obligation to ensure our dairy industry can 
compete. We need to help the industry to survive and prosper. 
The industry needs direction for the transition. If we do not lead 
in the Chamber, who will? We need to give guidance to the 
industry of intentions to negotiate a better solution.
<P>
	To ignore the reality and lose it in the end makes no sense. The 
time for change is now before it is forced on this industry. I want 
to help dairy farmers make this adjustment for the future.
<P>
	The government needs to broker a better deal during future 
negotiations. I want to see them be a success. Governments 
should want to see them succeed as well.
<P>
	Let us not bury our heads in the sand and ignore reality. As a 
farmer and a believer in the free market system, I call on the 
government to lead dairy farmers and the supply managed 
industry into the 21st century.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CNCOMMERCIALIZATIONACT">CN COMMERCIALIZATION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (for the Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
moved that Bill C-89, an act to provide for the continuance of 
the Canadian National Railway Company under the Canada 
Business Corporations Act and for the issuance and sale of 
shares of the company to the public, be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity today to speak in support of Bill C-89, an act to 
commercialize Canadian National at the third and final stage.
<P>
	This undertaking is an important element in ensuring the 
continued success of the Canadian transportation system. The 
geographic nature of the country means the efficient 
transportation of goods is intrinsic to our producers and 
manufacturers' being competitive in the global marketplace.
<P>
	Specifically, our exporters who use rail transportation to get 
their goods to market cannot compete on the global scale unless 
railways are cost efficient and effective in delivering their 
goods.
<P>
	Commercialization of CN is one of the government's efforts 
to ensure a competitive and viable rail system in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	We are also moving to reform the regulatory framework 
governing transportation to ensure it helps foster competition 
and serve shippers well, which is what the Minister of Transport 
did today. By putting CN on a level playing field and removing 
the often costly public policy demands it has faced as a crown 
corporation, the government is working to ensure we will have a 
healthy national railway to serve Canadians throughout the 
country into the future.
<P>
	The bill before us aims to allow the government to sell all of 
its equity in Canadian National as a public share offering. In 
order to do so the government had to make sure enough capital 
would be available to absorb this issue, expected to be the 
largest initial public offering in Canadian history.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14210"> 14210 </A></B>
<P>
	Recognizing the Canadian equity market could not absorb all 
the shares on its own, the government sought to structure the bill 
to allow for the maximum number of Canadians to take part as 
well as foreign investor participation. To this end we have not 
limited foreign investor share purchases any more than those of 
domestic investors. However, in trying to maximize the interest 
in this share issue we also recognize the desire to ensure CN will 
not be controlled by a single individual, whether Canadian or 
otherwise.
<P>
	Therefore in order to ensure a broad distribution of these 
shares a limitation has been placed on the shares which any 
individual or associated group of individuals may own at a 15 
per cent level. This level of restriction is both low enough to 
ensure no hostile takeover is possible and high enough to 
provide investors with some influence on management actions 
and decisions should they desire.
<P>
	The government felt it was important to include this 
restriction. However, let me assure the House that recognizing 
the negative effect which restrictions could have on value, we 
were very careful not to include any limitations which would 
prevent us from maximizing the return to the taxpayers of 
Canada in this share sale.
<P>
	The obligation for CN to retain its head offices in Montreal 
and to operate in both official languages will not affect the 
value. We could not include any sort of operating restrictions on 
CN's going forward because any sort of requirement in this 
legislation for CN to maintain a specific operation would have 
dampened investor interest in these shares given the possible 
effect on the railway's revenues.
<P>
	It can be tempting for some to ask CN to maintain certain of 
its operations while it is still a crown corporation. However, CN 
can no longer be used as a tool of public policy if it is to serve 
Canadian shippers well. The government's objectives must be 
met through transparent and direct means, not through entities 
such as railways.
<P>
	In committee Bloc members had originally indicated support 
and exemption from the bill for the Quebec bridge. The 
government has indicated in the past this is a perfect example of 
the government and CN's being committed to the maintenance 
of that bridge which is part of an important transportation 
corridor for Quebec, Quebec City and the area. Obviously it 
needs to have public participation by way of the provinces.
<P>
	CN has already committed $1.5 million to the maintenance of 
that bridge, key to its rail network. Seventy-five per cent of the 
traffic on that Quebec bridge is vehicular traffic, which is the 
responsibility of the provincial government. The president of 
CN has invited the provincial government to participate more 
fully in a equitable sharing of those expenses. Hopefully Bloc 
Quebecois members will use their influence with the provincial 
government to ensure it pays its part in maintaining that historic 
bridge which serves Quebec  City and its population and which 
is also a monument to what we have built in Canada together.
<P>
	CN has already sold its exploration division, the proceeds of 
which will be applied to debt reduction. It is important that CN 
be privatized in an attractive way to investors. It has extensive 
real estate holdings and other non-rail assets, some of which 
have considerable value.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	However, the government has been advised that investors will 
be looking for pure rail play and will not pay for CN's non-rail 
assets. Accordingly, these assets which have considerable value 
will be transferred to the government for subsequent sale.
<P>
	Some of CN's property holdings are marketable in the near 
term and will be sold to reduce the debt. The CN 
commercialization act provides the Minister of Transport with 
the authority to transfer selected properties from CN to the 
government prior to the sale offering. CN will receive credit at 
fair market value for these properties.
<P>
	One of the difficult aspects of reducing CN's debt will be to 
achieve a balance between what must be done to ensure the 
shares of CN are marketable, what CN must have at a minimum 
to start off on a financially viable footing and what impacts there 
may be on other players in the industry, notably CP.
<P>
	The railways are an important part of the transportation 
system in Canada. Commercializing CN using the guidelines of 
Bill C-89 will put CN on a level playing field with its 
competitors. In conjunction with regulatory reform the 
government has introduced today, we will ensure a viable rail 
system up to the challenge of helping Canadian shippers 
compete in global markets of the future.
<P>
	The government supports the bill and we encourage members 
on the other side to do likewise because it is an important 
moment in Canadian history, allowing one of our crown 
corporations to become a full player in the private sector and 
give the country what it needs, efficient, affordable and reliable 
rail service.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois agrees with the principle of the CN 
Commercialization Act, and, in particular, we appreciate the 
fact that provisions in it guarantee the bilingualism of the 
institution and the maintenance of its head office in Montreal. 
There are, however, six points on which we oppose the bill, and I 
will first list them for you, before I go on to examine them in 
detail point by point.
<P>
	The six points are as follows. The first is the excessive power 
the bill gives the minister to use public funds to pay off part of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14211"> 14211 </A></B>
<P>
CN's debts and to give CN consideration for any assets outside 
the railway system the minister wishes to transfer.
<P>
	Second, we do not agree with the fact that the bill does not 
protect the interests of CN workers once the company passes 
into private hands.
<P>
	In the same vein, we disapprove of the fact that the bill makes 
no provision for the retirement fund of CN workers. We also 
cannot accept the lack of provisions preventing foreign takeover 
of the company.
<P>
	Fifth, we object to the fact that, through clause 16, the SLRs, 
because of their connection with CN, could, in the future, come 
under federal jurisdiction, whereas they are generally under 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Furthermore, we do not agree with the fact that there is no 
guarantee CN's successors will carry out their obligations to 
repair the Pont de Québec, which is an historical work and of 
economic interest. There is, moreover, no guarantee that CN's 
successors will do it any better than CN has done it itself since 
its acquisition by the federal government.
<P>
	Here, then are the six points one after another. First, the bill 
accords the minister excessive power to use public funds in 
order to pay off part of CN's debts in order to make the company 
a more attractive buy and in order to give CN consideration for 
portions of assets the minister would like transferred.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	We find these powers truly outrageous. They are to be found 
under clauses 6 and 12. I will not quote the whole clause, but 
only parts of it: ``The Minister may, at any time, while CN is a 
Crown corporation, direct CN to transfer property, on such 
terms and conditions, including consideration, if any, as the 
Minister considers appropriate''-he is the one in 
charge-``and CN shall forthwith comply with the direction''.
<P>
	I will now read a short quote from clause 12, which goes along 
the same lines: ``The Minister, with the approval of the Minister 
of Finance, may enter into an agreement or other arrangement 
with CN or any other person respecting the acquisition, holding, 
service, disposal or discharge of or other dealing with any debt 
or obligation incurred by CN'', this is somewhat excessive, 
``and pay out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, or from the 
proceeds of any sale of shares, amounts in respect of any 
agreement or arrangement referred to in paragraph (a) or (b)''.
<P>
	We were and are still very much opposed to these provisions, 
but our proposed amendments were defeated. Motion No. 8, 
which I drafted myself, was in opposition to them. It said that no 
such agreement regarding the disposal of debt or the transfer of 
property may be entered into unless the following conditions 
were met, and here are a few of the most important ones: not 
until the minister has laid before the House of Commons a 
proposal that the agreement be entered into, and the House has 
concurred in the committee report. This was aimed at giving the 
House, rather than the minister, the authority to approve this 
kind of transaction.
<P>
	We also proposed that the transfer of assets be conditional on 
either the approval of the House or the favourable opinion of the 
auditor general to transfer to the minister assets with a value 
exceeding one million dollars, or to transfer to a third party 
assets with a value exceeding ten million dollars. These 
amendments were voted down. Therefore, the minister retains 
this outrageous power to use public funds as if they were his 
own.
<P>
	The second point we take issue with is that there is no 
provision protecting the interests of workers in those 
corporations that would be purchased by the minister, or 
transferred to the minister to be sold later on. In the case of 
companies that have formed an organic bond with CN and 
receive orders from it in some cases, if that bond is severed, we 
will have to make sure they remain viable and the jobs are 
protected. Nothing of this sort is mentioned in the bill.
<P>
	We do not want to presume the worst about buyers' intentions, 
but someone could buy a company just to close it in order to 
eliminate a competitor and then the jobs would be lost. To 
prevent this, my colleague, the member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans presented the following 
motion which was defeated. Briefly it said that the minister 
could not sell any subsidiary or part of the operations of CN, 
unless CN and the purchaser had given the minister written 
undertakings, in terms satisfactory to the minister, that all 
reasonable steps had been taken to ensure that it would continue 
for a reasonable period as a viable operation and that the 
interests of the employees affected by the sale would, so far as is 
practicable, be maintained after the sale. That motion was 
defeated, therefore the workers have no protection whatsoever.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Third, on a similar issue, we see nothing here that would 
protect the CN employees' pension fund and on that point my 
colleague, the member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
also presented Motion No. 11 which naturally was also defeated. 
It said that the pension plan for employees of CN known as the 
CN Pension Plan shall continue to exist and be funded and be 
administered by the CN Pension Board in accordance with the 
rules in existence immediately prior to the coming into force of 
this act. This amendment to protect the pension fund was 
defeated.
<P>
	Fourth, we object to the fact that there are no provisions which 
will really prevent foreign interests from acquiring the majority 
of shares and therefore the control of CN. To support what I was 
saying, I am referring to clause 8 of the bill, from which I will 
quote.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14212"> 14212 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``8.(1)The articles of continuance of CN shall contain</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>)provisions imposing constraints on the issue, transfer and ownership, 
[-]to prevent any one person, together with the associates of that person, from 
holding, beneficially owning or controlling [-]more than fifteen per cent of 
the votes-''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This provision is excellent, in principle, except that in the 
laudable intention of not reducing unduly the number of 
potential buyers in a market which is already rather limited, 
there is a provision that allows various persons, individuals or 
corporations, belonging to a group, to take less than 15 per cent 
each, even if the total for the group is over 15 per cent, provided 
that they submit a statutory declaration saying that they will not 
act in concert with respect to their interest in CN.
<P>
	This is a good provision and we agree with it as far as 
Canadians are concerned. However, we disapprove of its 
application to foreign interests, because we are not convinced 
that CN directors will be able to make sure that foreign persons 
will abide by their declaration. We proposed, in an amendment, 
that this provision be restricted to Canadians. Of course our 
amendment was defeated.
<P>
	Fifth, clause 16 which I will quote provides, intentionally I 
imagine, that a local railway created with a financial 
contribution from a CN buyer would come under federal 
jurisdiction, even though the others are under provincial 
jurisdiction. Here is what clause 16 says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``The railway and other transportation works in Canada of CN, of every 
subsidiary of CN and of every corporation formed by any consolidation or 
amalgamation of any two or more of those corporations are hereby declared to 
be works for the general advantage of Canada.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We do not accept the principle of federal jurisdiction over a 
local railway created in partnership with CN. Against that we 
proposed Motion No. 15 from which I will quote. This provision 
concerning federal control does not apply to:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) any activity of CN within a province that operates under an agreement that 
subjects the activity to the jurisdiction of that province, or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) any work, subsidiary or corporation owned by CN that is situated or operates 
only within one province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So, this provision putting short line railways under federal 
control could only apply to short line railways operating in more 
than one province. This amendment was rejected, just like the 
others.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The last provision concerns the Pont de Quebec, in Quebec 
City. You know that when it was first built, this bridge was 
considered the eighth wonder of the world and that it has not 
only an economic value, but it is also very interesting in terms of 
heritage. It seems to me that the Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Public Works 
should show some concern. I saw photos of the bridge in its 
present condition. In fact, it does not put people at risk, but it is 
really regrettable to let an asset such as this one fall apart.
<P>
	The federal government, which was the owner, was 
responsible for it, and then it transferred it to CN which should 
have taken all the necessary measures to repair this bridge as 
quickly as possible. It did not do so.
<P>
	We would have liked the bill to stipulate explicitly that the 
buyer of the part of the assets of CN including this bridge would 
have the obligation to repair it urgently within a specified time 
frame. This is the purpose of motion No. 14 which says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-89 be amended by adding after line 3, on page 8, the following new 
Clause:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``15.1 The Minister shall, no later than January 1, 1996, conclude an 
agreement with CN providing for CN to repair, renovate and maintain the Pont de 
Quebec in Quebec City and to commence work under the agreement no later than 
May 1, 1996''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It will come as no surprise that this amendment was rejected. 
So they were all rejected, and we are left with legislation that 
allows the minister to use federal funds as he likes, to have 
assets transferred to him or to pay debts incurred by the CN.
<P>
	The legislation does not protect the workers. It does not 
protect the CN pension plan. It does not give any real and 
verifiable protection against external control. It does not protect 
the future short line railways from an eventual take over by the 
federal government if ever there were joint ownership with the 
CN. The legislation does not give any guarantee at all respecting 
the Pont de Québec. It is an antisocial measure that totally 
disregards the rights of this House; it is insensitive to the fate of 
this historical bridge and would make short line railways come 
under two jurisdictions, some being under provincial 
jurisdiction and others, under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	In spite of what I mentioned earlier, in spite of the fact that it 
does guarantee bilingualism and keeps corporate headquarters 
in Montreal, we find that it is a bad bill and we will vote against 
it enthusiastically.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when Bill C-89 was first introduced, I stated that I 
supported the intent but not the content. Since that time the bill 
has been through committee, witnesses have appeared, 
amendments have been offered but very little has changed.
<P>
	Speaking first of some of the restrictions in the bill, I cannot 
see any business reason for the insistence that CN's 
headquarters remain forevermore in any one city. Contrary to 
the Bloc's rhetoric, this is not a Quebec issue.
<P>
	The concern on this clause is that a private company should 
not be restricted to any one location no matter where the location 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14213"> 14213 </A></B>
<P>
is. I would have the exact same concern if the restricted location 
were elsewhere. The issue is the restriction, not the location.
<P>
	During debate at report stage the Liberals stated that the 
headquarters are in Montreal, they have always been in 
Montreal and it is reasonable that they remain Montreal. 
Therefore, this is a good restriction. If the last part of the 
statement is true, then I would ask why they need the restriction 
placed into the legislation.
<P>
	Likewise another restriction requires that CN maintain the 
federal official languages policy as if it were still a crown 
corporation. This is not necessary. Again, the Liberals used the 
illogical approach that CN is already following the Official 
Languages Act and therefore would continue to do so in any 
event. If this is practical to do, CN will likely continue to do so. 
If it is not, then it should not be required to continue it, at least 
not indefinitely.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	An alternative which I offered on both of these clauses as well 
as the clause dealing with share restrictions was to include a 
sunset clause which would have provided that these restrictions 
would have been in place when the new company was formed 
initially but cancelled after a five-year period. CN would then 
be guided by market needs instead of political needs. This seems 
to me to be a reasonable compromise between Liberal needs and 
marketplace common sense. Unfortunately the words 
reasonable and compromise do not seem to be in the Liberal 
vocabulary.
<P>
	The third restriction in the legislation is restricting the 
maximum number of shares in CN owned by any one person or 
company to 15 per cent. Most committee stage interveners from 
the financial sector stated that there was no particular advantage 
to this restriction but it would not cause a problem in the short 
term. The obvious implication is that this would cause problems 
in the long term.
<P>
	The 15 per cent restriction prohibits shareholders from 
joining together to either ensure that directors will follow the 
will of the shareholders or to remove certain directors who are 
not acting in the best interests of the shareholders of that 
company. For example if a significant number of CN employees 
decided to buy into the company and the total number of shares 
held by various employees totalled more than 15 per cent, at any 
time they all voted the same way it could be ruled by the 
directors as collusion and their votes would not count. This 
serves to entrench management which hardly can be considered 
good long term policy.
<P>
	This also inhibits some company which wishes to bring a new 
management style to what may be a very tired and inefficient 
company from buying in. If this company is able to buy a 
sufficient number of shares to ensure that its new management 
policies can be utilized and brought forward it would hope not 
only to get a return on its investment in terms of the share value 
but also appreciation of the capital value of the company itself 
through the innovative approach that it may be able to  bring into 
the company and through ensuring that this comes to fruition.
<P>
	There are those who will argue that some other companies 
have similar restrictions and therefore this one is okay. I would 
answer that by pointing out that over time many mistakes are 
made. For example we used to have autocratic Conservative 
rulers in Ottawa. Voters, the shareholders of Canada, partially 
corrected that mistake. Now we have autocratic Liberal rulers 
who are a transitional mistake that we must put up with until the 
next election. Only then will we have government 
representatives who write legislation based on the people's 
needs rather than political needs.
<P>
	As in the case of the other two restrictions, I tried to find a 
reasonable compromise by amending this section with a five 
year sunset clause. Once again those words were not in the 
Liberal vocabulary.
<P>
	The next section deals with Canadian ownership. Bill C-89 
does not provide any restriction to foreign ownership, nor in my 
opinion should it. Financial experts have stated that it would 
likely take an international share offering to find enough 
investors for the CN shares. If that is the case, so be it.
<P>
	What if there are enough investors in Canada who want to be 
involved in the ownership of a sector of Canadian heritage that it 
could in fact be sold here? Alternatively, what if there are a 
number of Canadians who wish to buy some portion of the 
shares but are scooped by foreign purchasers who are quicker off 
the mark when the share sales begin? Do we not have some 
obligation to Canadians?
<P>
	I proposed a very simple solution which would have seen the 
shares available to Canadians and Canadian corporations only 
for the first 90 days. In terms of international sales all this would 
have done is delay the sales to the rest of the world by 90 days. 
This seemed to be a very reasonable approach to protect the 
rights of the people we represent without unduly restricting 
foreign sales. Of course I am again forgetting that the concept of 
representation is just as foreign to the Liberals as the words 
reasonable and compromise.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	The next problem in the legislation that I tried to deal with is 
the period of continuation of the rail line to Atlantic Canada. I 
proposed an amendment that would require CN not to sell or 
abandon the rail line between Montreal and Halifax for a period 
of 10 years.
<P>
	The Halifax Port Corporation testified before the standing 
committee pointing out that the new CN Sarnia tunnel gives 
Atlantic Canada excellent access to the American midwest. As 
such, it believes that by investing in upgraded port facilities it 
will secure handling of new high capacity, deep draft freighters 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14214"> 14214 </A></B>
<P>
and thus the economic future of the marine industry in Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
	The same transport committee that rejected my Atlantic 
amendment recently tabled a marine study which recommends 
that ports such as Halifax should be commercialized and must 
obtain their financing on the open market without government 
guarantees. I happen to agree with this but once again the word 
reasonable comes into play.
<P>
	For many years the government has interfered with the 
marketplace through government ownership, subsidies and 
regulations. It is obvious that the current government has looked 
at Reform policies and the popularity that those policies have 
generated. While anxious to try to adopt some of our ideas and 
policies, the Liberals always try to change things enough so they 
can call the ideas their own and in doing so lose much of the 
common sense that our original policies contained. The Atlantic 
Canada situation is a classic example.
<P>
	If the Halifax Port Corporation goes to the private sector for 
financing without government backing, the private sector is 
going to want some assurance that the all important rail link to 
central Canada and the American midwest will remain for at 
least long enough to ensure a return on investment.
<P>
	The purpose of the amendment is not to protect the rail line 
forever but to ensure its operation for a transitional period of 10 
years. This should give Atlantic Canada the opportunity to 
develop its marine operations to a highly viable degree after 
which normal private sector determinations of future CN 
operations will rule. If nothing is done, Atlantic Canada will risk 
losing new freighter business to the American east coast ports 
and the cycle of Atlantic Canada's economic dependence on 
Ottawa will continue. Perhaps that is the government's real 
strategy.
<P>
	I believe that this amendment is in keeping with my position 
on the other restrictions in that I can live with the other 
restrictions as long as they have a time limitation. My Atlantic 
Canada amendment did have that time limitation.
<P>
	The government does not seem to mind restrictions dealing 
with shares, language and headquarters locations, so why this 
sudden rejection of one that will promote economic 
independence in Atlantic Canada? Perhaps consistency is yet 
another word that is not in the Liberal vocabulary.
<P>
	I raised at committee another point of concern by way of an 
amendment. I tried to ensure that the sale of CN shares would 
not be prone to problems from insider trading. The argument 
from the Liberal side was that this was a wholly unnecessary 
amendment because the securities act covers insider trading. 
However, it only covers insider trading once the shares have 
been transferred to the stock exchange. If the government chose 
to sell any of those shares in advance of transferring all the 
shares to the securities commission, this would not be covered 
by the provincial regulations.
<P>
	We do have an undertaking from the government that it does 
in fact intend to transfer 100 per cent of the shares. Thus they 
will be covered by the provincial securities regulations. We will 
certainly monitor that closely and see that the government lives 
up to its word on this.
<P>
	The biggest concern I have about Bill C-89 is the minister's 
unlimited power to reduce or even eliminate CN's debt. CN 
currently owes $2.5 billion. Financial and industry experts have 
testified that in order to be able to sell the shares of CN they 
must have an investment grade bond rating of BBB. To ensure 
this, the debt will have to be reduced to about $1.5 billion.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	I introduced an amendment in committee to restrict the 
amount of taxpayers' money that the minister could use for debt 
reduction to only the amount necessary to reduce the debt to 
$1.5 billion after first reducing it by all available CN funds on 
hand and excessive cash flow requirements along with the 
proceeds of sale of all non-rail real estate assets. The Liberals 
rejected this as too restrictive in that the exact figure to provide 
a BBB rating is not known for sure. Unlike the Liberals, the 
words reasonable and compromise are in my vocabulary.
<P>
	I changed and reintroduced my committee amendment at 
report stage. This time instead of using the dollar amount of $1.5 
billion that the Liberals had objected to, I restricted debt 
reduction to the amount necessary to produce an investment 
grade bond rating of BBB after following the other reduction 
steps in the original amendment. Even though this amendment 
followed the very line of logic offered by the Liberals, they 
turned it down. It seems that the Liberals are still enamoured 
with the concept of a blank cheque.
<P>
	Bill C-89 is the first time I have been involved in the new 
process of sending a bill directly to committee after first 
reading. The rationale for this according to the Liberal 
government was that if a bill was dealt with in committee before 
real debate in the House, it would be much more amenable to 
amendments.
<P>
	This has clearly not been the case. The amendments I 
proposed in committee were reasonable and had the support of 
many of the interveners. One of my amendments dealing with 
the preservation of the Atlantic Canada port viability even 
received the support of one of the Atlantic Canada Liberal MPs 
but was defeated in a tie breaking vote by the committee Chair.
<P>
	One of the arguments I found really interesting was brought 
forward by the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Transport on this part of the Atlantic amendment that I offered. 
It was the idea that what was I doing promoting a restriction on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14215"> 14215 </A></B>
<P>
private enterprise, my being one of these infamous free 
enterprise Reformers. As I stated earlier, I do not see this as a 
long term problem. It is a transitional thing from where the 
government has total manipulation of the marketplace through 
intervention, through government ownership, through 
subsidies, through special regulations.
<P>
	I thought this was a very reasonable thing to bring forward. It 
was asked for by Atlantic Canada. It had the support certainly of 
the Atlantic members of Parliament I would think even on the 
Liberal side. It is extremely unfortunate that in raising this in 
committee I was not able to bring it up at report stage. It would 
have been very interesting to see the compromise struck with the 
Atlantic members of Parliament between serving their region or 
following the dictates of the Prime Minister.
<P>
	It seems that the only reason for moving to committee after 
first reading, which is the new procedure that is now often being 
used and pushed, is to fast track Liberal legislation by 
eliminating much of the public debate. This is just another 
example of the current system of autocratic rule. It certainly 
does not seem to indicate that the new procedure really works 
the way it was meant to work.
<P>
	This now leaves me to consider whether or not to support the 
overall intent of the legislation to privatize CN Rail, something I 
have spoken in favour of since before the last election.
<P>
	The open ended restrictions dealing with share sales, the 
location of headquarters and language requirements are not 
insurmountable problems. After all, we are only two years away 
from the next election after which I am sure those problems can 
speedily be cleared up. I can adequately deal with the Atlantic 
port problem at that time also because we do not expect the 
Liberals to be in a position to block that any longer.
<P>
	This then only leaves the problem of debt reduction. In an 
attempt to resolve this, I wrote to the Minister of Transport 
through the transport committee. What actually happened is that 
the minister appeared but he was only available for an hour and a 
half. When I asked him a 30-second question I got a five-minute 
answer which, very common to question period, did not answer 
the question at all.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	I asked the minister if he would respond to written questions 
submitted to the committee while it was still sitting. He 
indicated that he would. I set out a list of 12 questions which I 
submitted through the committee and I received the answers 
while the bill was still under committee study. Therefore, those 
questions and the subsequent answers have become part of the 
record of the committee study on Bill C-89.
<P>
	The response which I received from the minister indicates 
that he intends to pay off no more debt than is necessary to 
produce an investment grade bond rating of BBB. I do not know 
why the minister is prepared to commit to this on paper but not 
in legislation. I would have to guess that this is the Liberals' 
method of accepting reasonable measures from Reform while 
trying to hide what they are doing from the public.
<P>
	On the basis of the minister's written, on record commitment I 
am prepared to support Bill C-89.
<P>
	I would like to quote an excerpt from a letter. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Without a doubt, Canada requires a first-rate transportation system that is able 
to service every region. The federal government must play a role in maintaining 
and developing that network, yet it remains to be seen whether the damage 
wrought by the Conservative's policies of massive deregulation of the 
transportation sector can be completely undone. Their continued tolerance of rail 
line abandonments and consideration of proposals for the privatization of CN 
Rail have done nothing to clean up this mess.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	How these pre-election statements do keep coming back to 
embarrass their authors. The author of that letter is the current 
Prime Minister. He wrote it while he was Leader of the 
Opposition. It was written to the hon. member for Moncton only 
days before the last federal election.
<P>
	Looking at some of the items which were in the letter, the 
Prime Minister stated that Canada has to have a first rate 
transportation system, able to serve every region of Canada. If 
that was his intent only days before the election, why when he 
walked across the floor did he suddenly decide that we did not 
need to ensure the transitional preservation of the CN Rail line 
to Atlantic Canada?
<P>
	He also talked about the damage of the Conservative policies 
of massive deregulation. This is particularly interesting on the 
very day that we are having the introduction of a bill which will 
see massive deregulation of the transportation sector. He talked 
about the tolerance of rail line abandonments when the bill deals 
with improving, enhancing, speeding up and simplifying rail 
line abandonment.
<P>
	It seems that the more reasonable position taken by the 
Reform Party finally got through to the Liberals. We have been 
on record since before the last election that privatization is not 
only a good idea, it is essential. More recently I testified before 
the all Liberal task force on CN Rail, reiterating that CN must be 
privatized. I am glad they are finally listening.
<P>
	I hope that if the Liberals intend to use more Reform policies 
in the future that they come to us first so we can help them get it 
right the first time. Bill C-89, for all its flaws, is still a big 
change from the Liberal position at the beginning of this term of 
Parliament and I am pleased that we were able to show them the 
way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14216"> 14216 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak in support of Bill C-89, an act to 
commercialize the Canadian National Railway. This proposal is 
one part of the government's larger plan for ensuring a viable 
and competitive transportation system in Canada. It is also part 
of the government's intention to have the private sector operate 
in areas where it can do the job better than government. As the 
Minister of Finance said last February, our view is 
straightforward. If government does not need to run something 
it should not and in future it will not.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	Under Bill C-89 all of the government's current shares in CN 
will be sold on the public market. All Canadians, including CN 
employees, will have the opportunity to buy shares of the 
railway.
<P>
	During the hearings of the CN commercialization task force 
and of the Standing Committee on Transportation, concern was 
expressed by employees regarding their jobs and pensions. I am 
pleased to confirm that CN employees will continue in their 
current positions in the new CN and their pensions will be 
protected under the Pensions Benefits Standards Act.
<P>
	Employees will also have a special opportunity to take a stake 
in CN through a standard stock savings plan which will be part 
of the share sale.
<P>
	While we hope that many Canadians will be interested in 
buying a piece of CN to maintain its historical value, we cannot 
believe that the Canadian market is large enough to absorb the 
entire equity of CN. Therefore, recognizing the need for foreign 
participation in the share offering to ensure success, we have not 
limited the extent to which foreigners can participate any more 
than we have restricted Canadians.
<P>
	The 15 per cent individual ownership restriction, which is 
included in the bill, treats all investors equally by limiting their 
ability to take over CN by putting a ceiling on how much stock 
they can own. This represents the balance between not 
jeopardizing the government's ability to sell all its shares which 
would be the case if foreigners could not buy the stock and 
ensuring that no individual will be able to take over CN.
<P>
	The bill strikes a balance between the objective of 
maximizing return for the taxpayer by ensuring CN is viable into 
the future and the operating obligations some may wish to 
impose on the railway.
<P>
	I am also pleased, contrary to the Reform Party, that the 
headquarters of CN will remain in Montreal and the Official 
Languages Act will continue to apply to CN employees. This is a 
bilingual, bicultural country. However, these are not changes 
from the way the railway currently operates and will not affect 
the saleability or price which will be received for CN shares 
because investors will expect CN to continue to operate in this 
manner.
<P>
	We cannot, however, impose any serious obligations on CN 
that do not apply to its competitors if we are to ensure that CN 
can compete on a level footing with the other transportation 
sector players into the future, nor can we allow CN to become a 
private company without addressing its capital structure.
<P>
	CN must be able to finance itself in the public markets in the 
future at a premium similar to what its competitors pay. For that 
reason CN is doing all it can prior to the public offering to 
reduce its debt. In addition, CN will transfer its real estate assets 
to the government for a fair consideration which will also pay 
down debts. Any further debt reduction will be the minimum 
necessary and will be undertaken with the goals of fairness and 
competitiveness in the rail industry and the transportation sector 
in mind.
<P>
	I believe that Bill C-89 will enable the government to sell 100 
per cent of its equity in CN, maximizing the return to the 
taxpayer and ensuring that CN can remain a viable, national 
railway serving Canadians long into the future from the Atlantic 
to the Pacific.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
for me a pleasure to rise at third reading on Bill C-89, an act to 
privatize the Canadian National. We all know that transportation 
is essential to the economic prosperity and quality of life of 
Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	Transportation networks are the lifeblood of industry in 
Quebec and Canada. The existence of a transportation 
infrastructure often is a critical factor in the prosperity of a 
region and, as such, can be viewed as the foundation of all 
regional economic development.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	So in that context I am happy to rise this afternoon, since 
Canadian National has been, if we remember our Canadian 
history, a decisive factor in the development of this country, 
which is called Canada, from coast to coast.
<P>
	The analogy of the lifeblood I just used can be applied as well 
to any means of transportation, by air, rail or water. Any 
infrastructure, whether it be a port, an airport or a railroad, must 
be considered first of all as a means of regional economic 
development.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14217"> 14217 </A></B>
<P>
	Obviously, one does not need to be a rocket scientist to know 
that a serious shift in our rail policy is needed. The Canadian 
government has had for too long a narrow vision of the country's 
rail system and has sought no alternative to the abandonment of 
short lines. Large railway companies are not well equipped to 
operate short lines and do not possess the necessary flexibility to 
do so in a cost effective way.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois believes that many short lines can be 
operated on a cost effective basis by local interest railroads 
which are called CFIL in Quebec and short lines by our English 
speaking colleagues.
<P>
	The review of the railway regulations, as tabled this morning 
by the Minister of Transport, should contain measures which 
will pave the way for short line railroads to take over line 
portions that large railway companies no longer want to operate. 
The government should take measures to help the development 
of short line railroads, such as giving loan guarantees, to save as 
much as possible of Canadian railways, particularly in the 
regions.
<P>
	It is easy to understand that, once CN is privatized, the whole 
matter may be called into question and the delicate balance that 
had been reached in Canada and Quebec could also be destroyed 
because a privatised CN would not have the same priorities in 
terms of regional economic development as a crown 
corporation. We know that in our capitalist system, the first 
priority is money; corporations must make profits. This is why I 
am not convinced that the new CN shareholders would be as 
responsive to social needs. I am not saying that they will not 
have any sensitivity, but you know what I mean. When a 
corporation is run by the state, its corporate mission is to 
promote regional economic development, whereas a private 
company is not in business to promote regional development, 
but to make profits. That is what the Americans call return on 
investment.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois agrees in principle with privatizing the 
CN. However, it considers that it should remain under Canadian 
control, since this company was built with the Canadian 
taxpayers' money. Moreover, the Bloc Quebecois believes that 
the government is responsible for ensuring that CN subsidiaries, 
that are not directly related to railway transportation and that 
will be privatized, will be able to survive. To that effect, some 
measures should have been provided to ease their transition. 
Unfortunately, Bill C-89 does not respond to these expectations.
<P>
	Our party submitted in committee a list of amendments that 
were unfortunately-of course, this is the game of 
democracy-defeated by the Liberal majority. Obviously, we 
would have liked our amendments to be accepted. We remain 
convinced that they were realistic, logical and not made with the 
sole purpose of annoying the government or getting on its 
nerves.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	We believed and are still deeply convinced, this afternoon, 
just before the passing of this bill, that our amendments were 
reasonable and serious. In the time that I have left, I would like 
to look briefly at some of the amendments that were tabled and, 
of course, defeated by the Liberal majority in front of us.
<P>
	At the same time, I will look back on some amendments that 
were moved by my colleague from 
Kootenay-West-Revelstoke, because some of them are very 
reasonable. I think they illustrate very well his concern with 
respect for democracy. However, as a Quebecer, there are some 
amendments there that I find totally absurd and, once again, this 
is a demonstration of what we call Quebec bashing on the part of 
some of our colleagues in the Reform Party.
<P>
	I enjoy making comments like this, because it livens up the 
House a little. I was under the impression that, after lunch, my 
colleagues in front of me or beside me were sleeping. Deep 
down, I must be a troublemaker. Under clause 8, the government 
will leave the privatized CN's head office in the Montreal Urban 
Community. Once again, just to show that I am open-minded, I 
recognize that this is a good clause which reflects the strong 
presence of the rail industry in Montreal for over a century. This 
clause corresponds to other bills' provisions. For example, 
when Air Canada was privatized, in 1988, its head office was to 
remain in the Montreal Urban Community.
<P>
	It is therefore unfortunate that my colleague from the Reform 
Party, in his Motion No. 2, proposed to limit the effect of this 
clause to five years, after which the matter could be 
re-examined. I was anxious to make that comment to the House 
about the Reform Party's amendment. We also proposed Motion 
No. 4, stating that subsidiaries not directly related to the railway 
sector, for example, CanCar, an engineering firm, could 
continue to operate. This amendment mainly concerned AMF 
Technotransport, a company located in Pointe-Saint-Charles, in 
Montreal. There are 1,300 jobs involved. We wanted the federal 
government to continue to assume its responsibilities, and to 
take sensible measures so that the subsidiary could keep 
operating for a while, long enough to recover its profitability 
and financial viability. Unfortunately, this amendment has also 
been defeated.
<P>
	I also wanted to speak to amendment No. 8, proposed by my 
colleague for Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, and requiring the 
minister to obtain the House's agreement before arrangements 
are entered into in order to reduce CN's debt. As you know, there 
were increasingly persistent rumours that the minister would 
buy CN assets like the CN Tower or some other assets at a higher 
price than their real market value, in order to help CN bring its 
debt down to $1.5 billion. Obviously the Bloc Quebecois 
opposed such a buyout, which would amount to a subsidy to 
those buying CN.

<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	In addition to Motion No. 8, dealing with operations 
concerning the debt, Motion No. 9, also put forward by my 
colleague for Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, dealt with 
operations concerning assets. In fact, with the latter 
amendment, we were asking that operations concerning CN 
assets be approved by the House.
<P>
	As long as the government remains a majority shareholder in 
CN, any transfer to the government of CN assets with a value 
exceeding $1 million and any transaction between CN and a 
private party with a value exceeding $10 million must be 
approved by the House. This amendment would allow the House 
to assess the validity of the transaction and determine whether it 
is to the benefit of taxpayers.
<P>
	It is first and foremost a matter of democracy. Unlike the 
members of the other place who are political appointees-I do 
not want to comment on people appointed by the previous 
government to the other House-we have been elected 
democratically and we do not have anything to learn from any 
member of the other place. Since ours is a democratic assembly, 
we are asking that the rules of democracy be adhered to and that 
the government come before the elected members to have its 
decision approved.
<P>
	Another motion in amendment put forward by my colleague 
for Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, Motion No. 10, is an 
alternate motion to Motion No. 9. It would require that 
transactions with respect to assets be referred to the auditor 
general, and that his report be tabled in the House.
<P>
	Once again, the purpose of this amendment is not to annoy or 
irritate anybody, but to have openness prevail, so that 
everything can be above board and out in the open. That is why 
we suggested that the Auditor General of Canada be involved, 
because he is a trustworthy official whose mandate is to protect 
public moneys, and because his credibility has never been 
questioned.
<P>
	Another of my amendments, Motion No. 11, was meant to 
protect the CN employees' pension plan. Regrettably, Bill C-89 
still does not contain provisions to prevent any changes in the 
CN pension plan after privatization.
<P>
	Our party has already shown its commitment to workers at the 
time of the rail strike, when we sat over the weekend. We were 
the only ones in this House who fought for the rights of the 
workers. Therefore, it was important and crucial for us that CN 
employees get assurances concerning their pension plan. What 
will happen with this plan? Unfortunately, our amendment was 
defeated. The government did not see fit to accept our 
suggestion.
<P>
	We also moved another amendment, Motion No. 14, 
concerning the Pont de Québec, an issue which is very important 
for me and my colleagues in the Quebec City area. Again, as I 
said the other evening, during the second reading stage, it is a 
shame that the Liberal  members on the Standing Committee on 
Transport made light of the whole issue of the Pont de Québec. 
They really made it sound trivial.
<P>
	I do not want to seem chauvinistic or presumptuous, but I am 
convinced that the hon. members who have visited the 
magnificent region of Quebec City and the surrounding area 
were able to realize that the Pont de Québec is really a world 
heritage jewel.
<P>
	When the bridge was inaugurated by Sir Wilfrid Laurier, it 
was obvious in the mind of Laurier that this fine example of 
architectural engineering should be preserved so that future 
generations would be able to admire it.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	It is unfortunate that, because of CN's carelessness, this 
world-class jewel of architectural engineering is deteriorating. 
It is unfortunate that, in order to maintain this infrastructure in a 
safe and aesthetically pleasing manner, we need to invest 
between $41 million and $45 million. The Liberal members of 
the transport committee, as I said, made light of the whole issue. 
Here are some examples of the comments they made during the 
committee's hearings: ``As the federal government, we will not 
start preserving just any old bridge at the end of some 
concession, in some village in Canada. We will not start 
preserving just any short line railway. We will not start 
preserving every old rail station about to fall down''. We are 
talking about the privatization of CN.
<P>
	In making this comment, I do not mean to insult Canadians 
and Quebecers who happen to have an old bridge at the end of 
their concession road, but I do want to put things in perspective. 
To compare the Pont de Québec to any part of a railroad line that 
is no longer in use is to show a lack of knowledge of this 
architectural jewel. What can I say? The bridge is located in 
Quebec City and spans the St. Lawrence River. I know that, for 
some people elsewhere in Canada, just thinking that this bridge 
is located in Quebec City sets their teeth on edge, but there is 
nothing we can do about it.
<P>
	I see that my time is running out. I would just like to say that 
this coalition to save the Pont de Québec has many members. In 
other words, the member of the Bloc Quebecois is not the only 
defender of the bridge. There is also that member's regional 
caucus, the city of Quebec, the city of Sainte-Foy, the 
Fédération des caisses populaires, RCMs, the Chambers of 
Commerce, the Auto Club, and many more.
<P>
	In conclusion, we are disappointed that Bill C-89 will be 
adopted in its present form even though we have put forward 
very realistic and feasible amendments.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
30(5) the House will now proceed to Statements by Members 
pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we speak 
communities large and small right across the country are 
sprucing up, prettying up and greening up in hopes of being 
selected the most beautiful in the first annual Canadian 
communities in bloom competition.
<P>
	The idea for a national beautification competition comes form 
Canadians in Quebec who want to share and celebrate the beauty 
of our towns and villages. Now with a board of directors and 
sponsors like the national capital commission, the competition 
is under way.
<P>
	The city of Brantford in my riding has been selected to 
participate in the category of communities with a population 
under 100,000. The odds on favourite is Brantford because of 
the quality of our parks board, the involvement of local 
organizations and individual Brantfordtonians.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, has the heritage minister been relieved of his duties or 
has he resigned from his position without informing the public 
and this House? There are several indications that this might be 
the case.
<P>
	The minister was unable to attend the joint convention of the 
Canadian Museums Association and the Société des musées 
québécois at a time when the museums are waiting to hear about 
federal museum policy. For reasons that are a complete mystery, 
he did not delegate a replacement.
<P>
	The cultural community is worried and offended by this 
silence on the part of the federal government. As far as culture at 
the federal level is concerned, it is the policy of the empty chair. 
Left vacant by a minister in name only, this chair is now 
occupied by the Minister for International Trade when it comes 
to film distribution, and by the Minister of Industry in the case 
of orders with respect to satellite broadcasting.
<P>
	It is high time that the heritage minister handed the job over to 
someone really able to stand up for cultural issues. When will he 
be giving up his limousine?

Speaker, the small community of Chilanko Forks in my riding of 
Cariboo-Chilcotin recently lost its general store and post 
office in a terrible fire. For most small towns, this would mean 
the end of mail service for weeks and even months, but not in 
Chilanko Forks, thanks to the bravery and ingenuity of 
postmistress Penny Chipman.
<P>
	Mrs. Chipman entered the burning building four times to 
retrieve essential items at the post office desk. Then after the 
fire she went home and set up a new post office in her own travel 
trailer. The next day the mail went out from the makeshift post 
office without missing a beat, a letter, or a parcel.
<P>
	For Mrs. Chipman's bravery and ingenuity, today here in 
Ottawa she is being awarded the prestigious Golden Postmark 
Award given to postal employees who make outstanding

	<B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Beauce, Ind.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
provinces are increasingly asking for greater latitude in the 
financing of health care. For example, they would like to be 
allowed to impose user fees. Yet, studies show that such fees 
would not help control health expenditures and could result in 
underuse of services by those who are really sick.
<P>
	However, costs can be reduced by improving the efficiency of 
health care services. We all know that, all over the country, there 
are drug consumers, as well as some health care professionals, 
who abuse the system.
<P>
	I hope that the government will launch an awareness 
campaign to ensure that Canadians are responsible consumers of 
the health services provided to them. Our health care system is 
the most generous in the world, but some profiteers make it 
extremely costly to the state. Moderation is the solution.

	We already have over a hundred distinguished inductees and a 
wall of fame, which has generated a great deal of interest and 
pride, but until now we have lacked a real hall.
<P>
	Since its earliest years Peterborough has been a major centre 
for sports at all levels. It is a community known for a high level 
of participation in sports, the quality of its athletes, and the 
extraordinary variety of sports practised by its citizens.
<P>
	Our hall of fame will be a showcase for sports and will house 
the archives of sports history in the community. Since the 
history of Peterborough and the history of sports are 
inseparable, visitors to the new hall of fame, especially young 
people, will leave with a stronger sense of community identity

	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to inform the House that June is seniors month.
<P>
	Seniors month offers an opportunity for Canadians to 
acknowledge the contributions seniors make to their families, 
their communities, and to society at large. It is also a time to 
reflect on the diversity of Canada's seniors.
<P>
	The majority of seniors are healthy, physically and mentally 
active, involved in their communities, and are very satisfied 
with their lives. There are, however, seniors who are frail, who 
need support for daily living, or live in situations that put them 
at risk for depression, loneliness, and dependence. These 
seniors, who are most vulnerable for social, health, or economic 
reasons, need to know that our society will support them in their 
efforts to remain independent and contributing members of 
society.
<P>
	As Canada is experiencing a dramatic growth in elders, the 
oldest seniors who require the most care and support are the 
fastest growing. It is in this context that I invite all Canadians 
and those seniors of tomorrow and today to take up the 
challenge-

Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Health is once again looking for 
excuses to avoid assuming her responsibilities regarding new 
reproductive technologies.
<P>
	Indeed, in spite of the promises made by the health minister 
and the justice minister, the government has still not deemed 
appropriate to follow up on the recommendations contained in 
the Baird report. Yet, last May, the health minister stated her 
intention to table in this House, before the summer recess, 
temporary measures to prohibit the sale of human embryos and 
ova, and to also prohibit genetic manipulations for commercial 
purposes.
<P>
	However, the now legendary laxness and unconcern of the

barely a 20 per cent success rate.

recognize steps taken by this administration to make the 
government more open and accessible.
<P>
	One of our key moves toward openness was to set new 
guidelines on advertising and public opinion research 
introduced by the Minister of Public Works last May. These 
ensure that results of public opinion research studies 
commissioned by the federal government are now accessible to 
all Canadians through the Library of Parliament and the 
National Library of Canada.

<P>
	My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. Does 
this sudden change in her government's strategy mean that the 
federal government is about to do what it did in 1980: spend 
millions of dollars and thus ignore the limits set by the Quebec 
referendum act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, as we said before, we intend to respect the spirit of 
the referendum act. There is certainly no doubt about that.
<P>
	The referendum campaign has yet to begin, and I must say 
there are some very clear signs, because I have here a list of 
referendum-related expenditures by the Parti Quebecois, 
including, for instance, what they sent in the way of propaganda 
to every household in Quebec, which cost $1.5 million; the 
advertising campaign targeted to cultural communities, which 
cost $1.2 million; and the commissions on the future of Quebec, 
which cost $7.5 million.
<P>
	Since the Government of Quebec used taxpayers money to 
make these pre-referendum expenditures, it should look at the 
beam in its own eye instead of the mote in ours.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the minister told us that he was unable to 
estimate the cost of the referendum operation, an indication that 
the federal government has exceeded its spending limit. We 
have some concerns about the implications of the terms used 
yesterday by the minister, when he stigmatized the Parti 
Quebecois as a threat to Canada.
<P>
	Since when can a country that calls itself a democracy be 
threatened by a party that was founded according to democratic 
rules and which intends to achieve its goal by purely democratic 
means?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I said the Parti Quebecois was a threat to 
the unity of the country, and I repeat that the Parti Quebecois and 
the Bloc Quebecois are a threat to the unity of the country.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé: </B>It is clear that when a party is elected by 
democratic means and its purpose is to separate, that party is a 
clear threat to the unity of the country. As the people responsible 
for the unity of the country, it is our duty to explain what our 
country is about, to defend it and to take all necessary steps to 
show people the advantages of federalism, since both in Quebec 
and here in Ottawa, we have a party that is trying to show only 
the disadvantages.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I may refer the minister to what he said 
yesterday: ``The Parti Quebecois constitutes a threat to the 
country''. Second, what he just said is not at all reassuring, since 
he tells us this government has a duty to take all necessary steps, 
which says it all.
<P>
	Since the minister considers the Parti Quebecois to be a threat 
to Canada, I wonder whether he could tell us whether his 
intelligence service, CSIS, shares that opinion and, since CSIS 
is the department's intelligence branch, whether CSIS intends to 
treat the Government of Quebec as a threat and put the Quebec 
government's ministers under special surveillance?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I see the Leader of the Opposition is again trying to 
twist the meaning of what I said, although I made it quite clear 
that the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois were a threat to 
the unity of the country. In this country, the vast majority of 
Canadians want to keep the country together, and in Quebec, 
more than 60 per cent of the population wants to keep Quebec as 
it is. In a democratic system, we have every right to defend the 
will of the vast majority of voters who do not want separation 
and want to stay in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister has a short memory. The latest federal poll gave 54 per 
cent to the sovereignists in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is just the beginning!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is not even from the very 
latest polls, that they have decided not to leak.
<P>
	The Quebec Referendum Act limits each party's spending, in 
order to uphold democracy. But, the Privy Council, which could 
almost be considered the office of the Prime Minister, is not 
governed by this act.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
Given the way the Privy Council's budget works, will the 
minister confirm what Jocelyne Bourgon told the Committee on 
Government Operations at the end of May, which was that any 
additional spending done by the Privy Council is approved after 
the money has been spent, because it is impossible to forecast 
what the total cost will actually be?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, firstly, I would like to point out that the poll to 
which the hon. member for Roberval referred was conducted in 
the month of March. In addition, the figure of 54 per cent is 
being interpreted in a specific way by the Bloc Quebecois and 
the Parti Quebecois. The statistic of 54 per cent refers to those 
who are in favour of sovereignty association; according to the 
latest poll, only 32 per cent of those polled are in favour of 
independence. Consequently, it is obvious that this important 
statistic has been distorted by the Bloc Quebecois to mislead 
people.
<P>
	Regarding the Privy Council's budget, clearly it will cost us 
more to defend national unity if the referendum is delayed. This 
is true for the Province of Quebec, it is true for the Parti 
Quebecois and it is true for us. The figure approved in the 
estimates truly was what we believed we would spend on a 
referendum which we expected would be held in June. If the 
Parti Quebecois had kept its word, that is what would have 
happened.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, I would like to ask you to keep 
both your questions and your answers brief.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to remind the minister that never at any time did he, the 
Prime Minister, or any of the ministers opposite have the 
courage to clearly answer the question would they refuse an 
economic association in the interest of the rest of Canada, yes or 
no?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> I invite him to stand up and to answer that 
question now.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The question please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Since the spending of the Privy Council is 
only approved after the fact, will the minister confirm that his 
government could end up spending as much as it wants, without 
any control whatsoever, and that we would only find out the real 
cost several months after the referendum? In other words, will 
the minister confirm that the Privy Council is an open bar-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I just indicated the Government of Quebec, the 
Parti Quebecois, has already spent more than $11,130,000 on 
propaganda, pure propaganda for sovereignty.
<P>
	The opposition should remember that more than 60 per cent of 
Quebecers are federalists and the great majority of them, more 
than 90 per cent, like Canada and do not want to leave it.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, while we wrangle about Canadian unity and the relative 
safety of the Chamber, Canadian lives are at risk in the former 
Yugoslavia.
<P>
	We have learned directly from the Canadian camp at Visoko 
that earlier today Bosnian Muslims placed five anti-tank mines 
and two rocket propelled grenade launchers across the entrance 
to our base there.
<P>
	The Bosnian Muslims have reportedly told our forces that 
they may not leave the camp and to attempt to do so would invite 
military retaliation. This means that in effect 700 more 
Canadian soldiers are now the hostages of yet another warring 
faction in Bosnia.
<P>
	Canadians are rightly concerned about the safety of our 
peacekeepers and disturbed by the escalating nature of the 
conflict.
<P>
	Can the minister of defence confirm that this is the situation 
facing our peacekeepers in Visoko and update the House on the 
prospects for their release?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can 
confirm that for the past number of days access to our camp at 
Visoko has been restricted. This is something we deem to be 
totally unacceptable. We have conveyed our feelings to the 
Bosnian government and there are discussions now under way 
between the base commander and local military commanders.
<P>
	I think all Canadians feel some anger at the fact that the base 
in Visoko has operated for three years with the acquiescence of 
the Muslim majority; the soldiers there have performed 
incredibly good tasks in bringing medical and other 
humanitarian aid to people largely of Muslim origin; and now, 
three years after the fact, the Bosnian government denies access 
to our camp. It is something that is unacceptable and is 
something that we as Canadians will not tolerate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we share the minister's consternation but the question 
is: What are we going to do about it? We have gone from a dozen 
hostages to 700 and instead of delivering humanitarian aid our 
troops are now in need of food, water and supplies.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	It is our understanding that 20 Canadians stationed at the two 
observation posts outside Visoko will run out of rations by 
Friday and the 700 soldiers held at the base have only enough 
food to last for two weeks.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14225"> 14225 </A></B>
<P>
	What steps is the government taking to ensure the safe 
passage of supplies to our soldiers in and around Visoko and is 
the government taking any direct leadership role in this matter 
or merely leaving negotiations up to the local commander?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Reform Party and its leader seem to think solutions can be 
instant in the very difficult situation in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	During the 20 days we had members of our armed forces 
detained all we heard from that party were not constructive 
suggestions but ``why have you not done anything, why don't 
you have any results?'' The way that situation turned out, the 
calm diplomacy using the appropriate channels to gain the 
release of our people at Ilijas and Captain Rechner and Captain 
LaPalm was the right way to go about it.
<P>
	If hon. members of the Reform Party were directing Canada's 
defence policy, who knows what danger our troops would be in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, no one is advocating instant solutions to this problem. 
We have been consistent on our position with respect to what 
should be done in that part of the world for the last year.
<P>
	Due to the absence of a coherent government policy on 
peacekeeping in Yugoslavia, Canadians soldiers have been from 
one hostage crisis to another.
<P>
	Since November last year Reform has been calling on the 
minister to consider the well-being of our peacekeepers and to 
develop specific criteria for their involvement or their 
disengagement in Bosnia. The government has steadfastly 
refused.
<P>
	Given the increased use of UN soldiers as hostages and 
military pawns and their declining ability to fulfil their original 
humanitarian mandate, will the government make a 
commitment now to withdraw our soldiers from Bosnia as soon 
as possible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
made our position quite clear on this and the Prime Minister has 
stated the government's policy.
<P>
	The hon. member from the Reform Party talks about the 
consistency of their policy. Two weeks ago at the height of the 
hostage crisis when Canadians were held in very precarious 
situations we had talk from that side about Canada retreating 
from the theatre. Then it said its policy was not one of retreat but 
one of withdrawal. When pressed further, withdrawal meant 
taking everybody out, only to go back in with even heavier 
equipment, including F-18 fighter planes.
<P>
	Talk about consistency; it is not there on that side of the 
House.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	Yesterday, the government asked the CRTC for its comments 
on the two draft orders relating to satellite broadcasting. The 
CRTC has until tomorrow to respond, although the Standing 
Committee on Canadian Heritage is still reviewing the matter.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Canadian Heritage justify the fact 
that the final versions of the orders have already been submitted 
to the CRTC for consultation, when the heritage committee has 
not finished discussing the recommendations it will make to the 
government regarding these orders?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is wrong, as she very often is when 
making comments. We will continue to consult the CRTC about 
these orders, as we are required to do under the Broadcasting 
Act.
<P>
	Furthermore, we already have before us the procedure 
followed by Senate and House of Commons committees. The 
order will not be final until cabinet makes a decision following 
40 days of consultation with Parliament and the CRTC.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is really confusing. The government is 
consulting the CRTC, as it is required to do. Does this mean that 
it will have to consult the commission a second time, once the 
minister has taken into account the reports from the other House 
and from the committee?
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	Is this not ultimately some kind of masquerade trampling all 
parliamentary rights because, according to the memo from 
Power Corporation, this family business must be settled as 
quickly as possible?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a little difficult to take seriously the protestations 
of the hon. member about wanting to be consulted when she 
follows them up with ridiculous accusations such as she has.
<P>
	We have followed to the letter the requirements of the 
Broadcasting Act in order to consult with both Parliament and 
the CRTC.
<P>
	Although we have heard these accusations repeated over and 
over, we have not once heard from the hon. member whether she 
agrees with the panel of experts, whose recommendations we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14226"> 14226 </A></B>
<P>
acted on in April, or whether she agrees with the Friends of 
Canadian  Broadcasting, the Consumers Association of Canada 
or any of the groups that have supported the action the 
government has taken. Instead she makes these accusations.
<P>
	I would like to know, since it is clear the government stands 
on behalf of competition and in favour of consumers, choice and 
lower prices, what does the Bloc Quebecois stand for except to 
stand with the proposed monopolies?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday we learned that in its haste to help out government 
friends and relatives of Power Corp. the heritage minister 
presented a draft final cabinet order on direct to home satellites 
to the CRTC before the parliamentary process was completed.
<P>
	The heritage minister has allowed the process to be tainted 
from the outset. He had private meetings with Power Corp. and 
he is letting the CRTC now run amok and again he has violated 
procedure.
<P>
	I respectfully request that the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
respond to this question. Why is the cabinet sending draft final 
orders which benefit Power Corp. to the CRTC before the 
parliamentary process is complete?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would really like to see this draft final order. It must 
be an interesting hybrid.
<P>
	I call the member's attention to the provisions of the 
Broadcasting Act-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sure we all want to listen to the answer. I 
remind hon. members that questions are asked to the 
government and the government may choose to answer any way 
it likes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member made extreme 
allegations concerning the respect for process. I refer her to 
sections 7 and 8 of the Broadcasting Act. If she can identify in 
those provisions anywhere the government has failed to follow 
the provisions of the act, I would like to hear from her about that. 
In the meantime I would also like to hear from her as to the 
position of her party on the report the expert panel made to us 
with respect to satellite broadcasting in Canada.
<P>
	We know the senior political adviser to the leader of the 
Reform Party has already admitted he has been retained by the 
Expressvu consortium. We would like to know what role he has 
played in deciding Reform Party policy on this issue?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are focusing on this draft of final cabinet orders. That is the 
focus of the question.
<P>
	Keith Spicer's office at the CRTC today confirmed the orders 
it received were the final orders.
<P>
	The minister cannot hide behind the Broadcasting Act on this 
one. What we have here is yet another example of how the 
government and this minister are wishing to push aside 
Parliament, ethical standards and the ethics counsellor in order 
to further their own political agenda and benefit their own 
political friends.
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	Why is the minister fast tracking this directive and ignoring 
the parliamentary and Senate committees which he initially 
asked to review the directives?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Frankly, 
Mr. Speaker, the ethical question here is why the member 
persists on standing in the House and making false accusations. 
That is an ethical question.
<P>
	The real question is where that party stands. We set in place 
the process. The process has been transparent and is provided 
for in the Broadcasting Act. We have followed it entirely, 
completely, openly and honestly.
<P>
	This is not a draft final order if such a hybrid thing could exist. 
This is simply a process of consultation with the CRTC. We will 
follow it to its conclusion. There is no final order until cabinet 
makes a final order.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that will only occur after the 40 
days have been completed. If she has one, single, solitary, 
substantive suggestion I would be delighted to hear it.

Manning has been dead since May 1994. We are prepared to pass 
legislation submitted by the minister for DNA testing 
immediately.
<P>
	If the minister does nothing and the DNA evidence 
identifying the positive match is not admissible in court, will the 
justice minister accept personal responsibility for allowing a 
murderer to go free?
<P>

General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a search warrant was

procedures already invoked in the code are not capable of 
producing admissible evidence.

before the end of the session at the end of this week. If the hon.

Speaker, I am sure members share the hon. member's concern 
for the individuals in her constituency who have been impacted 
by this decision by Nortel and have lost their jobs. It is always an 
unfortunate consequence when corporations take decisions with 
respect to restructuring.
<P>
	I would like to point out that there is some good news both for 
Bramalea in this decision where the Nortel is consolidating its 
head office functions. It will operate as the international head 
office for the corporation as well as for Brockville, Ontario 
where 400 new manufacturing jobs have been created.
<P>
	On the broader question, I would like to point out this 
important fact so we understand exactly where our future lies in 
building international trade. Nortel's sales to Canadian 
customers have declined by 45 per cent since 1990. At the same 
time, its export sales are up from $784 million to $2.6 billion 
and Canadian manufacturing jobs have increased by over 1,000 
in that time.
<P>
	Export sales are the way we are going to succeed in the future.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday I asked the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
why he is ignoring the Immigration Act by issuing minister's 
permits to people who were refused entry to Canada.
<P>
	This is no drop in the bucket. There were 7,000 last year. 
Among them were 11 who had been previously deported from 
Canada. First they are out and then the minister lets them back 
in.
<P>
	What is the point of deporting people if the minister is just 
going to sneak them in again through the back door? Why has he 
kept this all a secret until now?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the report of 
ministerial permits is tabled in the House of Commons, I am not 
sure that is keeping anything a secret. Obviously he was asleep 
at the switch.
<P>
	Second, the member failed to mention that out of the 7,000 
ministerial permits only 141 were directed by this minister. He 
failed to mentioned that he and members of his party regularly 
approach me to ask for the issuance of ministerial permits for 
individuals who they think merit them.
<P>
	The member failed to mention that ministerial permits have 
been used more judiciously. In 1990, 19,000 ministerial permits 
were issued. Last year at my direction that number fell to 7,000. 
The member has to be honest with the Canadian public and talk 
about the reasons why ministerial permits are used.
<P>
	The majority of the exceptions are made for individuals who 
come to Canadian hospitals, pay for their medical treatment and 
leave. Some are for individuals on behalf of whom members 
have lobbied for family reunification. Some are for individuals 
who are not criminals but who may have a criminal record for a 
minor theft when they were 18. They have had a probation 
period of 10 years and need a ministerial permit to get into the 
country for the purposes of family reunification.
<P>
	They are trying to paint an ugly picture that does not exist.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this minister refuses to use his authority to deport criminals but 
is not afraid to use his power to let them in. That is incredible.
<P>
	Yesterday CTV reported that Canada is home to several 
confessed former members of death squads and the immigration 
department has been fully aware of their presence for almost 10 
years.
<P>
	Did the minister have personal knowledge of the presence of 
these death squad members? Is he going to give them minister's 
permits so that they can stay forever too?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, he talks about the 11 cases of 
individuals who were deported. We deported over 6,000 people 
last year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14229"> 14229 </A></B>
<P>
	The 11 cases happen to be, for example, individuals who 
failed refugee claims, left the country, subsequently married a 
Canadian and the Canadian has the right to sponsor the person 
in.
<P>
	In other cases, people have overstayed their visits, then given 
a departure notice that turned into a deportation, left the country 
and then subsequently asked to come in on either a temporary 
basis or permanently.
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	There were 11 cases of that type versus 6,000 individuals we 
have deported and this member wants to base the record of 
deportation on those 11 exceptions.
<P>
	With respect to the four cases from Honduras, the difficulty is 
those individuals came to Canada during the mid-1980s. It was 
not until the late eighties and early nineties that information 
about potential war criminal activity came to light. All four are 
being investigated by the RCMP. All four are being pursued by 
my department. One will come to an inquiry with respect to 
deportation so there will not be any minister's permit.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	From 1946 to 1964, the federal government was a trustee of 
the pension fund set up for ex-employees of Singer. As trustee, 
the government paid into the account of the employer, the Singer 
Company, a total of $714,900 in 1964, which is the equivalent of 
$5 million in today's dollars.
<P>
	Does the minister admit that the federal government, which 
was looking after the pension fund established for 
ex-employees of Singer, was a party to the terrible injustice 
done to them by unduly paying pension fund returns to the 
employer rather than the workers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic

concern about the ex-employees of Singer.
<P>
	However, I remind him that the Quebec Superior Court has 
already ruled the federal government is not a party to this 
particular transaction. The matter is presently being seized by 
the court. We expect to have a further ruling some time this 
summer and early fall. Therefore it is not appropriate for me to 
make a comment on the specific case until the courts have had an 
opportunity to dispense with it in their normal good judgment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the	case now before the courts has to do with Quebec pensions. The question I am asking the minister relates to government annuities, for which he is responsible.
<P>
	Can the minister confirm to us that his government has in its

which clearly recognize his responsibility and his mistake in the 
matter concerning the ex-employees of Singer?

indicated to him very clearly that if he or the ex-employees had 
any information concerning federal involvement they would 
like to present, I would be very pleased to receive it and review 
the case. I have yet to hear from the hon. member.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-89, an act to provide for the continuance of the Canadian 
National Railway Company under the Canada Business 
Corporations Act and for the issuance and sale of shares of the 
company to the public, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to discuss at third reading the bill 
concerning the privatization of the Canadian National Railway. 
Although Reform supports the government in this endeavour, 
there are some problems with this legislation that I feel must be 
addressed.
<P>
	First, I would like to take a minute to look at the $96 billion 
that CN has cost the Canadian taxpayer over 70 years in 
combined losses and public subsidies in contrast to CP Rail 
which has cost the Canadian taxpayers zero in direct 
government subsidy.
<P>
	Canada is $540 billion in debt, yet crown corporations like 
this one continue to run in the red without repercussions. Where 
can we find a deal like that in the private sector? We cannot. 
Companies go bankrupt and it is game over. Therefore, we 
support the government in getting out of the rail business.
<P>
	Despite these massive losses, however, CN managed in the 
past year to earn a $245 million profit which is a drop in the 
bucket when we consider the overall picture. CN's debt is 
currently about $2.5 billion. Industry representatives say that 
the debt must be reduced to $1.5 billion to achieve a triple bond 
rating and be able to sell it.
<P>
	I found an interesting article in <I>Alberta Report</I> dated May 29, 
1995 which states: ``CN's debt is unacceptable. Even if CN 
dumped its non-rail assets, its debt to capitalization ratio would 
be 45 per cent. The U.S. railway average is 30 per cent. In 
addition, U.S. railways have improved operating cost to revenue 
ratios from 90 per cent to as little as 75 per cent. CN is still at 90 
per cent''.
<P>
	The transport minister has the power to reduce CN's debt to 
any amount he chooses which could mean an amount well below 
the amount for which taxpayers would see a return. How this 
debt is reduced is of great concern to companies like CP Rail, its 
main competitor whose president stated before the transport 
committee that CN would get an unfair advantage if Ottawa paid 
off some of its debt.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14231"> 14231 </A></B>
<P>
	Moody's Investors Service issued a credit watch on CN's 
large debt in early May. I cannot believe how much we keep 
hearing the name Moody's these days in relation to finance with 
respect to this government. As we all know, a downgraded debt 
rating will make it more difficult and more expensive for CN to 
borrow the $2.53 billion it wants to buy new equipment by 1999.
<P>
	I am going to dwell on another issue for a little bit longer than 
normal. It is an important issue. The bill requires that the 
headquarters of CN be located in Montreal permanently. I could 
understand placing a restriction to keep the headquarters in the 
city of purchase for a period of time, say five years, to see if that 
is the best place to keep it and the best place to run the business 
out of, but no, this has to be in perpetuity which is not the way to 
sell a company. In today's marketplace, the stipulation of the 
permanent location of a head office is absurd and makes a 
mockery of a bill that has a serious intent.
<P>
	I respect the Minister of Transport. He has intestinal 
fortitude. Only a short year and a half ago the Prime Minister 
was against deregulation and privatization of the rail system but 
the minister has convinced him otherwise. Having said that and 
giving him that compliment, why is he placing this restriction on 
the sale? It is political.
<P>
	I was reading an interesting article that represents the view 
from the west. It was written by Mr. Ted Byfield, the founder of 
<I>Western Report</I>, <I>Alberta Report</I> and <I>B.C. Report</I> magazines. He 
submitted the article to Saturday's <I>Financial Post</I>. I will quote 
from what he wrote. I will use the technique the chief 
government whip used all the time while in opposition of giving 
lengthy quotes and testimonials of key and intelligent people 
who add and shed some light on a subject. That is what Mr. 
Byfield does. The article states in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Why, you have to ask, must the purchaser of Canadian National be required to 
maintain the head office in Montreal?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Such is one of the conditions the federal government has attached to the sale 
and the reason is purely political.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Something like 70 per cent of CN's business is done west of the lakehead and 
the western share has been increasing for the last quarter century. CN is, in other 
words, essentially a western Canadian company.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	I will skip a little piece and go down a couple of paragraphs:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Perhaps true, Ottawa would reply, yet from its inception 75 years ago CN has 
been headquartered in Montreal, and such historical associations matter more 
than where most of the business is actually done.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How different is this case to the one made when it was proposed to move 
Trans-Canada Airlines, ancestor of Air Canada-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-a problem which the Prime Minister was very much involved 
in-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-out of its traditional headquarters in Winnipeg.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At that time, westerners argued that by tradition TCA was a Winnipeg based 
company, which indeed it was. Ah yes, said Ottawa, but we must face the fact that 
more and more of TCA's business is in eastern Canada. So piece by piece the 
company's head office operations were moved to Montreal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When tradition favours the west, tradition does not matter; what counts is 
where the business is done. But when tradition favours Quebec, where the 
business is done does not matter; what counts is tradition.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is just the opposite. Mr. Byfield goes on to say that Montreal 
will not even be part of the same country in which CN does most 
of its business if the separation issue is settled by a yes vote.
<P>
	Based on what I just read by Mr. Byfield, is the Liberal 
government forcing CN to stay in Montreal because it does not 
want to be seen as promoting the loss of a major Montreal head 
office on the eve of a vote on separation? Do the Liberals feel 
that Quebecers and Canadians outside of Quebec are that naive 
that they do not know it is a political move? Do they feel that 
Canadians are so ill informed that they would not see what this 
is?
<P>
	Do the Liberals not see as a government that the best way to 
sell a company is to allow the potential owners to do what they 
want with that company once they make the capital investment 
to buy it and take the risk to run it, a company that has lost $96 
billion since its inception? Does that not make sense?
<P>
	Why in heaven's name would they impose these restrictions in 
light of the need to get out from under the continued government 
subsidy of the crown corporation? What are the Alberta Liberals 
doing to represent the interests of their constituents on this 
matter? What are the the Liberal members from Edmonton 
doing to exert any influence over the Minister of Transport, to 
try and talk some sense into the minister who, other than in two 
or three areas of the bill, is missing the boat? He is on the right 
track but why not do it 100 per cent right? Why jeopardize the 
potential sale of this asset which is so import to sell. In order to 
sell it the right factors have to be in play.
<P>
	Let me get back to another comment made by Mr. Byfield in 
his article in the <I>Financial Post</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Then, too, you wonder about that select set, the four Liberal MPs from 
Alberta. All four are from Edmonton. And if the CN head office with maybe a 
thousand jobs attached were to move out of Montreal, where would it go? Where 
is the CN's centre of operations in the west? Edmonton, that is where. So why 
haven't these four, at least within caucus, protested against that provision? 
Maybe they have.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We do not know because we are not privy to the Liberal caucus 
meetings except what gets leaked on integrity and cracking the 
whip and voting the party line. We hear about those things. But 
no such objections have been reported.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14232"> 14232 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And what about Edmonton city council members who tirelessly talk of their 
diligent labours to bring industry into their city and who wail so piteously every 
time another business departs for Calgary? What have they done? Delegation to 
Ottawa, maybe? Nope. Pressure on the Liberal MPs, perhaps? Nothing. For 
every buck CN makes in and around Montreal, it probably makes 20 in the 
Edmonton region.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I submit for that reason and that reason alone the person who 
will look at these assets and at the cash flow of this company is 
going to look at where the revenue is derived, where the business 
is. As I said earlier, I do not mind if they maintain the head office 
in the city of Montreal for a minimum period of five years, but 
after the owners should be given the flexibility to run the 
business the way they want to. A permanent location for their 
head office should not be imposed. That is completely ludicrous 
and ridiculous. Any business person would agree with that 
comment.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	There will be no restrictions on foreign ownership of CN 
shares, but no individual shareholder either domestic or foreign 
will be able to own more than 15 per cent of the shares 
outstanding. Personally I think that is ridiculous.
<P>
	I was in the business sector for about 25 years before I became 
a politician. I have purchased a lot of companies and I have 
looked at the assets of a lot of companies. One of the things that 
business people look at, the people who want to run successful 
corporations, is control. If they do not have control they cannot 
run a successful company. A corporation run by people who do 
not have a vested interest, a significant interest, and who do not 
have a lot at risk, at times do not care enough to pay attention to 
all the details to make proper decisions in the best interest of the 
corporation.
<P>
	I have a suggestion rather than limiting ownership to 15 per 
cent. There are ways to help the Minister of Transport whom I 
truly respect. I am trying to make it a better bill or a better way to 
sell the company. This is serious. The corporation is for sale and 
we need to raise $2 billion. We must have the right ingredients at 
work or at play to achieve a quick and effective sale. The longer 
it drags out the worse it gets and the more it hinders the 
government and hurts Canadians, because we will have to 
continue to subsidize the rail line.
<P>
	Why not offer the shares to Canadians first? Why not set a 
time limit of 60 days for an unlimited number of shares? Then 
we could put them on the global market. If the majority of shares 
are not picked up by Canadians or people from Canada, if less 
than 60 per cent are sold, Canadians have no right to come back 
on the government to complain.
<P>
	I am giving the government a suggestion to satisfy Canadians, 
Canadian content, the right to buy Canadian, and the right to 
participate as Canadians. If Canadians do not step up to the 
plate, if they do not want to take the risk and if they do not want 
to invest, so be it. However they should be at least given the first 
opportunity in  return for the $96 billion they have subsidized 
the company for over the last 70 years. They deserve at least that 
much. Wherever the percentage falls it should then be offered to 
the global market. If only 30 per cent or 40 per cent have been 
sold to Canadians, we should let other people buy control or 
control it. Canadians cannot then hold the government 
responsible or accountable for doing that.
<P>
	We need to have many people available to purchase the 
corporation. We need to make it available to as many people as 
possible, but I maintain Canadians first and a lifting of the 15 
per cent limit.
<P>
	In all cases sell or make control available. However, by 
making the shares available and control available the 
government can still impose restrictions on the competition for 
making the shares available to the competition so a monopoly 
cannot be achieved. That can be done through government 
regulation.
<P>
	That is what the purpose of government should be. It should 
pass good regulations to ensure fairness and competitiveness in 
the marketplace, to create an open and competitive marketplace, 
to have regulations in place that do not allow monopolies to 
exist in the business sector, and to allow the private sector to 
operate openly, freely and competitively but not in a family 
compact way where one corporation is allowed to buy up 
everything and there is no competition.
<P>
	Any government on that side of the House must always 
protect the interest of all Canadians. It must always have 
competition as its first priority.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	I should like to touch upon the Official Languages Act as well. 
It says in the bill that CN will remain subject to the Official 
Languages Act as if it were still a government agency. Will the 
people who want to buy the company, the eventual directors of 
the company, not know where to advertise in two languages, 
where to advertise in one language, or where to have people on 
the rail lines who are bilingual or unilingual? These people have 
enough intelligence, if they put that much money at risk, to 
know what is in the best interest of the corporation and how to 
increase sales and service.
<P>
	To impose rules like these make it negative. The owners 
should be given the option. They will not be people who have 
never made a dollar before. They will not be people who do not 
know how to market. Obviously they will be people who know 
how to make a dollar and what it takes to make a dollar. They 
will satisfy the needs of the people they serve. Be they 
francophone or anglophone or a combination, they will be able 
to project and present their rates, their trips and their packages 
in the language they feel is necessary to offer the services. A rule 
like this one is a restriction. It is not something that helps, aids 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14233"> 14233 </A></B>
<P>
and facilitates the sale. It restricts, hinders and hurts the 
potential sale.
<P>
	Reform Party policy on privatization and corporations is that 
we support placing ownership and control in corporations in the 
private or public sector that can perform their functions most 
cost effectively with the greatest accountability to the owners 
and the least likelihood of incurring public debt.
<P>
	If it is a public corporation the taxpayers own it and they 
entrust the government, the people they elect, to look after it. 
But it does not. Most of the crown corporations we have end up 
being arm's length, quasi-judicial or whatever claptrap they talk 
about where ministers will not take responsibility.
<P>
	The minister of heritage will not take responsibility for the 
CRTC. The minister of immigration will not take responsibility 
for the IRB. I will find something the Minister of Justice will not 
take responsibility for; I have not thought of it yet. However I 
am sure there is something on which he can stand and say that it 
is not his fault because it is an arm's length body, and the 
taxpayers are the ones who are paying for it.
<P>
	We have a situation where we believe the sector that can look 
after taxpayers' dollars the best and the sector that can achieve 
the highest profit and run the business the best could be the 
private sector. We believe 85 per cent to 90 per cent of the time it 
will be the private sector but not necessarily. Therefore we need 
some rules for crown corporations and some elements that 
ensure taxpayers' dollars are looked after.
<P>
	The Reform Party compliments the Minister of Transport for 
recommending and convincing cabinet to go forward with Bill 
C-89 and the privatization of CN Rail. However, as I have 
outlined in my speech today, we would like to see some of the 
roadblocks removed from the legislation, just as was wanted 
with the bill of the Minister of Justice on gun control. We gave 
him innumerable recommendations. He could have been the 
most popular justice minister in the country if he had split the 
bill. It was a very simple recommendation. There could have 
been the bill on gun control, punishment for the criminal misuse 
of firearms, and a discussion on a national registration system. 
The Liberals never promised registration in their red book; they 
promised gun control. The minister delivered on half of his 
promise and introduced a completely brand new element.
<P>
	I do not know how the minister drafted Bill C-89. Our 
transport critic has already mentioned that when the Prime 
Minister was on this side of the House he said that he was 
astonished at the Conservative recommendation of deregulation 
in the rail industry. How quickly they change colours. How 
quickly red becomes blue. How quickly the little fish in the bowl 
that are blue and red get together and suddenly become one 
colour when they are on that side of the House. It does not matter 
what they say on this side; they change when they go on that 
side. Unfortunately it will come back to haunt the government.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	I wrap up by saying I compliment the government on its 
attempt to privatize. I hope it listens to the abolishment of the 
headquarters in Montreal and the 15 per cent rule. It should open 
it up to real business people and entrepreneurs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I should like to make a couple of quick comments and 
then ask the member some questions.
<P>
	I have one comment about the Prime Minister's decision to 
allow CN to be privatized. It is pretty well known in this place, 
and the Prime Minister has said it publicly many times, that he 
does not always get his way. If cabinet makes a decision, like the 
rest of us who believe in the party process he will support the 
majority of opinion. That is difficult on that side over there 
where they try to play the smoke and mirrors game of their 
leader letting them do what they like when we all know he is 
probably the most draconian person in the place when it comes 
to not letting his members do what they want.
<P>
	From a railroader's perspective and being the only railroader 
in the House, I have a bit of an advantage over my colleague 
from Calgary. He talked about the fact that there was problem 
with having Montreal designated as the place to keep CN 
headquarters.
<P>
	Reformers continually tell us that they use the age old ability 
to find out what people think by going out and consulting. I was 
on the transport committee. My colleague opposite was also on 
the committee. We listened to many people talk about the effects 
of Montreal being the headquarters. We asked the investment 
bankers what they thought. The gentleman opposite being a 
business person would know that bankers are important people 
to ask. What did they say? They said that there would be no 
effect.
<P>
	Let me tell the House why. What is in Montreal at head office? 
There is a central calling bureau for railroaders. For people out 
there who do not know, it is a huge enterprise where every 
railroader who works for CN is called. It is a major undertaking 
that cost CN some $30 million to put into place in the last few 
years. To have that completely changed and transferred to 
another system would cost millions of dollars. Also, at CN or CP 
there is a central power bureau where every locomotive in the 
country is designated for a particular train or a particular piece 
of track. One would think it was outer space with all the 
technology involved there. To move the whole process to 
Edmonton or Calgary would cost the corporation literally 
millions of dollars.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14234"> 14234 </A></B>
<P>
	It would not cost a cent of the sale of CN to maintain the 
headquarters in Montreal. Quite frankly it is good business 
practice to do so. Therefore the investment bankers have said to 
us that there is no problem.
<P>
	On the 15 per cent retention I want to comment that CP, a 
privately owned company, does not have a restriction. In fact the 
most of CP owned by an individual is 11 per cent.
<P>
	Investment bankers are saying on the one hand that there is no 
cost effect to having Montreal designated as the headquarters. In 
fact it would be worse if we tried to leave it open and someone 
suggested for political reasons because of the sovereignist and 
separatist problems in Montreal that we should move it. It would 
hurt the company if someone suggested it for political reasons. 
Leaving it there for stability reasons is a much more appropriate 
process.
<P>
	CP is a private corporation. It has never had anyone purchase 
more than 11 per cent of the company. Investment bankers do 
not believe the 15 per cent limitation will have any effect on the 
sale.
<P>
	Why would the Reform Party be so adamant that they are 
impediments to the sale and getting a good price for CN when 
they are not by reason of sound investment bankers, 
consultations the government has made and what we have heard 
as a committee from witnesses? Is that not what the Reform 
Party says it is all about: if people tell us it makes good sense 
then do it? We have been told it makes good sense. Why is the 
Reform Party not supporting that when everyone we have talked 
to says that it makes good sense and it will not affect the sale 
price?
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's 
intervention and I respect what he said, because a lot of what he 
says has a lot of merit. Possibly even there could be two 
directors around the same table just having a difference of 
opinion on how to approach a problem.
<P>
	I heard another comment. I promised I would never have 
rabbit ears, but there is a certain individual whose voice is so 
loud that I just have to say that when they tell me I do not 
understand, let me tell that hon. member that I do understand. I 
have been in business for a long time. I know what it takes to buy 
and sell businesses and how to make a profit and how to achieve 
a bottom line.
<P>
	We have a railroader here debating with a businessman. 
Maybe he is the only railroader. I know I am not the only 
businessman, but along with the Minister of Finance and the 
member for Edmonton South I may be one of the few successful 
businessmen here whose comments are made in sincerity, not 
partisan politics. We are talking business here. We are talking 
privatization and how it should be done. I submit these 
suggestions on the basis that I feel that the government and the 
Minister of Transport should reconsider these issues.
<P>
	On the question of Montreal, I did agree that there was some 
sense to keeping the headquarters in Montreal for the sake of 
stability. I would agree with that member that stability is 
important, that to allow a new purchaser to lift up, pull out, and 
do what they wanted initially would be a mistake. But that 
stability should have a time factor on it. It should not be in 
perpetuity. It should be long enough that the people who are 
running the company, the board of directors, can have five years. 
It could be three, it could be eight, it could be ten. I do not care 
about the number, but eliminate that forever clause.
<P>
	They can try it and see whether leaving Montreal is in the best 
interests of the corporation. They can choose then where to 
move the corporation. Anybody who buys a company should 
have that freedom and flexibility. I believe that will attract and 
help those people who would be bothered by that and 
handicapped by that. It would eliminate that, which in the long 
run would be negative. In the short run it is a positive, but if you 
really want to attract investors you have to look at the long term, 
not the short term.
<P>
	On the issue of control and the 15 per cent, I do not care what 
CP did. It does not matter to me whether there is 11 per cent or 
10 per cent or 9 per cent. It does not matter. What I am 
suggesting here is that we have a quick and effective sale. The 
way to do that is to give Canadians the first opportunity. We 
know that the market is hot. The marketplace is hot right now. 
There are people willing to part with billions of dollars. There 
are investment funds, mutual funds, investors and dealers 
looking for places to place pension moneys. There is lots of 
money out there.
<P>
	If there are individuals with an expertise in this area and they 
feel they could buy control and that 16 per cent would give them 
that control, let that sophisticated purchaser buy that 16 per 
cent, or whatever amount would be control.
<P>
	By the very nature of how CP operates, nobody is going to buy 
51 per cent. Nobody is going to buy that much. If they can figure 
out that by buying this amount they could get control, great. But 
let us give it first to Canadian corporations and give them an 
opportunity for a certain period of time and after that open it up. 
I will submit that at the end, if these suggestions were at least 
addressed and looked at, the sale would be quicker. The sale 
would come about. It would not be a bastardized deal like some 
of the other crown corporations we have tried to sell, where we 
only end up selling off half of it and not all of it. We end up in 
trouble and it lags there.
<P>
	These are the things I am trying to recommend to the 
government. With respect, I tried to answer this as a 
businessman to a railroader who is also a businessman, 
businessman to businessman, to try to achieve a consensus. I 
still think we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14235"> 14235 </A></B>
<P>
should go after the Minister of Transport and get him to change 
his mind on a few of these issues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a short question if I 
could.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	I respect this member as a business person too, but the effect 
of what he is suggesting would cause the exact reverse. His 
colleague put forward an amendment indicating that we should 
offer it to Canadians first. We agree that in order to effectively 
get the value of shares for Canadian taxpayers for CN we need to 
have a broadly based offer in North America. We know there is 
not enough capital in Canada. To suggest that Canadians are 
lining up to buy 15 per cent, which is worth at least $200 million, 
I do not know of many pension funds and individuals who can 
afford to pay 15 per cent.
<P>
	The second thing is that if in fact we want to achieve a 100 per 
cent sale and maximum value for Canadians, we cannot impose 
restrictions to say let us sell it to Canadians first and then let 
somebody else buy the rest. It is impossible to achieve that. We 
agree. And we want to achieve the maximum value.
<P>
	The board of directors for CP, a private corporation, have 
decided that Montreal should be its headquarters and 70 per cent 
of its business is also out west. How does he rationalize that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, the only comment I would make 
to the parliamentary secretary is that he underestimates the 
wealth in Canada. He underestimates the willingness of 
Canadians to take a risk and to invest. There is a lot of money in 
Canadian pocketbooks. The oil and gas industry has seen that in 
the past two years. Petro-Canada should be the next one on their 
plate. It should be done quickly. It should not be waited upon. 
The $1 billion or $2 billion that could get is all there-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, the time has 
expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, since I 
represent the riding of Lévis, where 500 people work for CN in 
Charny, and since one of the main assets to be privatized under 
Bill C-89 is the Pont de Québec, one of whose supporting 
structures is located in my riding, it is quite easy to understand 
why I wish to participate in the third reading debate on this bill 
to privatize CN.
<P>
	When this bill was tabled in the House, my first reaction was 
to consult with my constituents, with workers and their families, 
with the people who live with CN workers in Charny, to find out 
what they thought. The first comment I heard took me by 
surprise. These people were not against privatizing CN for the 
following reason: They thought it could not be any worse than 
the way CN has been managed in the last 10 years. Although 
they were not enthusiastic about privatization, they almost 
preferred this option to the way CN has been managed, 
especially in recent months.
<P>
	In this context, the House will remember Bill C-77, which 
forced CN, VIA Rail and CP employees back to work, and the 
three unprecedented steps taken to cut off debate on this bill in 
the House, while Ogilvie workers have been waiting for two 
years for an anti-scab law that could speed up settlement of their 
dispute.
<P>
	The reason why workers faced with a bludgeon law, with 
several years of mismanagement at CN, with CN management's 
failure to listen to them, are not against privatization is 
obviously because they figure that purgatory is better than hell.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	I would also like to recall a point which was not emphasized 
much here. After the unprecedented promotional effort by CN's 
president, Paul Tellier, during the last election campaign, which 
took him to the U.S. for the World Congress of Railway 
Companies held in Louisiana, a colour picture was published in 
<I>Le Soleil</I>. I will never forget this, for Tellier had been advocating 
selling CN at reduced price and at any cost. He was telling 
everyone that the company was for sale because-what a great 
selling feature-of lack of productivity and the fact that the 
business was not doing well. It was so terrible; CN was 
unprofitable. He said it carried losses of about $80 million a 
year, adding that it was unacceptable and that CN should be sold 
as soon as possible.
<P>
	That was during the election campaign and, at the time, the 
Liberals never said a word about privatizing CN. There is no 
mention of this in their red book.
<P>
	In this context, a few weeks after Bill C-77 was passed ``full 
steam ahead''-I am using this expression deliberately since we 
are dealing with railways-Bill C-89 was introduced. And this 
morning, as we get ready to vote in third reading on Bill C-89, 
there is a transport bill, whose number I do not know because I 
think it has not been given one yet.
<P>
	What does this piece of legislation say in essence? Having 
attended the briefing session the officials delegated by the 
minister gave while he was tabling his bill in this House, I can 
tell you what it says. It says basically one thing: deregulation. In 
the neo-Liberal mind, this means eliminate as many regulations 
as possible and make things as easy as possible for the public 
sector.
<P>
	However, my review of the history of Canada and Quebec 
shows that Canadian railways were almost at the origin of the 
Canadian Confederation. We all recall the fine speeches made 
by key political figures of the time, by Sir John A. Macdonald in 
particular, who insisted that the vast country of Canada should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14236"> 14236 </A></B>
<P>
have a public railway system linking every region and that 
railways were almost sacrosanct to this country.
<P>
	So what is Bill C-89 doing? It is taking away this sacred value 
by privatizing the railway system. CN will become a private 
company like any other. However, the purpose of Bill C-89, and 
particularly that of the new transport legislation which was 
before the House this morning, is to make life for private 
companies even easier than was the case for Crown 
corporations. Let me relate something quite pertinent.
<P>
	When CN was a public corporation, under the 1987 and 1902 
acts, all agreed that the legislation was limiting, that it was 
harsh. However, we had a crown corporation under the control of 
the Minister of Transport, and we had some influence in that we 
could democratically express our dissatisfaction whenever an 
election was held.
<P>
	But now, at the same time as the decision to sell CN is made, 
the government tables a bill to deregulate. Why? It is to be able 
to face U.S. competition by allowing CN's new shareholders and 
managers to compete with Americans.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	At first glance, that decision may seem to make sense, but 
there is a danger. Indeed, the Bloc Quebecois feels, as the 
Reform Party pointed out, that Bill C-89 is dangerous because, 
while the government is deregulating in American fashion, in a 
free trade context, it leaves a former public corporation totally 
in the hands of the private sector. Moreover, the government 
gives Americans an opportunity to control that corporation. If 
the Americans have that possibility, they will look after their 
own interests, which is perfectly normal. This concerns us.
<P>
	This is why, even using the approach proposed by the Reform 
Party, Canadians from all regions, including Quebecers, should 
have been given priority in terms of buying at least a majority of 
the shares. But no, the Liberal argues that there is not enough 
money, not enough assets, not enough people in the Canadian 
private sector who are interested in buying the corporation and 
that, consequently, it has to open the door to foreign investors.
<P>
	We are told that the assets total some $2.5 billion. We are also 
told by a company hired by CN to evaluate these assets that 
Canadians represent a potential of only $750 million. So, the 
government privatizes, but admits from the outset that the 
former public corporation, which was set up to serve Canada's 
economic interests from east to west at the time the Canadian 
confederation was established, will now be under foreign 
control.
<P>
	Quite frankly, I find it very hard to get enthusiastic about this 
change. Although I am a sovereignist, I cannot stand by and let 
the rest of Canada be dispossessed of one of its main legacies, 
the railways.
<P>
	I cannot help but notice that Liberal members across the way 
are giving up their turns and becoming strangely silent on the 
subject of Canada's main railway company, which they want to 
privatize and risk leaving in American or foreign hands.
<P>
	Although their silence may be due to discomfort, I get the 
impression that it is more likely caused by their desire to go on 
holiday as soon as possible and by this government's 
carelessness and lack of vision.
<P>
	As I said at the beginning and as I reminded the House, the 
Bloc Quebecois is not necessarily against the principle of 
privatizing CN, but not under these conditions, which may lead 
to possible majority control by foreigners. We were against this. 
We expressed our position by tabling our amendment.
<P>
	We also said that CN is evading its responsibilities by not 
giving adequate guarantees to CN employees, who have faced 
repeated cuts in recent years. These employees live in a climate 
of insecurity in which the top manager, Paul Tellier, was paid a 
huge salary-$345,000 per year, a home for which he received a 
no-interest loan, and handsome perks-to travel around the 
world promoting CN, although ``depromoting'' or demoting-if 
I may use these words-would be more adequate terms since he 
explained how terrible this company was.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	As far as Bill C-77 is concerned, we listen to and watch the 
advertising, we read the CN report with its nice colours, and 
everything seems to be fine. Although we cannot show it, it is 
red but has nothing to do with the red book. It refers to a shift in 
policy.
<P>
	The 1994 CN report, which I saw this morning at the briefing, 
says that everything is hunky-dory at CN. In a few months, we 
made $279 million in profits. That is quite something. Yet, CN 
must be sold as quickly as possible.
<P>
	Can you imagine the effect of such an announcement on 
employees, on Canadians, on Quebecers? It took the incredible 
Mr. Tellier a year to accomplish the feat of making this 
supposedly money-losing company profitable. But he wants to 
sell it any way. I am trying to draw a parallel, in order to 
understand.
<P>
	When the Liberals came to office, the Conservatives had 
decided to privatize Pearson airport in Toronto. The Liberals, 
with the Prime Minister in the lead, said that they would not 
stand for that. Why? For one thing, Pearson airport was said to 
be one of the only, if not the only airport in Canada to turn a 
profit. Not only was the main airport in terms of traffic, but it 
was also profitable. Why privatize this airport then if it can 
bring in revenue for the government?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14237"> 14237 </A></B>
<P>
	In his report, Mr. Tellier says that CN is now a profitable 
business. After four or five years of making losses, now that the 
company is making a profit, it should be sold. Let us look to the 
future. This company must be sold at all costs as soon as 
possible; so, let us pass a bludgeon bill.
<P>
	Under the terms of the mediator's report released on June 14 
or 15, CN employees have to accept the conditions set, 
indirectly, by the government. There is this urgent need to sell 
CN before the fall regardless of the profits that can be made. I 
must confess that the Liberal government's logic eludes me at 
times. It is hard to see.
<P>
	At the same time, we must look at something else. Small 
airports like the one in Sainte-Foy, Quebec, which while being 
called international apparently are not profitable, are also to be 
privatized. Unless the municipalities and regions take it over-I 
took this example and, in this particular case, activities would 
be commercialized without ownership being affected-but there 
is also Rimouski, Mont-Joli, Baie Comeau, all those are not 
turning profits.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport is asking local communities to take 
over the operation of these airports, otherwise, after a while, 
they will be closed down. Where is the logic in that? You do not 
turn a profit, we close you down. CN is turning a profit, yet it is 
being sold. Why? It does not make any sense to me.
<P>
	I am no expert in transport, but people ask me why this change 
in policy, why sell CN now that business is good after several 
bad years. They cannot understand this change, especially after 
the Chrétien government prevented the privatization of Pearson 
airport.
<P>
	I do not know if I have much time remaining. Two minutes. 
That is just enough time to tell you about the two pillars of the 
Pont de Québec.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	The other night, between 1.30 and 2 a.m., the hon. member for 
Louis-Hébert and myself raised the issue of the Pont de Québec 
to try to influence the government regarding the privatization of 
CN's assets. After all, this is a majority government and it can 
make any decision it wants. We mentioned the fact that 
Canadian railway companies are true symbols. The old Pont de 
Québec is also a symbol of federalism in our region.
<P>
	However, the bridge is falling into decay, just like federalism, 
at least in the Quebec City region. The bridge is falling into 
ruins. On a more serious note, Madam Speaker, do you think that 
a private company will be interested in investing $40 million to 
restore the old bridge? Or will that company say: the federal 
government built the bridge, so it is its responsibility; if it wants 
us to repair it in the medium term, then it has to give us the $40 
million required.
<P>
	We tabled in this House an amendment which essentially said: 
we will support privatization, but will the government guarantee 
that the $40 million will be paid to CN, so that work on the 
bridge can start within a year? The government never gave us an 
answer. No answer. In that context, and given the social 
conditions of the employees, as well as the lack of respect shown 
for Canada's railway heritage, the official opposition will 
oppose this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member indicated a 
number of employees live in his riding. As well, in London, 
Ontario there are a number of CN employees.
<P>
	We have through the CN privatization bill encouraged them to 
be involved in the ownership. We believe that will be good for 
the new corporation. Each employee will be able to buy shares in 
the company which will give them a more meaningful role in the 
affairs of Canadian National.
<P>
	We wanted to ensure the employees knew their pensions 
would be protected in a number of ways. The Pensions Act and a 
number of safeguards Parliament has passed over the years will 
ensure each one of those pensioners and the people who work for 
CN now and in the future will have guaranteed pensions.
<P>
	The hon. member is right, the privatization of Canadian 
National was not in our red book. What was in our red book was 
to build an efficient, affordable and integrated transportation 
system, be it in air, in marine or in rail.
<P>
	We believe CN does not have to serve the public policy role. 
That is for governments to deal with in terms of regional 
economic development and so on. A railroad is a railroad and 
should be allowed to function as a railroad so it can provide the 
services it must to its customers.
<P>
	We believe a privatized CN will be better for the country, 
better for its employees and better obviously for its clients. It 
will be stronger and able to manage a number of things without 
the encumbrances of government.
<P>
	Therefore the deregulation package we put forward in the 
House today will ensure a viable rail industry for CP, CN and the 
creation of short line industries. Unless the country can move its 
goods and services in the most efficient and cost effective 
manner, we will not be able to deliver or export our goods and 
nobody will have a job. We need an efficient and affordable 
transportation system. That is what CN privatization is all about 
and that is what the deregulatory process is all about.
<P>
	The member spent some time talking about the Quebec 
bridge. If he had spoken to his colleague he would have known 
CN has an obligation to maintain that bridge. A letter from Mr. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14238"> 14238 </A></B>
<P>
Tellier to the Quebec transport  minister indicates the bridge is 
in need of repair, but there are studies which indicate it is safe.
<P>
	It also has indicated that perhaps the province of Quebec 
ought to pay its fair share for the maintenance of the bridge. 
While it is very important for rail traffic, 75 per cent of the 
traffic on the bridge is vehicular, which comes under the 
jurisdiction of the provincial government.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	We heard from people in committee who talked about the 
historical significance of the Quebec bridge. We believe in that 
as well. They are prepared to raise money. They are prepared to 
look at ways of restoring its historical significance.
<P>
	I wonder if the member has heard from the minister of 
transport in Quebec as to whether Quebec is prepared to pay its 
fair share for the bridge to ensure it is safe and properly 
maintained for historical and transportation purposes. Has he 
heard from the minister or will he undertake to the House that he 
can use his good offices to talk to the PQ about paying its fair 
share?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, it will be a pleasure to answer the 
question put by the hon. member for London East.
<P>
	First of all, regarding the Pont de Québec, since that is the 
main thrust of his question, I think that basically, it all boils 
down to the federal government's habit, inspired by Minister 
Martin himself, of offloading its responsibilities onto the 
provinces.
<P>
	The bridge was built by the federal government and used by 
CN. The Government of Quebec already pays an annual fee for 
use of the paved section, but the bridge was built for Canadian 
National. Quebec has already done its share under an agreement 
which, I believe, was for forty years.
<P>
	Quebec pays this fee under the agreement. However, the 
federal government now claims that because of inflation, 
although it certainly is not excessive these days, the Quebec 
government should help the federal government meet its 
obligations. This is fantastic.
<P>
	I think that in Quebec like anywhere else, when you have a 
tenant-landlord relationship, the tenant-and the Quebec 
Minister of Transport made this quite clear-may be willing to 
renegotiate the lease and pay more. This was in fact suggested in 
a letter. The Quebec Minister of Transport said that once the 
repairs had been made, he was prepared to pay for annual 
maintenance, but because the federal government has been 
cutting its maintenance budget for the past ten years, the bridge 
is in a sorry state.
<P>
	In his preamble, the hon. member said that employees in his 
riding were interested in buying shares. Madam Speaker, I want 
the hon. member to listen very carefully. In February of last 
year, at the invitation of the minister, CN employees across 
Canada submitted a purchase offer.  A year later, they got 
together with the actuaries and, using their pension fund, they 
made the same offer, and the response they got from Mr. Tellier, 
president of CN, and from the government, was the 
back-to-work legislation passed in February. That was their 
answer. ``No way''. That was the answer they got.
<P>
	On June 1, the union made the same offer. It is an interesting 
proposition because of the excellent working environment this 
could create. Since the employees would run the company, they 
would not want it to show a deficit. And they would save their 
own jobs. All this was dismissed out of hand. No, they prefer 
grandiose gestures; they prefer to call upon the international 
community while ignoring two or three dimensions that I 
wanted to stress in closing.
<P>
	The railway companies in all of the big European countries, 
France, Germany, etc, are public. Yes, in all of them. Why? 
Because they feel that this public infrastructure is a building 
block which is necessary for regional development. And what 
are we doing in Canada? In addition to the things I said earlier, 
the government is cutting transport subsidies for the regions. 
The hon. member for Ontario and people from the Maritimes 
know this. And why is the government doing this? It wants to 
replace them with new road infrastructures. Some gift. While 
the federal government would contribute to the cost of building 
new roads, the provincial governments will end up having to 
maintain them.
<P>
	We know that during the spring thaw, a single tractor-trailor 
wears down highways as much as more than 17,000 cars, 
according to engineers.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	We know that all of our highway maintenance problems in 
Quebec and Ontario, in Toronto where it is obvious, are caused 
by trucking. And the upkeep of roads is the responsibility of the 
provinces. The hon. member would like to see me encourage the 
Liberal government to reply that, at a time when the federal 
government is trying to offload its deficit to the provinces, the 
Government of Quebec should help the federal government 
meet these responsibilities, which it is no longer able to do 
alone. No, Madam Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in this debate. It is 
important for me, representing Edmonton Southwest, to ensure 
some views are put on the table that would reflect the views of 
Canadians with regard to the privatization of CN.
<P>
	The Reform Party is generally speaking in support of the bill. 
We think the privatization of Canadian National makes a good 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14239"> 14239 </A></B>
<P>
deal of sense. If we think it is such a good idea and if the 
government thinks it is such a good idea to privatize CN, 
perhaps the next bill to be discussed will be the establishment of 
another crown corporation, the Federal Business Development 
Bank, which will be  continued and greatly enlarged to compete 
in the financial services sector.
<P>
	The debate today concerns the privatization of Canadian 
National. Whenever the name of a railroad is invoked sooner or 
later taxpayers will have their hands in their pockets. That has 
been the case ever since day one in the railroad industry in 
Canada and nothing will likely change that.
<P>
	Canadian National is the result of an amalgamation of a 
number of smaller money losing operations which about 30 or 
40 years ago were combined into Canadian National. The 
wisdom of the day was a lot of small money losing operations 
could be combined into one big money losing operation, and that 
is exactly what happened.
<P>
	Canadians have been throwing money at Canadian National 
hand over fist ever since it was put together to compete with 
Canadians Pacific. Canadian Pacific was established with a 
great deal of government largesse. It received copious quantities 
of land in return for building the railroad. It promptly sold off 
the land and came cap in hand to the people of Canada saying it 
needed subsidies or it will close this or that.
<P>
	Thus is the story of big business in Canada. An hon. member 
from the New Democratic Party many years ago coined the 
phrase corporate welfare bums, and he is quite right. The larger 
the business in Canada, the closer the tentacles of that business 
are to the coffers of the country.
<P>
	It is Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer, people struggling to get buy, who 
seem always to be dipping into their pockets to subsidize 
somebody else. At least with this legislation there is half a 
chance the subsidization to CN will come to an end, which begs 
the question of who in their right mind would buy anything that 
has been losing money since time began.
<P>
	It was an amalgamation of money losing railroads turned into 
one big money losing railroad and now carries a debt of about 
$2.5 billion. Why would anyone in their right mind buy this 
railroad? Privatizing will not make it profitable. If one takes a 
historically unprofitable entity and privatizes it, that in itself 
will not make it profitable.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	Canadian National will have to be privatized in a manner 
which will remove the shackles that have prevented it from 
being profitable. That means whoever will be buying this 
railroad, whether it is a zillion individuals or a half a dozen large 
organizations and a lot of other individuals, these people will 
need the ability to make the decisions necessary to turn this 
railroad which has historically lost money into a profit making 
venture.
<P>
	That was the purpose and rationale behind some of the 
amendments we offered to the bill. The Reform Party is by and 
large in support of the bill. We think it is a good idea and we 
respect the government for taking this initiative. It has not been 
an easy chore over the last year or so for the Liberals to reverse 
direction, as they have in many of the bits of legislation which 
have come to the table. Who would have thought there would 
ever be in this day a Liberal government bringing in legislation 
to privatize a crown corporation? That has not been the Liberal 
way over the past 30 or 40 years.
<P>
	When the prodigal son comes home we should welcome him 
and say: ``Well done. We are glad you are seeing the light. What 
can we do to help?'' To dump all over the government because 
there are some things about the bill we do not like would be 
counterproductive.
<P>
	As my colleague from Calgary Centre mentioned, when a 
private corporation is looking at any venture, granted this is a 
big venture, business principles are business principles. It is 
really a question of adding a number of zeros once we get 
started; it is a question of how many zeros are behind the 
decimal point.
<P>
	Canadian National in order to be palatable to future investors 
must reduce some of its debt load. The debt load is $2.5 billion 
and people have said it should be reduced to something in the 
order of $1.5 billion.
<P>
	A truism in the business world is the first hit you take is 
always the easiest. Therefore if we are to sell this off we are far 
better off taking the hit by reducing the the debt CN carries the 
first time around rather than trying to drag it out. We are far 
better off getting the price and the debt to a level attractive to 
purchasers at one time than we are trying three or four different 
levels.
<P>
	There are a couple of ways this could be achieved. One is to 
sell assets CN presently has. That is the way it should be done. 
CN should not come to the public coffers of Canada, individual 
taxpayers, and say: ``Dip into your pockets and pull out $5 or 
$10. This is your contribution to getting this white elephant off 
our backs, this albatross of our necks. Your contribution is 
$100''.
<P>
	We should be saying CN is in the transportation business, the 
rail business, and had better sell off a whole lot of these assets. 
This is exactly what we would do in the private sector; get down 
to the bare bones, the core business. Once that is done and the 
assets are sold we could look at how much we have to write down 
on this debt in order to make it saleable.
<P>
	CN is a national company. I believe I am accurate in saying 
that something in the region of 70 per cent of the revenues of CN 
are generated west of the lakehead. It is a national company but 
the majority of the revenues of Canadian National are generated 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14240"> 14240 </A></B>
<P>
in the transport of raw materials such as coal, sulphur, grain and 
parts of the resource industry.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	That is why this is a reasonable question to ask. If the bulk of 
the revenues are generated in western Canada and the company 
is to be privatized, does it not necessarily follow that the 
privatized Canadian National in order to become profitable will 
accelerate in closing parts of the operation which are losing 
money which would then inevitably be that part of the operation 
probably east of the golden triangle or golden horseshoe of 
central Canada? In order to be a viable entity CN must have 
access to the country's industrial heartland. It may not have the 
wherewithal to continue to operate money losing parts of its 
operation elsewhere in Canada.
<P>
	This brings into the debate where the head office should be. 
We are not talking about where the various repair shops should 
be. Earlier a member mentioned that a high tech operation in 
Montreal keeps track of the locomotives and the trains. I always 
wondered how on earth railroads kept track of their rolling 
stock. That can stay in Montreal. We are talking about the head 
office. The head office could be wherever the majority owners of 
the new privatized Canadian National would want it to be.
<P>
	There is quite a disparity in the number of employees working 
across the country. Today, 29,541 people work for Canadian 
National. Of those 29,541 individuals 2,526 live in British 
Columbia; 3,567 live in Alberta; Saskatchewan has 1,380; 
Manitoba has 4,498. Alberta has the western regional 
headquarters. In Manitoba there is a major repair facility. It is a 
major yard. Ontario has 7,165 employees and Quebec has 7,795 
employees.
<P>
	Perhaps the head office should be somewhere in Ontario. 
There are the same number of employees. Perhaps the head 
office should be in Prince Edward Island. There are five 
employees in Prince Edward Island; Newfoundland, 167; Nova 
Scotia, 393; New Brunswick, 1,903; and I mentioned that 
Quebec has 7,795. With the exception of the maritimes where 
there is not much of a presence of Canadian National, outside of 
New Brunswick which did have a repair facility, most of the 
employees of Canadian National are spread out pretty evenly 
across the country.
<P>
	The Liberals dictate that the head office should be 
permanently in Montreal is because of the delicate nature of the 
relationship between some people who live in Quebec and the 
rest of Canada. The government just does not want to ruffle any 
feathers right now. It does not want to add another ingredient 
that could possibly be disturbing. It does not want to risk the 
enmity and the ire of the Bloc Quebecois by saying that the head 
office can be wherever the owners want it to be.
<P>
	There are issues of principle that go beyond whether or not 
members of the Bloc Quebecois get upset. Let them get upset. 
Who cares? We are running a business here. We make business 
decisions for business decisions. We could have the Holy 
Mother here and the Bloc would  find some reason for getting 
upset. Let us just assume that the Bloc is going to be upset no 
matter what we do.
<P>
	The next thing then, when we are looking at some of the 
suggestions that we have made, is the restriction of 15 per cent. 
Earlier someone said it is not a big deal because the maximum 
number of shares that anyone has of CP is 11 per cent. What 
difference does that make? Who cares what the share structure 
of CP is? What we are trying to do is sell CN provided that the 
debt reduction on CN is not so much that it makes it an unfair 
competitor to CP, which is, of course, the private entity 
enterprise. We do not want to repeat the mistake we made with 
Air Canada, which was to write off all the debt, throw a 
competitor that has lots of cash into the marketplace to compete 
with the private sector, which at the time was Canadian Airlines 
or whatever its precursor was, and start a price war. That almost 
put both of them out of business.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	In any event the situation is that no one owner may own more 
than 15 per cent of the shares of the privatized CN. People 
representing the government have said that it is a non-issue 
because the maximum share ownership of CP is 11 per cent. 
Surely it would not be a problem to take this restriction out of 
the legislation. The government has said it is not a problem, so 
why have it there?
<P>
	It is important with Canadian National that if a group comes 
to the table and is prepared to invest enough money to own more 
than 15 per cent, then why on earth should it not? It may need to 
have that control in order to make Canadian National a 
competitive, profitable enterprise.
<P>
	I have no reason to believe that this is the case but I am 
thinking aloud that it could be because so much of the Canadian 
National business is resource based, it is possible that a number 
of resource based companies will come to the table in a 
consortium wanting to buy Canadian National. Perhaps that 
consortium will want to have more than 15 per cent. The 
restriction of 15 per cent is artificial. It is not necessary and it 
does nothing to move the legislation ahead.
<P>
	Another sop to Canadianism in the legislation is the 
requirement that Canadian National must remain bilingual just 
as it is as a crown corporation or as a federal government entity. 
There are institutions in Canada that are rightfully bilingual, 
such as the House of Commons and law. Many of the institutions 
across Canada that are bilingual should be bilingual because we 
are a bilingual country. When those of us who have lived most of 
our lives in other parts of Canada come to central Canada we see 
just how bilingual the country is. Being bilingual, trilingual or 
multilingual is to our benefit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14241"> 14241 </A></B>
<P>
	What we are talking about now is privatizing an operation that 
has been losing money for many years. There should be as few 
strings attached as humanly possible. If the corporation is to 
become a private corporation, then let it become a private 
corporation without the strings attached. If it is in the interests 
of the corporation to be bilingual or multilingual, we can be sure 
it will remain so, as it should. It may well become multilingual 
because there are parts of this country where the second 
language is not English or French, but may well be Mandarin.
<P>
	Another point I raise is if we are going to privatize CN, let us 
honestly privatize it without all the strings attached in order to 
make it more palatable to the people. I do not want ascribe 
motive here, but it would seem to me that one aspect of the bill is 
nothing more or less than a sop to the Bloc Quebecois so that it 
will not get upset about it. If we are going to privatize it, let us 
do it.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	Another point has to do with the marine strategy, the railroads 
in Canada and the fact that everything in Canada is 
interconnected. There is not much point developing a port in 
Halifax if there is no facility to move products from that port to 
the rest of the country. To do that we will require rail lines.
<P>
	As this is privatized it is wholly appropriate there be certain 
restrictions on the new ownership to ensure that any transition is 
done carefully and in the public interest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I enjoyed my colleague's comments. I could agree with a fair 
number of his concerns. I think all Canadians have concerns.
<P>
	This is a massive move. He says that he could not imagine 
Liberals taking this move but the ideologies are pretty fuzzy 
these days. I would agree that 20 years ago to say that Liberals 
were going to privatize CN would certainly be out of the 
question. Privatization has been brought upon us because we 
have not been able to make this thing work. We are in a new 
league now. We are involved in world competition and we have 
to forget about those old standbys we thought we could live 
with.
<P>
	The railroad has been doing much better recently than the past 
50 or 75 years would indicate, which might make it somewhat 
attractive to a new buyer. The member categorized three things 
which I can see fitting together.
<P>
	One was having the location of the head office dictated and I 
agree with that. If I am going to own something I should be left 
with that decision. That would make sense. As someone once 
said, if you are going to do it, do it right. If we were privatizing 
something else we would tell the owners that they owned it and 
were free to put the head office where they wanted to.
<P>
	The fact we have said CN should be bilingual fits in there too. 
It was done for the same reason and Canadians realize that. It is 
only being honest with Canadians. I could add the 15 per cent 
ownership limit to the list. This  is such a massive move and 
nobody really knows where it is going to shake out. We avoided 
destabilizing the company as much as possible. This affects all 
Canadians, so we had to keep those things in mind.
<P>
	This case is bigger than when TCA was privatized to become 
Air Canada if we are just talking dollars and cents. With that in 
mind and all of the uncertainties, what is the price going to be of 
a share? I do not know but we have to depend on those we trust to 
tell us. That would be the rationale for not moving any further 
with it by throwing it completely open and saying: ``Have the 
headquarters where you like. Do not be too concerned about 
whether it should remain bilingual as it is now. Do not have any 
limit on the 15 per cent share but let people buy whatever 
portion they would like''.
<P>
	I suppose it is not really privatization in a sense if we are 
going to have those restrictions. On the other hand this has been 
a Canadian owned company which is moving into the private 
sector. The government was trying to avoid all kinds of pitfalls 
by putting those riders on for now. There may be pitfalls even 
with those riders.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Madam Speaker, the central point I was 
trying to make was that CN has had a record of losing money 
ever since its incorporation. The fact that it is losing money at a 
slower rate today is a blessing but it is like dying by inches, you 
are still going to die sooner or later.
<P>
	If this deal is going to be palatable in a private market, if it is 
going to be saleable and if it can be privatized, it will only be 
privatized because those who will invest in it see the opportunity 
of making a dollar. That is the way our system works. That is the 
way it should work.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Concerning the restriction of 15 per cent, if a potential 
purchaser had the resources to take 20 per cent of the shares, it 
would ensure there would be a very strong hand at the helm. The 
other 80 per cent of CN would be widely dispersed in pension 
funds, in RRSPs, with people all over the country.
<P>
	However, we had better make damn sure when we are doing 
something like this that this business is not being run by a 
committee. It had better be run by somebody who knows exactly 
what he or she is doing, exactly how he or she is going to do it 
and has one overriding ambition, to make a profit. There is no 
other reason for CN to be purchased by any potential investor 
anywhere.
<P>
	That person must purchase it with the intent of making a 
profit. It has nothing to do with the Canadian identity. It has 
nothing to do with being a good Canadian. It has nothing to do 
with how much money has already been lost. It is strictly 
whether there will be a return on the investment when those 
shares are purchased.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14242"> 14242 </A></B>
<P>
	That is the only consideration that anyone who buys a share in 
this should have. If Bobby Gimby decides he is going to be the 
head of Canadian National and this becomes part of the national 
dream then we are sunk. We will end up with another B.C. 
Resources Investment Corporation where thousands of widows 
and orphans are going to buy shares in this creature. They are 
going to see the share value plummet and be resentful beyond 
words.
<P>
	It is our responsibility to ensure that whoever buys this baby 
has the opportunity to turn it into a profitable venture. 
Otherwise we are going to wear that can around our necks and 
we will deserve it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I get 
rather disillusioned when I hear my Reform colleagues, 
particularly one who is considered more insightful than most of 
his brothers and sisters in his party, make comments such as the 
following: ``Bilingualism was given as a sop to the Bloc''.
<P>
	Does my hon. colleague from the Reform Party who has just 
spoken understand that the Bloc members do not believe in 
bilingualism? They want unilingualism, they want French. I 
cannot understand the lack of sensitivity and insight displayed 
by such a comment. It shows the Reform Party in spite of its 
attempts, does not understand the country.
<P>
	A second comment: ``We have in this country, two official 
languages''. To suggest that a business can ignore official 
languages, in spite of the fact that it is une des pierres angulaires 
de de pays, shows incredible lack of sensitivity.
<P>
	They can ignore to run trains where it does not pay. They can 
ignore to do anything except run them where there is the greatest 
profit.
<P>
	Is my hon. colleagues suggesting to heck with the city of 
Montreal? To heck with responding in English or French, the 
official languages of this country. To heck with everything else 
that is going to cost money because we, the business community, 
are going to skim off the richest of the cream. Is that what is 
being suggested?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Madam Speaker, my colleague from 
Winnipeg has a good point and he is absolutely right. I cannot 
believe that I said that language was a sop to the Bloc. Obviously 
it is not a sop to the Bloc and my hon. colleague opposite is quite 
right.
<P>
	It is a sop to Quebec perhaps in general terms but it is 
certainly not a sop to the Bloc. Whatever it might be to the Bloc, 
for sure it is not that.
<P>
	The other point is about bilingualism and this needs to be 
absolutely clear. I did not say that CN should not be bilingual. I 
did not infer that it should not be bilingual. I said that it may be 
multilingual.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	What I said was as CN is going to be privatized, take the 
shackles off and let the management of the company make the 
decision for themselves. That is a decision that rightfully 
belongs to the new owners of CN. It is a not a decision which 
should be made by the legislature of the country.
<P>
	If we are going to sell it, then sell it with no strings attached. 
The first hit we take will be the worst hit, so let us take the it, get 
it off the books and get on with life. Good for the Liberals for 
bringing the legislation to the table in the first place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, what is the point of this debate? Why are we here? I 
have been sitting here day after day. Are we wasting our time?
<P>
	I have listened to the debate and the speeches which have been 
made on both sides of the House. I know a heat wave is hitting 
the country. I wonder if it has been caused by the intense debate 
we have heard over the last week or so. I am not sure. Is the only 
thing we are accomplishing the generation of a lot of hot air?
<P>
	Last week I took a break and went down the hall to the other 
place which is known as the Senate. I sat in there for a while and 
listened to the debate. I heard some very good speeches on 
euthanasia and other topics. I thought to myself, nobody is 
listening to these speeches. Nobody in the country is looking at 
what is happening here. These people have gone to a lot of work 
and nobody is listening. Suggestions are being made and nobody 
is listening.
<P>
	Then I came back to this place. I thought to myself, it is no 
different here. Nobody is listening. Nobody is paying attention.
<P>
	The Reform Party has made suggestions. It has worked with 
the government to fine tune the legislation to ensure it is 
acceptable to all Canadians. We find that, by and large, our 
efforts are useless. The speeches we make are falling on deaf 
ears. Nobody is listening. What is the point of the debate?
<P>
	During the election campaign my strongest opponent was the 
NDP candidate who is now running for the leadership of that 
party. He made a big point of the Senate being unelected and 
unaccountable. He said that because it is appointed, the people 
in the other place are not very effective, the balance which it 
should provide between the regions is not there.
<P>
	However, my hon. opponent in the election forgot to mention 
that this place could really use some fixing. This place is not 
democratic. This place is not doing what it should be doing. The 
debate here is often very meaningless. The suggestions which 
are made in good faith are completely disregarded. My feelings 
about the other place are also the feelings I have toward this 
place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14243"> 14243 </A></B>
<P>
	People are frustrated because Parliament is not doing its job. I 
want to use this bill to illustrate what I mean.
<P>
	I have been here for almost two years now and that time has 
shown me that this place is guilty of many of the same problems 
of which we accuse the Senate. What is changing because of the 
debate we are having here? This debate is coming to a close. In 
fact, this session of Parliament will soon be over. We have been 
debating day after day. I wonder if it is accomplishing anything 
and whether the work we put into our speeches is really 
effective.
<P>
	For those who are watching on the parliamentary channel and 
may not be aware of how legislation is created, very simply the 
legislation is introduced in the House, generally by the 
government, but there are private members' bills. It is 
introduced and receives first reading. It goes through second 
reading, goes to committee, is reported back to the House and 
then goes through third reading. That does not mean it becomes 
law. Then it goes to the Senate and it goes through the same 
process. Then if the legislation has passed, it becomes law.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	As we go through all of these processes, as we work in 
committees, there should be amendments proposed. There 
should be open and free discussion. That has frustrated me. A lot 
of what we do is hidden. It is behind the scenes. It is in the 
committees. A lot of the work, the research, that is done and the 
proposals that are made, Canadians are not aware of.
<P>
	In order for democracy to work that process should be open. 
Every member of Parliament should have input. By and large 
that is not happening. The agenda is driven by only a few elected 
people in the House of Commons. That is unfortunate.
<P>
	When the debate on Bill C-89 first began, I suggested four 
things. I was one of the first speakers on the bill. If we are going 
to produce good laws these suggestions should have been dealt 
with but by and large they have not. I have heard several reasons 
why they have not.
<P>
	If we look at the reasons we begin to realize that they do not 
hold water. They are not acceptable. First I said that prohibiting 
the government from arbitrarily cancelling all or part of CN's 
debts prior to privatization should not take place. I also 
mentioned that removing the requirement to leave CN's 
headquarters in Montreal is something that the government 
should take a serious second look at. We proposed amendments 
for that. We thought perhaps a lot of politics was involved. What 
I have seen today probably underscores that fact. I do not think it 
is a wise business decision.
<P>
	Another suggestion I made was to remove the requirement 
that CN comply with the government's policy on official 
bilingualism. It was pure politics. My hon. colleague has 
pointed that out very well. I also said remove the 15 per cent 
ownership restriction.
<P>
	I heard the members arguing that we do not want to destabilize 
the company. Any owners who would take over would not want 
to do that. The arguments which have been presented on the 
other side are superficial. They do not hold water.
<P>
	That is why we have to do more in this place than simply 
generate a lot of hot air. We have to begin to listen to each other 
and do the fine tuning of legislation that would make it good 
legislation.
<P>
	We agree with the privatization of CN. It is a good thing. The 
government has an opportunity to make it a great thing. I want to 
suggest that the government use this, its first major attempt at 
privatization, as a testing ground for the privatization of other 
crown corporations.
<P>
	Reformers do not want a lot of unnecessary regulations that 
restrict companies in keeping down their costs. We do not want 
that. Yet the government is tying their hands somewhat.
<P>
	When Reformers ask why tie the hands of the new owners of 
CN by stipulating that the headquarters remain in Montreal, the 
Liberals answered and that they wanted to provide a level of 
certainty that potential costs from relocation of the headquarters 
will not ensue. Think about the absurdity of that answer. A 
company would not relocate its headquarters if it would result in 
some financial disadvantage.
<P>
	On the other hand, what if there was an advantage financially 
to moving the headquarters to Winnipeg or some other western 
place or to the east? What if there was an advantage in doing that 
because it might be more central to the bulk of the business? 
Why should they not be allowed to do that? Would they make 
decisions that were not wise for the company? They would not. 
That is why the answer that I have heard to to this question is 
absurd. Seventy per cent of CN's business is done in western 
Canada. Why put in the stipulation that the CN headquarters 
must stay in Montreal?
<P>
	The Bloc says that we are Quebec bashing. We are not Quebec 
bashing. Where is the consistency in the government's 
reasoning? When the ancestor to Air Canada moved its 
headquarters from Winnipeg to the east, westerners argued that 
this was a Winnipeg based company. The government in its big 
bubble here in Ottawa said ``Oh, no, most of the airline's 
business is in the east, so we should move the headquarters to 
Montreal''. When the shoe is on the other foot and CN's 
business is mostly in the west, it has a completely different 
argument. There is no consistency in what the government is 
saying. By using the government's own reasoning, it should 
allow the company, if it wishes, to move the headquarters out of 
Montreal.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	When history and tradition fail the west the Liberals say it 
does not matter. However, when history and tradition favour the 
east they write it into the law. Something is wrong. Why run a 
company 2,000 miles away from its main operation?
<P>
	In 1987 Madsen Pirie, who was president of the Adam Smith 
Institution in London and a world renowned expert on 
privatization, spoke at a Canadian symposium on privatization 
organized by the Fraser Institute. He had this to say about the 
fundamentals of privatizing a crown corporation:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When government engages in an activity such as privatization, it is speaking to 
several audiences. Among the audiences the government speaks to are the 
managers of the Crown corporations, the workers who are employed in them, the 
members of the general public who are customers of the Crown corporations, the 
general public who are taxpayers and who pay the subsidies to support the losses 
of those corporations, potential investors who might buy shares in those 
corporations, the financial and business community which takes an interest in 
their performance, and the media commentators who observe this process and 
comment on the results and declare it to be a success or a failure. Every act of 
privatization speaks to all of these audiences and every act should be tailor-made 
to maximize the support of each of these different groups.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When we review this bill we should test against Dr. Pirie's list 
of vested interests or audiences, or stakeholders as the 
government likes to call them. Bill C-89 must address each of 
the groups affected by the privatization: the managers, the 
workers, the customers, the taxpayers, and the investors. If Bill 
C-89 does not specifically address each of the needs and 
interests of these groups, then amendments will be necessary. 
That is what we proposed.
<P>
	This is what frustrates me as we come to the end of this 
debate. I do not think one thing we have said here today is going 
to change the government's mind. We are generating a lot of hot 
air in the midst of a Canadian heat wave and it is doing us no 
good.
<P>
	Dr. Pirie also outlined three key principles of privatization. 
His first principle was never cancel a benefit. If people are 
deriving a benefit from the public activity of a crown 
corporation, never cancel it, no matter how unjust it is. In his 
second principle he said to make friends out of your enemies: 
``Find out who the people are who might lose on the 
privatization process and structure the policy to make sure they 
gain instead''. The third principle he gave was disarm the 
opposition: ``Identify all possible objections to privatization 
and tailor the policies so that every single one of those 
objections are dealt with in advance''.
<P>
	Has the government done this? I brought this up months ago, 
and nothing has been done. That is why I still maintain that a lot 
of the debate here is not really effective. Has the government 
done this? I doubt it. The government should ensure that it has 
considered each of  Dr. Pirie's three principles in planning for 
this privatization.
<P>
	Has the government explored the idea that came from one of 
my constituents and which I presented to this government that 
we could have two or more government objectives rolled into 
one? For example, the government is giving landowners in the 
west a one-time payout for the elimination of the WGTA 
subsidy for the railways, which is commonly known as the Crow 
rate. Would it be possible, I asked, to give western farmers the 
choice to have their Crow rate buyout in the form of shares 
rather than cash? It could be made fairly attractive and then 
farmers would have a direct financial interest in the economic 
performance of CN.
<P>
	I heard one of the Liberal members opposite several hours ago 
argue that we could never raise the capital in Canada to even 
have someone grab hold of the major amount of shares in CN. 
That is ridiculous. Does the member not realize that the crown 
payout of approximately $1.6 billion is equal to the price the 
government is asking for CN? What does he mean the capital is 
not available? Right there is the capital. The main users of the 
railway are the grain producers in this country, and they could 
use it. It would give them the benefit. It would meet some of the 
negative aspects that often come with privatization.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	That is why I am saying the government should have been 
listening. As this idea is being picked up they could have floated 
the idea. Maybe this is a bad idea, but they should have looked at 
it. This idea comes from some of the constituents in my area, and 
it should be dealt with.
<P>
	Look at the recommendations of previous studies. The 
government spends million and millions of dollars on royal 
commissions and studies. One of the recommendations made 
was that rolling stock could be privatized but the government 
could continue to maintain the rail beds, maybe as a private 
corporation eventually. They could maintain the rail beds just as 
they do the highways in the country. It would allow small 
entrepreneurs that do not have the capital resources to buy a 
huge railroad to at least use the efficiency of the rail beds in 
transporting their products.
<P>
	The Economic Council of Canada published a report called 
``Minding the Public's Business''. In chapter five, entitled 
``Government Enterprise and Business'', the Economic Council 
made the following recommendation: ``Entry into rail carriage 
could be promoted in different ways. The provisions of the 
proposed legislation could be expanded to make running rights 
more easily available and to open entry into rail carriage to 
anyone who can meet the basic requirements related to safety 
and liability coverage. Instead of regulating the activities of CN 
and CP in their capacity as providers of the rail bed, the 
management of all track could be assigned to a new publicly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14245"> 14245 </A></B>
<P>
owned track authority. This would require the nationalization of 
CP's roadbed and the separation of  CN's track from the other 
components of its operation. Alternatively, a public track 
authority could be created based exclusively on the 
infrastructure of CN.''
<P>
	We have put this to the government. It seems to ignore it. I do 
not know why. Why does the government spend all these 
millions on commission and studies? They come forth with 
some sensible recommendations and the government promptly 
dismisses them. This is an idea whose time has finally come and 
the government should give serious consideration to 
establishing a public track authority that would operate 
similarly to our highway system. This would eliminate the tax 
disadvantage placed on rail companies.
<P>
	Rail companies are at a tax disadvantage. They pay fuel taxes 
and they also have to maintain their rail beds. That is not fair. On 
the other hand, trucks pay fuel taxes, but the highways, their 
road bed, are maintained at public expense.
<P>
	A public track authority could charge user fees to rail 
companies based on the use they make of the tracks. As a result, 
they would be self-financing. At some point in the future the 
public track authority could even be privatized.
<P>
	The Chamber of Commerce supports a fully user pay rail 
infrastructure and had this to say in their 1994 submission to the 
special joint committee reviewing Canada's foreign policy: 
``Canadian businesses are increasingly pointing to an unlevel 
playing field between the Canadian and U.S. commercial 
environments. One tangible example among many can be found 
in the Canadian transportation industry. Rail, for example, 
provides the most economic mode of transportation for a large 
part of Canada's freight and for many shippers is the only cost 
effective mode. It is fundamental to Canada's trade, moving 40 
per cent of Canada's exports, and provides a fully user pay 
infrastructure not liable to ongoing public funding.''
<P>
	Finally, I want to return to a point I have made repeatedly in 
speeches before the House for the last couple of years. I would 
like to comment on the importance of the port of Churchill to the 
farmers of Saskatchewan and Manitoba. When I said that the 
government should be looking at more than one initiative, this is 
another thing it should have looked at.
<P>
	The privatization of CN should be seen as an opportunity to 
privatize, expand markets, modernize, increase exports and 
imports through the port of Churchill. This will take more than 
just the privatization of CN. It would take the cooperation and 
likely the privatization of both VIA Rail and Ports Canada at 
Churchill. It will take the cooperation of the federal 
government, the government of the province of Manitoba, the 
cooperation and support of every community and producer 
whose future will be improved by taking advantage of the most 
cost effective shipping route for bulk commodities to our 
customers in Europe, Africa, and South America.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	I respectfully ask the government not to look at the Churchill 
line and the port of Churchill as a liability but as an opportunity 
requiring creative thinking and a cooperative and creative 
privatization strategy. I have worked on this quite a bit, and that 
is why I say one government department must work together 
with the other one.
<P>
	One of the main obstacles to making the Hudson Bay route 
and the port of Churchill viable is the Canadian Wheat Board. 
Unless the Canadian Wheat Board becomes more open and 
accountable to grain producers, prairie producers will continue 
to be routed through costly eastern ports.
<P>
	Yoy cannot just look at the railroad in isolation. You have to 
see how it all connects. Why is it that we have this problem? 
Because the railroads and eastern interests benefit in having the 
grain go through the traditional route rather than through the 
port of Churchill.
<P>
	Farmers are asking important questions that will not be 
answered until the process of grain sales in routing is opened up.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, the time has 
totally expired. Questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I really do not want to address the issue of the bill that 
is currently before us. However, I did want to ask the member 
about some comments he made.
<P>
	He criticized the quality of the debate and suggested that 
somehow government members were responsible for that 
quality of debate. Throughout this day and throughout a good 
part of last week the majority of speakers on any bill, by a 
margin of four to one, sometimes nine to one, ten to one, have 
been Reform Party members. If 90 per cent of the speakers on 
the bill are Reform Party members and only 10 per cent are 
government members, would this not suggest that it is the 
Reform Party members who are responsible for the inadequacy 
of the quality of debate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
wish the hon. member had been listening carefully to what I 
said. The point of what I am saying is that those members are not 
listening carefully to what we are saying.
<P>
	We have made suggestions to the government. We were not 
complaining about the quality of debate. We are coming up with 
speeches, coming up with amendments, working on committees. 
We are doing all of these things that a good parliamentarian 
should be doing, but it is useless.
<P>
	It is no different from what is happening in the Senate. These 
people make these wonderful speeches and it is to no avail. We 
come to this House and it is still to no avail because we do not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14246"> 14246 </A></B>
<P>
have democracy built into the system. We debated gun control, 
and when it came down to it we  were not even allowed to vote 
freely on the issue. Liberal members were told how to vote.
<P>
	We made suggestions as to how to improve some of the 
legislation in this House. My point was very clearly made that 
the speeches we made and the work we did was by and large 
ignored by the government.
<P>
	I would like to conclude some of the other remarks I made in 
regard to the Churchill route because they may be misconstrued 
if I do not. Suspicion grows that the grain companies, the 
government bureaucrats, the railroads, and the eastern interests 
drive the agenda while the western farmer continues to be ripped 
off, not realizing the full benefits of his labour and his 
enterprise.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Point of order.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Madam Speaker, I will be delighted to ask the 
member a question and to drop the point of order. The point was 
to have been in fact that the member was entering into debate. If 
I can continue with questions and comments, which is the 
time-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We have questions and 
comments. Point of order?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I was rising on questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I think the member is 
well aware that when the opposition parties are speaking we 
normally allow government to question the party.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Madam Speaker, contrary to the statement just 
made by the member, I was listening very carefully. It was the 
quality of debate he was criticizing. If he reviews his blues in 
<I>Hansard</I> he will find out those were the words he used.
<P>
	I can only say again that 90 per cent of the debate has come 
from the Reform Party compared with government members and 
therefore I know who to blame for the quality of debate.
<P>
	On the point of listening, the member is well aware, and I am 
surprised he has not said this in the House, there has been a great 
deal of listening. There were over 40 amendments to the gun 
control bill in committee. There were dozens more amendments 
debated-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order. Did the member not rise on a point of order?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> She retracted and went 
back to questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Would I not have a 
chance to finish the remarks I was making? Is she allowed to 
interrupt me?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am afraid the hon. 
member was back on debate.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Madam Speaker, would the member not 
concede there were over 40 amendments in committee, that 
there were dozens of amendments debated in the House last 
night on the bill? We voted on over 30 motions last night. 
Clearly amendments have been put forward with debate.
<P>
	If the member were to be totally honest with the public he 
would concede even some points brought forward by members 
of the Reform Party in committee on the gun control legislation, 
which he referred to, were incorporated in the gun control 
legislation and that we have been listening. Listening is not the 
same as agreeing with everything the Reform Party says; 
otherwise we would both be on the same side of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Madam Speaker, I was 
involved with C-68, the gun control measure, and if the she 
wants to debate that, I would be very willing to. I think that is not 
what is-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I ask the hon. member 
not to refer to other members in the House as ``she''. The hon. 
member is the deputy government whip.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> In relation to Bill 
C-68, the changes the government made that responded to 
Reform suggestions were simply changes where a word may 
have been clarified. Virtually no other changes were made by the 
government. They were so minuscule as to be almost useless, 
very small wording changes.
<P>
	With regard to Bill C-89 when we asked about allowing a 
company to move the headquarters from Montreal, the 
government did virtually nothing to act on that. When we 
questioned the government's official bilingualism policy being 
applied to a private company, it remained virtually unanswered, 
as did the question of the 15 per cent ownership restriction. All 
of these things we raised were not properly addressed. The 
answers we were given were superficial. They were not effective 
answers.
<P>
	We are talking about Bill C-89, not Bill C-68, a whole 
different matter. I would gladly address that if we were debating 
it. What about the cancelling of CN's debts prior to 
privatization? In all fairness to the government, it addressed that 
question somewhat. By and large a lot of the suggestions we 
made fell on deaf ears. That is the problem with this place; that 
is the problem with much of the debate that takes place here.
<P>
	We can speak 90 per cent of the time but it makes no 
difference. I wonder if Canadians realize we are acting as the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14247"> 14247 </A></B>
<P>
official opposition, that we are examining this legislation in 
minute detail. This is our job but by and large the government is 
not responding to the positive suggestions we have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am happy to talk on third reading of the CN 
privatization bill.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	Railway politics in Canada take a prominent place in our 
history. I know from growing up in this country and working on 
the railways part time I have a great sense of history. The 
member for Kenora-Rainy River is another part time 
railroader. The ra ilways are very important historically to the 
country.
<P>
	I am reminded of the railway on Vancouver Island, E&amp;N 
Railway, very important in the development of the west coast. 
There is an ongoing contractual commitment in this country to 
keep that railway going despite some pressures the other way. 
Those contractual commitments date back to prior to the turn of 
the century.
<P>
	In terms of our contemporary history, we are seeing great 
changes, the stability of our railways, or the instability in the 
beginning. It is a whole new ball game now. Why is it a whole 
new ball game now? Government operations and crown 
corporations can no longer function in the way they functioned 
for the last several decades.
<P>
	This is unavoidable because of our fiscal situation and I am 
reminded of this every day. Two-thirds of government revenues 
are derived from personal federal income taxes. One-third of 
federal revenues are to service our national debt. It does not take 
much of a mathematician to figure out 50 per cent of people's 
personal federal income tax is going to service our debt.
<P>
	This situation despite the last budget is getting worse because 
part of our revenue dedicated to servicing debt is increasing over 
the next couple of years. We are treading water and sinking 
slowly. This message is slowly being accumulated by the 
population at large. It is being expressed in a lot of different 
programs of government and it is being expressed in how we 
unavoidably must deal with our crown corporations.
<P>
	The transport committee, the task force appointed by the 
minister in September of 1994 which put its finding forth in 
January of 1995, identified a number of things which I think 
were largely known to most.
<P>
	CN and CP are both facing very strong competition from other 
industries and from the U.S., particularly on the north-south 
routes, north-south markets. The railways are losing market 
share to trucking. Deregulation of the U.S. railways is obviously 
impacting a great deal on the Canadian railways. The eastern 
routes are losing money and the western routes are declining in 
profitability.
<P>
	This same task force also identified that all major North 
American railways were privately owned with the exception of 
CN. One wonders why Canada would have such a different 
contemporary situation. This bill is quite predictable. The 
privatization was to occur. All the market pressures were there 
and governments around the world are privatizing crown 
corporations.
<P>
	The task force also identified that as a crown corporation CN 
had been subject to many politically motivated moves and that 
much of this results from the president and the board basically 
being patronage appointments. There is a message in all of this 
for other crown corporations of government.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	The standard provisions of any privatization bill are 
essentially the same no matter what crown corporation is being 
privatized. What is different are the bells and whistles which 
deal with investor attractiveness, some of the social 
ramifications, how it deals with existing employees, how it 
deals with the public interest and those kinds of things. 
Essentially that is what most of the debate in the House and in 
committee has been about. The amendments proposed by the 
Bloc and by the Reform Party have largely been about the bells 
and whistles of the bill.
<P>
	In terms of investor attractiveness, the bells and whistles are a 
very strong signal of what kind of regulatory environment the 
new owner is to face when they try to run the railroad. The 
signals we are sending out with this bill are all wrong. Most of 
the amendments deal with the signals we are sending to potential 
purchasers of the railway.
<P>
	One amendment is the requirement that CN's headquarters 
remains in Montreal. We have heard several times in the debate 
that this requirement is absurd because the marketplace can 
make that decision better than anyone else.
<P>
	That it exists in Montreal today may have some social and 
employment ramifications which is why a sunset clause is not a 
bad idea. We have seen in the history of Canada that different 
jurisdictions over time have different natural advantages. There 
are population shifts and differences in trading patterns and all 
kinds of rationale for which private investors would want to 
retain the option to move their office to a different location.
<P>
	Before I get into further amendments I will talk about the way 
the bill was handled in the House. The bill went to committee 
after first reading, which was a new process. Normally a bill 
goes through first reading when the legislation is tabled and 
through second reading debate and then the bill goes to 
committee.
<P>
	Conceptually there are some very nice things about sending 
legislation to committee after first reading when in a 
non-partisan way people can get all their points in before the 
legislation becomes set in any way and then a better bill can 
come before the House. The concern with respect to this bill was 
that if the environment was not there after first reading when it 
went to committee, to take all the best of everything people had 
to say about the bill to make it the best legislation possible we 
have really missed the opportunity of second reading debate. We 
want to have a very close look at the process before we commit 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14248"> 14248 </A></B>
<P>
ourselves to a continuation of it whereby we essentially 
eliminate debate at second reading.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	The next point I would like to speak to is about restricting the 
percentage of shares that any one individual, corporation or 
association may own. This has a very negative impact on 
bringing in the kind of investor that would like to purchase a 
major portion of the new company and bring in a management 
style that would revitalize the whole company.
<P>
	The chair of the transport committee, the member for 
Kenora-Rainy River, said that this had been looked at. The 15 
per cent restriction was quite plausible because CP had never 
had more than 11 per cent single ownership. Surely our view of 
the world extends beyond the gaze of Canadian Pacific. We have 
to look at this on a global scale. We have to look at it from a 
totally different perspective. Government once again is talking 
about privatization yet government still wants to retain control. 
There is an irony about this and it is inappropriate.
<P>
	One investor said that the 15 per cent restriction 
circumscribes the deal. It certainly does. It dampens investor 
confidence. It freezes out many investors who would otherwise 
look at this. It sends out all the wrong signals.
<P>
	With respect to CN's debt, this is repetitive but CN currently 
owes about $2.5 billion. It has been established by experts that 
CN will never sell this debt level. It must be reduced to a level 
which would allow access to a BBB credit rating. The general 
concurrence is that amount would be about $1.5 billion.
<P>
	CN currently has $300 million to $400 million on hand 
through recent company sales such as CN Exploration, and 
excess capital reserves. The market value of CN's non-rail 
estate assets are $400 million to $600 million. In a perfect world 
this alone would be sufficient to attain a BBB credit rating.
<P>
	Clause 12 of the proposed legislation gives the minister the 
power to reduce CN's debt to any amount he chooses. This is a 
major problem. This is something the other place should look at 
very closely if we cannot change anyone's mind in this place 
because there are two major risks in this.
<P>
	The minister may choose to reduce the CN debt well below the 
amount at which the taxpayers can receive a return on the sale. 
This would raise the cost of shares making it appear more 
attractive but producing a lower yield for taxpayers. As well, 
excessive reduction in the debt of CN would put CP at a 
disadvantage which is all too familiar. This was done during the 
privatization of Air Canada. The intent of the Reform 
amendment was to limit the minister's power in reducing the 
debt of CN.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	Clause 15 provides for a permanent requirement that CN 
retain the official languages policy and operates under both 
official languages. Once again, this is another signal of a 
regulatory atmosphere that is inappropriate when one is trying 
to attract investors.
<P>
	The government does not have official languages control over 
the private sector. Privatization of CN removes the mandatory 
compliance of the Official Languages Act. The Reform 
amendment was to include a five year sunset clause on the 
mandatory retention of operating under both official languages. 
Unfortunately this was voted down.
<P>
	Then we have the Canada clause. The bill does not provide 
any restrictions of foreign ownership, nor should it. However, 
the Reform amendment would have allowed a 90 day sale period 
open to Canadian individuals and corporations before opening it 
up to foreign markets. This provision would have allowed all 
Canadians first crack at investing in a Canadian institution. 
What could be more appropriate? This would have allowed a 
win-win situation but once again it was voted down.
<P>
	The marine strategy report proposes that all national ports 
must become self-sustaining and that all loans must be obtained 
from the private sector without government backing. Reform 
agrees with that proposal.
<P>
	The Sarnia tunnel is a viable access from Atlantic Canada to 
the American midwest. The Halifax Port Corporation believes 
that through upgrading the port facilities in Halifax it will 
secure the handling of the new high capacity deep draft 
freighters and thus the economic future of marine operations in 
Atlantic Canada. In order to secure the financing, it needs to 
ensure that CN connections will be there to connect the ports to 
the rest of Canada.
<P>
	The Reform amendment would have included a clause 
ensuring rail service to the port of Halifax for a period of 10 
years, thereby ensuring the development of the port facilities 
allowing them to compete with U.S. ports on the eastern 
seaboard and ensuring investor confidence once again. This 
amendment was not allowed. We call that the Atlantic clause.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports the bill although the provisions 
laid out in it are too restrictive and involve too much 
government interference in what should be a much more 
complete move to the private sector.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Leeds-Grenville-Gun control.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="14249"> 14249 </A></B>
<P>
	Questions and comments. Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The question is on the 
motion for third reading of Bill C-89. Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All those in favour of 
the motion will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> In my opinion the yeas 
have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to a request 
made by the deputy government whip, the division on the 
motion is deferred until tonight at 11.15 p.m.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, I was watching the House 
proceedings on television. I heard you ask: ``Is there further 
debate'' and saying, ``no further debate'' you grabbed your 
papers before a member had a chance to stand. I think that is 
unfair.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am very sorry but no 
one in the House stood up when I asked for questions and 
comments. That was prior to calling for debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, if no one stood for 
questions or comments, then you call for debate and you have to 
recognize someone when they are prepared to stand for debate.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I repeat, no one stood at 
all.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Madam Speaker, clearly a debate about a 
ruling after it has been made is entirely out of order and a little 
contemptuous of the role of the Speaker.
<P>
	In addition, however, you very clearly said: ``Is the House 
ready for the question?'' Nobody said no. You then asked as you 
normally do for those in favour and those against.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Madam Speaker, it is almost 5.30 p.m. If the 
members are here we could go into private members' hour right 
away.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Shall I call it 5.30 p.m.?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 5.30 p.m., the 
House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-275, an act respecting the protection and rehabilitation of 
endangered and threatened species, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I appreciate the debate taking place 
this afternoon on the protection and rehabilitation of endangered 
and threatened species. I would like to thank the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River and the member for Fraser Valley 
West for their support in their respective committees when it 
was decided that this bill should become a votable item.
<P>
	In essence the reason for putting forward this private 
members' bill is very simple. It emanates from one important 
commitment made by Canada to the UN conference on 
sustainable development and the environment in Rio in 1992.
<P>
	When the convention on biodiversity was arrived at with the 
consensus of some 150 nations, Canada was among the first, if 
not the first nation to sign it, if I remember correctly. It was 
among the first to ratify it. In other words, there was definitely a 
very quick response on the part of Canada. There was an 
understanding of the importance of the issue and the political 
sentiments of the nation. The aspirations of Canadians were 
expressed rapidly through these steps.
<P>
	The signing or ratification of the convention has now reached 
a fairly large number and has been put into motion by virtue of 
the fact that a sufficient number of nations in the world have 
ratified it to make it workable.
<P>
	What does a bill on the rehabilitation of endangered and 
threatened species mean? With this piece of legislation, which I 
hope will be followed by a measure to be introduced soon by the 
Minister of the Environment, we want to highlight the 
importance of the ecosystem to which we belong and the 
importance of protecting the richness that makes Canada so 
unique in the family of nations.
<P>
	If one compares the richness in biodiversity and the number of 
species both in flora and fauna that exist today with what existed 
a hundred years ago, one has to admit with regret that there have 
been losses with respect to some species that may never be 
recovered. In other words, we have lost ground as humans have 
settled in the country and have adopted various agricultural and 
industrial practices at the expense of nature. If one looks down 
the road 100 years from now at the richness of fauna and flora 
our grandchildren may be able to enjoy,  unless we do something 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14250"> 14250 </A></B>
<P>
about it fairly soon we would suffer perhaps the equivalent or 
even greater losses.
<P>
	Therefore it is necessary to put on the political agenda and on 
the agenda of Parliament, as well as those of the provincial and 
territorial legislatures, something that coagulates or gels our 
thinking on the subject matter. The bill before us attempts to do 
exactly that. It is inspired by article VII of the convention, the 
one I referred to earlier, which requires countries to:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-develop and maintain the necessary legislation and/or other regulatory 
provisions for the protection of threatened species and populations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is how it was put in the Rio convention which we have 
signed and ratified. It is a very simple, straightforward concept. 
I am sure that its application and implementation can be 
achieved if there is adequate political will.
<P>
	I am glad to report that four Canadian provinces have 
endangered species legislation today. They are the provinces of 
New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba. Close 
co-operation with provincial and native governments is 
necessary to protect endangered species. Preventing the 
extinction of species becomes a method of national and even 
international concern.
<P>
	I am not claiming this private member's bill can achieve all 
that, but it is at least an attempt to subject the matter to 
parliamentary scrutiny, to encourage colleagues on all sides of 
the House to think about the importance of the matter, and to 
ensure that respective governments take the necessary steps.
<P>
	There are 120 species that are either threatened or endangered 
in Canada. Of those 120, 43 are under federal responsibility: 18 
species of migratory birds and 25 fish and marine mammals. The 
habitats of these threatened or endangered species are quickly 
disappearing. According to Statistics Canada calculations the 
wetlands have been reduced by 70 per cent to 80 per cent so far 
and the old growth forests by as much as 85 per cent to 90 per 
cent. These are considerable figures which I commend to the 
attention of the House.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	The following commitment appeared in the red book of the 
Liberal Party in 1993:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Managing economic development in human growth without destroying the 
life systems on our planet and a vision of a society that protects the long term 
health and diversity of all species on the planet are matters of concern.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In a study conducted in 1991 Statistics Canada concluded that 
86 per cent of Canadians supported the protection of the 
abundance of species we have today. Bill C-275 is simply aimed 
at identifying, protecting and rehabilitating endangered and 
threatened species both in the realm of flora and fauna and both 
in the sense that they have become directly or indirectly 
threatened or endangered. Why? It is as a result of human 
activity.
<P>
	The bill provides the Minister of the Environment with the 
powers to develop and implement programs aimed at restoring 
the populations of threatened and endangered species to 
self-sustaining numbers. Time does not permit me to list the 
names of the various species. There are too many. However, they 
are attached to the bill by way of a schedule for any member who 
would wish to examine it. The bill attempts to provide a context 
for existing federal and provincial legislation in a 
complementary and unifying sense that is concerned with 
protecting threatened or endangered species.
<P>
	The bill provides a legislative basis for two institutions: 
COSEWIC, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife 
in Canada, and RNEW, the Recovery of National Endangered 
Wildlife. For members who might not have heard the terms 
before, they are two important committees in the protection of 
endangered species. However they are not required by law and 
the bill before us today would change the situation.
<P>
	In addition the scientific expertise of Committee on the Status 
of Endangered Wildlife in Canada would continue to provide the 
important first step in identifying threatened or endangered 
species. In the recovery of nationally endangered wildlife 
groups it would still be a required step in protecting endangered 
species. However, Bill C-275 seeks to provide both COSEWIC 
and RNEW with a common legislative framework to allow for a 
more responsible, consistent and accountable approach to the 
identification and recovery of threatened and endangered 
species. It draws from the categorization prepared over the years 
by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in 
Canada, COSEWIC. The bill contains two schedules which are 
available to members. Schedule A lists endangered species and 
schedule B lists threatened species.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	The listing of certain species and requiring the minister to 
represent their interests have the purpose of allowing recovery 
programs to be developed prior to species becoming 
endangered. It is a good precautionary concept. The preventive 
approach is more sensible and less expensive than simply 
allowing threatened species to become endangered species and 
then trying to recover them from the brink of endangerment and 
to regain ground. In other words the present approach can be 
subjected to improvements, and this is what Bill C-275 is all 
about.
<P>
	As to public accountability, Bill C-275 contains a provision 
whereby any Canadian may make a representation to the 
Minister of the Environment in writing requesting the minister 
to add or delete a species from the threatened or endangered list. 
I hope it will be used for adding rather than deleting.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14251"> 14251 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister must respond within 180 days, advising what 
course of action will be taken and why. This will have the effect 
of allowing for public knowledge and traditional knowledge 
systems such as those offered by the aboriginal people to work 
together with the scientific process represented by COSEWIC in 
determining which species in Canada are identifiable as 
endangered or threatened.
<P>
	Every year the Recovery of Nationally Endangered Wildlife 
group shall report to the minister on the effectiveness of the 
recovery programs carried out in the previous year. The report is 
to be tabled in Parliament not later than June 1 of the year the 
report was submitted to the minister. This will be done to 
address the criticism presently levelled at the Recovery of 
Nationally Endangered Wildlife group that it lacks 
accountability and is too slow in enacting recovery programs.
<P>
	I am sure many members of Parliament and the public at large 
would be fascinated, rather intrigued and quite attracted to 
becoming involved if they were familiar with the work done by 
both COSEWIC and RNEW.
<P>
	To conclude very briefly, according to the bill the minister 
shall table no later than June 1 of every a report of a list of every 
species added to or removed from either the threatened or 
endangered list. The report will include the summary of the 
information that led to the species being removed or added to the 
respective list.
<P>
	In essence the bill would provide a more coherent approach 
than we have at present to the protection of threatened and 
endangered species in Canada, while recognizing the 
importance of working in close co-operation with the provinces, 
the territories, the municipalities, aboriginal people and so on, 
so as to ensure recovery programs for endangered or threatened 
species are successful.
<P>
	Furthermore the bill builds on the established systems of 
expertise represented by the people involved and presently 
active in COSEWIC and RNEW, so as to ensure that sound 
scientific principles are maintained when listing threatened or 
endangered species while providing the opportunity-and this is 
the main point of the bill to which I keep returning-and the 
importance of public input and public accountability.
<P>
	This ends my presentation on Bill C-275 which I commend to 
the attention of my hon. colleagues. I hope they will find some 
positive aspects and sufficient substance in the bill to warrant 
having it sent to committee for necessary improvements and 
reinforcements.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	As I said at the outset, it is a measure that emanates from the 
Rio de Janiero conference. It flows from Canada's fascination 
and understandable pride in the richness of its wildlife and in the 
desire to ensure that what we have inherited will remain for 
generations to come because we all love our wildlife and we all 
love nature.
<P>
	Also as politicians we want to make a contribution to the work 
that is being done outside the political ranks in the communities 
at large in order to ensure that this richness remains one of the 
great things that makes Canada known and admired and desired 
by so many people abroad.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is with great interest that I rise to speak today to Bill C-275, a 
bill tabled by the hon. member for Davenport.
<P>
	For approximately one year now, I have had the good fortune 
of sitting on the Standing Committee on the Environment and 
Sustainable Development chaired by the hon. member for 
Davenport. He is so interested in the cause and devotes such 
effort to it that he is undoubtedly a first rate environmentalist 
and a true defender of our environment. However, the hon. 
member is also a staunch federalist, which, in my opinion, 
makes him lean dangerously towards centralization, which we 
do not consider an option and which can only have nefarious 
effects on the environment.
<P>
	Centralization would burn bridges with the community; 
centralization would distance us from the community; 
centralization would make us more out of touch with the 
community. Therefore, the environment would lose out under an 
excessively centralized system, because the environment is very 
much a hands-on field and the local and provincial governments 
have a bigger presence in this field than the federal government.
<P>
	It is becoming increasingly obvious that we have to give 
jurisdiction for the environment to the provinces and to the local 
governments. Furthermore, I would like to stress that the hon. 
member stated himself at a press conference this morning that 
aboriginal peoples should be given full jurisdiction over the 
area. He seemed to have really been caught off guard by a 
question that a journalist asked, which was whether the federal 
government was being hypocritical by denying the provinces the 
jurisdiction which it wants to give to aboriginal people. 
Obviously uncomfortable, he muttered that certain provinces 
wanted national standards.
<P>
	Therefore, I would ask him the following questions: Will he, 
who is so big on democracy, impose his standards on the other 
provinces which do not want national standards? Will he accept 
that certain provinces refuse to adopt the standards? These are 
questions which merit a reply and for which the hon. member for 
Davenport is not very clear.
<P>
	The summary of the bill indicates that it provides for: ``the 
identification, protection and rehabilitation of flora and fauna in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14252"> 14252 </A></B>
<P>
Canada threatened or endangered by human activity, to provide 
for the protection of habitat and the restoration of population''.
<P>
	Certainly, nobody can be against the protection of endangered 
animal species and populations. As inhabitants of this planet, we 
have the duty of respecting and protecting all species with which 
we share the planet. Otherwise, we are opening the door to the 
extinction of our own species. Too often, however, we remain 
oblivious to the need to protect the environment. More and more 
species are becoming extinct and more and more are threatened, 
mainly because of human interference.
<P>
	Recently, the Standing Committee on Environment and 
Sustainable Development sponsored a seminar on wildlife. This 
very useful and interesting activity gave us an opportunity to 
become more aware of all the threats to wildlife. Believe me, it 
was not a pretty picture. Witnesses who were invited to speak on 
the subject described an alarming situation that required prompt 
and decisive action. They described the impact of poaching, 
smuggling and destruction of natural habitat with a lot of 
expertise and considerable emotion.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	They also pointed out the inadequacy of federal action in this 
field. Not enough financial resources were available to provide 
for more effective local control of the situations already 
mentioned. It was clear to us in the Bloc Quebecois that once 
again, the federal government was not up to the task in this area.
<P>
	Canada is even incapable of complying with certain 
international agreements in this sector. One example is the 
CITES agreement to monitor and stop the trafficking in organs 
or endangered species. At the seminar, intervenors made it 
abundantly clear that the federal government failed to allocate 
the resources to meet its commitments in this respect. As a result 
we have considerable misgivings about the federal 
government's desire to protect threatened wildlife and plants 
and also about its ability to do so.
<P>
	That is why we cannot allow the federal government to 
intrude even further in provincial jurisdictions. Although the 
bill presented by the hon. member for Davenport has its merits, 
some of its clauses reflect a desire to encroach on provincial 
jurisdictions, and that we cannot accept. For instance, in clause 
8(2), the minister shall secure the carrying out of a recovery 
program by agreement with the province or municipality 
concerned. But, and this is the sticking point, the clause includes 
the phrase: ``where possible''.
<P>
	What does the hon. member think would happen if it were not 
possible? And what about possible agreements with the 
municipalities? As far as I know, they come under provincial 
jurisdiction. This clause is typical of the attitude of government 
members. The Liberals are very good at saying ``where 
possible'', although they know perfectly well that very often it 
would be impossible. If we consider current federal-provincial 
harmonization agreements, it is clear there are quite a few 
problems with these agreements.
<P>
	The federal government has quite simply failed to get the 
provinces to agree on quite a few issues. The authoritarian 
approach of the Minister of the Environment has been one of the 
main reasons why agreements have not been signed. According 
to our information, the minister has even been challenged at 
these federal-provincial sessions. I may point out to the hon. 
member that Quebec, with whom Canada will soon have to 
negotiate on an equal footing on these matters, recently 
launched its policy on biodiversity and at the same time asked 
Ottawa to mind its own business as far as provincial 
jurisdictions were concerned.
<P>
	In fact, the Quebec minister of wildlife and the environment, 
Jacques Brassard, made public his proposed strategy for 
preserving Quebec's biological diversity, on May 18. In 
announcing it, he said: ``Its actual implementation will be 
Quebec's responsibility in the end. This was the decision of the 
Government of Quebec in 1992''. I close the quotes by pointing 
out that the Government of Quebec in question was red and 
federalist, like those opposite. It was not the wicked separatists.
<P>
	Mr. Brassard went on to say: ``We will be the ones to act. This 
is why the federal strategy contains no measures and ours has 
over 200. I do not foresee any trouble, so long as the federal 
government stays where it is''. Make no mistake: the Quebec 
minister was talking on May 18 about the bill the federal 
minister was to table, which has since vanished never to be 
heard of again. To replace what the federal minister withdrew, 
the government is proposing the bill of the member for 
Davenport. It decided to give him a bit of rope and to untie his 
hands. This is a good way to give Liberal members the 
impression they are useful for something in Parliament.
<P>
	Moreover, the minister has her hands full at the moment. With 
all the mail she has to check and even her fictional mail and with 
everything she says here and there, she and her acolytes have a 
lot of salvaging to do and corrections to make. The minister has 
become a great big surprise package. The same rabbit that pops 
out of the magician's hat could pop out of her mouth. This is 
farce, burlesque. I think the minister has really missed her 
calling.
<P>
	To finish up what I was saying about Mr. Brassard, he told the 
federal government clearly to focus its actions on areas under its 
jurisdiction and, more particularly, to regulate international and 
interprovincial trade and to maintain a constant vigil to stop the 
illegal traffic in endangered species.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14253"> 14253 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Quebec's message is clear-no encroachment in areas under 
Quebec's jurisdiction. We therefore oppose the bill proposed by 
the member for Davenport. In our opinion, it will be the source 
of confrontation with the provinces. Furthermore, for the 
federalist provinces, this bill is no pledge of effectiveness in 
species protection. As I mentioned, the federal government has 
the unfortunate habit of not applying its environmental 
legislation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this 
private member's bill put forward by my colleague from 
Davenport.
<P>
	Bill C-275 provides for the identification and rehabilitation 
of flora and fauna in Canada threatened or endangered by human 
activity and provides for the protection of habitat and 
restoration of populations.
<P>
	Endangered species is an important Canadian environmental 
issue that should be carefully considered within a 
comprehensive, biodiversity strategy. According to one 
estimate, species are going extinct globally at the rate of several 
species a day. Since the arrival of the Europeans, only nine 
species have been rendered extinct in Canada.
<P>
	Last April reports indicated that Canada had 263 species 
listed at risk. Some of the endangered species include the 
whooping crane, beluga whale and the peregrine falcon. The list 
is growing steadily and only last April eight new species were 
added. Once a species is lost, it is forever and the actions cannot 
be reversed.
<P>
	The Brundtland commission identified one of the 
prerequisites to sustainable development as the protection of 
species and ecosystems. The fundamental goal of endangered 
species legislation must be to ensure that no further native 
species go extinct and that already endangered species recover 
to healthy, self-sustaining population levels using the most 
efficient, effective, fair and balanced means possible.
<P>
	In 1992 Canada signed the Convention on Biological 
Diversity. This agreement calls on nations to retain a healthy 
population of the many varied species in the wild and commits 
signatories to introducing legislation to protect endangered 
species. Japan, Australia and the United States all have federal 
endangered species laws in place at the moment. The 
development of comprehensive legal protection for endangered 
species is a first step in meeting Canada's international 
commitments.
<P>
	The federal government has jurisdiction over the management 
and preservation of wildlife on federal lands such as national 
parks. Provinces have jurisdiction over the management of all 
wildlife not falling within the federal jurisdiction. Only four 
provinces, as my colleague has mentioned, Manitoba, Ontario, 
Quebec and New Brunswick have provincial endangered species 
acts. These laws enable, but do not compel, governments to 
develop  a national list of endangered species and implement 
recovery plans. The remaining provinces have no endangered 
species legislation.
<P>
	There are 12 pieces of federal legislation ranging from health 
regulations to trade rules that address species protection. These 
federal laws must be harmonized. Rather than developing a 
weak and ineffective set of standards, the federal government 
should work with the provinces to come up with a common set of 
standards that will be agreeable to all parties right across the 
country.
<P>
	It is my hope that the federal environment minister will work 
co-operatively with provincial and territorial governments to 
develop such a strategy. I understand that harmonized 
endangered species legislation is currently in the works.
<P>
	Last November the environment minister stated in the House 
that framework legislation would be introduced this spring. 
Members have seen a discussion paper and working document 
but there has been nothing concrete as yet. However, I suspect 
we will see endangered species legislation in the fall.
<P>
	With federal legislation already in the works, this private 
member's bill may best serve as an example for discussion and 
consideration by the standing committee and the environment 
minister.
<P>
	As part of the process, it is important that all interested parties 
have the opportunity to take part in the consultation process. 
The government should consult a broad cross section of 
stakeholders, including rural and urban centres, and 
consultation must be open to the public.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	It is important that when we develop endangered species 
legislation we give serious consideration to the variety of 
options available. Laws must be balanced in meeting both the 
environmental and economic needs of the country.
<P>
	Habitat protection will be a contentious and difficult issue 
when dealing with endangered species protection and laws must 
be fair and balanced. We need to encourage private land owners 
to protect endangered species and their habitats as opposed to 
heavy handed legislation that would penalize land owners. 
Clearly we have to have the land owners on side.
<P>
	Bill C-275 does not set out how far the minister can go in 
taking action to protect endangered species and it is unlikely we 
will see this clearly spelled out until the minister tables the bill 
this fall.
<P>
	Canadians do now want laws that will be economically 
destructive. We recently saw the U.S. Endangered Species Act 
shut down a large portion of the west coast logging to save the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14254"> 14254 </A></B>
<P>
spotted owl, thus devastating entire communities. Endangered 
species legislation must be fair and reasonable and not 
draconian in approach.
<P>
	Section 9 of Bill C-275 proposes to give the minister the 
power to forbid or restrict use of, access to, activity on, or the 
use of any substance on lands that directly threaten the success 
of a recovery program. It is most important that we ensure 
private property rights are respected when any activity or use of 
lands is being restricted.
<P>
	Section 11(1) of the bill empowers the minister to pay 
compensation when actions to protect endangered or threatened 
species affect a person's property or livelihood. This clause 
merits serious consideration. When personal property or 
restriction on the use of property are affected by government 
action, compensation must be addressed. I am sure my colleague 
will address this in detail when his turn comes up.
<P>
	Another area of concern with the bill is section 5(2). This 
section gives the minister power to implement a recovery 
program if the minister is advised the cause or probable cause is 
of human origin. I am concerned this section may be too open 
ended as it allows the minister to take action before an 
investigation has taken place. The minister is not required to 
have proof that actions are warranted or justified. I feel this is 
dangerous.
<P>
	Section 5(2) must be tightened up to ensure individual rights 
are protected. It is not good enough to take action because the 
minister has been advised of probable cause; rather, cause must 
be determined and action should, if necessary, be implemented.
<P>
	In addition, endangered species legislation should apply 
equally to all Canadian citizens regardless of race or ethnicity. 
Two sections of the bill imply native Indians may be exempt 
from legislation or subject to a separate set of rules and 
regulations. This needs to be reviewed, as there can be only one 
set of laws applied equally to everyone in Canada.
<P>
	Whatever rules and regulations are drawn up regarding the 
protection of endangered species they should be applied 
nationwide and with equality. The minister should not be 
negotiating private deals with one group and applying a set of 
regulations to another.
<P>
	I am concerned about the potential implications of this 
section. Legislation should establish one comprehensive set of 
rules to be applied equally to all Canadians.
<P>
	I take the opportunity to voice my concerns regarding the 
trade in endangered species and animal parts. The bill addressed 
endangered species but Canada is also faced with serious 
problems regarding the trafficking of wildlife and animal parts 
and continues to be used as a transit route for shipments of 
illegal wildlife destined for other countries. This is particularly 
so in my riding of Comox-Alberni on Vancouver Island. 
Penalties must be severe enough to act as a deterrent 
commensurate with the commercial value of endangered species 
and their parts.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for bringing this private members' 
bill forward in the House. Although I do not agree with all 
sections of the bill, some of the proposals warrant serious 
consideration and I hope the environment minister will look at 
some of the ideas contained in the bill as she drafts her 
legislation. I look forward to looking at the issue more closely 
when the minister tables the legislation.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, in rising to speak on Bill C-275 I congratulate the hon. 
member for Davenport for his tireless work to bring the bill 
before the House of Commons. More important, I congratulate 
the hon. member for his tireless efforts to protect Canada's 
endangered and threatened species.
<P>
	The caribou, the sea otter, the wolverine, the burrowing owl, 
the blue ash and the red mulberry are just a few of the more than 
240 endangered, threatened or vulnerable species in Canada.
<P>
	Human activity is putting those species at risk. It is up to us as 
human beings to understand our failings and to work to reverse 
those failings. When we kill or injure an endangered species we 
are putting at risk a unique life form. When we buy or sell, 
import or export an endangered species we are trafficking in the 
extinction of a species.
<P>
	All Canadians have a responsibility to prevent native wild 
species from disappearing from the face of the globe as a result 
of human activity. All Canadians have a responsibility to protect 
endangered species to the full extent of our powers. All of us 
must do what we can to help those species recover.
<P>
	In Canada wetlands have been reduced by over 70 per cent. 
We have lost 99 per cent of tall grass prairie. No single Canadian 
is to blame. We are all to blame and it is up to all of us to act at 
every level of government, in every occupation, in every 
community and neighbourhood across the country.
<P>
	Four provinces have acted to introduce endangered species 
legislation; Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick 
deserve credit for their actions. It is now clearly time for the 
federal government to do its part in areas of federal jurisdiction. 
It is also time for the federal government to push hard for 
co-operative national and international action.
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. member for Davenport, understands 
that and the Minister of the Environment understands that. That 
is why the minister last fall outlined the federal government's 
intention to introduce endangered species legislation. It is why 
she held the first ever public consultations on the basics of such 
a law. It is why she has committed herself to bring such a law 
before cabinet in the next few weeks and to allow Canadians to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14255"> 14255 </A></B>
<P>
comment on the law before it receives detailed scrutiny by 
Parliament.
<P>
	I am very pleased the hon. member for Davenport and the 
Minister of the Environment are working so closely together to 
advance the cause of endangered species. Obviously as Liberals 
we support their efforts and we are pleased to see real federal 
leadership.
<P>
	However, this is not a partisan cause and I regret some of the 
comments I have heard in the House which clearly appeared to 
be of a partisan nature. I know members of Parliament from 
every party and every part of the country, including Quebec, 
want to see Canada a true world leader in protecting endangered 
species.
<P>
	Canada was the first industrialized country to sign the United 
Nations convention on biological diversity. We need to transfer 
our goodwill and our signature on a piece of paper into real 
action to preserve our country's biological diversity. We owe 
that to future generations of human beings and we certainly owe 
that to future generations of endangered species.
<P>
	Canadians like to keep their word. In article 8K of the 
convention on biological diversity, Canada promised to develop 
or maintain necessary legislation and/or other regulatory 
provisions for the protection of threatened species and 
populations. That is one good reason the hon. member and the 
minister are pushing for action.
<P>
	There is another good reason to take action. Canadian 
children expect us to act. They have petitioned and written the 
Minister of the Environment in unprecedented numbers to call 
for the protection of endangered fish, marine mammals and 
migratory birds.
<P>
	I recently received many responses from my spring-summer 
householder, something all members send out. Concern for the 
environment was at the top of the list.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	I have heard it described as a sexy issue that has now been 
pushed to the background. That is nonsense. If we let this issue 
be pushed to the background we will all pay a very heavy price.
<P>
	Canadian children and all Canadians believe or should believe 
that living organisms have the right to live. They do not 
understand how someone could make a living by selling off the 
parts of an endangered species. Canada's children are right.
<P>
	Important scientific and financial issues must be addressed. 
There are certainly important issues raised by provinces, 
aboriginal peoples and farmers that must be addressed. 
Legislation must be realistic and fair. Not all the issues are easy 
but all of the issues must be resolved.
<P>
	The biological foundation for our world depends on its 
diversity of genes, species and ecosystems. We need each sphere 
of our society to demonstrate both leadership and partnership in 
protecting endangered species. We do not need overlap or 
duplication or wasteful actions. We need swift action.
<P>
	Conservation of endangered species is not the sole 
responsibility of the federal government, nor of any 
government. All elements of society have an interest in 
protecting species and all elements of our society should be 
intimately involved in planning, developing and implementing 
conservation programs.
<P>
	It is important for the federal government to pass legislation 
that can be a model to the world, legislation that seeks to put an 
end to the extinction of species as a result of human activity. The 
federal government must do its part to make things right for 
Canada's wild plants and animals.
<P>
	That is the policy underlying the legislation introduced by my 
friend and colleague from Davenport. That is the policy 
underlying the actions taken by my friend and colleague the 
Minister of the Environment. I believe it is the policy that must 
guide Parliament in our work to protect endangered species, and 
I am very pleased to have added some thoughts to today's 
debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my intention, in the next few 
minutes, to demonstrate to those watching that Bill C-275, 
which is before us today, is a typical example of inefficiency 
resulting from the overlaps that are caused by poor 
co-ordination between the federal government and Quebec.
<P>
	This bill, as was pointed out by my hon. colleague, the 
member for Laurentides, and I am going to repeat it because it is 
important, provides for the identification, protection and 
rehabilitation of flora and fauna in Canada threatened or 
endangered by human activity-the hon. member for Davenport 
has provided a fairly impressive list, I believe-to provide for 
the protection of habitat and the restoration of population.
<P>
	This is a laudable sentiment, and obviously this bill is 
interesting because the government is limiting its legislation to 
federally owned lands. After all, the government is perfectly 
justified in taking environmental action on lands that belong to 
it.
<P>
	But the problem lies in the fact that fauna, understandably, do 
not stay in one place, and sooner or later appear on sites where 
the federal government does not have exclusive jurisdiction. 
There is therefore a need for an agreement with the other 
governments concerned, including the government of Quebec, 
all the more so as the latter has already made known its 
intentions in this regard in a letter sent to the attention of the 
Minister of the Environment last March 28.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14256"> 14256 </A></B>
<P>
	In the circumstances, the least we could expect from the 
federal government is that it would consult the government of 
Quebec to find out its intentions and that it would table a bill 
taking into account the potential conflicts of jurisdiction with 
Quebec.
<P>
	With respect to the environment, the distribution of powers is 
not fully spelled out, adding to the risk of overlap, 
overregulation and duplication. Let us look more specifically at 
the somewhat ill defined distribution of powers.
<P>
	With respect to terrestrial fauna, Quebec has full authority 
over the species inhabiting the public or private lands held by 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	It may also take steps to protect species and their habitat. The 
federal government has jurisdiction over land animals on 
federal land only.
<P>
	As far as our feathered friends are concerned, the federal 
government was responsible for implementing the 1916 
convention on migratory birds. Since this was an international 
agreement, the federal government at the time assumed 
responsibility for protecting these birds.
<P>
	Today, Quebec is responsible for all bird species, including 
migratory birds, except on federal land. One wonders what 
happens when birds are neither on provincial land nor on federal 
land. Furthermore, following a number of administrative 
agreements, Quebec is now responsible for enforcing Canadian 
legislation on the 1916 convention on migratory birds.
<P>
	Finally, as far as marine mammals and fish are 
concerned-certain fish species are also on the endangered 
list-the Constitution Act, 1867 gives the federal government 
exclusive jurisdiction over ocean and inland fisheries. As of 
1922, however, an administrative agreement gives Quebec full 
responsibility for fisheries management, without any regulatory 
powers, however.
<P>
	This delegation of authority has changed over the years, and 
today, Quebec is responsible for managing freshwater resources 
and the species they contain, while the federal government 
manages salt water resources. The division of powers remains a 
problem.
<P>
	In the light of the foregoing, it is clear that agreements on the 
division of powers in environmental matters will require a very 
sensitive approach. Bill C-275, however, ignores the very 
existence of this problem, which is why it merely increases the 
likelihood of overlap and jurisdictional disputes between 
Quebec and the federal government.
<P>
	In fact, the Minister of the Environment is well aware of the 
dangers of overlap and the potential for jurisdictional disputes. 
In a letter dated March 28, her Quebec counterpart, and I 
referred to this letter earlier, wrote that the federal bill on 
endangered species constituted an intrusion into one of 
Quebec's jurisdictions.
<P>
	Not only does this government not consult Quebec but there is 
no attempt to consult within the government itself. In his letter, 
the Quebec Environment Minister suggested ways to regulate 
this area, saying that the minister should focus federal action on 
aspects that were obviously federal in scope, in other words, 
regulating international and interprovincial trade and exercising 
constant vigilance to prevent unlawful trafficking in endangered 
species. The bill before us today, however, does not reflect these 
suggestions, which means that the Liberal government's 
spokespersons for environmental matters may not have bothered 
to discuss the matter. Or even worse, they did and deliberately 
decided to ``invade'' an area over which Quebec has specific 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	We certainly do not doubt the sincerity of the hon. member for 
Davenport, and I am sure, because I know him personally 
through the Standing Committee on the Environment, that the 
bill he introduced today is based on a genuine desire that is 
found the world over to protect the environment.
<P>
	However, despite this sincerity, there is a significant risk that 
this bill will encroach on Quebec's jurisdictions. Even if the 
hon. member's motions are sincere, this is something we cannot 
accept.
<P>
	I realize, and here I want to add a more personal note, that this 
is not the first time we rise in the House to speak out against bills 
or to say that there is a risk of encroaching on Quebec's 
jurisdictions. Every time we do, we look like troublemakers. I 
feel a bit like a troublemaker myself when I do this. Quite often, 
the bills introduced in the House are, to all intents and purposes, 
good bills.
<P>
	From time to time, in committee, we draft dissenting opinions 
on committee reports which, all things considered, were 
excellent. However, we had to file our minority reports because 
the majority reports contained some very serious threats to 
Quebec's jurisdictions.
<P>
	I think we should consider the demographic evolution of 
Quebecers since the founding of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	When Canada was founded, the number of francophones and 
anglophones was about even. Today, we represent only 23 per 
cent of the population. We used to be one of four provinces. 
Today, we are one of ten and may become one of 12 or 13, when 
the territories gain provincial status. Quebecers are one of 
Canada's endangered species.
<P>
	That being said, I think we must protect the interests of 
Quebecers. That is what we were elected to do. I know this bill is 
sincere and relatively well drafted, but because it represents a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14257"> 14257 </A></B>
<P>
serious threat to Quebec's jurisdictions, we intend to vote 
against this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to take part in this debate on the bill introduced by 
the hon. member for Davenport.
<P>
	First, I want to praise the hon. member for his unflagging 
commitment to environmental issues. Second, I want to point 
out how dedication to a cause can result in progress. Third, I 
wish to talk about the importance of protecting and 
rehabilitating endangered and threatened species.
<P>
	My colleague from Davenport is well known for his 
commitment to environmental issues through his work as chair 
of the standing committee on the environment and sustainable 
development.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	The hon. member has devoted his political career to keeping 
the environmental cause in the foreground in society and at the 
centre of debates in the House of Commons. He knows that 
sustainable development is the only way to secure our 
generation's prosperity without endangering the prosperity of 
generations to come.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	He knows that preservation of the world's biodiversity is 
central to the preservation of the world's environment and the 
world's future success. He knows that taking an ecosystem 
approach to environmental issues is critical. We have to look at 
the big picture and understand that every action in any sphere of 
the environment can have and does have implications for other 
parts of the environment.
<P>
	That brings me to my second point, that the dedication of the 
hon. member has helped to ensure that the protection of 
endangered species has become a national priority. Thanks to 
forceful advocacy by the hon. member and others, our party 
made protection of endangered species a core part of the Liberal 
red book. We promised to introduce Canada's first 
comprehensive federal law to protect endangered species, and 
we are going to keep that promise to Canadians.
<P>
	Bill C-275 received first reading in the House of Commons 
last September. Since that time the Minister of the Environment 
has called for wide-ranging public consultation on a law to 
protect endangered species. A few weeks ago the minister 
completed those hearings and outlined the fundamentals of the 
new law to the last national consultation meeting.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the minister herself said, she received over 5,000 very 
articulate letters from grade school and high school students in 
support of such a law. That is why she drafted the bill hand in 
hand with representatives of the industry, the farming sector, 
aboriginal organizations and the provinces and territories.
<P>
	In addition, the Minister of the Environment and the hon. 
member for Davenport joined forces to ensure that their wishes 
for a law to protect threatened species became a reality. Their 
determination reflects the determination of the Liberal Party 
and our government. Their determination reflects the wishes of 
the vast majority of the members of this House and, more 
importantly, the desire of the vast majority of the Canadian 
public to bring in such a law.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The law is coming very, very quickly thanks in large part to 
many years of hard work and dedication by the chair of the 
standing committee on environment and sustainable 
development.
<P>
	This brings me to the third point. The preservation of 
endangered and threatened species is of vital importance to this 
country. As the school children who mounted the campaign for 
endangered species legislation said, ``There otter be a law''. 
Mammals, birds, amphibians, fish, invertebrates, plants, and 
other wild organisms all play a critical role in the environment 
of our country. Endangered fish, endangered marine animals, 
endangered waterfowl, and endangered migratory birds are all 
an important federal matter.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	The species of the world contribute to the ecological wonders 
of the world. Of course these species have the right to exist for 
their own sake, but it is important to remember how much these 
species matter to us. They provide us with learning 
opportunities. They are part of our history. They offer artistic 
and spiritual inspiration. They are part of our identity as a 
country and as human beings. They help to sustain us 
environmentally, culturally, and economically.
<P>
	Consider the list of endangered or threatened species in 
Canada and imagine how much poorer a country we would be 
without them. The Vancouver Island marmot, the beluga whale, 
the peregrine falcon, the leatherback turtle, the Acadian 
whitefish, the prairie orchid, the wood poppy, the wood bison, 
the harbour porpoise, the white-headed woodpecker, and the 
trumpeter swan are some of the endangered, threatened, or 
vulnerable species in Canada. These are some of the species that 
need protection and restoration. They are species whose habitat 
is disappearing or who have been victims of pollution or have 
been 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14258"> 14258 </A></B>
<P>
slaughtered so that a few human beings may trade in their 
precious products. That is clearly wrong. That is clearly foolish.
<P>
	It is important to note the efforts undertaken by conservancy 
organizations throughout the country to preserve and protect 
some of our endangered species. I can think of no better example 
than the Wye Marsh Wildlife Centre in Midland, Ontario, which 
is located in my riding of Simcoe North. A few weeks ago I had 
the extreme honour of celebrating the 25th anniversary of the 
official opening of the Wye Marsh centre with many of its 
supporters. The centre is today a national example of leadership 
and ecological awareness and understanding of the importance 
of wetlands and wildlife in our world. In the past few years this 
centre has been very active in its program to increase the 
trumpeter swan population, which we know is very vulnerable.
<P>
	It is now the time to assist Wye Marsh and similar 
organizations with meaningful and effective legislation. In 
addition to this private member's bill, the member for 
Davenport went to great lengths to organize a forum on wildlife, 
which was hosted last April by the standing committee on 
environment and sustainable development. This was a great 
opportunity for the members of the committee to discuss this 
serious matter with a variety of experts and organizations 
devoted to the protection of endangered species. I know that for 
me personally it gave me a newfound understanding of the 
consequences at hand and an appreciation of the urgency of this 
type of legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Davenport and the Minister of the 
Environment are determined to put an end to these unfortunate 
practices in the federal jurisdiction. They are determined to 
have Parliament pass a law with teeth. They are also determined 
to see Canada adopt a credible and co-ordinated action plan to 
protect threatened and endangered species.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In our red book we committed the Liberal government to a 
vision of society that protects the longterm health and diversity 
of all species on the planet. The initiative we are debating today 
is one important contribution by the hon. member for Davenport 
to advance that vision and to advance that cause. We all ought to 
join him in this worthwhile cause. His bill is proof that he 
remains as committed as ever to providing good government for 
this country and responsible policies for the world's 
environment.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, the time provided for the 
consideration of private members' business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>

	The House resumed from June 19, consideration of the motion 
in relation to the amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-69, 
an act to provide for the establishment of electoral boundaries 
commissions and the readjustment of electoral boundaries; and 
of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-69, an act to provide for the 
establishment of electoral boundaries commissions and the 
readjustment of electoral boundaries.
<P>
	To start off, I would like to say that we proposed an 
amendment to improve Bill C-69. As we were denied this 
amendment, which was defeated in the House, we cannot 
support this bill.
<P>
	It was essential for us to ensure proportional representation 
for Quebec in the unlikely event of other  elections here in the 
federal system involving Quebec. We think it would be very 
surprising, but, if it did happen, we had to guarantee that Quebec 
had at least 25 per cent representation. We were denied our 
amendment; it was defeated democratically in the House and, 
for this reason, essentially, we cannot support this bill.
<P>
	I must also point out the importance of the readjustment 
commissions, the commissions redefining electoral boundaries. 
It should be said that there are some obvious points here. There 
are ridings, like my own, with 110,000 constituents; there are 
other ridings with 43,000 constituents. Representation is 
therefore not proportional. In some regions, ridings are huge, 
and the member of Parliament, even with the best of intentions, 
is unable to serve the entire population.
<P>
	Therefore the changes to the electoral maps planned for every 
five years with the census and the readjustment are fundamental 
and vital. In any decision to readjust boundaries, the primary 
criterion should be proportional representation. Before 
continuing, I would like to point out that it is unlikely that we 
will be involved in any more elections in Ottawa, but I would 
still like to speak to Bill C-69 because it directly affects my 
riding.
<P>
	The federal riding of Terrebonne would be split in two on the 
new electoral maps. This is fine. As I said earlier, having 
110,000 constituents can be a bit difficult, even though things 
are going very well right now. But it is a bit much as far as 
proportional representation is concerned, and they want to split 
the riding in two, to create the ridings of Repentigny and 
Blainville-Terrebonne.
<P>
	This split will be the focus of my speech to the House. Briefly, 
the riding of Terrebonne, as it now stands, the riding I represent, 
has 110,000 voters, as I said earlier, and 160,000 inhabitants. It 
is the most densely populated riding in Quebec, and if memory 
serves, the sixth most densely populated in Canada. We 
therefore agree on the need to readjust the riding's boundaries.
<P>
	I would like to show in this House that it is in the interest of 
the two groups of people concerned to examine the proposed 
ridings of Blainville-Terrebonne and Repentigny. I believe 
that a simple mathematical calculation was performed; 75 
members divided by the number of people. As I will point out, 
there are elementary rules to follow. But these rules have not 
been followed by the electoral boundaries commissions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14261"> 14261 </A></B>
<P>
	To do so, the commissions should go by the rules of 
geographical size and population density. In my riding in 
Lanaudière, the population increased 25 per cent in ten years. 
This was the most significant demographic ``boom'' in Quebec. 
So population density, community of interest, cultural identity 
and the region's historic background-I believe the last two, 
cultural identity and historical background of the region should 
be included as criteria, but these are eliminated from the outset, 
and you will see why.
<P>
	After analysing the two proposed electoral districts, it is clear 
that some of these principles were not considered at all by the 
commission, as I said earlier, I am referring to community of 
interest and historical background of the region.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	I started with the first riding the bill proposed, the riding of 
Blainville-Terrebonne. In its proposal, the commission, which 
visited my riding, suggested putting the following towns: 
Blainville, Bois-des-Filion, Lorraine, Rosemère, 
Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines and Terrebonne together in the riding 
of Blainville-Terrebonne.
<P>
	Although the first five towns met all the criteria, Terrebonne, 
the most densely populated town in the proposed riding, would 
be the big loser. In fact, Terrebonne had a population of 39,678 
at the last census. These residents have no geographical, 
economic or cultural affinity with the other towns in the 
proposed riding.
<P>
	They do not have the same administrative regions, MRCs, 
school boards, economic development corporations, 
employment centres, Quebec manpower development 
corporations or CLSCs, but the commission still wanted to put 
them into one riding, grafting together bits and pieces that have 
nothing in common, and they think this will be a riding that 
makes sense. However, it makes no sense at all to uproot entire 
communities.
<P>
	At a time when we are all working hard to eliminate costly 
duplication and overlap, we think this should be an opportunity 
to reinforce communities of interest instead of dividing them.
<P>
	Considering that the riding of Terrebonne has existed since 
the Constitution Act, 1867-I have already said this here, but I 
want to repeat it in reference to the current bill-considering 
that the commissions are probably going to circulate again, I 
would like to ask the federal electoral boundaries commission to 
reconsider the proposal regarding Blainville-Terrebonne, and 
to decide to leave the riding as Terrebonne.
<P>
	It meets the first criterion, which is historical development. 
Under this criterion, the towns of Lachenaie, Mascouche, 
Terrebonne and La Plaine could be grouped together to form the 
new riding of Terrebonne.
<P>
	According to the decennial census of 1991, the population of 
this new riding would be approximately 91,156, which is within 
1 per cent, or 800 persons, of the electoral quota set for Quebec, 
which is 91,946.
<P>
	In addition, in the next briefs to be presented in the next 
hearings, the commission and Parliament will have to take into 
consideration the fact that the four towns mentioned earlier are 
already considered to form one entity for the purposes of the 
administrative region of Lanaudière, the RCM of Les Moulins, 
the des Manoirs school board, la Société de développement 
économique des Moulins, the Terrebonne Canada Employment 
Centre at Lachenaie, la Société québécoise de développement de 
la main-d'oeuvre and the Lamazer local community health 
centre.
<P>
	Therefore, I believe that I have clearly demonstrated that 
creating the riding of Blainville-Terrebonne would be totally 
irresponsible and irrational. It is our duty to respect 
communities of interest, economic communities, historical 
development and thus to maintain the riding of Terrebonne with 
the new towns as I just explained.
<P>
	Regarding Repentigny, we were pleased to see that the 
previous law created this riding. As I said earlier, with 110,000 
voters, there is no reason for us to oppose the boundary as it 
stands.
<P>
	In fact, the creation of Repentigny corrects a historical 
oversight. On April 16, 1647, Pierre Le Gardeur de Repentigny 
was granted the seigniory of Repentigny. We can only praise this 
acknowledgement of history which is one of the criteria in the 
bill before us.
<P>
	The commission aims to group the towns of Charlemagne, 
Lachenaie, Mascouche, Repentigny and the part of the RCM of 
Les Moulins which is included in the parish of La Plaine in this 
new riding.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	In fact the cities of Charlemagne and Repentigny, on the one 
hand, and Lachenaie, La Plaine and Mascouche, on the other, 
have different RCMs, school boards, economic development 
corporations, manpower development corporations and so on.
<P>
	We can see the aim is to combine two ridings into one, 
regardless of the economic, social and cultural realities of this 
area. Here again, administrative overlap and duplication have 
not been corrected.
<P>
	In the light of the above, we are asking the federal Electoral 
Boundaries Commission for Quebec to review its proposal as 
follows.
<P>
	The proposed electoral district would still be called 
Repentigny. It would include the cities of Charlemagne, 
L'Assomption, L'Épiphanie, Le Gardeur, Repentigny and part of 
the regional county municipality of l'Assomption included in 
the parishes of l'Épiphanie, Saint-Gérard-de-Magella and 
Saint-Sulpice.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14262"> 14262 </A></B>
<P>
	According to the 1991 decennial census, the population of the 
riding proposed, which we propose to improve, is 91,537, here 
again, almost exactly the electoral quota established for 
Quebec, which is, and I repeat, 91,946. Not even a difference of 
300 people. It is therefore realistic.
<P>
	In the new riding, under one administrative region, that of 
Lanaudière; there would be one regional county municipality; 
one school board, the Le Gardeur school board; a single 
economic development corporation; a single employment 
centre, the one in Repentigny; and a single Quebec manpower 
development corporation.
<P>
	In short, the two ridings we are proposing: Terrebonne, in 
keeping with historical changes, and Repentigny, also in 
keeping with these changes, are entirely in accordance with the 
principles established by this same commission.
<P>
	In the light of these facts, we are asking that, with Bill C-69, 
there be a little flexibility when the commissions resume their 
hearings in the regions. We therefore ask the federal Electoral 
Boundaries Commission for Quebec to review its proposal, 
which, we hope, is not cast in stone, and to understand the 
simple, rational and fundamental arguments here for the greater 
well-being of the people concerned by this readjustment. That 
is, of course, in the unlikely event these people will require 
representation in another federal election.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in discussion of Bill C-69, an act 
to provide for the establishment of electoral boundaries 
commissions and the readjustment of electoral boundaries.
<P>
	This bill comes back to us from the Senate and therefore my 
remarks will address essentially the amendments proposed by 
the Senate and our reactions to them.
<P>
	One approaches this debate in a spirit of respect for a 
co-ordinate institution and for the care that the Senate has 
attempted to give for the fulfilment of its constitutional duty. I 
would also say, however, that we are in a special area of the 
constitutional law of Parliament where each Chamber, being 
co-ordinate, must recognize that the histories and traditions of 
the other are different.
<P>
	The House of Commons and the model from which we 
borrowed, the Parliament of Great Britain, separated 
historically from the House of Lords. Therefore conventions as 
to the role, for example, of the Speaker in the internal conduct of 
Parliament are different for the two Houses.
<P>
	That suggests as a principle of constitutional comity a certain 
amount of self-restraint in the attitudes of one House to another. 
For example, it would be improper for the Senate to offer 
suggestions as to the conduct of the Speaker of the House or vice 
versa, the House offering  suggestions on the conduct of the 
Speaker of the Senate, other than in a spirit of study and a 
suggestion in the strict sense of the word. Comity enjoins a 
certain respect for differences in traditions and differences in 
historical evolution.
<P>
<B>(1915 ) </B>
<P>
	This having been said, I will note that some of the suggestions 
made by the Senate seem to be valuable and the product of 
reflection. Time always improves examination of a measure. I 
believe on these points the House is in a mood to respond 
positively.
<P>
	The issue of the electoral quotient, the amount of permissible 
variation from constituency to constituency, was much 
discussed in the master committee of the House, the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs which is really a de 
facto Constitution committee of the House. It was much 
discussed. On both sides there was considerable examination of 
the issue of whether the maximum permissible variation should 
be 15 or 25 per cent and with the Senate's suggestion the 15 per 
cent.
<P>
	I have no particular quarrel. I gather the feeling of the House 
is very much positive in relation to this point. Similarly with the 
suggestion in appointing members of the electoral commissions 
that the members to be appointed or persons to be considered 
should be residents of the province concerned, that seems to be 
matter of ordinary common sense.
<P>
	I see opposite an hon. member who made thoughtful 
contributions to the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs. I suspect this is something we simply 
overlooked, and it is good to be reminded of it. It makes sense. It 
would not make sense to do it the other way.
<P>
	Our suggestions in changing the procedure used over so many 
years were directed toward taking the current development in 
constitutional thinking, which is increasingly to 
constitutionalize large discretionary offices that exercise 
constitutional powers in a discretionary way, and to subject the 
incumbents of the office to some degree of prior scrutiny by 
Parliament of their qualifications. In an ideal sense this might 
mean that all executive council appointments would be subject 
to some sort of parliamentary examination.
<P>
	It is not the function of the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs to make a constitutional revolution all across 
the board. It does not have that mandate. Nevertheless we will 
notice a change here from a system where the appointment of the 
commissioners was solely at the discretion of the Speaker of the 
day and not subject to review.
<P>
	There were attempts to establish a gloss on this practice made 
by a distinguished speaker, Madam Sauvé, to consult informally 
with people outside. In the early eighties the electoral commis-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14263"> 14263 </A></B>
<P>
sions that were formed by Madam Speaker were done after 
informal and private consultation with outside people. I believe 
she consulted a current member of the Senate, Senator 
Beaudoin, who was then a very distinguished constitutional 
authority.
<P>
	What we have here is a proposal to further constitutionalize 
the process by establishing a duty of consultation with the House 
of Parliament. It is obviously not the same as submitting to 
Parliament the approval or ratification of that decision, but it 
opens up the process and it takes us a considerable way along in 
constitutional evolution. One of the good things in this 
committee was the general enthusiasm with which this change 
was recognized by the members of the committee. In responding 
to the Senate's suggestion again, I see no particular problems 
with it if they understand they are operating in the spirit of our 
original intention.
<P>
	I have more difficulties when we arrive at the more 
substantive side of the Senate's suggestions. One problem is 
increasingly directed to what was one of the key thrusts of the 
recommendations of the procedure and House affairs 
committee. The problem essentially in this area is that the 
system of electoral boundaries, which purported to be private 
and non-political, was inevitably subject to political pressures 
which, because they were never out in the open, were not subject 
to public scrutiny and review.
<P>
<B>(1920 ) </B>
<P>
	An ideal system of constitutionalizing electoral boundaries 
commissions would recognize that it goes to constituent power, 
which is prior to constitutional power and the ultimate source of 
state authority. That is something, I think ideally, on which we 
would have a set of very clear, concrete principles to be applied 
by commissioners so that their discretion would not be, as was 
once said of Lord Eldon when he was Lord High Chancellor, as 
long as the chancellor's foot.
<P>
	Outside people could refer to clear constitutional principles in 
deciding whether the commissioners' discretion was exercised 
rationally or was exercised merely arbitrarily and capriciously 
and of course subject to review by the courts. The biggest gap in 
the Canadian electoral system is that there is no developed 
system of court jurisprudence.
<P>
	If we examine the evolution, the democratization of electoral 
law in the United States is essentially because they have clear 
constitutional principles set out in the constitutional charter and 
a perfected system of court challenge by test cases financed by 
competing interest groups and clear court rulings. This 
constitutionalization through clear enunciation of constitutional 
principles and judicial review was borrowed by the German 
constitutional system, the contemporary system, from the 
United States. It goes even more along that road than the United 
States does.
<P>
	We have lagged behind in many respects perhaps because of 
the timidity-self-restraint might be the kinder word-of the 
Supreme Court and the absence of a disposition on the part of 
persons affected and even political parties to approach the court 
where boundaries are obviously gerrymandered or established 
arbitrarily and capriciously without proper regard to local 
conditions.
<P>
	It can however be changed. The feeling of the committee was 
very clear that the criteria for establishment of electoral 
boundaries should be set out in the legislation, and that they 
should be criteria to which what was done by the boundaries 
commissions in the future would be referable and would 
obviously be subject to scrutiny by citizens, political parties and 
others affected, but subject to review by an ultimate authority. 
This is why we approached the statement of principles.
<P>
	Coming back to what the Senate has done, I have some 
reservations in its striking out the provision intended to 
safeguard against unnecessary revision. I also have some 
difficulty with its touching the issue of community of interest. I 
felt that within the committee ourselves we did not go quite far 
enough in defining the criteria, but at least we made a beginning.
<P>
	One thing we tried to establish was the respect for continuity, 
which is one of our constitutional values. Members of 
Parliament build up a special relationship with their 
constituencies. There is a relationship of trust which subsists 
during the mandate of the member. It should not idly be 
changed. Unless there is a pressing consideration of sociology, 
economics or something else set out in the criteria, there should 
be a presumption of continuity. One does not indulge in changes 
across the board just for the sake of making a professorial 
exercise.
<P>
	In looking at the last electoral boundaries commission-and 
in an earlier pre-parliamentary capacity I served as an electoral 
boundary commissioner-Madam Sauvé as Speaker approached 
me and said that she wanted to depoliticize the process. She was 
looking for people a bit outside the political arenas for that. One 
of the principles we very clearly recognized was the principle of 
continuity, the relationship between members and their 
constituents. If we change a boundary dramatically halfway 
through a term, what is the relationship of trust between 
members and their existing constituents from whom the member 
will be separated by the next boundary change? Obviously one 
does one's best but it is not good for the relationship of trust 
which one tries to build up through the municipal, provincial 
and federal levels of government.
<P>
<B>(1925) </B>
<P>
	We stressed, however, in community of interest that it should 
be established in an evolutionary pattern. Constitutions are not 
static instruments, laws are not and obviously society is not. It is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14264"> 14264 </A></B>
<P>
a principle of the common law and I think of our constitutional 
jurisprudence that laws should evolve as society evolves.
<P>
	One regret I had in looking at the work of the latest electoral 
boundaries commissions, the series of 11 reports that we had, 
was that in a certain sense in the philosophy, because everybody 
has a philosophy, we discovered that there had been no contact 
by the electoral boundaries commission the last time with the 
federal electoral commissioner who has a great deal of 
experience. There was no mutual contact between them so there 
were wide variations in approaches.
<P>
	We discovered that essentially some of the commissions were 
looking back to the future. The unique feature of Canadian 
society today, which some have railed against, some have 
viewed with despair and others have viewed with joy as an 
opportunity for the future, is the fact that we have become a 
community of communities. It is interesting certainly in large 
cities that all the constituencies are plural in the sense of 
representing many communities. It is something in some sense 
that has been achieved accidentally over the years but is 
consolidated.
<P>
	One of my deep regrets in looking at the latest exercise is that 
there is an attempt to turn the clock backward, seemingly, to 
create uni-communities, uni-ethnic constituencies. This is a 
false approach to building a Canadian society. It runs against all 
the trends. This is why in spelling out the criteria we have tried 
to stress two things: first, continuity unless there is a clear 
reason for doing differently and, second, a balance of 
characteristics, a balance of features in which sociology, 
geography and commonalty of ties all operate together.
<P>
	We must never forget the prime lesson of Canadian society 
which will be the hallmark of our society as we enter the 21st 
century. There is unity in the diversity because of the necessity 
of co-operation and co-existence between the different 
communities.
<P>
	My suggestion to the Senate, and I do so in the full spirit of 
respect for a co-ordinate institution, is that it should hew more 
closely to the position adopted by the House. In our committee 
we gave hours of work, hours of give and take, in discussion of 
the particular clause and it should not be changed lightly. I 
would suggest that the excision of our principle of continuity is 
a step backward, particularly where continuity now by the happy 
accidents of the evolution of our society adequately reflects the 
diversity and in a sense the unity through diversity of our 
society.
<P>
	I am optimistic about the venture in the constitutionalism of 
electoral laws. So far in society we have left the political parties 
untouched. It is my view that constitutionally the political 
parties as organs of our constitutional system are subject to the 
same principles of constitutional review as the main 
governmental institutions.
<P>
	I would view it as a healthy situation if issues of the internal 
processes of parties where they operate in such a way as to 
negate the principles of representation are subject to court 
challenges and court review as they are in Germany, France and 
in all the countries that have borrowed from American 
constitutionalism. We would not have the great 
constitutionalism of the United States without it. In some senses 
principles we have established only in terms of consideration of 
electoral boundaries carry over to the political parties as prime 
instruments of our constitutional system.
<P>
<B>(1930 ) </B>
<P>
	One thanks the Senate for the thoughtful suggestions among 
which we can very easily accept the reduction of electoral 
quotas from 25 to 15. &quot;Thank you again for the suggestion of 
residency. Please, in a spirit of comity, take another look at what 
we have done with the substantive provisions. We would respect 
your accommodation to our suggestions here.''
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to say that I welcome the opportunity to speak on this 
whole matter of electoral boundaries, in particular Bill C-69 
and the amendments before us this evening.
<P>
	It seems we have been dealing with this issue ever since I got 
to this House, and in fact I guess that is the case. Bill C-18, the 
Liberal government's attempt to disband the Electoral 
Boundaries Commission, was one of the first bills brought 
forward. In fact the first time I saw closure used in this House as 
a new member was on that very bill. This evening we see closure 
being used again to limit debate on Bill C-69.
<P>
	The member for Vancouver Quadra talked about the changes 
that were made at the Senate and the reason we are back here this 
evening to debate those. Many of those amendments were ours. 
The quotient that he talked about from plus or minus 25 to 15 I 
think was a good one, but I think the thing that marks the whole 
business of Bill C-69 and the electoral boundaries is the 
mismanagement of this whole issue. We have been working on 
this for a year and a half, and in fact it may now revert back to the 
old boundaries commission if it does not get through this week. 
That shows how badly mismanaged this whole issue has been. I 
think it has been a tremendous waste of time in this House.
<P>
	This is the government that was going to do things differently. 
We have closure on Bill C-69 tonight so that we have to vote at 
eleven o'clock. We had closure on Bill C-41 just this week on 
the hate crimes bill. We have had closure being used or time 
allocation on Bill C-68, gun control, and again on Bill C-85, the 
MP pension plan. What is this all about? I know members want 
to get back to their ridings, but it seems to me that this is not a 
very reasonable approach to limit debate in this very important 
Chamber.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14265"> 14265 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-69, should it receive royal assent by the end of this 
week, will make some adjustments to the Electoral Boundaries 
Adjustment Act, which was first enacted in 1964. As far as I am 
concerned, this bill should not be passed. The changes being 
proposed are not substantial enough to warrant the interruption 
of a perfectly good process.
<P>
	The process that was in place before was fine. It is a process 
that was almost complete in any case. In fact the Canadian 
taxpayers had already spent around $6 million on a process of 
redrawing our electoral boundaries before the Liberal 
government decided to change this through Bill C-18 and now 
Bill C-69. In fact hearings were held in a lot of ridings in 
Canada.
<P>
	If this bill is not passed, we may go back to the original 
boundaries commission and pick that whole process up. People 
who have been waiting to make their case patiently are waiting 
to see what this new boundaries commission is going to be. It 
has been a year and a half, and I think time is of the essence 
because we may be only two years away from the next election.
<P>
	What is the process that was interrupted a year and a half ago? 
It is a process that occurs every ten years or after each census. 
But last year there was considerable concern by the new Liberal 
MPs from Ontario that changes to their riding boundaries would 
hurt their re-election chances. This was the party that was going 
to be different. The member before me talked about what used to 
happen in the old days with gerrymandering. This smacks of the 
same type of thing.
<P>
	If this government is unhappy with the results of the 
boundaries commission when they were allowed to complete 
their work, it should bring forward some substantive changes. In 
fact it has not done that. By substantive change I mean true 
representation by population in this House of Commons and true 
representation by region in the Senate.
<P>
<B>(1935 ) </B>
<P>
	My riding of Peace River has been in place since 1925. It has a 
population of almost 107,000 people. Of the 13 large ridings in 
Canada, mostly northern ridings, that have areas of over 
100,000 square kilometres, the Peace River riding rates up there 
at about ninth.
<P>
	What do we have in this country? Do we have representation 
by population? We are not even close. The quotient the hon. 
member before me talked about is going to bring it closer, and it 
certainly needs to be. We have some constituencies that have 
populations as low as just over 30,000 people. We have others in 
downtown Toronto that are in the 230,000 range. This is too big 
of a spread. I believe we need some substantive changes, not 
tinkering in this House.
<P>
	In our minority report to the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Suspension Act we called for changes that would 
make sense in this House of Commons. The key change is that 
we would like to see the number of seats reduced. Our proposal 
would create a House with 265  seats based on the 1991 census. 
This would be a decrease from the 301 that will come into effect 
under the current formula.
<P>
	One thing we have heard a fair amount of in the last couple of 
years is that we are a country that is overgoverned. If we look at 
the United States, which has a bigger population by far, they 
have far fewer elected members. I believe we can never get to 
the situation they have unless we make substantive changes, but 
we can start the process in gear. The decrease would be spread 
among the eight provinces and would maintain representation 
by population as it is at present but with a fairer share for both 
Ontario and British Columbia.
<P>
	If this government would only care to listen to what the people 
want, it would hear that Canadians want less government and 
fewer politicians. Look at what happened just recently in the 
Ontario election. Mike Harris promised that he would reduce the 
number of seats in the Ontario legislature by 25 per cent. It was 
one of the contributing factors to his election, I would think. 
And of course he won against considerable odds.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Against the Liberals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> It was very interesting that we had a lot of 
Liberal members in this House talking about the Ontario 
election about a month ago, but they got fewer and fewer as the 
weeks passed and it was obvious that the Conservatives were 
going to win in Ontario.
<P>
	Of course, to Mike Harris's credit, he did borrow some of our 
ideas and policies. We applaud him for that.
<P>
	Another Reform policy in this area is that government should 
give careful consideration to filling vacancies as they occur in 
the Senate with province-wide elections. These elections should 
be conducted in the same manner as the one in which the late 
Senator Stan Waters was elected, thereby having some popular 
support in the province. In Quebec, where the senators actually 
represent defined constituencies, the election would only have 
to take place in that constituency.
<P>
	The official Liberal position is that they support an elected 
Senate. In our caucus we go even further. We believe in what we 
call a triple-E Senate, one that is equal, effective, and elected. A 
Senate where there is true representation by region would 
provide the people of the less populous provinces with an 
effective voice in the second chamber of Canada's Parliament. A 
triple-E Senate would give an equal voice to the smaller, less 
populous provinces and give them the clout in Parliament they 
have sought for so long.
<P>
	It is not as if Canada would be breaking any new ground here. 
Other countries have two democratically elected chambers: the 
United States, Germany, and Australia. I realize that creating 
the kind of Senate of which I speak would require constitutional 
reform, but in the interim this government could hold senatorial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14266"> 14266 </A></B>
<P>
elections in the same way it did when it appointed Stan Waters as 
a result of that election.
<P>
	To date, the Prime Minister has ignored his own official 
Liberal policy and has chosen to fill Senate vacancies with the 
usual assortment of party hacks and cronies. This is in direct 
conflict with the stated Liberal policy.
<P>
	Since Bill C-69 does not bring about substantial change to the 
redrawing of the boundaries and to the whole democratic 
process of true representation, I say let us revert back to the old 
process. Why would I say that? It is because we have already 
spent $6 million on that process. Hearings have been held in a lot 
of those ridings. They understood what was going to happen in 
terms of what their new boundaries would be. It was well along 
before it was interrupted a year and a half ago.
<P>
<B>(1940) </B>
<P>
	I say let us change the whole kit and caboodle. Let us bring in 
true representation by population and bring in true 
representation by region or else leave the process alone and 
revert to what it was before. We had quite a good process in 
place, one that recognized that there are people who move in the 
country from time to time, one that recognized growth in regions 
and therefore recognized that the boundaries have to be redrawn 
from time to time. That process is one we should revert to. The 
Senate recognized it, with some minor changes. I believe we 
would be wise to drop Bill C-69 and the mismanagement that 
has followed it and revert to a process that has worked well for 
us in the past.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, throughout Canada's history the issue of 
electoral boundary redistribution has been contentious. The 
hostility is derived from the very premise that those who have 
power are never willing to relinquish their hold on it.
<P>
	I want to make it clear from the outset that I am opposed to 
Bill C-69, as it will attempt to fix a process that is not really 
broken. The government wants to scrap an electoral boundaries 
commission that has cost Canadians nearly $5 million and redo 
that process at a cost of another $5 million to $6 million. My 
question to the other side of the House is what happened to fiscal 
responsibility?
<P>
	I could see the need for Bill C-69 if the original report had in 
some way been tainted by any type of political influence-in 
other words, if there had been gerrymandering or if there had 
been a large outcry from Canadians regarding the current 
redistribution process. Neither of those events has occurred.
<P>
	I think the idea of politicians redrawing their own boundaries 
lies at the very core of a serious problem in Canada. The 
problem is a lack of trust by the public regarding politicians. It is 
evident therefore that this government does not see that 
Canadians are unhappy with the entire process in which 
politicians have been conducting their business.
<P>
	Canadians want change. They want a new style of openness. 
They want a new style of fairness. This type of legislation can 
only be viewed as regressive. Even though the House was given 
the absolute right to redraw the electoral boundaries at 
Confederation, because of the contentious nature of electoral 
redistribution Parliament agreed to share the responsibility of 
redistribution with electoral boundaries commissions.
<P>
	Since the creation of the electoral boundaries commissions in 
1964, public perception that there is not a considerable amount 
of political interference in the readjustment process has 
diminished. The political interference that took place before the 
creation of the electoral boundaries commissions was seen as an 
attempt to ensure as far as possible that the members of the 
governing party were re-elected. That is absolutely wrong.
<P>
	I hope this government is not travelling down the same path of 
earlier governments, where gerrymandering and the abuse of 
power were seen as commonplace. It is important to note that 
since 1964, while many politicians have been unhappy with the 
outcome of redistribution, there has rarely been a complaint of 
political interference. This is a direct result of one mitigating 
factor. These commissions are non-partisan. The commissions 
look primarily at the number of people in the province, not 
political partisanship. They do not consider how the changes 
will affect one party over another.
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	The largest criticism of the commissions is they do not 
consider enough non-political information. Many times they 
overlook common community interests or community 
identities. It is important to ensure redistributed boundaries 
correspond as closely as possible to the national quotient while 
also taking into account community interests and the historical 
patterns of an electoral district.
<P>
	These factors will enable the commissions to properly 
manage the geographic sizes of districts with sparsely populated 
areas. The commissions are allowed to deviate from the 
provincial average by plus or minus 25 per cent, as the bill was 
written.
<P>
	This allows them to accommodate for human and geographic 
factors. Another issue that causes me a great deal of concern and 
which was not addressed by Bill C-69 is that because of a 1985 
constitutional amendment no province can have fewer seats than 
the 1985 level of representation regardless of the population of 
that province.
<P>
	The exception is P.E.I. which can have no fewer MPs than 
Senators, not something we disagree with. We therefore have 
done away with the premise of absolute representation by 
population. It is clear that within the concept of representation 
by population emerges the concept of equality of vote. Any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14267"> 14267 </A></B>
<P>
notion of equality which rep by population may permit is 
countered by the fact the current and historical development of 
representation  in Canada has only partially been based on the 
notion of this concept.
<P>
	Since Confederation Canada has developed a system with 
respect to electoral representation whereby a heavily populated 
province retains its majority of seats within the House of 
Commons while the less populated provinces receive an 
adequate number of seats to ensure appropriate representation.
<P>
	By no means does the federal government reflect the notion of 
true representation of population in its purest form. Rep by pop 
has been altered in order to guarantee a minimum number of 
seats within the House to the less populated provinces so they do 
not become under represented if their population base 
decreases.
<P>
	Thus while the principle of representation by population may 
be said to lie at the heart of the electoral apportionment, it has 
from the beginning been altered by other factors. Due to 
Canada's vast geographic size and regional differences a 
modified version of representation by population has emerged.
<P>
	It is therefore determined the equality of votes guaranteed by 
Canadians is one of relative equality and not absolute equality. 
Therefore we do not have equality of voting power but rather 
relative equality of voting perception.
<P>
	Canada has many regions and there probably are as many 
definitions of regionalism as there are people defining it. 
Regionalism is not some sort of disease to be stamped out. 
Rather it is a healthy manifestation, lacking at present a healthy 
constitutional outlet. The only true significant political failure 
of the Canadian experience is its chronic inability to solve those 
regional tensions.
<P>
	The Senate was established to protect the interests of the 
regions and the provinces, yet for too long western Canada has 
felt its interests have not been adequately represented in this 
federal Parliament. The Canadian Senate lacks legitimacy in the 
eyes of many Canadians because it is an appointed body which 
runs counter to the fundamental Canadian belief that democratic 
governments should be conducted by an elected rather than an 
appointed body.
<P>
<B>(1950 ) </B>
<P>
	What Canadians need and what Canadians in more and more 
numbers want is an effective, elected and equal Senate. A 
reformed Senate will not just benefit one province or one region, 
it will help build a better and stronger Canada.
<P>
	We should have an elected Parliament based solely on 
representation by population with a constant number of 
members. This concept will work only if we have an elected 
Senate in which all of the regions of Canada have an equal 
number of senators; this would ensure that Parliament reflects a 
notion of one person, one vote and would allow the Senate to 
recognize the regional interests of our nation.
<P>
	Moving on to the specific recommendations from the Senate 
on Bill C-69, I state for the record we support some of its 
amendments. Amendment Nos. 1 and 6(a) will reduce the 
allowable size of deviation from the provincial average to 15 per 
cent from the current 25 per cent.
<P>
	This should help to equalize some of the concerns I have 
raised regarding the inequities of representation by population. 
This will ensure the ratio between rural and urban dwellers in 
that it will become smaller. It also allows for deviations of the 
plus or minus 15 per cent in special circumstances, which is 
totally acceptable to the Reform Party and is a point we as a 
party have argued for throughout every stage of this debate.
<P>
	Amendment No. 4(a) is for the most part a technical 
amendment which simply states the two non-judicial 
commission members reside in the province for which the 
commission is established. The merits of this amendment speak 
clearly for themselves. However, for those for whom it does not, 
let me put it this way. Who better to understand the needs and 
requirements of a particular province than someone from that 
province?
<P>
	Amendment No. 6(b)(i) eliminates the provision that a 
commission will only recommend changing to existing electoral 
district boundaries where the factors are set out and are to be 
significant enough to warrant such a recommendation.
<P>
	Again it is important that an independent body able to make 
recommendations which could have boundary deviations which 
may be necessary is also free from the notion of perception of 
political interference. We must always remember it is simply 
not enough to be free from gerrymandering; it must be perceived 
to be free form gerrymandering.
<P>
	I wish to make it clear that even with the three Senate 
amendments with which we agree the bill does not improve on 
the present process to warrant discarding the redistribution that 
is almost complete.
<P>
	Bill C-69 failed to address the size of the House by capping or 
limiting the number of members of Parliament in the future. It 
plans to increase number of members of the House from 295 to 
301. My constituents in Edmonton-Strathcona do not want 
more politicians; they want less government.
<P>
	Bill C-69 will ultimately cost the Canadians $5 million to $6 
million, as was already mentioned, to redo the distribution 
process. For these reasons I am against Bill C-69 in principle.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to take the floor once again regarding Bill 
C-69, this time at the consideration stage of Senate amendments 
and the amendment proposed by the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
	The two speakers who preceded me, the hon. members for 
Peace River and for Edmonton-Strathcona, spoke for several 
minutes about their desire for an elected Senate, a triple-E 
Senate, an efficient Senate, to use the words they used. In theory, 
it could appear interesting to elect members to the other place on 
a regional basis. Just imagine. I am merely asking a hypothetical 
question because this is not at all what I want.
<P>
	They would like to create a parliamentary Senate with 24 
members from the Maritimes, which is what we have now, 24 
from Quebec, 24 from Ontario, 24 from western Canada, 2 from 
the territories and the 6 senators from Newfoundland in 
accordance with the Newfoundland Act of 1949, for a total of 
104, but they would like to have them elected. That could create 
a balance of sorts. It is plain to see now that the Senate has 
completely strayed from its original mandate which was to 
protect the regions.
<P>
	It is a House which speaks for itself and which, in the final 
analysis, has no other voice than the one that it gives itself. 
Except that the amendment proposed by the Reform Party will 
probably have its day when the time comes to reorganize 
Canada's political institutions, which will probably be in a few 
months. In the meantime, we have other decisions to make and 
we have work to do regarding the new partnership between 
Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	This having been said, the Bloc Quebecois opposes Bill C-69 
at third reading for a very simple reason. Although we 
recognized that Bill C-69 was a significant improvement over 
the current law, we had no other option but to oppose Bill C-69 
when this House refused to approve the motion in amendment 
that I tabled in this House at the report stage, which aimed to 
secure minimum representation for Quebec. This minimum 
representation would have been set at 25 per cent, in other 
words, would have guaranteed Quebec 25 per cent of all seats 
under the constitution.
<P>
	I note with sadness that, apart from the Bloc Quebecois 
members, the only other members who supported this 
amendment at the report stage were the hon. member for Beauce 
and the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway. This tells all 
about how isolated the Bloc, an hon. member from British 
Columbia and the independent member for Beauce were in their 
move to support this amendment.
<P>
	It tells of just how isolated Quebec is and it tells the story of 
just how things evolved until we arrived at this state of affairs. 
While at the beginning of the federation we thought that we had 
made a nation to nation pact and,  overall, equality for 
anglophones and francophones, 128 years later, we find 
ourselves in a situation where we are even denied a minimum of 
25 per cent. We find ourselves in a situation where Reform 
members expound their theory in the House that Quebec is only 
one province among ten and not a founding people. Canada has 
reached the multicultural and multiethnic stage; it is no longer at 
the biethnic and bicultural stage, as Quebec has always seen 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(2000) </B>
<P>
	There are two opposing visions. I think it is useless to prolong 
these arguments about ideas, terminology and behaviour. This 
fall in Quebec, we will have to make up our minds about what we 
want. Do we want to be a people, a nation like other nations? Or 
do we want to be a province like the other provinces? That is the 
question we will have to answer this fall.
<P>
	Later, together with our friends in English Canada, liberated 
from the political structures that are strangling us today, once 
we stop feeling like a minority group in a country where every 
day we become more conscious of the fact, then we will be able 
to create economic and political instruments that are far more 
effective than what we know today, which makes this debate so 
pointless.
<P>
	I will not review everything that has been done since Bill 
C-18 was passed last year in this House.
<P>
	A few moments ago, I referred to the fact that Quebec failed to 
obtain guarantees for 25 per cent of the seats, which was a 
minimum if we were to support Bill C-69. That being said, our 
support for Bill C-69 is not a foregone conclusion.
<P>
	We have reached a theoretical stage in this debate. Tomorrow 
we will know whether the Senate will be able to garner the 
requisite unanimous consent to receive the bill from the House 
as amended and possibly proceed with third reading.
<P>
	If the bill is not passed by the Senate by midnight tomorrow 
and has not received royal assent, the current legislation will 
prevail. After this evening's vote, we will look forward to what 
happens tomorrow in the Senate. Will there be unanimous 
consent to proceed or not? We have no control over the process.
<P>
	I must say the government did a very poor job of scheduling 
this particular bill. Perhaps it did not expect such a strong 
reaction from the Senate. That may be, but I think that as soon as 
the bill was amended in the Senate, if the government had said 
no and stuck to its guns instead of caving in after the first 
negative vote in the Senate on this bill, the whole thing would 
have been settled long ago.
<P>
	The Senate is starting to make a habit of this procedure, as we 
saw subsequently. It delayed Pearson, it delayed Bill C-68 to 
create committees and so forth. However, those who were 
responsible for these tactics were probably hesitant to use them, 
and when they did  they were rather clumsy about it, so that in 
the end, the government no longer controls the agenda. We are at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14269"> 14269 </A></B>
<P>
the mercy of a single person who could defeat this bill, as 
happened in the case of Meech Lake.
<P>
	However, this legislation would improve certain aspects of 
determining electoral boundaries. You may recall that if C-69 
comes into force, the commissioners will have to hear 
submissions before starting on their work. This would give them 
some idea of the situation they would have to deal with.
<P>
	The commissioners would produce three maps instead of just 
one, which is an improvement, as I have always said. I worked 
on the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs on 
this bill until quite recently. Basically, I agreed with all the 
amendments except that when we were denied a guarantee of 25 
per cent of the seats for Quebec, it was obvious we could no 
longer support the bill.
<P>
	As for the technical improvements, there were quite a few. I 
see that the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, 
who also worked on this legislation, agrees with me in that 
respect.
<P>
	The fact that Bill C-69 obliges the commissions to consider 
community of interest is certainly an improvement. Providing 
for a readjustment every five years instead of every ten was 
another improvement, because this prevents excessive 
distortion due to the population shifts that occur in Canada.
<P>
<B>(2005) </B>
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. member for Terrebonne, was speaking 
earlier about the situation that is peculiar to the area he 
represents, where population growth is quite incredible. 
Adjustments every five years would mean avoiding redoing the 
electoral maps that upset everybody, every ten years.
<P>
	Bill C-69, the result of a compromise, maintained the 
principle of the 25 per cent variation in the electoral quota. That 
is, if the number of voters in a riding was set at 100,000, the 
riding could have either 75,000 or 125,000 voters. The 
compromise in Bill C-69 lay in the fact that a riding could no 
longer have over 125 per cent, which is currently the case. One 
riding can have 200 per cent of the voters so that others may 
have 50 per cent fewer. In this regard, I think the bill is well 
balanced.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that we were denied the constitutional 
guarantee for Quebec of 25 per cent of the seats, my own 
proposal, the bare minimum, given that, in 1867, we had 65 of 
the 181 seats, that is, two thirds of the members of Parliament 
were from Quebec. Now, from 33 per cent, if the next election is 
held using the new electoral map, we will have 75 seats out of 
301. In other words, the fateful figure of 25 per cent will be 
wiped out. This is how the francophones and Acadians outside 
Quebec quietly became minorities. The same applies to the 
people of Quebec, who are quietly becoming a minority without 
a constitutional guarantee, either.
<P>
	We are not lucky like the province of Prince-Edward-Island 
to have a senatorial clause. We do not have the special protection 
enjoyed by the Northwest Territories and the Yukon, which is a 
constitutional guarantee of one seat, regardless of their 
population. We are not questioning this-it is a fine thing for 
them. I am not questioning Prince-Edward-Island's 
representation or the Northwest Territories' or the Yukon's 
representation, but why not give the same representation to 
Quebec?
<P>
	Two members voted with the Bloc. I remind my colleague for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell that they are the member for 
Beauce and the member for Burnaby-Kingsway. No other 
member considered it appropriate to support the proposal. Quite 
the opposite, they all rose to vote against it. Obviously this is 
their democratic right. I take the liberty, however, of drawing 
my own conclusions, and Quebec voters can do the same.
<P>
	Were there other good things? I will look in my notes, as it has 
been a while since I have had occasion to speak about this. The 
provisions in Bill C-69 struck a certain balance that made it 
possible to function. We started over with new commissions and 
new commissioners appointed by the Speaker of the House and 
the provincial chief justices, and the Speaker's decisions could 
be reviewed at the request of a minimum number of members in 
this House.
<P>
	Thus, members were involved more at the stage of appointing 
the commissioners than at the stage of reviewing the map. It is 
not work suited to MPs, who too often think that the riding 
belongs to them and who always want to hang on to the same 
boundaries so as not to lose a particular parish, because in the 
world of politics, of course, friendships are formed, as are some 
rather artificial boundaries, that become almost as important as 
the borders between countries.
<P>
	We are probably left with two scenarios: either Bill C-69 does 
not receive Royal Assent tomorrow evening and we start all over 
again, or Bill C-69 is not passed tomorrow evening and we are 
left with the existing act. In either case, we will have a problem 
because we still do not have the 25 per cent for Quebec. Nobody 
is going to give it to us and that is that.
<P>
	If the existing act is suspended until midnight tomorrow by 
Bill C-18, we will have the bizarre and unfortunate situation 
where commissions that have been suspended or that knew that 
they were going to be suspended, have nonetheless continued to 
do their work for quite some time.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14270"> 14270 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2010) </B>
<P>
	And constituents, believing in good faith that the bill 
presented in the House would pass, did not come before those 
commissions which were obviously going to be disbanded. 
However, through the Senate amendments, they were only 
suspended, and they will be revived tomorrow night. They often 
held their hearings before empty rooms.
<P>
	If those commissions, created under the old act passed by the 
previous government in another Parliament, are to be revived 
tomorrow night, they should at the very least hold new hearings 
to allow people to express their opinions on the electoral 
boundaries that have already been proposed. We should make no 
mistake about it, there are some members, particularly Liberal 
members, who think that if Bill C-69 does not pass, we go back 
to the 1993 electoral map.
<P>
	On the contrary, I want to tell the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell that this is not the case, he will 
not get back his 1993 riding. We have to tell him that it will be 
his riding as reviewed by the commission for Ontario. He does 
not seem to understand it; I would like him to explain to all his 
colleagues we can see here tonight that if Bill C-69 does not 
pass, we do not go back to the status quo, but to the electoral 
districts as they were established before Bill C-18 was passed.
<P>
	In fact, if those commissions are revived tomorrow night, 
they will resume their hearings to hear constituents across the 
country.
<P>
	Still, everything was not bad with the old act, particularly 
with regard to the definition of special considerations allowing 
the creation of electoral districts departing from the electoral 
quota by more than 25 per cent. Right now, under Bill C-69, a 
commission can deviate by more than 25 per cent below the 
provincial quota, and always below-it cannot be 150 per cent 
or even 126 per cent of the quota, but it could be 74, 65 or 50 per 
cent-only in very exceptional cases like those isolated and very 
hard to reach areas.
<P>
	This is what Bill C-69 provides, but the former act was much 
more flexible. Let me read it. The act as it stands now, if Bill 
C-69 is not in force, says that a commission can deviate from the 
provincial quotient by more than 25 per cent more or 25 per cent 
less. Thus, it can go as high as 150 or 175 percent and as low as 
40 per cent ``in any case where any special community or 
diversity of interests of the inhabitants of various regions of the 
province appear to the commission to render such a departure 
necessary or desirable.''
<P>
	Those guidelines are much more flexible than Bill C-69 
where remote areas are concerned. The act we have now is more 
flexible. It is by no means certain, but it is likely that ridings in 
areas like the Lower St. Lawrence, the Gaspé peninsula and 
Lac-Saint-Jean would remain practically unchanged. With Bill 
C-69, there is a real danger because the commissions cannot go 
beyond 125  per cent and create a reservoir of voters to 
compensate for another area.
<P>
	The same holds true for Northern Ontario, where Bill C-69 
will spell problems. I think that a certain balance was achieved 
with C-69, but that it is far from perfect.
<P>
	As to the motion moved by the government House leader 
concerning Senate amendments, I am tempted to say that they 
are good amendments to a flawed bill.
<P>
	Since it is a flawed bill, I will vote against the amendments 
later tonight, and I hope our colleagues in the other place will be 
guided by the Providence when they make their decision 
tomorrow on whether Bill C-69 will receive royal assent or the 
former commissions will be revived.
<P>
<B>(2015) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
debate has been going on for quite a while. I remember it as one 
of the first debates in the House. It was ferocious and motives 
were attributed to the government that were not true, but what 
else is new.
<P>
	I recall vividly the first debate we entered into when we said 
we wanted to update the electoral boundaries bill to better 
reflect the communities of interest and also make some other 
adjustments. I recall so well the member for Beaver River 
commenting on the fact that what we were doing was 
gerrymandering, trying to fix boundaries and trying to assure 
our political futures.
<P>
	Today I listened to one of my colleagues from Peace River 
who was still using some of the same arguments. I thought it 
would be useful to recount what happened in my community and 
how the community came together. Instead of being divided by 
various political alliances, the community put aside its various 
partisan political representations and learned to cross political 
boundaries to support the interests of the community of the 
regional municipality of Waterloo, of which my riding is one 
member. There are three ridings contained in that region: 
Waterloo, the Kitchener riding and the Cambridge riding.
<P>
	I recall when the commission came out with its proposal on 
how it was going to divide up the regional municipality of 
Waterloo. The consensus across the region was that the proposal 
was not acceptable. It did not make any sense and that the 
community, on which it would impact, had no representation. 
Their wishes were ignored.
<P>
	I underline that because it is important, particularly for our 
colleagues in the Reform Party to understand this. What I as a 
member and my colleagues from Kitchener and Cambridge were 
reacting to was to the presentations made to members of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14271"> 14271 </A></B>
<P>
Parliament by members of the community. Let us say that we 
were representing the wishes of our constituents.
<P>
	As I mentioned before, we are contained within the regional 
municipality of Waterloo. It has three cities, Waterloo, 
Kitchener and Cambridge. It also has four townships, North 
Dumfries, Wolwich, Wilmont and Wellesley. We have seven 
local municipal councils. Then we have the regional 
municipality of Waterloo council.
<P>
	If you looked at the partisan politics of these various councils, 
we had Liberals, many Conservatives, some New Democrats 
and even some Reformers. In the case of the riding of Waterloo, 
which contains the township of Wolwich to the north, the city of 
Waterloo and part of the city of Kitchener, I used to sit on the 
Waterloo city council. When I was elected to come to the House 
of Commons by the electors of the riding, the person who filled 
my position on the council was a gentleman by the name of Mike 
Connolly who was a candidate for the Reform Party in the 1993 
elections.
<P>
	When the Waterloo city council first heard about the proposal 
that was put forward, it was Mr. Connolly, the former candidate 
for the Reform Party, who moved the motion at the council that 
the boundaries commission proposal was not acceptable. Is that 
not rather interesting? You would think that the sincerity of 
partisan politics would go from the grassroots up to this place 
but it seems to remain at the grassroots. Mr. Connolly was quite 
active in making sure the resolution was passed on to the other 
six municipal councils as well as regional council.
<P>
<B>(2020) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Connolly, who was appointed to fill my position on city 
council, had the same kind of support for the government's 
infrastructure program. Reformers in the House could not find 
anything useful to say about what turned out to be a very 
successful program.
<P>
	Once the local councils talked about the issue they met with 
my colleague from Kitchener and myself regarding the 
boundaries. They were very concerned that the Waterloo region, 
which has evolved over a period in excess of 100 years, have its 
political integrity respected.
<P>
	We went to the boundaries hearing. I was there, along with my 
colleague from Kitchener and the mayor from Waterloo. 
Representatives from the regional municipality of Waterloo 
were there. We had representation from all the individual 
councils. It was a community of interest that crossed partisan 
political lines to push for something on behalf of the community 
that made political sense. When one talks about community of 
interest that is one of the things that I am very happy about in 
terms of my community, the Waterloo region.
<P>
	We were going to plead with boundaries commission to 
change its mind because it had already said what it was going to 
do. The response of the boundaries commission to our joint plea 
was that it made a few very minor adjustments. Its members 
could have told us they could have accommodated us within the 
perimeter of the boundaries that they set up or they could have 
accommodated us by drawing lines that made sense, some  of 
which would have coincided with the provincial boundaries but 
they did not do that.
<P>
	Once again I am very pleased with this bill. I am pleased with 
a number of aspects of it. One is that the commissioners in the 
future will listen to reports from communities before they make 
up their minds. They will canvass the whole province and then 
they will have an overall idea of what should take place. Before 
they can do that they are going to have to hold hearings.
<P>
	It is somewhat similar to what happens at the local council 
level when a developer proposes to zone a piece of property. We 
have in the province of Ontario and in other provinces a process 
under the planning act that is known as the informal public 
hearing where people in the community have an opportunity to 
have their say before the commission makes up its mind or ties 
itself down to some options.
<P>
	The reason that is important is I believe that a community like 
Waterloo region probably could have got the commission to 
consider much more seriously what my community asked of the 
boundaries commission. We are going to have minimal changes. 
We are going to try to minimize the changes to boundaries. Let 
me expand on that a bit. The boundaries commission took the 
city of Waterloo, with a population of about 84,000, which is 
well below the 100,000 or 105,000 people that are supposed to 
be in a riding, and dismembered that city. It took a big chunk of 
lakeshore on the north side of the city and then it drew an 
imaginary line to the east and really did a hatchet job on the 
municipality. The commission then took a big chunk out of 
Kitchener and added it to the new Waterloo riding. That did not 
make any sense.
<P>
<B>(2025) </B>
<P>
	The commission also did the same thing to the riding of 
Kitchener. It took away a big chunk of Kitchener and then it gave 
it a bigger chunk.
<P>
	It is important for the people in the communities of Waterloo, 
Kitchener and Cambridge to have boundaries where they can 
understand who their provincial representatives are and who 
their federal representatives are. As much as possible those 
boundaries should coincide. As well, we should have boundaries 
whose names reflect the geographic location of the riding. In the 
case of the Waterloo federal riding, the township of Woolwich is 
included as well as the northern part of Kitchener. By calling the 
riding Waterloo, that is hard for people to understand.
<P>
	One of the proposals put forward in the bill is that there should 
be a minimizing of the changes to the boundaries. The interests 
of the community should be the dominant factor. The 
commissions will listen to the input of the people living in the 
districts before its members make up their minds. The 
commissions will conduct informal public hearings where it 
will hear the constituents. I believe that the end product will be 
something with which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14272"> 14272 </A></B>
<P>
my community, both in the  Waterloo federal riding as well as in 
the regional municipality of Waterloo, will be a lot happier.
<P>
	Let me conclude by emphasizing that the partisan political 
parties in my community came together and in my riding, the 
city of Waterloo, the person who moved the motion expressing 
grave disagreement with the proposed boundaries was the 
candidate for the Reform Party in the last election campaign. He 
stood for what the community wanted. My position, the position 
of my colleague from Kitchener, as well as my colleague from 
Cambridge, come from trying to represent what is best for our 
community and what our community so articulately expressed 
to us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the hon. member for Waterloo for his 
remarks. I particularly enjoyed his comments about the former 
candidate for the Reform Party. It will be nice after the next 
election when we will get to enjoy reading his comments in 
Hansard. I am sure those comments will be far more to the point 
and much easier to digest.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to speak to this bill tonight. In a sense the bill 
encapsulates part of the problem with the democratic process, or 
the choosing in this case of electoral boundaries. It deals with 
the neutrality of that, the idea that we as politicians should not 
be messing around in choosing the riding boundaries. We should 
be leaving that to a neutral body which will ensure that fairness 
is the key word in all boundary decisions.
<P>
<B>(2030 ) </B>
<P>
	It also gives me an opportunity to talk about the whole 
legislative process by which we bring laws into being in the 
House. On a late night sitting like this, it gives me cause for a 
few moments to talk about the whole idea of debate, which again 
is part of that democratic process. The flaws that I see in the 
House and in this current parliamentary system.
<P>
	I am often asked after being here for a year and a half what I 
think of it now, if it is everything I thought it would be. Is it 
everything I thought it would be? Is it everything I thought it 
would be when I first got here? I have to say sadly with 
considerable disappointment that no, it is not. This evening I 
will give a 20-minute speech to a largely empty House. This is 
my second speech of the day. I gave another 20-minute speech 
on Bill C-86 earlier today. It was germane to my riding. It was 
about the dairy commission.
<P>
	A lot of work goes into the preparation of a speech. There is 
the research, the time my staff and I commit, my resources, the 
communication with my constituents and earlier today with my 
dairy farming constituency, and so on. There is all that effort to 
prepare a decent and hopefully cogent argument and then I 
deliver it into an empty House. There has to be something wrong 
when people back home are wondering what I think of it. I am 
pleased to be here. I am proud to represent them, but they should 
know that there is a systemic problem here.
<P>
	When I see debate after debate and speaker after speaker 
presenting arguments to themselves and not having someone to 
debate with, it is rather discouraging. The very process of debate 
presupposes that there is someone to debate with. We have to 
suppose that we are going to talk to someone and try to 
understand their point of view, debate them on the merits of that 
point and then listen to their points. It goes back and forth until 
we come to a resolution that maybe was wiser than either one of 
us started out with.
<P>
	Again, when I give another speech to a largely empty House, I 
wonder sometimes about the value of it. Is it just killing time or 
is it really debate where I hope to speak to someone's intellect 
and challenge them in some ways?
<P>
	Yesterday there was a vote on a private members' Bill C-295 
that I initiated. It was defeated. I was not upset about the defeat 
of the bill. What does annoy me is that early in the debate I had 
misplaced a word in the text of the peacekeeping bill I brought 
forward. I asked for and received unanimous consent of the 
House to change the word command to operational control.
<P>
	The word was changed and for the next three debates I 
listened to the prepared speeches from the other side. Members 
just went through their prepared speeches time and time again 
saying that the word command should be changed to operational 
control. It had been done at the outset but they did not listen. 
They are not not listening and they do not care to enter logical 
debate.
<P>
	Instead, the government wants to come in with a legislative 
agenda, crack the whip and tell people how to vote. The concern 
for actually coming to a consensus is somewhere down there. I 
referred to it earlier in my dairy speech as the spreadings of the 
honey wagon.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Some people might not know what a honey 
wagon is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> I will leave the honey wagon explanation to 
others.
<P>
	In his intervention the member for Waterloo was speaking 
about the need to represent the wishes of his constituents. I urge 
the member to go back and check his speech. He may want to 
check the blues to see if he can get that erased. Representing the 
wishes of a constituency. What does that mean to Liberals 
exactly? What is the purpose of representing their constituents?
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14273"> 14273 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2035 ) </B>
<P>
	If the Liberals were to represent their constituents but it was 
not the party line, I wonder what would happen. I am sure the 
Liberal Party would shrug it off. It would say that probably the 
member had a legitimate point of view having consulted with his 
constituents and wanting to legitimately represent their 
concerns even though they happen to be juxtaposed against the 
Liberal Party. That would be fine, would it not?
<P>
	We have seen in the last couple of weeks-and this comes 
down again to the democratic process-what would happen if 
Liberal members truly try to represent their constituents in the 
Liberal Party. First they would get the mild reaction, the tongue 
lashing. ``Mr. Member from wherever, if you do that again, if 
you happen to be so brazen as to actually represent the people 
who put you into power, we will make sure that you do not get a 
voice on committees''. That would be the first step: Why do we 
not just yank them from their role on committees? That is of 
course a small thing, but when they are trying to do their job I 
suppose those three or four Liberals would feel just a tad 
chastized. What would happen if this continued? If the members 
were so brazen as to vote a second time against the Liberal Party, 
what would happen?
<P>
	Suppose the member was a 30-year man having been on the 
job for 30 years, never voting against or bucking the party line 
but finally he did what he thought was the wishes of his 
constituents. Perhaps the member was a former cabinet minister 
who had bent the ear of several prime ministers. If he dared to 
step out of line, what would happen? He would be threatened 
with dismissal from the chairmanship of his committee, having 
done nothing wrong, having done nothing but represent the 
views of the people in his riding.
<P>
	If it were to continue, what would then happen? The Prime 
Minister would stand up and say words like this: ``You either do 
as you are told or I will not sign your nomination papers next 
time''.
<P>
	It is incredible. That is the way the old line party seems to 
think is a good way to run the country. It goes to the very heart of 
what we are talking about tonight, this need to interfere in the 
democratic process. The way it says that the party knows best, 
the constituents know nothing, and the members know less. The 
Liberals have come from a time when they used to be a coalition 
of friends scratching other friends' backs to friends warning 
other friends that if they step out of line, they will not be around 
much longer. It is a sad, sad day.
<P>
	I wondered even as I listened to the member from Waterloo 
waxing eloquent as he said: ``We are going to make sure that 
they are going to listen to us. We are going to make sure that they 
observe the boundaries we want''. What kind of nonsense is 
that? What kind of diatribe is that when we hear someone 
saying: ``We will make sure the next group that sets the 
boundaries does what we want''. It is nonsense.
<P>
	The reason it is nonsense is that they do not seem to 
understand the role of a neutral or fair minded boundary 
commission. The role of a commission is to come in not to do the 
wishes and the bidding of the member sitting in the riding. It is 
to listen to witnesses, do what it can to have input from the 
community, and then it has to make a decision.
<P>
	The sad but ironic thing about what is happening here with 
this bill is that the Liberal backbenchers who initiated this whole 
gong show of a revisiting this whole thing have shot themselves 
in the foot so to speak, maybe both feet. They said: ``We do not 
like the boundaries that C-18 gave. We do not like the 
boundaries and in fact the boundaries are so new, it will give us 
so little time to adjust that what we are going to have to bring in a 
new set of boundaries''.
<P>
	By pushing it off until this late, we are going to end up with a 
set of boundaries for Reformers and Liberals alike that no one 
will know until probably a couple of months before the next 
election. What a wise, wise move. Of course it will cost another 
$5 million or $6 million to do it. I guess that is just pocket 
change. The introduction of the $2 coin is only going to save $12 
million a year and the Liberals had to move heaven and earth for 
that. But for $6 million they will get another set of boundaries 
that will not be any better than the ones they had before. They 
will be slightly different and there will be slightly more of them. 
I wonder if they are listening to their constituents.
<P>
<B>(2040) </B>
<P>
	I repeat what the member for Waterloo said: ``It is important 
that we represent the wishes of the constituency''. Well, what 
would the constituency want? Maybe I should not speak for the 
member from Waterloo. Maybe his constituents do want more 
members of Parliament.
<P>
	As a matter of fact if we could get 301 members in the House 
we could start the renovations. Soon we will not have enough 
room in the House. We could just push the walls back and add 
more seats until the House becomes-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Tent meetings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Maybe that is what they would like, tent meetings 
in order to handle more members of Parliament that are 
inevitably going to come because of the way this bill has been 
set up.
<P>
	The Liberals refused to listen to the Reform Party. The 
Reform Party said there should not be more than 265 members 
of Parliament. They should not be looking to expand the 
numbers of members of Parliament. They should be looking to 
restrict them, to cut back on the size of government, not to 
continually think of ways to expand it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14274"> 14274 </A></B>
<P>
	If the Liberals would listen to the constituents in my riding 
and I would think in Waterloo as well, they would not be adding 
more seats and pushing the translators out into the boonies. They 
would be saying: ``We have more than enough people here. We 
have too many members of Parliament. Let us cut back the size 
of the House of Commons to 265 members''. It would be a 
manageable thing and would save money. If we are going to go 
to the trouble of a boundary redistribution let us at least save the 
taxpayers some bucks. Instead, that gets tossed out. It gets 
shoved aside and the Liberals decide instead to keep expanding 
it.
<P>
	Also there have been comments from many members of the 
Bloc on their supposed concern about the 25 per cent 
representation. The firm figure they want is a 25 per cent 
representation of all the seats in the House of Commons must be 
from Quebec. I do not know where they are coming from. They 
want out of Canada but they demand at least 25 per cent of the 
seats in the House of Commons. They want to make sure they 
have a referendum this year so they can leave Canada, but they 
demand that they get their MP pensions. They sound confused. 
A little bit like the Liberals, although granted in a different way. 
Still I do not understand what they want.
<P>
	In the bill we talked about earlier today Bloc members wanted 
continued access to the Canadian dairy market, except that they 
want to be a separate country. Quebec has 50 per cent of the 
industrial milk in Canada already. What do they want? I do not 
know and I do not think they know themselves. With the three 
leaders getting together I suppose they just want everything. 
That way they cover it with the three leaders. I am not sure what 
else it could be.
<P>
	It is in the best interests of the Liberal Party to let the bill die. 
If the they would just let the bill die at least Liberal members 
going into the next election would have some idea as to where 
they are going to fight their next losing battle. It is in their own 
best interests to at least set up their own Waterloo in such a way 
that they could at least plan for their own demise.
<P>
	There is no sense in being surprised by this. Why ask for a new 
arbitrary boundary so that we can try to make political contacts, 
media contacts in a riding where we do not know the boundaries. 
It is far wiser to go ahead and make whatever changes are 
necessary, and members opposite, if there were members 
opposite, should listen to this. There will be and must be 
changes. The boundaries cannot stay the same. There is no sense 
in saying: ``I wish this town or this little area were included''. It 
is not possible to stay the same. It has to change. It must change.
<P>
	If it changes, and it will, let us change it now. We can all get on 
with life and represent the ridings we have and we will go into 
the next election knowing the boundaries of the ridings we are 
going to represent. If some ridings need to be eliminated, 
perhaps we can eliminate the  riding of the hon. member who is 
leaving the House now. If we have to eliminate some, let us 
eliminate them now and get it over with so we can get on with 
making our plans for the next election.
<P>
<B>(2045 ) </B>
<P>
	Based on the 1991 census the Reform plan originally tabled 
with the committee would have created a House with a total of 
273 members, 265 seats plus some constitutional requirements 
to include some extras from certain provinces. There would 
have been only slight future growth. That is the kind of thing our 
constituents want. They do not want more government.
<P>
	I will speak for a moment about the way the amendments 
came back from the Senate. What an improvement it would be if 
we let the House of Commons operate with representation by 
population as close as we can work it. Then we move on to an 
upper House that is as close as we can make it in 
representational by region. What an improvement it would be if 
we said we all have 100,000, or whatever the figure, constituents 
to represent. Sometimes it is difficult because it is spread out; 
sometimes it is concentrated in cities. Be that as it may, this is 
rep by pop in the House of Commons.
<P>
	When we wanted advice or a sober second thought we could 
go to the Senate elected by the people, that had regional 
representation so that for instance the farming community in 
Saskatchewan would have people it could go to and say: ``This is 
the region you represent; this is the job you have. Get with it and 
represent my interests as a regional centre''. We could go to a 
senator from Toronto and he could do his best to represent that 
city and so on.
<P>
	What a better system it would be if we had true rep by pop in a 
smaller House of Commons and a triple E Senate. We could all 
look forward to an election for that and the job it would do.
<P>
	As I talk about this democratic process, the process of who 
should choose our electoral boundaries, obviously it should not 
be the members of Parliament but a neutral body. When we set 
up cost saving measures we should be willing as members of 
Parliament to pull in our vision of more seats and instead restrict 
it to a more cost effective way of doing business in the House.
<P>
	Think of the way we run things in the House where we should 
be elected to represent our constituents, not just our parties. 
Think of the changes required to make sure the House of 
Commons allows freer votes without party discipline. Think of 
the changes required in committees when a bill is referred to a 
committee on first reading in the hope of obtaining ample input 
from members of Parliament only to find out that in some 
committees when it comes to a clause by clause debate debate 
will be restricted to five minutes per clause; amendments will be 
refused if they are in one official language only; clauses of a bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14275"> 14275 </A></B>
<P>
will be passed without having a vote; decisions will be reversed 
on votes; witnesses will be refused.
<P>
	In the case of the MP pension plan members of the committee 
refused to hear from members of Parliament to be affected by it 
or from ordinary citizens. They restrict the input into those 
committees to maybe a single day. They did not allow enough 
time on Bill C-68, one of the most controversial bills of the year, 
to have legislative counsel draft the amendments properly.
<P>
	We saw our Prime Minister saying do as you are told by the 
party, not as you are told by your constituents or else. We see 
motions to extend hours and voting until 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. in order 
to shove through legislation. We see what we are facing here 
tonight, another example of closure where the government will 
force the bill through without allowing all the debate members 
want on it.
<P>
	We see all of this compiled in only 20 months of the Liberals 
in government. We wonder where their vaunted red book 
promises are. Where is the promise of freer votes, more open 
government, a chance to represent our constituents? It is gone. 
In only 20 months of arrogant government that is being wrapped 
up, shipped out in the fish wrappers of old. It is not a reality. The 
time has come and gone when we could look to the Liberal Party 
for reforming the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(2050) </B>
<P>
	It is becoming obvious that reform of the House of Commons 
will take the Reform Party. That is why it is a pleasure to stand 
here with many members of the Reform Party sitting in their 
seats listening to the debate, entering into the debate with 
government members who are willing to. We offer constructive 
criticism, beg the members opposite to debate us in public on 
issues such as closure, MP pensions and so on and we get no 
response.
<P>
	Still it is a pleasure to make known the concerns of my 
constituents and the concerns of the Reform Party as we want to 
make this place work better, more democratically. We want an 
electoral boundaries system free from political interference. 
That is why I will be voting against this bill and I am proud to do 
it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to 
participate in this debate on Bill C-69.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First of all, I want to congratulate all the members who sat on 
the parliamentary commission on Bill C-69. I want to point out 
in particular that this bill was agreed on and approved by all the 
members of the parliamentary committee. I can remember, for 
instance, the rather significant contribution made by the hon. 
member for Bellechasse and his support during the final vote in 
committee. The hon. member enthusiastically agreed to support 
this government bill.
<P>
	However, he had to yield to the higher authorities within his 
caucus, to the big shots in his caucus, and was unable to support 
the bill in the House. His colleagues even forced him or 
encouraged him to move an amendment. Even though we were 
told that the amendment was in order, it was unconstitutional 
because it would have changed the constitution of Canada.
<P>
	As you know, the hon. members of the Bloc and others may 
want to talk about the constitution, because they get a kick out of 
it, but I for one do not want to address this issue and the right 
hon. prime minister did say that he did not want to talk about it. 
Mr. Speaker, you are totally objective and impartial; therefore, 
you must have noticed that we have stayed away from the issue 
of the constitution since we came into office.
<P>
	I want to come back to the substance of Bill C-69, but I cannot 
miss the opportunity to comment on the statements made by the 
hon. member for Fraser Valley West.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A little earlier I listened to the remarks of the hon. member for 
Fraser Valley West. He was talking about the virtue within the 
Reform Party. He was talking about the fact that the Reform 
Party was so virtuous in his opinion, that the Reform Party could 
do no harm.
<P>
	As my colleague the parliamentary secretary to the 
government House leader said so eloquently, obviously if that 
had been the case it would have been a very short speech because 
the Reform Party is rather short on virtue.
<P>
	Nevertheless, he referred to MPs' being able to in his own 
party, so he said, vote the will of the people members represent 
and that they were never disciplined for doing so within the 
Reform Party. Surely some of us remember when the then 
justice critic was bumped off his parliamentary committee. The 
then justice critic, the member for New Westminster-Burnaby, 
whom I see before us in the House right now, got the boot. He 
was booted off his committee because he said something his 
leader and many other people disagreed with.
<P>
<B>(2055) </B>
<P>
	What happened? He got bumped off the committee. He was 
unceremoniously demoted. That is what happened to a Reform 
MP. What happened to another MP? I remember a certain speech 
in the House on Bosnia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, the 
statement the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell made 
is absolutely untrue. He has no basis to make that comment. I 
ask him to retract it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14276"> 14276 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Arseneault):</B> That is a matter of 
debate and not a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker as usual has adjudicated in a 
totally objective and non-partisan way.
<P>
	Getting back to those people across the way in the Reform 
Party, I signed the form that assisted in bumping the member off 
the committee at the request of someone representing another 
party. We will not mention the name of that party.
<P>
	However, let us get back to other members of the Reform 
Party and what happened to them. Do members remember the 
debate on Bosnia in the House? I do very clearly. I remember a 
speech from the hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca. He 
spoke very well on the issue. Do members know what happened 
after that? The member never spoke again; weeks and weeks 
without being able to speak in the House. I wonder why that 
happened. He was silenced by the authorities within his party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is a seasoned 
parliamentarian. He should certainly recognize his comments 
have no relevancy to Bill C-69, absolutely none.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Over the years the 
relevancy rule has had a tremendous amount of flexibility and 
elasticity. I know within the confines of a 20-minute 
intervention the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is probably just getting to the 
very point of debate, which the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster was raising.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Well put, Mr. Speaker. Not only is that true but 
I was responding to the speech from the member for Fraser 
Valley West and I know that he would not have made an 
irrelevant speech.
<P>
	I will stand up to defend the member for Fraser Valley West 
against this vicious attack by the Reform Party House leader that 
we just saw against the member for Fraser Valley West because 
when he talked about free votes in the House we let him say it 
because we knew it was relevant to this debate.
<P>
	We all recognize it in the Liberal caucus. The Reform Party 
House leader now tried to silence that member and to reprimand 
him for what he said previously. We will not put up with that. We 
will defend the member for Fraser Valley West.
<P>
	Having discussed and proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that 
Reform Party senior big wigs have reprimanded most severely 
the member for Fraser Valley West a moment ago by the 
comments from the House leader, and also silenced the member 
for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, forbidding him to speak in the 
House for weeks and then bumping the member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby off his committee unceremoniously, 
now we can get back to the main topic of Bill C-69.
<P>
<B>(2100) </B>
<P>
	My colleagues remind me about the hon. member for 
Crowfoot who was demoted from the human rights committee, 
but I shall not even mention the member for Crowfoot being 
bumped off that committee. I am sure he was excellent, but the 
authorities within the Reform Party saw fit to demote him.
<P>
	Let us get back to the substance of Bill C-69, recognizing of 
course that everything I have just said is totally germane to the 
bill, as the hon. member for Fraser Valley West so eloquently 
pointed out earlier today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This may be a 
trivial matter, but he keeps talking about the hon. member for 
Fraser Valley West and I am sure he means Fraser Valley East. 
To avoid the necessity of having to change <I>Hansard</I>, maybe we 
should correct the member.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for Elk 
Island is absolutely right. I am sure the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell will now make that adjustment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I suppose that east met west. That 
is correct, it is the hon. member for Fraser Valley East. But I 
would gladly defend the hon. member for Fraser Valley West as 
well, should that be necessary, against any attack by the 
leadership of the Reform Party.
<P>
	On the substance of Bill C-69, this bill was necessary. It was 
tabled in the House by a parliamentary committee. This bill is 
the only piece of legislation of its kind. It was produced by a 
parliamentary committee. I am glad to say that I was a member 
of that committee very ably chaired by the hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands. Of course we had the distinguished 
leadership and ability of the hon. member for Bellechasse.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Several other members, including Reform members, have 
also helped to make this bill a rather unique piece of legislation, 
having been entirely drafted by the parliamentary committee.
<P>
	So, this bill was debated and passed in the House of 
Commons. Then it was sent to the other place. The other place, 
in its wisdom, decided to send the bill back to the House with 
some amendments.
<P>
	Despite all this shuffling back and forth, we are on the last day 
of debate on this bill, or so we hope. The other place refuses to 
adopt this bill, which is not a government bill, but a bill 
produced by all parliamentarians, by all of us in this House of 
Commons, who are the salt of the earth.
<P>
	I do not want to show a lack of respect for the hon. persons in 
the other place, but not being subject to electoral rules as 
frequently as we are-and that is the least we can say since, 
when they are appointed to the other place, they are there for a 
good long time-they should not be lecturing us on how to get 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14277"> 14277 </A></B>
<P>
elected to this House. This bill is good and I am proud to support 
it.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, the member for Bellechasse praised this 
bill a few moments ago, which certainly means that it must be 
good. The member for Bellechasse spoke about the five-year 
redistribution that we will have after this bill is adopted, and it 
will be adopted. After that, there will be no need for the kind of 
electoral redistribution we have now.
<P>
	Some members of this House, such as the member for York 
North, the member for Mississauga, the member for Ontario and 
the member for Terrebonne, represent ridings that are often two 
or three times more populated than other ridings across Canada. 
This is not normal.
<P>
<B>(2105) </B>
<P>
	This situation will prevail as long as we have a system where 
electoral redistribution happens only every ten years following 
the census.
<P>
	But now, we have a new formula. We have a good bill, a bill 
that will allow us to make smaller changes every five years, 
changes that will ensure that the House continues to apply the 
principle of proportional representation much more adequately 
than it does now.
<P>
	I am not convinced that a member who represents 250,000 or 
275,000 constituents can take as good care of them as another 
member whose riding is smaller, like mine for example, with 
100,000 constituents, or yours, Mr. Speaker, with some 60,000 
constituents. This is the sort of figures I am talking about.
<P>
	There comes a time when, unless he has access to 
considerable resources to help his constituents, a member can no 
longer do his or her job as an MP alone at the riding level, 
especially when the riding is very large or heavily populated. 
This is the case of a number of ridings in the Toronto area and, of 
course, in the Montreal area, the riding of Terrebonne, which is 
certainly the best example I could come up with in Quebec and 
stands to benefit from a bill like this one.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some members have advocated that it is necessary in this bill 
to put this business of the 25 per cent representation for the 
province of Quebec. We know the House has already voted that 
down, as it had to. This is not a constitutional amendment; this is 
a bill having to do with electoral redistribution. There are right 
now a series of thresholds in electoral redistribution and we 
know what they are. There is what is commonly referred to as 
the Senate floor: no province can have fewer MPs than it has 
senators. There are a few other criteria in there as well. At 
present provinces do not lose seats from what they had prior to 
the last redistribution, and that is since 1988 or so. We must 
respect what is in there now. We cannot unilaterally today make 
those kinds of amendments to give that 25 per cent 
representation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must also remember that the whole Canadian electoral 
system is based on a specific province, when it comes to 
allocating seats to the other provinces. As we all know-at least 
those of us who, in the past, worked on redefining electoral 
boundaries-, that province is Quebec. We take the province's 
population and we divide it by its number of seats. The quotient 
is then applied elsewhere in the country. It is as simple as that. 
There is of course another factor, namely the fact that a province 
cannot have fewer MPs than senators. This explains why, for 
example, Prince Edward Island has four seats in the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to ask all members to support this bill. It 
is a good bill. It is the only bill produced by a parliamentary 
committee. It is unique and it is our bill. It is the bill of MPs for 
electoral redistribution for those of us who got elected and for 
future candidates who will be elected to replace MPs who will 
not run again or who will be defeated in the next election and so 
on. It is the bill for redistribution and it is a fair one for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Without being disrespectful, those who do not get elected to 
anything, after having made their representation to us once, 
should recognize the second time that this is the will of the 
House of Commons, democratically elected, and that the will of 
the people is totally respected by a bill like this.
<P>
	I say to the members across that they did not produce one 
piece of evidence why this bill is unfair, nor do they have any 
alternative to this electoral redistribution bill. Their members 
who worked on the committee know better than the hon. member 
who just heckled from across the way.
<P>
<B>(2110) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
not a happy occasion, because just before the fall referendum in 
Quebec, the Parliament of Canada has failed to recognize the 
historic contribution of the people of Quebec and confirm that 
Quebec will have 25 per cent of the seats in Parliament.
<P>
	I know the amendment was defeated, but I cannot help talking 
about it because for us in the Bloc Quebecois, and, I suppose I 
could say, in Quebec, the most important aspect of the bill is the 
representation of the people of Quebec. This is a gesture the 
Parliament of Canada could have made to Quebecers. It is a 
gesture it refused to make, which sends the following message 
to Quebecers: ``We do not recognize your position, your historic 
contribution or what you are as a people and a distinct nation''.
<P>
	I realize historic references are not always appreciated in this 
House. But since I am speaking to you, Mr. Speaker, I will try 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14278"> 14278 </A></B>
<P>
and make a few. To know where you are going, you have to know 
where you are from. We  must remember that in 1837-38, we 
had a rebellion in Lower Canada and Upper Canada, both of 
which were put down. Upper Canada and Lower Canada were 
forced to come together in a union. Canadians, and I am 
referring to the ``Canayens'', the people who came over to 
America from France and, before France was defeated by 
England, had become sufficiently independent to start 
criticizing France, the church over here quarrelling with the 
church over there, so that if the colony had remained French, 
after a while it would have become independent like all the 
American colonies did after a while. These French men and 
women, who became the ``Canayens'', are the ones who were 
defeated. They were left here, about 60,000 of them, and here in 
North America they continued to multiply, develop the land and 
try in spite of everything to preserve their language, their 
religion and identity.
<P>
<B>(2115) </B>
<P>
	These ``Canayens'' who in 1791 obtained their national 
assembly, these Canadiens who for years elected their members 
and founded a party called the Patriote Party, who wanted to 
negotiate the patriation of executive powers with England, and 
finally, these ``Canayens'' who, according to the historians, 
were provoked by the Doric Club in 1837, were defeated and 
became a minority as a result of the forcible union of 1840.
<P>
	I say became a minority because we should remember that in 
1810 and later in 1822, the British Montrealers wanted to make 
Montreal Island a part of what was not yet known as Ontario but 
as Upper Canada. However, they were not successful because 
the ``Canayens'' who had large families were not about to 
become a minority.
<P>
	After the rebellion was put down in 1837-38, when Lord 
Durham came to conduct his investigation, he said the 
following: ``I found two nations warring in the bosom of a single 
state''. Lord Durham was anxious to put these ``Canayens'' in a 
minority position, to ensure that the character of British North 
America, come what may, would remain British.
<P>
	At the time, there were about 450,000 ``Canayens'' in Lower 
Canada, 150,000 anglophones and about 400,000 British or 
people of British descent in Upper Canada. This means that 
although the population was not the same within the union, 
Upper Canada and Lower Canada were given the same number 
of members, irrespective of population. There was a significant 
difference between the number of people in Lower Canada and 
in Upper Canada. At the time, it was important to maintain the 
minority status of the ``Canayens''.
<P>
	Once the union became official, it did not work very well. 
According to the history books, many settlers came to Ontario, 
to Upper Canada, and when the union did not work out, members 
for Upper Canada, under the slogan ``Rep by Pop'', demanded a 
new government. An alliance was formed between 
representatives of Lower  Canada and others, who did not seem 
prepared to unite with them in Upper Canada to produce a 
federation, when it became clear that the union was not going to 
work and something new had to be found.
<P>
<B>(2120) </B>
<P>
	But, in exchange, and this was clear, patriots like 
George-Étienne Cartier who fired the first shots, 
George-Étienne Cartier who was a member of the McDonald 
government, could not accept a confederation proposal which 
did not recognize Lower Canada, what it represented and its 
importance.
<P>
	Confederation was enacted in the British North America Act. 
At Confederation, Quebec, because that was how it was then 
known, became one of four regions. Quebec was granted 65 MPs 
out of a total of 181.
<P>
	Since then, Quebecers have steadily become a minority. This 
situation led a large number of Quebecers to want sovereignty, 
and it led us, the Bloc Quebecois, who are here in the Canadian 
Parliament just a few months before the referendum, to say to 
ourselves that the Canadian Parliament possibly would 
recognize the right of Quebecers to 25 per cent of all seats 
because of their status as a founding people.
<P>
	Now, I will talk about the Quebecois people. This people has 
long been recognized as Canada's francophone nation. The 
francophone nation of Canada, the ``Canayens'' of whom I 
spoke, held their hands out to the anglophone nation after 1840 
in friendship so that those who called themselves English 
Canadians could try with French Canadians to piece back 
together the pieces of two shattered colonies.
<P>
	For a long time, French Canadians in Quebec desperately 
tried to find their niche within Canada. They were searching for 
equality. I said for a long time and desperately because there is 
something desperate in this repetitive quest over the years, we 
can even say over the centuries, of the descendents of the first 
francophones, the ``Canayens'' who became French Canadians 
who, despite the circumstances, wanted to take their place 
within Canada.
<P>
	It is only after repeatedly failing to do so, after recognizing 
the potential to develop to their fullest in Quebec, that in the 
1960s or thereabouts, because history cannot be boxed in, 
Quebecers saw events quietly transform reality. At a certain 
moment, the situation changed: in the 1960s or thereabouts the 
people who were referred to as the cradle of French in Canada 
became the Quebecois people.
<P>
<B>(2125) </B>
<P>
	I am always pleased to quote Daniel Johnson, the father, the 
one who was Premier in 1966, whose father was Irish. Daniel 
Johnson, the father, this leading Quebec politician, a French 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14279"> 14279 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian, the first to launch his party, the Union Nationale, the 
party in power without a break from 1944, except for the period 
between 1960 and 1966. He is the one who called an election on 
a platform  of ``Égalité ou indépendance''. He was thinking of 
equality for the French-Canadian nation, but he said in his text: 
``If French Canadians cannot achieve equality within Canada, it 
will be legitimate, normal and natural for them to seek political 
independence within their territory''.
<P>
	The people known as Quebecers have a long and meandering 
history, having moved from a French colonial identity to a North 
American identity, from Cajun to conquered, to dominated, to 
colonized by the British colony, to French Canadian in a colony 
that gained its independence from Great Britain in 1931. The 
French Canadians, who became Quebecers in the 1960s, are 
having a hard time discovering their identity, some of them. 
Some of them mock it.
<P>
	Their history, although meandering, is one of courage. And 
Parliament's recognition in acknowledging Quebecers' 
entitlement to 25 per cent of the seats would have been a 
minimum tribute to Quebecers' contribution to Canada.
<P>
	I would add the following. The French Canadians, I saw it 
earlier and I am repeating it, it hurts me but it is true, French 
Canadians desperately wanted to find their place and grow 
within Canada. Often they were the only ones wanting to. At the 
same time, though, they developed the qualities that go into 
making a people. They meet all the criteria of a nation: 
language, different laws, the Civil Code, their religion, a culture 
and a community spirit. Neither the people nor the nation is 
closed, as some would claim.
<P>
	I quoted Daniel Johnson senior earlier. He was the son of an 
immigrant and became premier. I do not think I need to provide 
many more examples in talking of this openness.
<P>
	This people tried to find its place in Canada. After the 
referendum when the people said ``no'' in 1980, because 
Trudeau had promised change, federal reform, the people 
followed Bourassa with his five basic conditions. Today, some 
people have no other choice but to say: ``We will take charge 
ourselves''.
<P>
	They do not want an end to relations. For them, the only way 
to grow in this country is to say yes to who they are and offer the 
rest of Canada an economic and a political agreement.
<P>
<B>(2130) </B>
<P>
	It would not have cost Parliament much to grant this status to 
the people of Quebec, a status they have anyway, by recognizing 
that they are a founding people of Canada and play a 
fundamental role within Canada.
<P>
	Personally, I would have liked to see such a sign. Instead, 
what we saw was its failure to recognize this basic difference of 
ours.
<P>
	Some members addressed the technical requirements of the 
rep. by pop. rule and we understand that this is important. 
However, the message Parliament could have sent or still could 
send Quebec is infinitely more important than setting the 
allowable percentage of variance in determining the size of any 
given riding. We are talking about having one country or two.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was quite surprised to hear the comments made by the 
hon. member for Mercier.
<P>
	In his speech earlier tonight, the government whip suggested 
that Bloc members disagreed on this bill. This is quite obvious 
tonight as the hon. member for Bellechasse, who sits on the 
committee, proposed in committee an amendment to the bill that 
would have given Quebec at least 25 per cent of the seats in this 
House.
<P>
	The suggestion to amend the bill actually came from a senator 
who testified as a witness before the committee. The committee 
nonetheless decided that amendments to the Constitution of 
Canada were not needed at this time and that, as everyone 
agreed, the amendment suggested by the hon. member for 
Bellechasse would involve amending the constitution. 
Consequently, the committee rejected this amendment and 
decided to preserve the constitutional relations now in effect 
among all Canadian provinces, and especially the constitutional 
provisions concerning representation in this House. We then 
heard the hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm deliver a long 
speech in this House at second or third reading of this bill.
<P>
	The hon. member for Bellechasse did not have anything to say 
at that time, while his colleague from Berthier-Montcalm 
called for major changes to this bill and proposed an 
amendment. This amendment was rejected by the House. We 
now hear all kinds of speeches dealing with the amendments 
proposed by the Senate, which have nothing to do with the 
constitution, nothing to do with the representation of any 
province in this House, although all speeches by Bloc members 
deal with this. This has nothing to do with the motion before the 
House tonight. Perhaps they would like this to be the case, but it 
is not.
<P>
<B>(2135) </B>
<P>
	The motion before the House and the amendment concern 
only the amendments proposed by the Senate. It is noteworthy 
that the Senate did not propose the amendments requested by the 
hon. members for Mercier and Bellechasse. Why? Because such 
amendments would have also been rejected by the Senate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14280"> 14280 </A></B>
<P>
	I am surprised. During her speech, the hon. member for 
Mercier rewrote the history of Canada. It is very obvious that 
our country was built by two partners, English Canadians and 
French Canadians. That much is obvious to everybody. Canada 
will continue to prosper because of these two partners. If we are 
together, if we work together to continue to build this country, 
there will always be enough wealth for everyone in Canada and 
no one will be denied their rights. That is what created this great 
country, Canada, and what will sustain it in the future.
<P>
	I am certain that when the Bloc Quebecois will have the 
courage to hold a referendum in the Province of Quebec, 
Quebecers will tell all of the world that they want to remain in 
Canada, that they want to remain part of this great country, 
because they have always worked with all other Canadians to 
create this country, not without difficulty, but ever hopeful for 
the future of this great country, one of the world's greatest.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to leave that subject and speak instead tonight about the 
Reform amendment, which is, after all, what we are supposed to 
be discussing.
<P>
	I am very surprised to see the Reform Party carrying on the 
way it has been tonight. Again I have the little green book handy. 
I was just browsing through it. I know we have heard hon. 
members of the Reform Party almost speak disrespectfully of 
the other place. I am shocked, to say the least. I am shocked 
because here we have a spectacle of the Reform Party on the one 
hand speaking disrespectfully of the other place and on the other 
hand supporting the amendments it has made to this bill. I do not 
think it is any accident that many of the amendments proposed 
by the Reform Party members in the committee and rejected by 
the House and the committee are now being supported by their 
friends in the other place.
<P>
	The other place has a constitutional right to suggest 
amendments to this House and send bills back, as it has done in 
this case, but I am surprised that a party that speaks so 
disrespectfully of the other place would now support by its 
amendment the amendments that have been proposed there.
<P>
	I want to quote from their leader, the hon. member for Calgary 
Southwest, in the little green book. The book is called ``The 
Gospel According to Preston Manning and the Reform Party''. 
He said the following, although I want to say at the outset that I 
do not agree with the statement: ``The three priorities of the 
present Senate are, in order, protocol, alcohol and Geritol''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> There is the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster, who quoted this very statement in 
his speech the other night, applauding it. Yet I note on the other 
hand that he is supporting the Senate amendments to this bill.
<P>
	We are not just asking him to vote for the one amendment the 
government supports. He is saying we should support a whole 
bunch of them and has proposed an amendment to do. We are 
saying reject it because those amendments are not good 
amendments to this bill and we are asking the Senate to 
withdraw them. That is what the motion states. It is a sensible 
bill.
<P>
	What is the principal objection the Reform Party has? I 
suggest there are two. One of them is not dealt with in any of 
these Senate amendments and it was not dealt with in the bill, 
but there are two. The first was that Reformers wanted the 
possibility in a riding of moving away from the provincial 
quotient to the variation permitted to be 15 per cent above or 
below instead of 25 per cent above or below.
<P>
	The result of such a change would be to ensure that the ridings 
would be closer in size. In other words, there would be one 
person equal to one vote a little more closely across the country 
than is the case now. In fact it would only apply within a 
province, but it would result in a substantial shift.
<P>
<B>(2140) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster and the 
others who are hooting and hollering over there tonight know 
perfectly well that it would result in changes so that large rural 
ridings such as that occupied by the hon. member for 
Bellechasse-I could name a whole host of others in this House, 
but he is here, he was on the committee, he knows the 
argument-would be enlarged enormously to fill it up with more 
people to get it closer to the provincial quotient in numbers and 
other ridings in big cities would be cut up and divided into 
smaller units. More ridings would move to the cities than there 
are now and there would be fewer rural ridings in Canada.
<P>
	I am surprised that hon. members opposite, largely from rural 
parts of the country themselves, are supporting this kind of 
amendment. I know their hope lies in winning additional seats in 
other parts of Canada, but I know perfectly well their hope lies 
in rural Canada. If they cannot win seats there, they are going to 
be in difficulty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> They are in difficulty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> My hon. colleague says they are in difficulty, 
and he is right on that score.
<P>
	The second argument they had was that the House was getting 
too big and they wanted to stop this House from getting any 
bigger. They said 295 was ample. Some of them wanted to cut it 
back. There was disagreement on how far it should be cut back, 
but they wanted to cut it back.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14281"> 14281 </A></B>
<P>
	The government and the members of the committee agreed 
that 301 was not too many and we have agreed to go along with 
the existing law. So we have proposed no change in the 
Constitution or in the rules relating to the size of the House and 
we have left it at 301 members, which is what the number will be 
after the next election, whether this act passes or not.
<P>
	Let us see what their leader says about how you fix meetings. 
He said this is one of the things you have to do to preserve party 
dignity: ``If you think it's going to be that type of meeting, get as 
many sane, sober people there as possible. Overwhelm the kook 
element.'' We are only following his leader's advice. We are 
going to try to expand this House to overcome the kook element. 
That is the aim. We are going to try to create another five or six 
seats, fill them with good Liberals, and overwhelm the kook 
element in the opposition-and I do not mean the official 
opposition.
<P>
	That is just one of the things his leader said. He said more. 
There is a lot more. This man is productive.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I am very curious 
as to whether the hon. member referring to us over here as the 
kook element is denigrating our position and impunging our 
honour. I would ask him to please retract that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Certainly any member 
can retract anything upon the request of another member, but 
respectfully I must say to the House that is not a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not think the member would 
be offended; I was only quoting his leader.
<P>
	I want to quote the hon. member for Calgary Southwest again. 
He also said ``Every political party has a few bad apples''. I 
think he was right, but I will not throw stones.
<P>
	The member obviously holds politicians in very low esteem. 
The hon. members opposite say they do not want to have 301 
seats because it would increase the number of politicians, and 
they say that Canadians do not like politicians. I do not know 
about the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, the 
hon. member for Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, the 
hon. member for Bruce-Grey, the hon. member for St. 
Boniface, the hon. member for London West. All of these people 
are not unpopular in their constituencies. I know when they go 
home they are greeted warmly. They are not regarded as 
unwanted politicians. Perhaps the hon. member for Calgary 
Southwest and some of the members of his party feel they are 
unpopular and therefore think politicians are unpopular. It does 
not follow. Some are, but I know many who are not. Many of my 
colleagues on this side of the House are very popular.
<P>
	Let me read what the hon. member for Calgary Southwest said 
about politicians: ``What's the difference between a politician 
and a catfish? One is a slimy, wide-mouthed bottom feeder and 
the other is a fish.''
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I knew hon. members opposite would applaud 
that one. As my hon. colleague from St. Boniface said, 
obviously they are intellectuals.
<P>
<B>(2145) </B>
<P>
	If the hon. member for Calgary Southwest holds politicians in 
such low esteem, I can understand why he and his colleagues do 
not think there should be any more in the House. I assure him 
that my constituents and the constituents of my friends-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You are exhibit <I>a</I>.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member suggests that I am an exhibit. 
I do not think that is quite fair.
<P>
	The hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is well 
regarded in his constituency. I know; I have been there. In St. 
Boniface the hon. member is very well regarded. In Bellechasse 
I have no doubt the hon. member is well regarded.
<P>
	For the member for Calgary Southwest to speak this way 
about the profession that he now claims to profess and to refer to 
his own colleagues in this way is unfair and unjust. Hon. 
members opposite deserve a better defence and I am prepared to 
defend them from the ravages of their own leadership.
<P>
	Having said that, let us turn back to Bill C-69. The bill, after 
all, represents an honest attempt by the government and by 
members of the House. The House is dealing with a bill that has 
been approved by the membership of the House in a committee. 
As the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell said in 
his remarks earlier, this is the first time the House has come up 
with a bill that has been created or drafted from scratch by a 
committee of the House. It was agreed to in the committee.
<P>
	I know the hon. member for Calgary West said in his remarks 
in the debate on the bill the other day that this was their fourth 
and fifth choice, that they went along with it only because we 
rejected choices one to five. All of us had choices we wanted on 
different things rejected in different ways. We all settled and 
made compromises. That is the way committees work.
<P>
	I do not know where the hon. member comes from when he 
thinks a committee goes the way of only one person. I was only 
the chair of the committee so I did not even have a vote. I accept 
the work of the committee as good, solid work. I think it was 
fair. I think it was reasonable. The hon. member opposite was 
there. He knows it was reasonable. The hon. member for 
Bellechasse knows it was reasonable.
<P>
	When the bill came back to the House, when the government 
introduced the bill, it had reasonable support. I know hon. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14282"> 14282 </A></B>
<P>
members complained about it. Of course it did not have 
everything in it that they wanted. They are members of an 
opposition. They are paid to be here to oppose. So they did what 
any opposition would  do and opposed it. I have been in 
opposition before. I know how it works.
<P>
	Let us face the facts. The bill was a reasonable compromise 
reached by the members of that committee working together. I 
think we worked extremely well together. We came up with a 
reasonable proposition.
<P>
	Now we have this loud criticism going on night and day, 
especially from the Reform Party, spouting absolute nonsense in 
respect of the bill. The extraordinary thing is that they have had 
to do it on the basis of Senate amendments when they know 
perfectly well the Senate amendments are not ones the 
committee agreed to. The committee considered almost every 
one of the Senate amendments in one form or another in the 
course of its deliberations, rejected those changes in the law, and 
came up with something different.
<P>
	The Senate is trying to take us back to the same old law we had 
before. The Senate amendments proposed in the notice that was 
sent to the House effectively gut the bill of any significant 
change over the existing law. Hon. members opposite know that 
is not what the committee agreed to. They wanted changes in the 
law. They did not get everything they wanted but they got a good 
number of changes that were quite reasonable. We all agreed to 
the changes. For the most part they are good changes and 
reasonable changes. We should support them and tell the other 
place that is the case.
<P>
	Hon. members opposite like to complain about the use of 
closure in this debate. They have not said a lot about it. Nor 
should they because we are getting toward the end of a session. 
An upcoming summer vacation is specified in the rules where 
members will have a recess from the House and will go to do 
work in their constituencies. I am looking forward to the 
opportunity to do some work in my constituency. I am sure hon. 
members opposite are doing exactly the same.
<P>
<B>(2150) </B>
<P>
	When we get to the end of the line and are running out of time, 
the government is trying to get its legislative agenda through 
and has adopted measures with respect to arranging the time of 
the House to ensure the legislative agenda is adopted. The 
government has various tools at its disposal.
<P>
	Hon. members opposite could get up and quote chapter and 
verse on the evils of time allocation and probably on the evils of 
closure. As a member of the opposition I opposed those 
applications in years past. However I can say to hon. members 
opposite that they do not know how lucky they are that they have 
a Liberal government on this side of the House that is so 
beneficent and so careful in its use of these tools.
<P>
	I see the hon. member for Beaver River. She was here. None of 
her colleagues was but she was. She knows that the former 
government used closure and time allocation right, left and 
centre with what can only be described as gay abandon. I should 
also say that it was used by the previous government unilaterally 
with no co-operation from anybody.
<P>
	This government used closure today for the first time and with 
reluctance only because members opposite would not make any 
arrangement to dispatch this business expeditiously. It is quite 
reasonable to apply it. Look at the difficulty they are having 
filling the time with speakers tonight.
<P>
	With respect to time allocation we have used it in almost 
every case with full co-operation of the opposition. In other 
words we have not used it unilaterally. We have done it with 
co-operation from opposition members. They know organizing 
the time of the House is important to the orderly conduct of 
business. They know we have an interest in seeing that bills are 
passed in a timely way, and that when debate has come to a 
logical end and it has gone on for too long it is time to bring it to 
an end and to reach a decision in the House.
<P>
	I spoke on this issue last week when the time allocation 
motions were moved and carried in the House with a substantial 
majority of the members. Only the Reformers and a handful of 
Independents were voting the time allocation process adopted in 
the House. The time allocations we allocated on the bills were 
reasonable. On this one we could not get agreement but closure 
was a simple, short way to dispatch this item of business.
<P>
	Hon. members opposite know in their heart of hearts that they 
want the bill passed. They want the Senate to back off on these 
amendments and get on with life. They prefer to get the 
amendments in but they know if we agreed to their amendments 
tonight they would be standing here screeching at the Senate to 
pass the bill tomorrow.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary wags his head but he knows 
perfectly well that is the case. He would not be supporting the 
amendment otherwise. He wants these amendments if he can get 
them.
<P>
	I remind hon. members opposite-and I thank the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell for this point-that 
we have even had support from members of the Reform Party on 
time allocation when there were bills they wanted passed.
<P>
	We have not used time allocation unilaterally very often. In 
fact it has been extremely rarely. The hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster keeps a little list and marks it down 
every day it is used. It is not a long list but he has it there. I invite 
him to count how many times it was used unilaterally. In almost 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14283"> 14283 </A></B>
<P>
every case it was done with the co-operation of one or the other 
of the opposition parties.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is a new rule.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> It is not a new rule. Standing Order 78(2) has 
been in the rule book since 1969 when it was passed. It is just 
that it has not been used before. Governments have usually acted 
unilaterally and we fought that when we were in opposition.
<P>
	We are in a different situation. It is a different kettle of fish at 
the moment. We are getting co-operation from one party or the 
other because the parties opposite realize that for the orderly 
conduct of public business it is sometimes necessary to fix 
times. That is exactly what we have done. We have done it fairly 
and we have done it in a way that could not lead to any 
complaints from hon. members opposite despite the screeches 
of horror we hear so regularly.
<P>
	I urge members of the House to vote against the amendment, 
to vote for the government motion rejecting these amendments 
in the other place and to urge the other place to pass the bill with 
dispatch so that we can get on with drawing proper electoral 
boundaries for all the constituencies in our great country.
<P>
<B>(2155 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to speak on Bill C-69 respecting changes to 
electoral boundaries.
<P>
	The arrogance and the lack of integrity that have been 
displayed by the government, particularly over the last couple of 
weeks, are absolutely astounding to me, the Reform Party and 
all Canadians. In true Grit fashion the Liberals have had the 
nerve to campaign on a theme of restoring integrity to 
government. Yet the government's arrogance is increasing while 
its integrity is decreasing. The government's lack of 
competence is appearing in more and more areas.
<P>
	The defence minister, the heritage minister, the health 
minister and the minister of Indian affairs are seriously 
mishandling their portfolios. The human resource development 
minister has caused a complete collapse in the social reforms 
promised in the red book.
<P>
	Speaking of promises in the red book, let us for just one 
moment take a look at some of the promises in the red book that 
the Liberals talked so much about during the election campaign. 
Did they not promise to base key federal appointments solely on 
the competence of the person rather than on patronage? That 
promise is routinely broken on a weekly basis.
<P>
	Was it not the Liberal government that said in the red book 
that it promised not to alter federal-provincial transfers without 
the full co-operation of the provinces? That was broken by the 
introduction of the Canadian social transfer in the recent budget.
<P>
	Was it not one of the cabinet ministers, the Deputy Prime 
Minister as a matter of fact, who said that she would resign if the 
GST was not replaced within one year? Shamelessly that 
promise was broken on October 25, 1994.
<P>
	There were more promises. There are sheets and sheets, 
literally miles and miles of promises the Liberal government has 
broken over a short period of time. In a mere 19 months it has 
broken promises to the Canadian people.
<P>
	The arrogance of the Liberals is clear in their coercive 
treatment of individual MPs, forcing them to vote against the 
wishes of their constituents. Can we imagine? The Prime 
Minister even congratulated those members for toeing the party 
line. For goodness' sake, if we were not elected to this place to 
represent our constituents, what were we elected for?
<P>
	More examples are the Liberal's sexual orientation bill, the 
gun registry bill, and the disappointing changes to the MPs gold 
plated pension plan. They have all been torpedoed through the 
House. The use of time allocation and closure effectively 
limiting debate in the House is as prevalent as it was in the 
government before.
<P>
	The Liberals should be absolutely ashamed of what they have 
done to parliamentary democracy. They are not governing with 
integrity. We have seen conflicts of interest, unethical 
behaviour, broken promises, arrogance and incompetence. The 
confidence of the people in the government is decreasing as the 
integrity of the government decreases.
<P>
	Let us take Bill C-69 as an example. This piece of legislation 
has cost the taxpayer some $6 million so far. That is the amount 
of money needlessly spent on previous federal electoral 
boundaries commission proposals. These were scrapped by the 
government in Bill C-18 because a number of Liberal members 
disliked the new maps. Now the whole process is being redone in 
their favour under the guise of Bill C-69.
<P>
<B>(2200) </B>
<P>
	To obscure the real intent of Bill C-18, this government put 
forward a motion which initiated this bill. It asked the 
procedures and House affairs committee to examine methods of 
capping or reducing the size of the House of Commons, to 
improve the process by which the boundary commissioners are 
selected, to consider how boundary commissioners conduct 
their work and examine the involvement of the public.
<P>
	If this bill capped or better yet reduced the number of 
members of Parliament in the House of Commons, then the $6 
million lost by scrapping the previous commission and its 
proposals could have been justified. The cost savings could have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14284"> 14284 </A></B>
<P>
been much more than the $6 million already spent on the 
previous commission's proposals.
<P>
	Sadly and in true Grit fashion, this government has shown its 
usual contempt for the taxpayers of this country. The 
government did not address the most fundamental reason it 
claimed for reinitiating the whole process. The government 
failed to reduce the already excessive and growing number of 
members of Parliament sitting in the House of Commons. This 
bill has been rendered utterly useless in the face of the $6 
million which is removed from the pockets of hard working and 
tax paying Canadians.
<P>
	Worse still, contrary to all logic, the government actually 
intends to increase the number of members in the House of 
Commons from 295 to 301. This will cost the Canadian 
taxpayers millions in additional salaries, staff costs and how 
about travel expenses? Of course, something the Liberals do not 
like talking about very much is the lavish gold plated MP 
pension benefits which they will receive. We only have to worry 
about that if there are any members opposite left here after the 
taxpayers vote in the next election.
<P>
	In addition to the extra cost this bill imposes on Canadians by 
increasing the size of the House of Commons, new commissions 
will need to be struck to redo what the commission scrapped by 
this government has already done. Judging by the last 
commission, this will cost taxpayers at least another $6 million, 
maybe more.
<P>
	Many Canadians have questions, as do I. Why has this 
government shown such contempt for the taxpayers? Why does 
the government fail to cap or reduce the number of members of 
Parliament? The answer is obvious. It is very clear. Self-interest 
of course. The interests of the voters and taxpayers were set 
aside so that no Liberal members would have to voluntarily give 
up their seats when the numbers were reduced.
<P>
	This example of arrogant self-interest will backfire when the 
taxpayers get the opportunity to vote in the next election. 
Liberal members need not worry. They will not have to 
voluntarily give up their seats because they will be booted out of 
this place by the seats of their pants in the next election.
<P>
	Liberal arrogance and incompetence reared its ugly head 
before this bill even made its way to the committee. The 
government actually intended to include a schedule of special 
ridings exempt from having their boundaries adjusted by the 
future electoral boundaries adjustment commission.
<P>
<B>(2205 ) </B>
<P>
	This is laughable. It is not funny but it is laughable. What a 
tool that would have been. Imagine the Liberals manipulating 
the system by creating safe seats. Even though the schedule was 
dropped in committee, the arrogant attempt to create safe seats 
shows that the Liberals are running scared. They know what is 
going to happen to them in the next election.
<P>
	Whatever happened to the red book promise to govern with 
integrity? We all know the Liberal red book's title ``Creating 
Opportunity'' and what that stands for. Unfortunately the 
Liberals left out the subtitle: ``for deception, hypocrisy and 
greed''.
<P>
	During committee and at report stage the Reform Party 
offered a number of amendments to the government which could 
have salvaged the bill. The government could have succeeded in 
making the bill workable and productive. It could have 
succeeded in making this bill worthwhile for the taxpayers. 
However, the constructive amendments were rejected by the 
government.
<P>
	Bill C-69 then went to the Senate where a number of our 
concerns were again raised. It was returned to the House from 
the Senate with a number of constructive amendments. For 
example, the Senate amendment to reduce the allowable size of 
deviation from a provincial electoral quota of 25 per cent to 15 
per cent is well worth supporting and has been raised a number 
of times by the Reform Party.
<P>
	A deviation of 25 per cent is totally unacceptable to 
Canadians. The creation of ridings which could actually vary by 
50 per cent is not only unfair but is undemocratic as well. A 15 
per cent deviation would promote the equality of vote for each 
Canadian while at the same time allowing the boundary 
commissioners sufficient flexibility when drawing up new 
boundaries. Despite the constructive amendments offered by the 
Senate, this piece of legislation will still be lacking.
<P>
	Bill C-69 fails to address the supposed intent of the motion 
put to the procedure and House affairs committee which was to 
reduce or cap the number of ridings in Canada. The House of 
Commons will needlessly swell to a size taxpayers need not and 
should not support. At a time when it is urgent to cut the fat and 
bloat we see everywhere in government, there is absolutely no 
excuse for putting forth legislation which would make the House 
grow. This is not in tune with the people of Canada or the 
finances of the country.
<P>
	It is appropriate to remind hon. members opposite that 
Premier elect Mike Harris handily defeated the Liberal Party in 
part because he promised to reduce the size of the Ontario 
legislature.
<P>
	This government could partly make amends to the people of 
Canada by letting this unnecessary and counterproductive 
legislation die. If nothing else, it would save the Canadian 
taxpayer $6 million. I urge all members to vote against Bill 
C-69.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have been sitting here listening to this debate for 
some time. I was interested in the comments offered up by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14285"> 14285 </A></B>
<P>
hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell and by the hon. 
member for Kingston and the Islands. Back in British Columbia 
we call some of the comments which were made symptoms of 
the Ottawa disease: no substance but a lot  of cheap political 
gamesmanship, and this from veterans in the House who could 
pursue much more productive avenues.
<P>
	The bill we are discussing tonight was not produced by all 
parties, as those members well know. We co-operated, which is 
our norm and we filed a dissenting report. We heard in typical 
style that this bill will be adopted. One of the problems with this 
House is that the results are a foregone conclusion when we see 
the stubbornness with which these bills are approached.
<P>
<B>(2210) </B>
<P>
	This is the fourth time I have spoken in public on Bill C-18, 
the forerunner to this bill, on Bill C-69 today and indeed on 
another occasion to the electoral boundaries commission in 
British Columbia. This dates back to February 9, 1994, March 
21, 1994, May 26, 1994 and again today.
<P>
	I must say that when members of the public ask me what is 
transpiring in terms of the whole electoral boundaries situation, 
there is a natural tendency to try to not talk about it because 
everything has become so complex, unravelled and intertwined. 
There is a great deal of uncertainty among everyone as to where 
we are going on these boundaries and when the changes, if there 
are going to be changes, will actually take place.
<P>
	It is important to dredge up the history behind all of this and 
why we stand here tonight in this circumstance. We have to 
explain a little bit of that history to understand what is going on 
here.
<P>
	One thing was of concern to me last year and is still very much 
at the forefront of my thoughts. The whole initiative to kill the 
electoral boundary redistribution process started in Ontario. It 
had got up a head of steam so that Bill C-18 was being drafted 
before British Columbians had even received their original 
electoral boundaries report to know where their proposed 
boundaries were.
<P>
	This is typical of how many regions of the country feel left out 
and manipulated by what goes on in Ontario or in central 
Canada. It is worth repeating that there is no necessity in this 
issue. It was not an issue in the campaign. It was not an issue 
after the campaign. It is not in the Liberal red book, the dead 
book.
<P>
	This bill continues to do one thing and one thing only. It 
responds to the desires of politicians to draw lines on a map. The 
Ontario MPs are trying to kill the boundary redistribution 
process. As I said before, they were trying to do that before the 
B.C. report was even out. This process has been in effect every 
decade since 1867 during the time of Confederation. It has been 
tied to the census. There was no public outcry. The outcry does 
not exist.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> There was in 1986, it was changed then.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Phone the electoral boundaries commissions 
that were in place at the time. Phone the chief electoral officer 
and ask him if there was a public outcry. There certainly was not. 
There is self-interest in this issue and that is what it is all about.
<P>
	What do I do to tell my constituents where we sit on this 
electoral boundary redistribution process? Confusion reigns 
supreme because of government actions. There is confusion 
over timing and confusion over the role of the Senate. There is 
uncertainty as always over when the election date is going to be 
and when these things are going to kick in.
<P>
<B>(2215 ) </B>
<P>
	Is the original motivation of government, of this 
administration, still the same today as it was last February? It is 
a good question; we do not know. When does government 
embarrassment kick in? I do not know if the government ever 
gets embarrassed. When does the government want to end the 
uncertainty? I thought that day would come sooner than it 
appears it will.
<P>
	Listening to the debates tonight one thing is very clear. What 
was a non-partisan exercise to realign constituency boundaries 
has already deteriorated into a partisan political exercise in 
Parliament. That is really not what we should intend.
<P>
	I hope we can separate the whole process at some point into 
boundary adjustments and the question of how many members 
there should be in the House. Those two issues became a part of 
this last exercise when in my view they should be quite separate. 
If we had left the original redistribution process the way it was 
and taken an all party committee to look at the number of 
members for the next exercise we would have been in very good 
shape.
<P>
	It may be two years from the next election. When will Bill 
C-69 ratification lead to a final resolution? I cannot answer that 
question and I do not think anyone else can at this point.
<P>
	This whole exercise has been political football and now the is 
government trying to save face by continuing this charade. It 
would have been better to drop it at this point. The government 
has wasted time, money and the goodwill of members to keep a 
few disgruntled government members happy.
<P>
	We have debated in numerous readings, we have gone to 
committee, we have had dissenting reports and now we have six 
Senate amendments before us and our constituents have lost the 
thread to this rapidly unravelling bad novel.
<P>
	I felt strongly in March 1994, as I did on February 9, 1994 
when once again I protested politicians' drawing lines on maps. 
I will talk about Amendment No. 1 the deviation quota. This 
amendment reduces the allowable size of deviation from a 
provincial electoral quota from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. 
Reform can support this amendment. From the outset we called 
for an allowable  maximum variance of 15 per cent to ensure the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14286"> 14286 </A></B>
<P>
primacy of the equality of voting power over sociological 
considerations.
<P>
	Elections Canada had reported 51 of the 295 existing ridings 
exceeded the current permissible population variances. 
Legitimate concerns were expressed by the Reform Party that 
this situation could be compounded in light of population shifts 
between redistributions. The bill still allows for deviations 
greater than 15 per cent in special circumstances.
<P>
	Amendment No. 2 deals with non-judicial commission 
members. When the bill was drafted this clause was probably 
left out in error. Adding the requirement for the two 
non-judicial commission members to be resident in the 
province for which the commission is established does make 
sense; who better to monitor and recommend boundary changes 
than those from the province concerned? The Reform Party can 
support this amendment but overall does it really improve the 
bill? Does it really change or improve the existing process 
enough to warrant discarding the redistribution process that is 
almost complete?
<P>
<B>(2220) </B>
<P>
	Amendment No. 3, the 20-member factor to challenge the 
Speaker's appointments to the boundary commissions, is an 
indefensible amendment in our view and we oppose it. These 
appointments are not under parliamentary rules a ruling by the 
Speaker. It may cause the Speaker a little embarrassment but 
little else. It hardly can be construed as a non-confidence 
motion in the Chair. It is turf protecting and is adding a political 
element to a supposed non-partisan apolitical function.
<P>
	The Senate amendment does not take the House of Commons 
dynamic into account. The Reform Party views the ability to 
challenge appointments as an improvement over the current 
process when the Speaker's appointments cannot be challenged 
and therefore can be influenced by government.
<P>
	If we could have maintained this challenge option, I dare say 
before appointments were made the Speaker would surely have 
consulted with all parties in the House.
<P>
	Amendment No. 4 is a trigger based on population shifts. This 
Senate amendment eliminates the use of a trigger based on 
population shifts to determine whether a boundary commission 
must be established in a province. We oppose this amendment.
<P>
	Already under Bill C-69 the Speaker and the chief electoral 
officer can order a redistribution where one has not been 
automatically triggered. To say the least, this elimination of a 
trigger is perplexing. The trigger is largely a cost saving 
measure and it is estimated the cost savings are substantial.
<P>
	Some may argue there could be challenges to this section 
under section 15 of the charter surrounding the quality element. 
We view this as extremely remote because the Constitution 
requires only an interprovincial deccenial redistribution, thus 
the prevention of an intraprovincial redistribution would not 
contravene section 51 of the Constitution. To me this is good 
grounds not to eliminate the trigger.
<P>
	Senate Amendment No. 5 deals with eliminating the provision 
that a commission will only recommend changes to existing 
electoral district boundaries where the factors set out are 
significant enough to warrant such a recommendation.
<P>
	The original intent of this provision was designed to 
encourage the commission to give greater consideration to 
existing boundaries. We can support this amendment because 
for all intents and purposes existing or traditional boundaries of 
electoral districts are also included for the commission's 
consideration in the current definition of community of interest.
<P>
	Amendment No. 6 deals with redefinition of community of 
interest. Reform is opposed to this amendment because it calls 
for a redefinition of community of interest using the Lortie 
commission's definition.
<P>
	Community of interest according to clause 19 would include 
such factors as the economy, existing or traditional boundaries 
of electoral districts, urban or rural characteristics of a territory, 
boundaries of municipalities and Indian reserves, natural 
boundaries and access to means of communication and 
transport.
<P>
	I ask why clause 19(4) currently contained in Bill C-69 is so 
offensive. It is clear and gives clear direction to the boundary 
commissions. While the Senate's proposed definition is 
consistent with the recent Supreme Court decision, the 
procedure and House affairs committee considered and rejected 
this definition because it turns redistribution into an affirmative 
action process.
<P>
	This is not in keeping with the process that has been in place 
since Confederation. We oppose this amendment also and that 
concludes my remarks on this bill.
<P>
<B>(2225) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, at this rather late hour we are debating a bill that is 
purely technical. I wonder whether people who may still be 
listening would appreciate some information on the present 
proceedings. There are not many of us here but that is not the 
point.
<P>
	We are discussing Bill C-69, which provides for the 
establishment of electoral boundaries commissions. The bill is 
of particular interest to Quebecers and in fact to all Canadians, 
as we saw in the course of the debate this evening.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14287"> 14287 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill is of particular interest to people in Quebec because 
at the report stage, we proposed an amendment that would 
guarantee Quebec 25 per cent of the seats in the House of 
Commons. This amendment was voted on and defeated.
<P>
	When we first arrived in the House of Commons, we voted on 
a bill, C-18, which suspended the proceedings of the 
commission which had started to review the electoral districts 
under the legislation then in effect, on the basis of the 1991 
census.
<P>
	We went through the whole procedure to pass this legislation, 
and now we have Bill C-69 which must be approved before 
tomorrow midnight, if the new legislation is to come into force. 
In this area, as in so many others, as we saw recently in the case 
of the CRTC and satellite television, we may end up with a new 
legal debate.
<P>
	If Bill C-18 is once again in effect on June 22 because the bill 
before the House today has not been passed by the Senate, 
according to the parliamentary House Leader who has his own 
interpretation of the facts, we will have a problem because we 
will have to find out which legislation will be in effect on June 
26: the one that was in effect before or the new legislation, when 
it is passed by the Senate? That is a legal argument we can look 
forward to.
<P>
	What is difficult to understand in this process is the 
government's agenda. The bill was tabled, and we worked 
together on this bill, as the government's chief whip pointed out. 
In fact, the hon. member for Bellechasse contributed his 
expertise to make this bill as good as it could be.
<P>
	But in the end, we had to vote against the bill, unwillingly, but 
the government refused to concede on one thing we considered 
essential: the guarantee of 25 per cent of the seats.
<P>
	The bill went to the Senate. The senators are appointed, not 
elected. They come from the regions. They met and tried to find 
something that could be changed in the bill, with the good 
intention, no doubt, of improving it. When we look at some of 
the amendments from the Senate, we wonder how these people, 
who in principle are supposed to represent the various regions in 
Canada, could propose an amendment like the one to change the 
variation in the quota from 25 per cent to 15 per cent.
<P>
	To put this in concrete terms, suppose there was an average of 
100,000 voters in Quebec ridings, the bill provides that the 
number could grow to 125,000 or drop to 75,000 in a riding 
because the variation can go 25 per cent either way.
<P>
<B>(2230) </B>
<P>
	The Senate, for its part, suggested that this quota should be 
reduced from 25 to 15 per cent. As you can well understand, 
such an approach could not have been worse for regional 
representation. This bill came back  from the Senate with six 
amendments. At first, the government said, ``We will accept the 
one amendment that makes sense''. An amendment to the 
amendment was moved by our Reform colleagues, who 
suggested that we approve a few others. But as far as the 
substance of this debate is concerned, what is really interesting 
to us, the people of Quebec, is that the message is very clear. 
When they were in opposition, government members were the 
first to demand 25 per cent representation for Quebec and to 
express a willingness to guarantee such an outcome.
<P>
	The statements made by the hon. member for 
Papineau-Saint-Michel, who insisted that Quebec should be 
guaranteed 25 per cent of seats, are still fresh in our memory. 
This is not the first time we point out that, when they were in 
opposition, the Liberals advocated policies that were sometimes 
very innovative in my opinion. However, now that they are in 
power, they repeat the speeches made by those they used to 
criticize when in opposition, and it could even be said that, in 
some regards, they are going much further than the Tories would 
have gone.
<P>
	To us, the message is crystal clear: Quebec no longer has its 
place in Canada. What they want is to turn Quebec into a 
minority as quickly as possible, to reduce its representation as 
much as possible, and they are not even interested in saying that 
they want to keep Quebec in Canada. They are telling Quebec 
that 25 per cent is too much. They will reduce its representation 
as much as possible; they could not care less if some day Quebec 
ends up with only 5 per cent representation.
<P>
	In the end, the clear message from the government is that 
Quebec is not welcome and that it can go on with its plans. On 
the eve of the referendum, when we see that the government is 
unable to send us a clear message, as our colleague from Mercier 
reminded us, we may well ask ourselves where this is taking us. 
If we look at what happened in history, I remember that the 
Prime Minister recently stated that, ``If we continue like this, 
the sovereignists will want to keep the name of our country, 
Canada, for themselves''. Rest assured that you can keep that 
name, even though you took it from us, as Canada first came into 
being in Quebec.
<P>
	At the very beginning, before Quebec took its name, it used to 
be called Canada. So, you took our name. You stole it away and 
said: ``We will turn it into a great country from coast to coast''. 
Both my colleagues from Bellechasse and Mercier made 
historical reviews, saying that, while it may not be fun to hear 
historical reviews in this House, we need to be reminded that 
Quebec is a founding people. We were here first. You came 200 
years later. My ancestors were here before the British conquest. 
This gives me a sense of belonging to this land. We first settled 
in the province of Quebec, which was known at the time as 
Canada. When Upper and Lower Canada were created, we were 
on equal footing as two founding people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14288"> 14288 </A></B>
<P>
	Did you know that this is what we would like to return to, 
because the only way for us to continue to develop on this land is 
by restoring somehow the balance that used to exist between 
Upper and Lower Canada in numerical terms. These were two 
distinct entities and one could not legislate for the other. They 
settled their problems between themselves and even had the 
decency to pay their debts. Debts were released and we started 
over with a clean slate. Realizing that this did not work so well 
and learning from this experience, another step was taken in 
1867. And what we want to do now is basically the same thing: 
have two equal people who recognize and respect each other as 
such, two founding people. It is obvious that within Canada, 
there are two nations: the Quebec nation and the nation of 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(2235) </B>
<P>
	So, let us have two separate countries. Then we can talk about 
an economic and political union. After all, we will have things to 
manage together in the process of starting from scratch again so 
that you can have your country and run it as you wish. Never 
again will you have to wonder what we want, since we will have 
gone with all we wanted, and that is a country. That is what we 
want.
<P>
	Eventually, discussions would be bound to be held to sort 
things out because to us it is very important, as a founding 
people, to be able to deal with you on an equal footing.
<P>
	You took the name; keep it, it is yours. Not everyone knows 
this, but you also took the national anthem from us, lyrics and 
music. That is right, both the lyrics and the music are from 
francophone Quebecers.
<P>
	There are people in Canada who are not aware of this 
important fact. When Canada adopted the national anthem, one 
of longest debates in the history of this House, the problem was 
to agree on an English version of the ``O Canada''. It made for 
very stormy debates. If there had been television back in those 
days, we could watch how low members quibbled over how the 
original ``O Canada'' should be translated into English.
<P>
	People can even be found who think that we are responsible 
for changing the words to the national anthem, when 
translations were in fact adopted following these events. It is 
obvious that the small favour we were asking was the assurance 
that we would continue to carry a reasonable political weight, as 
a form of recognition for all we had done for Canada. Do not 
think, however, that we came here and did nothing for the 
country. We helped build this country, we helped give it a top 
notch image, a respectable image in the eyes of the international 
community; we have contributed at least 25 per cent towards its 
development, because we represent 25 per cent of the 
population. But, at one point, we made up at least 50 per cent of 
the population of Canada.
<P>
	If policies which were fair towards both founding countries 
had been adopted, if a dominant approach had not been taken in 
order to crush us, under Lord Durham's policy for example, we 
would not be where we are today. We would have been two 
peoples who could have grown in ways we wanted to grow and 
could have carved out the niches we wanted.
<P>
	Therefore, our demand for 25 per cent representation was 
entirely legitimate. Our demand was supported by a very, very 
large consensus among politicians in Quebec.
<P>
	It is safe to say, for example, that the Liberals from Quebec 
who were in the House in 1992 and who are still in the House 
today, want Quebec to be guaranteed 25 per cent of 
representation. Therefore, if we add these Liberals, who are 
government members, to the Bloc members, who are on this side 
of the House, and to the Quebec Liberals, because, do not forget 
that the leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, 
Daniel Johnston, tabled the following motion: ``That the 
National Assembly of Quebec reiterate its goal of maintaining 
Quebec's representation at at least 25 per cent in the House of 
Commons of Canada, and that it ask the Government of Quebec 
to make representations to this effect''. A federalist, a Liberal, 
Daniel Johnston, the leader of the opposition to the Government 
of Quebec, asked the Government of Quebec to make such 
representations to the Canadian government.
<P>
	So we can say that all the elected representatives of the people 
of Quebec, all the representatives of Quebec, in Quebec and 
Ottawa, came to bring this message to Canadians who also 
represent the people, asking them to grant us this representation 
of 25 per cent. It was denied. For us, as the hon. member for 
Mercier said, it was a very sad day.
<P>
<B>(2240) </B>
<P>
	This bill is going to the Senate, to the other place. Personally, 
I hope the senators do not intend to sit tomorrow or, if they do, 
that they will take a long time to discuss the bill so it will not be 
passed in time to supersede Bill C-18 which was passed last 
year. That is the sad part for Canada, because the referendum 
will be held this fall and we still do not know what the 
democratic choice of Quebecers will be. So no gesture was made 
to Quebec.
<P>
	In a way, as a sovereignist, I am delighted. I will be able to 
travel all over my riding all summer, and at all the political 
meetings I attend during the referendum campaign, I will be able 
to tell Quebecers that Canada does not want us. Canada is not 
willing to make any concessions. Canada is not making any 
gestures.
<P>
	I think Quebecers will realize there is no future in Canada for 
us and that we could never develop our potential in this country. 
We were here first. We want to see a gesture of openness, of 
sympathy for a people and a nation you say you want to keep in 
this country. It seems to me that if the government wanted to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14289"> 14289 </A></B>
<P>
show that it  loves Quebec, it should have realized long ago that 
what we wanted was a guarantee of 25 per cent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak in the debate tonight, but while we see this 
place going round and round, let me interject this. In the real 
world New Jersey has just scored and it is two to two with about 
three and a half minutes left in the game, so stay tuned.
<P>
	We are tied up in a ridiculous wrangle about changing 
electoral boundaries. This has been going on for some time now. 
In 1993 when the former government set up the electoral 
boundaries commissions, as governments have done for many 
years, the process kicked into place. It was during the 1993 
election campaign that the commissioners started their work. 
When they came out with the maps a year ago last spring, the 
present government was very displeased with them and Bill 
C-18 was put in place.
<P>
	The question which anyone would ask is: Why was Bill C-18 
initiated in the first place? We would not be here today debating 
Bill C-69 if Bill C-18 had not been brought forward.
<P>
	The process was proceeding without government 
interference. The commissioners were chosen, the maps were 
being redrawn and people were attending the public hearings. 
That process was being carried out by the electoral boundaries 
commissions. It was fair and democratic and there was no basis 
for suspending it whatsoever at considerable cost to the 
taxpayer. This whole exercise has cost millions of dollars.
<P>
	Last spring, a year and a bit ago, shortly after the independent 
commissions reported their findings and were preparing public 
hearings on the boundary changes, the present government 
blatantly interfered with the democratic process. Of course 
government members would argue tonight that they did nothing 
of the kind.
<P>
	However, the maps were drawn by the original commissions 
after the 1991 census. Those people said: ``Here is our best shot 
at it''. Maybe they were not perfect. Who knows what the 
community of interest and all these other geographic and 
psychological boundaries are. However, the government said: 
``Wait a minute'', and blatantly interfered with the process.
<P>
	I am sure the government was under pressure from many new 
Liberal MPs who were not pleased with the new electoral maps, 
particularly where boundary revisions transferred blocks of 
voters from one riding to another. Nothing to me is sadder than a 
self-serving politician saying, ``Wait a minute. That is my 
strong area that you are taking and you had better not do that''. 
Territorialism is probably the most frightening thing that could 
happen in the Chamber, when someone says: ``This is my 
ground. This is my territory,'' and as we say in Beaver River, 
``Keep your mud hooks off it''. That kind of attitude is 
something that is becoming more and more prevalent, certainly 
not just with Bill C-69 but  with a government, as we have seen 
in the last 10 days, that has said we know what is best for you and 
you just like it or lump it. Unfortunately, many of the members 
who are speaking up are going to have to lump it, and that is very 
unfortunate.
<P>
<B>(2245) </B>
<P>
	In the guise of opening the redistribution process for 
fundamental review the government scrapped the maps 
produced by the provincial boundary commissions and 
introduced Bill C-18, which suspended the whole operation.
<P>
	I just did my spring tour in my riding. People asked me, where 
is this anyway? Is it cancelled? Is it going forward? Are the 
maps good? Are they no good? What is happening? I tried to 
explain to them that the government actually put this process on 
ice for exactly one year and now it is coming up with other 
legislation and if it does not get royal assent by the magic day of 
June 22, which is about 48 hours from now, then that whole 
process that we wasted all this time and money on, Bill C-69, 
gets scrapped and we go back to the original.
<P>
	If anything is confusing for us, it is that process. How in the 
world are we supposed to tell people across the country the facts 
and the figures and what actually is going on? It is just 
absolutely ludicrous.
<P>
	These commissioners last spring were told ``You're on ice''. 
You know that feeling, Mr. Speaker. ``You're on ice. Hang on to 
it for a year and we will let you know next June 22 if your work is 
going to be of any use or not.'' It is ridiculous. Those 
commissioners felt disappointed, they felt disillusioned. They 
thought: ``What about all this work? I was being paid good 
money for my work.'' It just seems as though it was all for 
nought.
<P>
	Many of the witnesses who came in good faith and drove 
miles in our rural ridings thought the process was going 
somewhere, that they were really participating in democracy, 
only to be told, ``Sorry, that's on ice. We'll let you know next 
June 22 if anything in fact is going to happen.''
<P>
	Following a one-day debate in the House of Commons the 
government imposed that ``the question be now put'', thereby 
suppressing any further debate and smothering democracy one 
more time. Here we are today, the democratic process again 
being thwarted.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you and I sat in the last Parliament and watched 
government members then, the Conservatives, bringing in time 
allocation and sometimes they got really scandalous and just 
brought in actual closure, and my friend from Kingston and the 
Islands said that it was ``scandalous'' and of course ``rubbish'' 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14290"> 14290 </A></B>
<P>
and finally he said ``This is morally wicked for a government to 
do this''.
<P>
	What in the world is the difference between this side and three 
sword lengths across the aisle? It is three big steps. What ever 
happens to the psyche that goes from here, saying it is morally 
wicked, to all of a sudden on that side saying ``We are 
government and we do have things that we need to get through 
for the Canadian public''?
<P>
	I do not see any benefit to the Canadian public in this bill, 
quite frankly. What I see are self-serving politicians who say 
``We want it this way because I'll keep my good polls and you 
can give the lousy polls that don't support me very much to 
somebody else''.
<P>
	This process has gone on for a year. Last July these 
committees sat during the summer recess. They heard witnesses. 
It has just been chatted among us here and it is unanimous; you 
may find it surprising, but we decided that this whole exercise 
has been pointless. Frankly, there has been no positive outcome 
on it for anybody. I do not think these MPs are going to be a 
whole lot better off in the next election, regardless of what their 
boundaries are, if they keep behaving this way. It will not matter 
what the boundaries are, folks. It will not matter what the 
boundaries are one bit if people are disgusted and they say ``You 
in your lofty positions on Parliament Hill, if you don't listen to 
us, you will go the same way the Conservative Party went in 
1993''. And no member in this House should think they will not 
do it. They did it in 1993 and they are prepared to do it again in 
1997, with every opportunity that they see for this arrogant 
behaviour, keeping people here until all hours of the night, 
ramming legislation through 48 hours before it is actually due.
<P>
	It has been a total waste of time. It has kept people flying back 
and forth to Ottawa. It has been an incredible waste of money. It 
has taken so long to do. This partisan manoeuvring and 
meddling are why we are here tonight to debate this bill.
<P>
	The odd person is snorting across the aisle. I suppose that is 
fine for them. What they are forgetting is that there are real 
voters out there. We are not just talking about people in the 
Chamber and then all the rest of the people out there. People are 
not dumb. After the Charlottetown accord, which I have 
mentioned so many times in here, people are not going to put up 
with this kind of nonsense from politicians any longer. It is as 
simple as that.
<P>
<B>(2250) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-69 will go the way of the dodo bird for all those people 
who are running on these new boundaries that are supposed to be 
sacrosanct and supposed to save their seats. SOS-``save our 
seats''-is what this government is talking about. It is not going 
to happen.
<P>
	This is blatant interference in what is supposed to be a 
democratic and non-partisan process. If ever I have seen 
anything that is partisan, it is certainly to say: ``We know what is 
best for you. Father knows best. The House leader, the whip, the 
Prime Minister know what is best for you''. It is interference. 
And Mr. Speaker, you know better than any of us in this 
Chamber that when there is interference there ought to be a 
penalty, for sure.
<P>
	My guess as to why the electoral boundaries readjustment 
process was suspended is that the Liberals did not like some of 
the results in the last federal election. If we look at the numbers, 
not the theory, it is interesting what happened, especially in 
Ontario. While we are here in the province of Ontario tonight, 
we might as well have a look at some of those results. My friend 
from Ontario would be interested.
<P>
	The Reform Party came second in 57 out of the 99 ridings. My 
friend from Broadview-Greenwood knows that. He has 
probably also added up that in 25 of those ridings the PC and 
Reform vote combined would have defeated the Liberal vote. 
That is rather interesting. That starts getting into the actual 
numbers of this and the hidden reason why so many people are 
demanding that their ridings become safe.
<P>
	Across the country the combined PC and Reform vote 
defeated the Liberal vote in about 100 ridings. If you add that up 
you realize that only 130 Liberals would have been elected. That 
would have been a minority government.
<P>
	If it comes to another vote in 1997, I could refer my friends to 
the corner over there, where the former government, for the first 
time in Canadian history, was totally obliterated. That may well 
happen again.
<P>
	It has often been said that the Reform Party would split the 
vote. Of course nothing could be further from the truth, because 
those people are going to go for absolute, fundamental change 
and democratization of this system, regardless of what my 
friends in the governing party would say. This is democracy. It is 
wonderful.
<P>
	Closure is okay now that the Liberals are government, making 
sure that their backbenchers fall into line or their nomination 
papers will not be signed. That is the kind of behaviour people 
are sick of and do not want to see any more.
<P>
	The Reform Party has managed to get some improvements to 
the redistribution process. The selection of boundary 
commissioners is less partisan and subject to more public 
scrutiny. That is a wonderful thing. That is a good move with 
some of these amendments.
<P>
	Under the changes that have been made, the role of MPs and 
the redistribution process has been greatly reduced. As far as I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14291"> 14291 </A></B>
<P>
am concerned, nothing is better than politicians' hands being 
pulled out of any of these processes. There is nothing better than 
politicians being yanked back from the process and not being 
able to take part in it quite so self-servedly.
<P>
	In provinces where significant population change has 
occurred, the possibility of a five-year redistribution now exists 
rather than ten years. I know my friend from York North has an 
incredible population explosion. It seems wrong that he would 
have to wait for ten years. There is also my friend from 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley. The population in the 
riding she represents is incredible. To be able to do that on a 
five-year span rather than ten years is probably really good.
<P>
	Reform also pushed for a cap or a reduction in the number of 
seats in the House of Commons. The Liberals rejected it at every 
stage totally out of hand. As a result, this House will 
immediately increase to 301 seats and continue to increase in the 
future.
<P>
	I ask anybody sitting in this Chamber tonight or watching on 
TV, if they are not watching the hockey game, does this country 
need more politicians?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Liberals, yes.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> The answer is fairly clear, because there is a 
direct correlation to the amount of noise on the government side 
to the question.
<P>
	If Bill C-69 receives royal assent by June 22, just 48 hours 
from now, after tomorrow we celebrate the longest day of the 
year, and nobody knows other than the people who sit in this 
Chamber how long these days are getting.
<P>
	If it gets at the new redistribution process, we will begin all 
over again. We are going to start this dance again. Because of the 
government's interference in the democratic process, here we 
are almost two years later back to square one. Because of the 
time the electoral boundaries readjustment process takes, the 
new boundaries will not even be known until shortly before the 
next election.
<P>
<B>(2255) </B>
<P>
	With this process in place, we will have new ridings and new 
riding associations. The question of course is where is the 
money going to be split up between this riding and that riding? 
How are they going to break up the bank accounts? Who is going 
to run for nominations in these ridings? The answer: ``Your 
guess is as good as mine''. That is ridiculous. You cannot be 
prepared for an election, move ahead for an election, and 
nominate candidates if you do not know the boundaries until just 
a couple of months before the election is called.
<P>
	This is the government that said it was going to restore 
honesty and integrity to our political institutions. Canadians are 
still waiting for that restoration of integrity. They are still 
waiting for some of those promises in the red book to be 
fulfilled. They are not waiting for a government that is going to 
start ramming through time allocation, closure, and the attitude 
of we know better than everybody else does. We have seen that 
in this House, and we are going to see it again in 1997 if this 
government does not get its act together, get these  things on 
their way, and quit wasting time and money. The people who are 
paying the bills are disgusted with it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going to 
probably have little time beyond giving my introduction, but I 
do want to say something with respect to boundary reallocation.
<P>
	What we are talking about is how many MPs we send to this 
House, where they come from, what region they represent and 
what their constituencies are. It reminds me of a story I read a 
long time ago entitled ``How Much Land Does a Man Really 
Need?'' It was a story about a man who, in almost a crusade, 
spent his whole life amassing land. At the end of the story he 
died and it was found that the amount of land he really needed 
was a plot of about two feet by six feet.
<P>
	I asked myself the question: How many MPs are really needed 
in this place? I have come to the conclusion that we need 20 
MPs. Those 20 would all be cabinet ministers. They would 
decide what is done and the rest would be redundant. Members 
may say that does not sound very good, but that is really the way 
it is right now.
<P>
	This is a government that promised more involvement for 
members of Parliament. It is a government that promised more 
meaningful work in committees. I have observed what happens 
in committees. During the beginning we had some really good 
debates, good honest give and take and some true negotiations. 
However, when we came to the place where we were actually 
voting on the clause by clause, these poor members from the 
government side all came in with their little sheets of paper and 
were told what to do. Even though prior to that I know from the 
way they responded that I had persuaded a number of them on 
different issues, they voted against them. When I asked several 
of them why, they said ``Well, we don't really have a choice''. 
That is deplorable.
<P>
	If that is the way this government is going to work and that is 
the meaning of more MP involvement then this whole exercise is 
really an exercise in waste. Why should we even consider 
increasing the number of members of Parliament from 295 to 
301 when most of the members here are redundant in any case?
<P>
	Added to that is the fact that we are also limited in the debate. 
As a member of Parliament representing Elk Island, the only 
way I can represent them and have their wishes influence the 
decisions of government is through debate. When I debate I put 
out my best arguments. I try to persuade the other members to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14292"> 14292 </A></B>
<P>
my point of view. We actually experienced this in one of the 
committees in which I participated, where there was a closure 
right in committee and we were not permitted to debate. Even if 
I were able to debate and persuade, if members are not given the 
freedom to represent their constituents, as is the practice with 
this present government, there is no point in having them.
<P>
<B>(2300 ) </B>
<P>
	My conclusion is very simple: The move of this government 
to increase the number of members of Parliament is truly an ill 
conceived notion. It is one that should not even be thought of 
until it is decided that members of Parliament will be allowed to 
truly represent their constituents. How deplorable of the Prime 
Minister to praise the members of Parliament who defied their 
constituents, who went against what even they believed, by 
saying to them it was wonderful that they put that aside in order 
to keep party unity.
<P>
	This Parliament needs true representation of the wishes of the 
people. If we had true free votes then surely there would be 
meaningful give and take, meaningful debate, meaningful 
negotiations on different points. We would eliminate and we 
would amend those clauses of bills which were undesirable. We 
would pass bills in amended form which would be good for the 
country.
<P>
	The way it is right now we end up with the lowest common 
denominator. It is forced on us. We have absolutely no say in the 
matter. I am speaking now of the Liberal backbenchers who are 
not permitted to vote according to their consciences and 
according to the wishes of their constituents. We need to 
redefine the way Parliament works.
<P>
	The Senate has sent Bill C-69 back. Of course we have a little 
bit of a problem with the Senate because it is not elected, but the 
Senate has in sober second thought come back with some 
amendments to the bill, some of which we actually support.
<P>
	This country has the potential for the best government 
possible. If only we would in honesty and in clarity do away with 
those aspects of our democracy that do not function properly. 
We could replace them with a true representative democracy, 
one in which we acknowledge that democracy works best when 
the wishes of the majority are considered, when the common 
sense of the common people by majority vote is brought into this 
place, where each of us as members of Parliament can represent 
that. If we find a consensus among the Canadian people for the 
views that are being put forward because we represent them, 
then certainly Canadians will continue to have a high regard for 
law and order which we so desire.
<P>
	A basic fundamental aspect of democracy is the willingness 
of the governed to be governed. We are going to lose that if we 
practise the arrogance of the kind of government we are 
experiencing here where a small group of people simply impose 
their wishes on everyone else by cutting off debate, not allowing 
free votes, controlling and inhibiting the freedom of members of 
Parliament. It is time that we clarified this. We must indicate to 
the Canadian people that we are ready to make the needed 
changes. This is urgent. Really urgent.
<P>
	For example, while we are going down the tube at the rate of 
$110 million a day, more and more people are no longer willing 
to participate in the tax process. Why is that? Because the GST 
was rammed through without the majority will of the people. It 
was rammed through using exactly the same system which is 
being used here tonight. Because of that we are losing between 
$7 billion and $10 billion a year, and some estimate up to $40 
billion to $50 billion per year, in unpaid taxes. People are saying 
that if this government rams things through that the majority 
does not concur with, they just will not concur in practice. That 
is exactly what is happening.
<P>
	We see the same thing in the justice system. Rules are being 
passed that do not bear the majority of Canadian support. 
Consequently there is no reflection in the laws of what the 
people support. There is a reduced respect for it and this country 
has an increasing amount of lawlessness and crime.
<P>
<B>(2305) </B>
<P>
	The government got elected on its word that it would restore 
integrity, give more meaningful work to members of 
Parliament, and increase the importance of committees. The 
government having been elected on those words is missing a 
great opportunity by not delivering on them. It is a terrible thing 
that the government is thumbing its nose at the people of Canada 
by engaging in these practices.
<P>
	I am appalled at the fact that the government persists in doing 
things like pushing this bill through for purely political reasons. 
There is no excuse that would warrant changing the political 
boundaries simply because after the process had started, a 
number of members felt they were being threatened.
<P>
	If we wanted to do the honourable thing, we would say that 
perhaps there is a problem. In order to provide for continuity and 
stability in the political process, we would simply begin our 
work and the rules which are presently in place would stay there 
until the next election in order to remove the political 
motivation from the process.
<P>
	This is a tremendously important era we are embarking on. 
The government talks about representing the people. It comes up 
with that theme so often. Members of Parliament are saying that 
if they have 25 per cent more in their ridings they will be unable 
to represent them properly. With all due regard, those are empty 
words from members of Parliament who persist in ignoring the 
wishes of the very constituents they are concerned about. We 
need to be honest about this. We need to do what we are sent here 
to do, which is to represent our constituents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14293"> 14293 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to the bill before us, we would do well to give it 
some serious second thought. We would do very well to think 
soberly and carefully about the ramifications of it. With all of 
the push and rush of the last few days I am not sure that we are 
making good decisions.
<P>
	I cannot believe that raking members of Parliament over the 
coals as we have been doing for 14 hours a day yields any good 
thought. It does not give us the best ability to think clearly. 
Putting through bills such as the MPs pension plan without 
looking at the long term effects of it and ramming through other 
bills such as Bill C-41 and Bill C-68 have tremendous 
implications to our population.
<P>
	The government rams this through by saying: ``We are only 
going to talk for so many hours and then we are going to vote. 
You are going to vote the way you are told. We are the majority. 
We will get it through''. That is not the way to provide good 
democracy and good decision making.
<P>
	Many members of this 35th Parliament will look back. They 
will then recognize how grave the errors were because of the 
lack of thought and the lack of integrity in the democratic 
process. There is no adequate debate, no freedom to vote, so 
what can we expect?
<P>
<B>(2310 ) </B>
<P>
	The only thing I can do as a member of Parliament is to try to 
persuade. In most of the committees on which I sat there were 
two and sometimes four opposition members, but there were 
always more government members. If I wanted to get my point 
of view across to influence a change in the legislation we were 
contemplating I had to persuade.
<P>
	I challenge government members to be brave, to stand up for 
what is right and to put aside the years and years, almost a 
century of a tradition which is taking us down the wrong road. I 
challenge members of the Liberal Party, who in majority can do 
whatever they want, to think independently in terms of what is 
good for their constituents and what is good for Canada. Without 
disrespect to their leader they should simply say: ``I stand on a 
high principle. I will do what I know is right''. I am sure that if 
members of Parliament from whatever party followed that 
principle they would be applauded by the people who really 
matter, the people who elected them.
<P>
	On the other hand, I would probably be better off politically 
speaking if I were to encourage Liberal members to continue to 
do what they are doing. The more they do that the more cynical 
Canadians will become and the more seriously they will think 
about alternatives. Canadians had it up to here with the 
Conservatives because of their arrogance. If we continue to have 
this kind of behaviour from the Liberal government Canadians 
will be more likely to look at an alternative in terms of a true 
democratic system which will represent them.
<P>
	I also want to say a few words to Bloc members and to the 
Quebec members of the Liberal Party. These days we are facing 
the challenge of having our country torn apart. A group of 
people is saying that Canada as it exists no longer works and that 
group wants out. Of course, they do not want to opt out of the 
pension plan; they want to opt out of Canada but not out of the 
pension plan. These people are saying that Canada does not 
work.
<P>
	It is an easy and simplistic response for the government to say 
that it is Quebec's problem. It would be much more honest to 
say: ``Let us look at what part of it is the Ottawa problem''. 
When will the federal government wake up to the fact that the 
people of Canada are tired of having somebody in distant Ottawa 
controlling every aspect of their lives? It is no wonder that some 
of them would come to that conclusion, although we disagree 
with it.
<P>
	All Canadians, not only the people in the west, or in Ontario 
and eastern Canada, but also the people of Quebec should be 
made an offer which says: ``Let us stay together in a democracy, 
in a federation which truly works because the people who come 
here to represent the constituencies are free to represent them''. 
If we were to practise that and if we were to go back to the 
principles of our Constitution, in which the members of 
Parliament represent their constituents and guard the rights of 
the provinces, we could all live together in harmony. We could 
all survive, look after our own domains and do so very 
efficiently. No one would be so disgruntled with the country that 
he or she would feel it necessary to leave.
<P>
	The electoral boundaries issue is but a symptom of a much 
larger problem. We need to look at what is causing the problem 
and correct that. It is in that area that we will maintain the unity 
of the country.
<P>
<B>(2315) </B>
<P>
	To all people in Quebec, and they may not have thought of this 
before, I urge all in la belle province, to consider what we say. 
We want to be one with them. We want to reconsider. We want to 
look again at the Constitution of the country. We want to build it 
in such a way that respect of all Canadian citizens is maintained 
and that all provinces can live in Confederation in unity and in 
harmony.
<P>
	This bill is very important. I urge members to vote against it 
so that it will die and we can look at this more seriously in a 
better way later.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 57, it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put

	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I was absent for the first vote, I 
would like my vote to be recorded for the next ones with the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The next question is on 
the main motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, if you were to seek it, I believe 
you would find unanimous consent for the members who voted 
on the previous motion to be recorded as having voted on the 
motion now before the House, with Liberal members voting yea.
<P>
	You will probably note as well, Mr. Speaker, that some 
members who were not here for the first vote may wish to rise to 
add their names to those who were here for the first vote.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Unanimous 
consent was sought and I do not give unanimous consent. I 
would like a recorded vote.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House did not give its 
unanimous consent.
<P>
	The question is on the main motion. Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those in favour of the 
motion will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In my opinion the yeas 
have it.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 425</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should support the 
undertaking of a country-wide program of improving the treatment of 
municipal sewage to a minimum standard of at least that of primary treatment 
facilities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to have the opportunity 
to speak to my motion before the House today.
<P>
	The motion deals with the need for the government to support 
the undertaking of a country-wide program of improving the 
treatment of municipal sewage to a minimum standard of at least 
that of primary sewage facilities. The motion is about setting a 
minimum standard right across Canada for sewage treatment.
<P>
	As Canadians we often take for granted the vastness and 
magnificence of our environment. As much as we struggle to 
balance environmental with industrial and economic concerns 
we hold our environment in high esteem.
<P>
<B>(2355 ) </B>
<P>
	Reform environmental policy supports the balance between 
environmental and economic concerns and encourages 
Canadians to develop, renew and conserve our resources and 
environment to ensure the next generation inherits an 
environment equal to or better than that which the last 
generation received.
<P>
	Essential to a clean and healthy environment are clean rivers, 
oceans and water bodies. When our water bodies are threatened 
with over pollution it hurts our environment, our fisheries, our 
economy, tourism, industry and municipal growth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14298"> 14298 </A></B>
<P>
	For these reasons municipal sewage facilities, set at a 
minimum level of primary treatment, are essential to 
maintaining and protecting our environment. That is why I am 
introducing the motion today.
<P>
	I will give some background on the state of sewage treatment 
in Canada today to illustrate why the motion is necessary.
<P>
	In most provinces the provincial government sets the standard 
for sewage treatment and for disposal of municipal solid waste 
and provides the regulatory function. Municipalities are 
responsible for the actual treatment of sewage and for collection 
and disposal of garbage. In 1993 approximately 57 per cent of 
Canadians were served by waste water treatment plants. That 
compares with 74 per cent for the Americans, 86 per cent for the 
Germans and over 90 per cent for the Swedes. We are obviously 
well behind.
<P>
	Many cities have lagoon facilities which provide minimum 
treatment. Waste water flows through the lagoon, allowing long 
residence times for the settling of solids and the microbial 
degradation of organic matter. This is basically a system where 
raw sewage, less the solids, is dumped directly into the ocean or 
water basin with no treatment. This is the system used in the city 
of Victoria as well as in Halifax. We have the problem on both 
coasts. I will discuss the objections to this system of dealing 
with sewage later on.
<P>
	Victoria is the only city from Alaska to the Mexican border 
which still dumps untreated sewage into the ocean.
<P>
	I will give a quick summary of the three types of sewage 
treatment which include primary, secondary and tertiary 
treatment facilities. Primary treatment, which I am calling for, 
is the most basic stage of sewage treatment and is the minimum 
level I propose in my motion. Primary treatment involves the 
settling and chlorination stage prior to effluent discharge.
<P>
	A more advanced stage of treatment is secondary treatment, 
which uses an activated sludge process to hasten the rate of 
waste water treatment. Large masses of actively growing 
bacteria are retained in large tanks and fed waste water. High 
levels of mixing and aeration facilitate microbial action.
<P>
	Treated water then goes through a settling stage to remove the 
micro organisms and is chlorinated prior to release to the 
receiving body of water. Edmonton, Fredericton, Hamilton and 
Winnipeg use this more advanced form of waste water treatment 
on the majority of their municipal sewage.
<P>
	Tertiary treatment is the most sophisticated form of water 
treatment practised in Canada. An anaerobic microbial 
fermentation step is added after the activated sludge process. 
The final effluent is relatively clean and in desert areas such as 
Israel is used directly for crop irrigation. Tertiary waste water 
treatment is used in Calgary, Kitchener, London, Oshawa, 
Ottawa, Regina, Sudbury and Toronto. In the maritime 
provinces a large  percentage of municipalities do not have any 
sewage treatment and tertiary treatment is virtually 
non-existent.
<P>
	The annual volume of untreated sewage in this country would 
cover the entire 7,800 kilometre Trans-Canada highway to a 
depth of nine metres. That is a lot of you know what, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	The effects of raw sewage dumping are being debated in cities 
such as Halifax and Victoria, which both discharge sewage into 
large water basins. In cities such as Regina, which dumps into 
small rivers, the effects are potentially disastrous. Sewage 
removes so much oxygen from the water that fish cannot survive 
and decomposing sewage may render the water undrinkable.
<P>
<B>(2400) </B>
<P>
	The government is in the process of major infrastructure 
spending with funds initially targeted for projects such as 
sewage treatment facilities, roads and water lines. Many towns 
and cities remain without any sewage treatment while tax 
dollars are being directed toward art centres and hockey rinks. 
Where are the priorities?
<P>
	The government has made some significant promises 
regarding sewage treatment facilities in the country. The Liberal 
red book states on pages 66 and 67:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One of the country's biggest sources of water degradation is untreated 
municipal sewage, aggravated by decades of neglect of sewage and water 
treatment infrastructure. A Liberal government would assist provincial, 
regional, and municipal governments to finance new or renewed municipal 
sewage and water treatment infrastructure. This federal commitment would be 
conditional on municipalities encouraging water conservation and developing a 
sound financial regime for infrastructure maintenance in the future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Federal assistance to municipalities for sewage treatment has 
been discussed in the House for over 25 years. In 1960 
amendments to the National Housing Act provided for federal 
aid for municipal sewage projects to be administered by the 
Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Up to two-thirds 
of the cost of projects would be lent by the federal government. 
Municipalities would have to repay only 75 per cent of the loan 
if sewage work was completed by 1963.
<P>
	The purpose of the 1960 legislation was to provide incentive 
to make an early start on these problems while it was still 
relatively inexpensive. Municipal sewage became an ongoing 
problem with annual allocations of $50 million to $75 million 
administered by the Canadian Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation.
<P>
	The system was put into place 25 years ago, yet today Canada 
remains with almost half of its residents without any sewage 
treatment whatsoever. Now costs have skyrocketed. The longer 
municipalities wait, the more expensive it will become.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14299"> 14299 </A></B>
<P>
	Despite efforts to date there are several reasons sewage 
remains untreated in many areas. One reason is Canada's large 
land mass and relatively low population which often mitigate 
the need for expensive, centralized sewage treatment facilities.
<P>
	Another reason for the low level of sewage treatment is that 
many Canadian communities located adjacent to oceans and 
large rivers discharge raw sewage directly into water bodies, as 
in some cases the solution is to simply dilute the sewage.
<P>
	In small amounts this may not harm the environment as 
organic matter can supply nutrition to aquatic organisms and 
benefit the fishery. However, once communities reach the 
municipal size, primary sewage treatment should be a 
requirement.
<P>
	If we do not encourage a minimum standard of primary 
sewage treatment we risk damage to the environment, tourism, 
recreation, fisheries and health. In large amounts raw sewage 
can devastate the area by drastically degrading water quality, 
limiting dissolved oxygen levels, harming marine life, polluting 
shorelines, removing areas from recreational use and 
endangering human health.
<P>
	The Liberal Party has recognized that a national waste water 
program exists and has pledged financial assistance to 
provincial, regional and municipal governments to finance new 
or renewed municipal sewage and water treatment 
infrastructure, but infrastucture spending is bypassing much 
needed sewer upgrades.
<P>
	For example, Halifax and Victoria are still without any 
sewage treatment while at the same time government spent over 
$12 million in infrastructure funds for improvements to the 
Olympic Saddledome in Calgary and a hockey rink in Winnipeg.
<P>
	In the big picture, basic infrastructure such as water and 
sewage treatment clearly has to take precedence. It is time for 
the government to renew its commitment to the public. 
Infrastructure spending should be targeted to local 
improvements which would benefit the entire community, not 
just a select few.
<P>
	Clearly the biggest problem is expense and we all know it. 
There is no doubt that sewage treatment upgrading will require 
additional funding. When we look at the environment, 
environmental costs must be weighed with economic costs. In 
many instances taking action will be far more economically 
beneficial than the costs of the long term environmental damage 
of doing nothing.
<P>
<B>(2405) </B>
<P>
	Effective municipal waste treatment facilities are an 
expensive proposition for any municipality as they involve the 
provision of basic infrastructure as well as treatment facilities.
<P>
	To counteract the cost, some cities such as the city of Toronto 
have proposed user pay fees on sewage discharge. That is one 
way to collect for the cost of  cleanup and upgrading. It is one of 
the many options that warrants consideration.
<P>
	In deciding which areas necessitate primary sewage treatment 
facilities, the environmental benefits of treatment must equal or 
outweigh the environmental costs. I am not proposing that all 
towns and cities undertake a program of primary treatment 
because there are many towns that are too small to benefit from 
sewage treatment programs.
<P>
	For example, towns with small populations often do not 
generate enough waste to necessitate sewage treatment 
facilities. My proposal applies only to the minimum standard of 
municipalities which by definition have a minimum population 
of 1,000 residents.
<P>
	Many studies have shown that secondary or tertiary forms of 
treatment are not necessary in all cases. In Victoria, for 
example, studies concluded that the treatment of waste water 
discharge into the strait would provide no appreciable health or 
environmental gain to the city or to the strait and that primary 
treatment was all that was necessary. That is what I am calling 
for in my motion.
<P>
	Provincial governments have known about the bio-hazard of 
municipal sewage for generations, but many choose to ignore 
the problem. Concerns with the volume of minimally treated 
waste water were first identified in 1975. Yet many 
municipalities routinely fail to comply with permits on the 
discharge of sewage from outfalls.
<P>
	The Fraser River is B.C.'s most endangered watershed with a 
sewage discharge amounting to 450 billion litres per year. If one 
were to package the sewage into one-litre milk cartons and pile 
them one on top of each other, a year's discharge would extend 
to the planet Mars and back with enough left over for 100 side 
trips to the moon. That is a lot of fertilizer.
<P>
	Federal fisheries scientist analysed discharges from the 
sewage outfall at Iona Island on the Fraser in 1985 and found 
200 toxic substances, many of them persistent and some with the 
ability to increase in concentration and toxicity as they migrate 
up the food chain.
<P>
	Other substances identified are associated with organ 
damage, birth defects, cancer and second or third generation 
reproductive collapse in both humans and wildlife. Obviously 
these substances simply cannot continue to be dumped into the 
Fraser. I am pleased to report that one of the larger infrastructure 
projects of the government involves upgrading the Fraser 
sewage treatment facility.
<P>
	A report by the World Wildlife Fund said sewage plants in 
Ontario and Quebec were receiving, along with billions of litres 
of waste water, about 100 tonnes of industrial metals and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14300"> 14300 </A></B>
<P>
chemicals each year. This discharge can cause serious damage to 
the ecosystem and contaminate drinking water.
<P>
	Provinces such as Ontario have been working on developing 
effluent quality standards for sewage plants but nothing 
concrete has developed to date. Six years ago the federal and 
Nova Scotia governments agreed to deal with the untreated 
sewage flowing directly into Halifax harbour. Concern was 
raised seven years ago that the lack of sewage treatment 
facilities in the harbour would have long term consequences on 
the fisheries and on growth and investment in the metropolitan 
area.
<P>
	Over 30 million gallons of untreated sewage enter Halifax 
harbour waters every day, with close to 20 per cent of this inflow 
classified as industrial in origin. This has resulted in 
documented levels of toxic contamination of the harbour waters.
<P>
	This sewage and waste dumping into Halifax harbour present 
health hazards on top of the aesthetic problems with the harbour 
mired in sewage. The Nova Scotia government and Canada 
entered into an agreement in September 1988 to upgrade 
existing sewage infrastructure in the Halifax-Dartmouth area.
<P>
	The agreement recognized that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Even though the provision of municipal sewer services is fundamentally a 
provincial-municipal responsibility, Canada and the province recognize that 
the current state of sewage infrastructure in Halifax-Dartmouth is of urgent 
concern and justifies assistance on the basis of a regional development priority; 
and a significant portion of waste water is generated by federal facilities in the 
Halifax-Dartmouth metropolitan area.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(2410 ) </B>
<P>
	Some $200 million was set aside to build a sewage treatment 
facility in Halifax, yet today the project is at almost a complete 
standstill with over $20 million sunk into consulting and with 
Halifax no closer to a primary sewage treatment facility. This is 
where the G-7 conference took place.
<P>
	Today the estimated cost has doubled to over $400 million, 
twice that which was first estimated six years ago. The longer 
we wait, the more expensive it will be.
<P>
	Now the Nova Scotia government and the federal government 
are wondering how it will come up with the extra money. After 
several promises that this will be completed they appear to be 
backtracking on their promises. Again I go back to the G-7.
<P>
	Halifax harbour is but one example of the status of sewage 
facilities throughout the country. It is now commonplace to hear 
each summer which beaches are open and which beaches are 
closed due to high concentrations of fecal chloroform. Now is 
the time to deal with the problem.
<P>
	In conclusion, I hope all members will support Motion No. 
425 to undertake a country wide program of improving the 
treatment of municipal sewage to a minimum standard of at least 
that of primary treatment facilities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I commend my colleague for introducing this private 
member's motion. It is a very important subject. We share the 
feeling that this is a question of key importance.
<P>
	I know my colleague is extremely concerned about matters of 
the environment. However, at this time when friends are fewer 
and fewer as days go by, we have almost completed an 
infrastructure program. The federal, provincial and municipal 
governments have joined together to launch a $6 billion 
program, effectively to renew infrastructure including the 
sewage systems in the country.
<P>
	Whatever we do we cannot do by imposing ideas from the 
federal government. It has to start at the municipal level because 
sewage is a matter for municipalities to deal with and 
municipalities are creatures of provincial governments. This is 
why at the time of the election, in our red book, we decided to 
join with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and with all 
the provincial governments without exception to start a broad 
infrastructure program.
<P>
	The $6 billion infrastructure program has achieved sewage 
treatment upgrades amounting to $2 billion in total. I will give a 
few examples of various projects that are being carried on under 
the program. In British Columbia, as the member for 
Comox-Alberni pointed out, there has been a $206 million 
upgrade projected of the Anascis Island sewage treatment plant; 
one of $2.2 million in Sherwood Park, Alberta; one in the 
Hamilton-Wentworth region of $25 million; one in 
Chicoutimi, Quebec, of $7.2 million; one in Grand Falls, New 
Brunswick; another one in Crossroads, P.E.I; another one in 
Deer Lake, Newfoundland; and so on.
<P>
	The irony of it is that the leader of the Reform Party at the 
time of the election was quoted as saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Any politician who thinks he can stimulate a $700 billion GNP economy with 
some sewer projects or $2 billion to $3 billion in public works will believe he 
can start a 747 with a flashlight battery.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(2415 ) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, with due respect, I think my colleague from 
Comox-Alberni should speak to his leader and suggest that 
sewer and infrastructure programs are key to the renewal of a 
prosperous economy. In fact the Reform Party, in its own budget 
plan, referred to physical and intellectual infrastructures on one 
page. However, as I read through it, there is not one mention of 
the environment or sewage projects. It mentions Canadian 
highways, airports, information transmission systems, ports, 
and railways, but not one word about the environment, sewage 
or water treatment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14301"> 14301 </A></B>
<P>
	It would seem to me that this is where it must start. If the 
member wants to do something constructive he should start at 
the level of his own party and persuade his leader to include the 
environment, sewage treatment plants, and infrastructure 
projects dealing with environmental needs in his future budget.
<P>
	It is significant that during the infrastructure program the 
following provinces spent the greatest part of their money 
toward sewer upgrades and environmental projects. British 
Columbia has spent as much as 75 per cent, amounting to $488 
million. Sixty per cent of all New Brunswick's infrastructure 
money went into environmental projects. In Newfoundland it 
was 48 per cent, in Nova Scotia 62 per cent, in P.E.I. 60 per cent. 
Admittedly, the other provinces spent a minor part of their 
infrastructure moneys in sewer and environmental projects. 
Even then, it is pretty significant. Alberta has spent 30 per cent 
to date, Saskatchewan 32 per cent, Quebec 33 per cent, Yukon 27 
per cent, and so it goes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> In Ontario?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> The figure for Ontario was only 16 per cent, and 
in Manitoba it was 16 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> They fixed up the rinks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Well they might have fixed up the rinks, but 
they also fixed up a lot of sewer projects. In the member's own 
riding I see that out of this infrastructure project the village of 
Ucluelet, the regional district of Comox, Strathcona, Port 
Alberni, and the village of Cumberland all realized sewer 
projects with their infrastructure money.
<P>
	What I think we have to do is support what we have already in 
order to make it a better project and convince the member's own 
party that the environment counts. When they redraw their 
famous budget they should include the environment and sewer 
projects.
<P>
	I agree that work has to be done, but it will only be done when 
we sit together with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, 
all the municipalities in the land and all the provinces so that 
future infrastructure projects, if we can find the collective 
money to put them together, will be geared firstly and hopefully 
almost exclusively to environmental needs.
<P>
	Admittedly a lot of money has been spent on road repair and 
all other types of infrastructure projects, which were also 
necessary. However, maybe we can agree in the future that 
environmental needs will come first and foremost. In this I 
would support the member 100 per cent.
<P>
	What we must do is first of all ensure that what we have 
already works and works well. What we have attempted here has 
been a significant achievement to put together for the first time a 
collective program of $6 billion at a very tough juncture for both 
provincial and federal governments as well as for municipal 
governments. It has been a big achievement, $2 billion spent on 
environmental projects.
<P>
<B>(2420) </B>
<P>
	I believe that we have the start of something constructive, and 
I respectfully suggest to the member that this is a solution for the 
future in what he is trying to do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I see 
that the Minister of the Environment has managed to influence 
the hon. member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis. He speaks the 
same language as the Minister of the Environment. He now 
engages in petty politics.
<P>
	It is with great interest that I rise tonight during private 
members' hour. Motion M-425 put forward by the hon. member 
for Comox-Alberni deserves a few minutes of consideration 
since it deals with an issue that affects us very closely, 
municipal sewage.
<P>
	If I understand correctly, the purpose of the hon. member's 
motion is to prevent municipal sewage from being dumped back 
directly into the environment without undergoing at least 
primary treatment, as the motion says.
<P>
	I, for one, am totally in favour of this. Sewage must undergo a 
minimum level of treatment. We no longer think that we can 
flush our sewage directly into bodies of water without negative 
consequences. We, unfortunately, did this for too long, and we 
must now pay for our carelessness and stupidity. Today, we must 
live with and clean up polluted lakes and rivers. Of course, at the 
time, we thought that our hydrographic system could absorb a 
certain amount of sewage. Perhaps it could, but did we have the 
right to do this?
<P>
	Since then, however, the amount of sewage has grown by 
leaps and bounds, so to speak, and it now contains an increasing 
variety of products whose long term effects are totally unknown. 
At the present time, if we dumped all municipal sewage without 
treating it, our hydrographic system would be totally devastated 
and become unusable for no good reason.
<P>
	Fortunately, some 30 years ago, I would say, we became 
aware of how big the problem is. The small facilities then in 
existence quickly became outdated and inefficient, even 
obsolete.
<P>
	It is then that it was decided, in Quebec in particular, to 
modernize existing systems and build more sophisticated and 
efficient equipment that could absorb and treat large amounts of 
sewage.
<P>
	Significant amounts were invested. Provincial funds and 
municipal taxes were spent through specific programs. Of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14302"> 14302 </A></B>
<P>
course, there were major flops. Some of the plants that cost a lot 
to build did not live up to expectations. But on the whole, we can 
say that it was a success.
<P>
	Much work has been done and much money has been poured 
into this since, but we are still far from being able to draw our 
drinking water directly from our lakes and rivers or dip our big 
toe into certain waters that bathe our urban or semi-urban areas. 
In that regard, is it not somewhat paradoxical that we treat our 
sewage before discharging it and have to treat water again 
before using it?
<P>
	That being said, it is clear that efforts are required in that area. 
So far, all the efforts have come from the provinces and 
municipalities.
<P>
	Municipal sewage is therefore and undeniably an area of 
provincial and municipal jurisdiction. So, when the hon. 
member for Comox-Alberni talks about a country-wide 
program and a minimum standard, I cannot help but wonder and 
worry about what he wants exactly.
<P>
<B>(2425) </B>
<P>
	Does he want the federal government to come and impose, 
because of its spending power, standards in a jurisdiction clearly 
belonging to other levels of government? If that is what he 
wants, I think that he is mistaken. The federal government is 
certainly no guarantee of a better environment. As media 
reviews and environmental groups have been telling us 
regularly these days, the federal government is backing off in 
matters of the environment. It is cutting funding, abandoning 
the Green Plan, showing its inability and blatant lack of 
willingness to meet its own targets and failing to honour every 
one of its international undertakings under various treaties.
<P>
	In the face of this abdication, I think that the federal 
government should stay in its backyard with respect to 
municipal sewage. Not in my backyard, as the popular saying 
goes. The government could nonetheless provide funding to 
carry out this great plan of discharging clean sewage into our 
waters. A resource envelope divided equitably among the 
provinces would certainly help achieve this objective. Do not 
get me wrong. All I am talking about is funds divided equitably, 
period.
<P>
	If the federal government starts imposing standards, as it 
tends to do more and more, its attempt will have to be quashed. 
Finally, I wish to underline the good intention of the hon. 
member for Comox-Alberni. His motion reflects a genuine 
concern for the environment. Besides, the Reform Party's 
concern for the environment is made abundantly clear anytime 
we deal with an environmental issue. From Cape Breton, where 
we have the Sydney Tar Pond Projects, to the Standing 
Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development, 
where the CEPA is being reviewed, the Reform Party 
contribution has shown exemplary concern for the environment.
<P>
	In concluding, I should say that municipal sewage is only one 
element of the much larger pollution problem. It is essential that 
we immediately correct the problems and that we consider very 
seriously all the other sources of pollutants. If we do not act 
now, the condition of our planet will be such that in the future 
our children and  grandchildren will not be able to survive. I 
would like to propose an amendment on behalf of the Bloc 
Quebecois to the motion of the hon. member for 
Comox-Alberni. I move, seconded by the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Motion M-425 be amended by adding, at line 2, after the words ``a 
country-wide program'' the following: ``with opting out provision and full 
financial compensation for all provinces''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. The amendment 
moved by the hon. member for Laurentides, seconded by the 
hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, is in order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
motion by the member for Comox-Alberni concerns the 
establishment of a country-wide program to permit 
municipalities to upgrade their sewer systems. I would point out 
to the House that the infrastructure program launched by the 
government in co-operation with the provinces and the 
territories has helped municipalities modernize their effluent 
treatment facilities and, at the same time, has created the jobs 
these communities badly needed.
<P>
<B>(2430) </B>
<P>
	On June 14 of this year, the government approved $1.2 billion 
dollars for infrastructure projects across Canada to modernize 
and expand sewer systems. If we add to this the funds approved 
for projects to improve drinking water supply and treatment 
systems, we end up with a figure of $1.9 billion, or a third of the 
money earmarked for the infrastructure program, going to water 
or sewer system projects.
<P>
	These figures indicate that clean water and establishment of a 
healthy environment are priorities in each province. The 
municipalities invest the money from the infrastructure 
program to provide essential services, and we are their partners 
in this undertaking.
<P>
	The improvements will benefit the municipalities themselves 
and Canada as a whole. The projects will mean work for 
workers, improved quality of life in the communities and a 
better future for our children.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The member sponsoring this motion comes form British 
Columbia. In that province 75 per cent of infrastructure works 
funding has been set aside specifically for sewer and water 
projects and $388 million has already been approved for sewage 
treatment improvements.
<P>
	The largest single infrastructure works project in the country 
is a major sewage treatment facility in B.C. The $206 million 
upgrade to the Annacis Island sewage treatment plant will 
reduce waste reaching the Fraser River. Costs will be shared 
with the province of British Columbia and the greater Vancouver 
regional district. The upgrade will cover the first phase of 
secondary waste water treatment and reduce the level of pollu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14303"> 14303 </A></B>
<P>
tants expelled into the Fraser River, home of the largest  salmon 
run in the world. More than one billion fish migrate up the 
Fraser River to spawn every year.
<P>
	Still in British Columbia, communities from one end of of the 
province to the other are taking advantage of the unique 
partnership created by Canada infrastructure works to upgrade 
vital services and boost their local economies. For example, in 
the Okanagan region infrastucture funding of $27 million is 
allowing the district of Summerland to build sanitary sewers and 
a sewage treatment plant. With a population of almost 10,000 
Summerland is the largest community in the Okanagan without a 
community sewage program.
<P>
	Thanks to the $7.5 million in infrastructure works funding 
Prince George is moving ahead with stage three of a waste water 
treatment plant in that city. Smaller communities are also 
benefiting. On the northern part of Vancouver Island, Port Alice, 
Port McNeill and the district of Powell River are upgrading or 
building sewage facilities under the infrastructure program.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By taking advantage of the possibilities for co-operation 
offered by infrastructure works, municipalities can begin 
earlier, and at a lower cost, to modernize their water treatment 
facilities. In my province, Manitoba, Winnipeg is modernizing 
its sewer system in order to reduce spillover into the Red River. 
Four projects worth a total of $20 million will prevent the rise 
and overflow of sewer water.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A similar project is now under way in Hamilton, Ontario. That 
city is building a $25 million facility that intercepts combined 
sewer overflows and contains them for treatment at the water 
pollution control plant. Here again is a case of the national 
infrastructure program responding to local priorities and 
improving our environment.
<P>
	The infrastructure program is bringing water and sewer 
service to many rural Atlantic Canada communities for the first 
time. Examples include Colchester county, Nova Scotia where a 
$13 million project will build a sewage treatment plant to 
service the town of Truro and surrounding area. This improved 
infrastructure will assist industrial development while 
enhancing the local environment. What is more, using the latest 
technology will develop the job skills of those employed in the 
construction and operation of the plant.
<P>
	Three communities in Prince Edward Island have worked 
together to expand sewer facilities. Bunbury, Southport and 
Crossroads have now been amalgamated into one town. The 
community is pleased with the rapid implementation of the $1.5 
million project. It is a densely populated area and environmental 
problems were imminent if the sewer system had not been 
extended.
<P>
<B>(2435) </B>
<P>
	According to the head of the local pollution control 
commission, the community benefits in several ways. I quote: 
``One is the potential for safer groundwater for a much longer 
time. It also makes the area much more attractive to live in. 
There's also a greater potential for commercial and industrial 
development in the area''.
<P>
	In the community of Conception Bay South, Newfoundland 
about 350 homes, schools and businesses will have water and 
sewer services available to them this summer for the first time. 
The $5 million infrastructure project employed over 200 people 
and has been a real shot in the arm for the local economy. The 
town's mayor says that it is the best thing that has ever happened 
to his community. I quote: ``There are a lot of families that have 
been waiting a long time, perhaps 20 years, for these services, if 
not for the infrastructure program''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, the infrastructure program has allowed large and 
small municipalities across Canada to make improvements to 
their sewer systems, improvements they established as 
priorities themselves.
<P>
	Thanks to federal-provincial co-operation, these 
improvements may be made now and create the jobs these 
communities so badly need. The program is a fine example of 
what can be accomplished when three levels of government 
decide to work together for the welfare of the people.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is now 12.35 in the morning and it is a privilege 
to speak to the motion put forward by my colleague from 
Comox-Alberni. The motion says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should support the 
undertaking of a country-wide program of improving the treatment of 
municipal sewage to a minimum standard of at least that of primary treatment 
facilities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The motion put forward is to improve sewage treatment 
facilities, part of what I might call need to haves rather than the 
like to haves, which are often put forward by the government in 
its infrastructure program.
<P>
	This is not a western issue. It is a national issue. It is also an 
issue raised by the Liberals in their red book, an issue that now 
seems to have been put on the back burner.
<P>
	I want to read the promise in the red book word for word. I 
encourage my colleagues from across the floor to listen closely. 
It states: ``One of the country's biggest sources of water 
degradation is untreated municipal sewage, aggravated by 
decades of neglect of sewage and water treatment 
infrastructure''. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14304"> 14304 </A></B>
<P>
This sounds very similar to the motion so I would assume its 
mover would have the full support of all the members on the 
government side on this one.
<P>
	The lack of basic sewage treatment is a serious problem. 
According to the Sierra Legal Defence Fund report: ``If the 
annual volume of untreated sewage were piled on the 
trans-Canada highway, all 7,800 kilometres of it, it would cover 
the road to a depth of nearly 9 metres from coast to coast''.
<P>
	Running on the boundary of my riding of New 
Westminster-Burnaby is the Fraser River. British Columbians 
realize that the Fraser is in serious jeopardy. Unfortunately most 
do not truly understand why it is in the condition that it is in. I 
am sure there are many answers, complex scientific ones, but 
certainly one answer is that it is how sewage is handled in and 
around the river.
<P>
	Just last week the Fraser River Management Program issued a 
report card on the Fraser basin. Sewage treatment plants on the 
river were singled out as the biggest problem, receiving an f 
grade, a fail. Dumping of under treated sewage is benefiting no 
one and is endangering once abundant fish stocks.
<P>
	The Outdoor Recreation Council declared that the Fraser 
River, which supports about a $300 million a year salmon 
fishery, is British Columbia's most endangered river.
<P>
	We realize that the cost of upgrading or building new 
treatment plants is rather expensive. We also realize what our 
priorities are. Our priorities should always be for the well-being 
and health of Canadians.
<P>
	A ribbon cutting ceremony for a new sewage treatment plant 
may not make for great photo opportunities but photo ops are not 
what will keep the country environmentally sustainable. We all 
know the Liberal government is more into photo ops than it is 
into environmental cleanups.
<P>
<B>(2440 ) </B>
<P>
	The government implemented its grand infrastructure 
programs soon after they were elected. They talked about 
funding going toward roads, sewers, bridges and water mains, 
except here is where some of the funding is actually going: $15 
million for renovations to a coliseum; $21 million for a 
convention centre; $173 million for a trade centre; $50 million 
for an arts centre; $24 million for a tennis stadium; and almost 
$15 million for building a circus training facility.
<P>
	This is only a portion of the list. I believe the list I just read 
will give an understanding of how wasteful this government has 
become. Among the legitimate projects there is also a lot of 
Liberal pork. These are misplaced priorities from misguided 
Liberalism.
<P>
	Our motion clearly calls for the federal government to 
improve municipal sewage facilities to a minimum standard of 
at least primary treatment. With only three types of possible 
treatments available, this is the second from the bottom for 
effectiveness yet it would be far greater than some Canadian 
cities currently have. Some of them have nothing at all.
<P>
	In Halifax, Nova Scotia the city dumps all of its raw sewage 
down the pipe into the ocean. That is 250 years of pumping 
untreated sewage right into the Halifax harbour. The same 
method is used in Victoria, British Columbia. In both places 
proponents hope that the cold tidal waters will be capable of 
carrying the waste out to sea. I believe both cities are realizing 
that there is only so much that the waters are able to neutralize.
<P>
	So many promises have been made that people are having 
trouble keeping track of which level of government actually said 
what. For Halifax, the federal, provincial and municipal 
governments apparently earmarked $200 million to build a new 
treatment facility yet residents of Halifax are still pumping over 
100 million litres of untreated sewage into the harbour each day. 
While Nova Scotia waits for its much needed facilities, 
Montrealers will be serving up aces in their new tennis complex 
and doing somersaults in their new circus tent, all part of 
infrastructure money.
<P>
	This country's deficit and debt are ballooning larger every 
day. The federal government must be frugal on how it spends its 
money. My constituents have told me that when their bank 
accounts are low, they spend according to priority. They only 
purchase what is most necessary and they expect the 
government to do the same.
<P>
	Like many of my constituents, Canada has basic necessities 
like education, health and the environment. When my own 
personal bank account is low, I do not go out and purchase a 
painting but when the federal government's bank account is low 
it goes out and builds an art gallery. Something just does not 
make sense here.
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment talks of sustainable 
development but talk is insincere when the words are not put 
into action. British Columbia's Fraser River is the greatest 
salmon producing river in the world. People living along the 
Fraser have always had a close connection with the river, relying 
on it for water, food, transportation and livelihood. However 
this river system cannot be sustained if municipalities along the 
river are forced to release untreated sewage.
<P>
	My colleague from Comox-Alberni is not proposing 
anything new with his motion. He is simply reminding the 
government of its commitments for sustainable development. I 
hope that the revenue minister as well as the member for Halifax 
are listening closely to this debate because Victoria and Halifax 
are the two Canadian cities that are dumping untreated sewage 
into our waters.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14305"> 14305 </A></B>
<P>
	I note that the revenue minister is quite aware of the situation. 
In February 1993 he wrote a column in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
entitled: ``The benefits of dumping sewage in the sea''. In the 
article he wrote: ``When the waste water leaves the pipe, it is 
immediately subjected to vast quantities of cold, fast moving 
sea water high in oxygen which would result in a biological, 
bacterial and chemical change''. Strangely enough, he does 
admit there is the possibility that something dangerous but 
unknown may be in the discharge water and might become a 
problem in the future.
<P>
	Finally it should be noted that in 1989, 70 per cent of 
Victorians supported treatment for all waste water coming out of 
Victoria's capital regional district. I hope that the minister will 
have the courage to listen to his own electorate.
<P>
	The government was so proud of the red book during the 
election. I often heard the Prime Minister tell Canadians that if 
his Liberal government was not following the red book promises 
to notify him and make him accountable, not that the red book 
was so great anyway.
<P>
	Someone mentioned to me recently that the Deputy Prime 
Minister said a similar thing but added that if promises were not 
kept that they should give her a good swift kick. After the next 
election, the voters will not be able to kick the minister around 
any more for she will not be around.
<P>
	The Reform Party through this motion is asking the 
government to live up to its basic promise and to support 
improvements to municipal sewage facilities. Should it fail to 
do so it will be conveying a message to Canadians that the red 
book was merely an election pamphlet which was long ago 
forgotten.
<P>
<B>(2445) </B>
<P>
	I urge the government to take care of the basics, to do at least 
the minimum and quickly act positively in response to the 
motion presented today.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
motion and the well researched speech by the hon. member for 
Comox-Alberni are very important and stir the sentiments of 
many in the Chamber who share the views with respect to the 
importance of continuing this effort.
<P>
	I remind my colleagues in the Reform Party it was the Liberal 
Party and the Liberal government which initiated the 
infrastructure program. Even if the method by which the 
program was launched is not 100 per cent satisfactory, programs 
related to sewage treatment, water improvement and the like 
have been set in motion which permit the debate tonight in a 
search for ways of improving what is under way.
<P>
	The infrastructure program is a good measure. It has helped to 
create jobs for Canadians and it has helped to finance initiatives 
environmentally oriented in conjunction with other initiatives, 
as the hon. member for  Comox-Alberni has already indicated 
and as the parliamentary secretary indicated in his reply.
<P>
	What needs to be stressed in the debate is the importance of 
the Canadian Federation of Municipalities and of the respective 
provincial governments in deciding how the money is to be 
allocated. Evidently Ottawa, even if it wanted to allocate 100 
per cent of its funds to a specific purpose, would have to obtain 
the concurrence of the other two partners. Therefore there is the 
necessity of working very closely with and convincing 
municipalities and provincial governments to agree to what we 
think are the priorities for the infrastructure program.
<P>
	However, the infrastructure program has come to an end. This 
is year two and the scheme has virtually been completed. The 
question is how to continue. Obviously in considering the 
economic policies of the Reform Party and the limitations which 
have been imposed by the budget one would have to be very 
creative in the search for the funds.
<P>
	I invite members of the Reform Party to look at a study 
conducted by the Department of Finance in December of 1993 
and January of 1994 entitled ``Tax Expenditures''. There is one 
item which is rather considerable, a tax expenditure which is the 
equivalent of a loophole in the taxation system with respect to 
lottery winnings. In 1991, because of non-taxation of lottery 
winnings, the loss in revenue amounted to some $860 million. I 
suspect that amount increases every year. Therefore there are 
places where moneys can be found by way of improving our 
taxation system and by closing loopholes.
<P>
	I bring these thoughts to the attention of the hon. member for 
Comox-Alberni because I am sure he is very keen in his search 
for funds required in order to continue the infrastructure 
program in years three and four.
<P>
<B>(2450 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in the House at this late hour and be the last 
speaker on the motion brought by the member for 
Comox-Alberni.
<P>
	Like the member for Davenport, I will begin by 
congratulating the member for Comox-Alberni on his motion 
and on the presentation he gave which was a very thorough 
exposition of the nature of the problems in our country and in 
every modern society dealing with effluent. We have to be very 
conscious of this. This is an example of the type of debate we 
can have in the House to search for the best solutions to these 
perplexing and complex problems from a technological point of 
view and from a human management point of view.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="14306"> 14306 </A></B>
<P>
	I suppose as a member of the government one regret I have 
about the debate is I was disappointed to see it degenerate so 
quickly on the other side of the House from what I considered to 
be the high level of the opening moral tone of the member for 
Comox-Alberni to other members of his party who then used 
the motion as a way to attack the government for not doing 
things which we have been doing.
<P>
	It reminds me of earlier when I listened to the member for 
Fraser Valley East spending his whole speech complaining that 
there is no discussion in the House. When members of the third 
party get up and use these opportunities to attack another party, 
no wonder we do not get into any discussion.
<P>
	This is a constructive opportunity to exchange views. The 
member for Davenport has indicated members of the House on 
all sides are passionately interested in finding solutions to these 
problems.
<P>
	I, as chairman of the foreign affairs committee and the 
member for Red Deer, who also sits on that committee, are more 
than aware of the consequence of effluents flowing from 
Victoria into international waters and our relations with the 
United States. It behoves all of us to be aware of that.
<P>
	To suggest that the government is not aware of it is totally 
ignoring reality. Suggesting the infrastructure program has been 
deficient in this respect is doubly unfair. The infrastructure 
program is, as the member knows, a tripartite program 
conceived in the Canadian spirit. It requires the collaboration of 
the federal, provincial and municipal governments.
<P>
	When we look at the way the infrastructure program has been 
applied around the country and the way it has been used, it 
co-ordinates the needs and desires of all people. Members of the 
Reform Party should be happy because at the municipal level we 
are getting the input from the very lowest level of government in 
the European sense of subsidiarity, that which is closest to the 
people, and it is their choice.
<P>
	There are municipalities that have selected water treatment 
facilities. In those cases the federal government has 
participated, encouraged and done its best to make sure the 
country and the needs of the municipalities are served. Where 
other municipalities have chosen other priorities, the federal 
government has recognized that it is their right as citizens and as 
municipal governments.
<P>
	I suggest to the third party we should concentrate not only on 
the question of effluent removal, which is a most important 
priority, but also on the principle on which the country is 
founded; a principle of tolerance and co-operation by all levels 
of government. If we can get all our programs working that way 
and use persuasion to get the federal government to do its work 
we can achieve the results wished for by the member for 
Comox-Alberni without trampling on the rights of local 
municipalities.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 is 
deemed to have been made.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GUNCONTROL">GUN CONTROL</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to focus on the recently passed gun legislation.
<P>
<B>(2455) </B>
<P>
	Our articulated gun bill in Canada says something for us as a 
society not only for today but for generations to come. However, 
I have some real concerns in the ability to apply that law. We 
would like to think that Canadians are law-abiding citizens in 
terms of there being seven million guns. I do not know who 
counted them. I do not know who knows for example that I have 
three guns.
<P>
	Let us say there are seven million guns out there. A lot of 
those guns have been sitting around. They are in attics, 
basements and behind pantry doors. A lot of them are not used 
and have not been used for years. I have two rifles that have not 
been used for 20 years. My concern is that we must have some 
incentive to flush out of existence a lot of those rifles and guns 
which have not been used, are not being used and will not be 
used unless they happen to fall into the wrong hands.
<P>
	I am proposing a form of gun amnesty in Canada. There would 
be some incentive for people to turn in those guns. Some people 
are quite aware they have no use for the gun but there is a 
reluctance or a sentimental attachment to it. Perhaps the 
widow's husband used the gun for many years and she is just a 
little bit reluctant to get rid of it but at the same time knows she 
has no earthly use for it.
<P>
	The bill could be improved. The application of the bill 
certainly would be much easier. It will be a tremendous and 
horrific job for our police departments unless there is genuine 
co-operation to register the guns.
<P>
	My proposal is to have a form of amnesty, amnesty plus if you 
like, with some sort of minimal tax credit, something in the area 
of $25 or so for turning in those guns. Motivation is needed. I do 
not think a lot of people would object to that. It would not cost 
very much. It is going to cost something to register the gun 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14307"> 14307 </A></B>
<P>
anyway so it is not as if it were all lost. Some program like that 
with a public relations selling job associated with it would have 
a very positive effect on the number of guns that are in this 
nation.
<P>
	I would be glad to turn in my two rifles and keep my shotgun. 
In that case I would probably make better use and take better 
care in the storage of my shotgun than if I had a whole lot of guns 
sitting around.
<P>
	We could flush out those guns that are no longer used and 
where their purpose is long forgotten. I do not see any advantage 
to having them sitting around when people will be reluctant to 
go through the inconvenience of registering them. They would 
be relieved if there were some way in which they could dispose 
of them. The motivation could be a very small tax credit. I think 
it would work. I have received very positive feedback from 
some very unexpected corners when I think back to their attitude 
toward the gun bill. That is why I brought this matter forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the member for Leeds-Grenville brings forward a 
very interesting proposal. There is a new twist I have not heard 
before which is the aspect of the tax credit.
<P>
	With the passage of Bill C-68 in the House of Commons and 
the expected passage of the same bill in the Senate later this 
year, we will be registering all firearms. As the member for 
Leeds-Grenville has said, some people may not want to 
register firearms.
<P>
	Frankly, I do not think it will affect the gun owners 
themselves, but for those who have inherited firearms or have 
had firearms lying around the house, they may not want to go 
through that procedure if it is not their intention to use those 
firearms. Of course I think mainly of long guns, rifles and 
shotguns. Firearms can be sold. Handguns, even the prohibited 
ones, can be sold to people who have similar types of firearms. 
They can be turned in at any time or they can be sold out of the 
country.
<P>
	It is correct that when there is an amnesty it focuses the idea in 
people's minds so they become more conscious of turning in 
their firearms. A lot of people will turn in firearms without any 
compensation but certainly more people would turn in their 
firearms if there is compensation.
<P>
	The main problem is the cost which would be considerable. 
One never knows how many people would take advantage of the 
amnesty but we would have to expect that there would be a cost.
<P>
	The other question that has to be looked at is if prohibited 
weapons are being turned in that can be purchased on the street 
or out of a trunk of a car for a very small amount, then these 
people with the tax credit would receive more than they actually 
paid for the firearm. That would only take place for a short 
while. Once registration came into effect they would not be able 
to do that. However, it is certainly something that should be 
examined further.
<P>
	I know the Department of Justice and the Minister of Justice 
will be discussing this idea with the Department of Finance. 
Something may result from this but it is too early to speculate 
whether the idea of the hon. member for Leeds-Grenville will 
result in a solution or not. We will have to wait until these 
discussions take place.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed 
adopted.
<P>
	Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 
p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
