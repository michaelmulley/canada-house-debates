Once it is enacted it will ensure that Canada Post does not

are inadvertently subject to these fees and moneys are collected. 
I think it is a consumer rip-off.

aggravated assault, aggravated sexual assault and armed robbery, 
to double the maximum penalty and to allow the publication of the 
young offenders' names after a second indictable offence, to 
lower the age limit which defines a young person to include only 
those youth between the ages of 10 and 17 and, with violent

<A NAME="LINK27">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the 
government for the deplorable state of Canada's criminal justice 
system, and the government's lack of concern for public safety, 
as demonstrated by their refusal to: (<I>a</I>) strengthen the Young 
Offenders Act; (<I>b</I>) abolish conditional sentencing for violent 
offenders; and (<I>c</I>) introduce a Victims' Bill of Rights. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. 
member for Langley—Abbotsford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's supply day motion is aimed at strengthening Canada's 
criminal justice system.  Canadians have lost faith in our 
justice system because it caters to criminals and it ignores 
victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has mismanaged our justice system so 
badly that the protection of society is not its primary purpose. 
The Liberal purpose for the justice system is the quick release 
of offenders and the protection of their rights.  The justice 
system has become a revolving door for criminals.  They go into 
prison knowing they will only serve a fraction of their sentences 
before being released, free to pursue their criminal activities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general, the minister in charge of prisons, said 
in January that he wants more low risk, non-violent offenders on 
the streets.  Let us examine exactly what the Liberals consider 
to be non-violent, low risk offenders.  Rapists and pedophiles 
have been released into many communities thanks to this Liberal 
government's conditional sentencing program. Conditional 
sentencing means offenders serve their time in the community 
subject to certain parole style conditions.  The Liberals treat 
these despicable members of our society as upstanding citizens 
whom they consider to be low risk and not deserving of jail time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 19 the <I>Globe and Mail</I> featured a story in which a 
Windsor woman was in a grocery store and ran into the man who was 
convicted of raping her.  The man had been sentenced only a few 
weeks earlier and was given 18 months of house arrest.  A 63-year 
old Kelowna man sexually assaulted his niece and received a 
conditional sentence.  Two Montreal rapists received conditional 
sentences.  The list goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 8, 1997 the justice minister stated in this House: 
“We agree in principle that conditional sentencing is working 
well”.  Working well for whom?  It works great for the 
criminals, that is for sure.  But there you have it.  The 
Liberals are most concerned with criminal rights.  The Liberal 
focus is on what is best for the criminals, not on what is best 
for society. The previous justice minister, now the discredited 
health minister, agreed to a victims bill of rights over two 
years ago and we are still waiting.  Victims are still waiting 
and still nothing from the justice department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice committee spent almost a year travelling across the 
country, consulting and hearing testimony on proposed reforms to 
the Young Offenders Act.  It tabled a comprehensive report in 
April 1997.  The Liberals have had that report for over a year 
but what has the minister done?  Did she bring in legislation? 
No.  Did she introduce tough new measures to deal with young 
thugs?  No.  Did she display a keen interest in taking on youth 
crime and defeating it?  No.  Instead, over a year later the 
justice minister released a glossy discussion paper complete with 
a colourful logo.  She calls it a strategy paper but what it 
amounts to is more stalling and more delays in reforming the 
flawed Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak about the Young Offenders Act as a representative of a 
province that is all too familiar with the problem of youth 
crime.  Saskatchewan has the highest rate of youth crime in the 
country on a per capita basis.  Regina and Saskatoon are ranked 
first and third among Canadian cities when it comes to break and 
enters, most committed by teens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Carol Wright of North Battleford was so sickened by the Young 
Offenders Act that she created a petition signed by 70,000 
people.  And what is the justice minister's response?  What does 
the justice minister offer Ms. Wright and other residents of 
Saskatchewan plagued by youth crime?  The minister released a 
pamphlet entitled “Canada's Youth Justice Renewal Strategy” 
which is coloured and designed like a fancy promotion piece. 
Typical Liberals, do nothing, just discuss, release a paper, 
discuss some more, study it, have a report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much longer do Canadians have to wait?  How much longer does 
our safety have to be compromised before this government will 
act?  How much longer must Canadians live in fear of walking down 
the streets in their own communities and in their own 
neighbourhoods?  The minister's colourful PR package does nothing 
to make our streets safer or to address the concerns Canadians 
have about youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's proposals leave too much discretion in the hands 
of judges.  We have seen where that has led with conditional 
sentencing.  In typical Liberal fashion it is left up to a judge 
to decide whether names should be published and whether a violent 
young offender should face an adult sentence. So-called special 
sentencing options will also be left to the discretion of judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than ensuring young offenders face stiff sentences and 
penalties by entrenching them in legislation, the minister wants 
to leave everything to the whims of judges.  Clearly leaving too 
much power in the hands of judges is not the way to proceed.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That type of open ended discretion has led to the mess we are in 
today where young offenders who murder and rob are given slap on 
the wrist sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister states that adult sentences will be given to those 
who display a pattern of violent behaviour.  What kind of 
pattern?  How many offences make a pattern? None of this is 
explained so I assume this also would be left to the discretion 
of a judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is also vague about non-violent offences. Is break 
and enter going to be considered non-violent?  What about drug 
trafficking?  Will these youths be sentenced to community work? 
Do we want burglars and drug pushers serving community sentences 
in our neighbourhood? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to waste the time of this House with a detailed 
analysis of the minister's strategy paper because it simply 
continues the consultations, the discussions and the debate that 
have raged over the Young Offenders Act for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now all we get is a smoke and mirrors strategy paper from the 
Liberals to make it appear as though they are serious about 
cracking down on crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what others are saying about the minister's 
paper.  The attorney general of Ontario said: “I do not think 
beyond a couple of things that it really deals in a comprehensive 
way with the concerns that Ontarians have expressed over and over 
again”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister from Alberta said: “From what I am hearing 
from Albertans every day, this will not fit the bill”.  It will 
not fit the bill because this strategy is not about the 
protection of society.  It is not about anything.  It is just hot 
air, more talk and more debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Young Offenders Act was introduced in 1984, the 
justice department has operated in a social engineering fashion 
and look at what it has got us.  People are afraid to walk the 
streets at night.  Violent crime by youth is at an all time high 
and some cities are contemplating curfews for teens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal way is the wrong way and this new strategy paper 
does absolutely nothing to steer the youth justice system off the 
wrong path. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guiding principle of the justice system should be the 
protection of society.  The rights of criminals should be 
secondary.  The maximum age for the Young Offenders Act should be 
lowered to 15 years for all offences and the minimum age for the 
Young Offenders Act should be lowered to 10 years in order to get 
young offenders into the system early. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need truth in sentencing and the names of all convicted 
violent offenders should be made public regardless of whether 
they were convicted in adult or youth court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be parental responsibility for their children's 
actions.  The minister speaks of parents paying court costs but 
their responsibility should go beyond that in cases where it can 
be demonstrated that parents were negligent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to promote personal responsibility.  Individuals 
must be responsible for their own actions.  The Liberals believe 
that our environment is responsible for criminal behaviour.  They 
believe individuals have no personal obligation whatsoever. Blame 
it on TV, blame it on alcohol, blame it on the humidity, the 
alignment of the stars and planets, whatever, but do not feel you 
are personally responsible. That is the message being delivered 
to criminals by this Liberal government, but that is the wrong 
message.  Criminals must be held accountable for their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The types of changes that Canadians wanted to see are not 
mentioned in the minister's new glossy package, but then this 
government has not done anything with respect to bringing our 
justice system into line with the views of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to strengthen the Young Offenders Act.  The Liberals 
bring forward this meaningless paper.  They want truth in 
sentencing.  The Liberals established conditional sentencing 
where rapists and pedophiles are released into society, into our 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want a victims bill of rights.  The Liberals continue 
to champion the rights of criminals.  I therefore urge all 
members of the House to speak in support of today's supply day 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To speak against it, someone must either be a Liberal or they 
must have an extremely warped sense of justice.  I guess those 
are really one and the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Reform motion reflects the opinion of average Canadian 
citizens and I know many members will want to support the 
objectives of this motion when they speak in favour of safer 
streets, safer communities and a more effective, functional 
criminal justice system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to what the Reform Party member had to say on 
this and my question is a very simple one.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he agree that, whether with respect to youth or the entire 
penal system, there are also two solitudes in Canada when it 
comes to the issue of crime?  There is our attitude in Quebec 
with regard to the entire penal system, young offenders, parole, 
rehabilitation, and reintegration into society, and the attitude 
of the other solitude further west in Canada on these same 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the member was so interested in the Young Offenders Act, I 
wish to point out that the 66th convention of ACFAS was held 
during the week of May 14. 
This important meeting of specialists, political scientists, 
criminologists, and those working in the sector is held annually 
in Quebec to examine all aspects of crime.  I will read the 
conclusion and I would like the Reform member to tell me whether 
or not he agrees that there are two irreconcilable solitudes in 
Canada, not just with respect to crime but with respect to other 
matters as well, and that we will never be able to see eye to 
eye. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This conclusion says “The federal proposals to amend the Young 
Offenders Act that were released Tuesday by the Minister of 
Justice reveal a growing gap between the approach to crime in 
Quebec and that in English Canada, particularly in the West”. 
This was the view expressed by Quebec researchers during the 
symposium on politics and social management.  They conclude as 
follows “There are two irreconcilable solitudes; that of western 
Canada, among others, and that of Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. member at least admit that there is an 
increasingly wide chasm between Quebec and the rest of Canada? 
If so, what does he propose to prevent this chasm between the 
two Canadian solitudes from growing even wider?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot provide any 
specific explanation as to why youth crime is higher in 
Saskatchewan than in Quebec, in fact higher than anywhere else in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has proposed a three step plan to deal with 
young offenders.  The first step involves early intervention and 
prevention.  The second is community based sentences for 
non-violent, non-serious crimes.  The third is what I focused 
most of my discussion on, getting tough and having effective and 
harsh penalties to deal with repeat violent offenders who are not 
start getting the message currently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a town hall meeting recently in Saskatoon. Advocates of 
the current system's remaining as it is were there and there was 
a young offender there who had committed repeat violent crimes 
over a period of five years.  His opinion was “see, now I'm 
better”, but if our Young Offenders Act were working and 
effective, his first offence would have been his last.  That is 
the type of justice system we need to prevent people from getting 
into patterns of repeat criminal behaviour.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to comment on 
the opposition from the Bloc in Quebec.  I applaud the system of 
youth justice in Quebec because it is well integrated. But I also 
want to say very strongly and emphatically that whereas the loyal 
opposition talks about plans in town halls and stridently 
critiques, in London, Ontario last week I opened the Sonier 
Centre, together with many of the community partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not at the planning stage.  We are at the implementation 
stage.  That implementation in my city involves crime prevention. 
It involves getting a collaboration between boards of education, 
early intervention to prevent children leaving school.  It 
involves getting neighbourhood watch and the St. Leonard society, 
youth justice circles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk and critique but really what matters is action, and 
action starts in communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I compliment the hon. member 
on her community initiatives to deal with the problem of youth 
crime. 
I wish the justice minister would take some initiatives at the 
federal level.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to the Reform Party supply day motion 
today.  It addresses a number of issues that are very near and 
dear to my heart, in particular the Young Offenders Act, victims 
rights and conditional sentences.  I can speak to any of these 
points for a full day and still have more to say about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment I want to concentrate on the issue of victims 
rights.  I want to relate a situation, one of many in my riding, 
that I am very concerned about.  With regard to the once proud 
Canadian criminal justice system which today is basically a legal 
industry, I am asking people who are listening and watching this 
debate to take out a pen or pencil and a piece of paper and write 
down some of the dates I am about to give.  It will give everyone 
a good idea of what the legal industry is all about, a legal 
industry that is perpetrated by a government so mired down in 
legalese and legal phrases that it has forgotten the basics of 
what we are all about, that is victims rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 I began working with victims groups across the country 
in developing a national victims bill of rights.  In the latter 
part of 1995 the Reform Party adopted the proposals in the 
national victims bill of rights and included its blue book 
platform at our assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 at the height of this issue my colleagues and I brought 
the proposals into the House on April 29.  The then justice 
minister, the now woefully inept health minister, stood in the 
House just before me in debate and agreed to it.  He said that we 
needed a national victims' bill of rights and that it should be 
sent to committee.  And there it sits.  That is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about an individual and give everyone listening 
an idea of what a victim goes through in society today.  This is 
about one of these characters.  His name is Clinton Dale McNutt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 at age 19 McNutt's adult criminal record began.  He was 
driving with over .08 and was convicted of mischief, refusal to 
provide a sample and uttering a forged document.  That can 
happen.  Maybe we should intervene.  Maybe we should look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened five years later?  He was sentenced in 1990 to 
eight years for attempted murder.  During a domestic dispute 
McNutt shot his brother-in-law in the abdomen and his wife's 
sister in the back of the head.  Both survived.  After a plea 
bargaining arrangement—and this is where the victims rights bill 
comes into play—McNutt pleaded guilty to one charge for that 
damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1995 McNutt was granted day parole at Sumas Community 
Correctional Centre.  This is the day care of all day cares for 
criminals.  There are no fences, no guards and no security 
system.  Criminals can venture out in the community of Abbotsford 
during the day, do what they please and go back at night to 
sleep.  There have been four rapes by residents of Sumas centre 
in the last two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July 1995 McNutt had day parole at Sumas centre but his day 
parole was revoked.  He was found intoxicated at the centre, 
which is no surprise as booze and drugs come into Sumas all day 
long.  The correction centre says that is the kind of risk faced 
in Abbotsford, British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 18, 1996, McNutt was again granted day parole at 
Sumas centre for a second time.  He was back into day care again 
so that we could look after this boy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 14, 1997, not too long ago, McNutt was charged by the 
Abbotsford police with indecent assault causing bodily harm.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is accused currently—I like the word accused—of leaving the 
Sumas day care centre and attacking the corrections volunteer 
whom he had met at the centre.  The female victim required 
hospitalization.  Even the workers are not very safe from this 
guy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened after April 14?  This is what should be noted. 
This is what that indecent assault victim is going through like 
many victims in our country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 25, 1997, disclosure court was adjourned.  On May 23 
the discovery was adjourned.  On June 24 disclosure court was 
adjourned.  On July 15 disclosure court was held.  On July 29 a 
judicial interim release hearing was held.  November 7 was the 
preliminary hearing.  He pleaded guilty.  We must keep this in 
mind.  He is now guilty of indecent assault.  He said  “Yes, I 
did it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 2 sentencing was adjourned.  On January 21 
sentencing was adjourned.  On January 29 sentencing was 
adjourned.  On February 16 sentencing was adjourned to obtain a 
psychiatric report.  That was after four adjournments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judge W. Field struck down the guilty plea and ordered himself 
removed from the bench after all this.  He deemed a possible 
conflict of interest since the judge's former law partner 
defended McNutt in the attempted murder case when Field was a 
defence lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to piece this together and think about it.  Suddenly the 
judge says, after adjournment after adjournment, that his law 
partner defended him years ago when he was a lawyer.  He deemed 
it in conflict so he stepped down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then what happened?   On February 26 they fixed a date for 
sentencing.  On April 3 sentencing was adjourned since the crown 
counsellor announced that a dangerous offender designation was 
being sought.  They did not do that way back when the victims 
were sitting in the court.  After all this the crown decided to 
seek that designation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 20, 1998, the dangerous offender hearing was adjourned. 
On April 27 the dangerous offender hearing was adjourned as 
McNutt entered a new plea of not guilty.  He had the right to do 
that because the judge stepped down and there was a new judge: 
“I was guilty before but I am not now”.  The victim who was 
indecently assaulted was sitting there listening to this stuff. 
On October 29 the pre-trial was scheduled.  On November 30, 1998, 
the preliminary hearing was held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going on?  This goes on every day in almost all our 
cities.  This is nothing but a sick legal system, a legal 
industry feeding on itself at the cost of victims.  They sit 
there day in and day out, the lawyers earning big pay for this 
sort of thing, while the case is adjourned and adjourned and the 
judge steps down.  He pleaded guilty; he pleaded not guilty after 
another judge was on the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They laugh.  Look at them over there laughing at it. Liberal 
members think it is funny.  They should try going to the victims 
and asking them about it. I think it is sick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I only have a minute or I would start on what is 
wrong with the system.  We should take that for what it is worth. 
That is what victims are going through day after day.  It is darn 
well time the government had the courage of somebody's 
convictions to develop a national victims bill of rights to make 
sure that victims are not treated like third class citizens, to 
make sure that victims have at least the same rights as 
criminals, and to make sure that victims are treated decently in 
a country where they should have always been treated decently in 
the first place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
normally a government member ought to have risen to say that 
what has just been said makes no sense. I cannot remain seated 
without commenting on such a speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have figured out what the hon. member's problem is. 
Having listened to him carefully for 10 minutes, I think he is 
in the wrong legislature.  He should be a member of a provincial 
legislature, because everything he mentioned relates to the 
administration of justice.  As far as the disqualification of 
the judge is concerned, he may have forgotten, but he did not 
specify which level of court this was.  It was probably a court 
of first instance, where the judgeships are provincial, not 
federal appointments. 
If the judge is incompetent, let the hon. member speak to the 
Minister of Justice for British Columbia, which is where he was 
appointed, but not in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that he is comparing apples and oranges, and scaring 
everybody in the process.  This is how prejudices are created in 
Canadian and in Quebec society, when people listen to these 
folks with their tales of the bogey man, trying to stir up fear 
about the Young Offenders Act, for instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything the hon. member had to say about the adjournments, 
the changes of court dates, the disqualification of the judge, 
who appears not to have done a good job, comes under provincial 
jurisdiction. The Bloc Quebecois members are not in agreement 
with this, because we respect your Canadian constitution.  We 
may not have adopted it, or signed it, but we do respect it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> They cannot understand for they are not 
listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Instead of yelling, the hon. member 
should perhaps listen to what I have to say. 
He would hear somewhat more balanced and realistic speeches. 
People would not be alarmed. The game they are playing here is a 
dangerous one.  Crime, the judicial system and public safety are 
nothing to joke about.  They should not be making political hay 
with them and they should certainly not be picking up easy votes 
in western Canada on such important matters.  I think their 
remarks are outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Furthermore, I am receiving applause 
from the Liberals, the New Democrats and the Conservatives. 
Something is wrong in this system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am coming to my question and I will be brief.  The hon. member 
would do well to come more often to the meetings of the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights. We recently heard the 
testimony of an illustrious individual from British Columbia on 
a victims bill of rights and on everything the member has just 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was refreshing to hear someone from B.C. expressing views 
that are different from those of Reformers, because that 
province has a good system for victims.  Perhaps it could be 
improved.  If the federal government has surplus money, let it 
give it to the provinces to improve the system.  British 
Columbia, like Quebec, has a good system already. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Just what I need, Mr. Speaker, and just 
what the country needs: a separatist telling us in the House how 
our provincial governments and our judicial system should run, a 
separatist telling us how our Canadian judicial system should 
run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is about politics.  This is about a government and 
politicians who legislate in the House and leave the 
administration of political decisions that lead to legislation to 
provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not legislate a national victims bill of rights and let it 
be administered?  Why is it that a government like this one 
institutes conditional sentences and then turns around and says 
to provincial judges that they can issue them all they like? What 
happened?  In my riding there were two rapes in a row. People who 
raped women received conditional sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Thanks to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Thanks to me, the hon. Liberal member 
says. I would like an apology for that insult.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly the Liberal government was told time and time 
again in the House that we should exclude rapists and murderers 
from conditional sentences and it chooses to ignore it and allows 
it to happen.  Thanks to me.  I would like an apology for that 
insult.  It is the Liberal government that is at fault.  The 
government is deliberately denying victims in this country their 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the comment and the question from the separatists, 
their agenda is a little below what it should be in this country. 
I do not have any time to answer that real dumb question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
let me begin by saying what else is new on the part of the 
Reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform chooses an opposition day to do a smorgasbord of what is 
the most heinous violent criminals.  It is highlighting those 
people in our society that the justice system is trying to work 
out.  It is exaggerating the extent of the crime in this country. 
Crime has gone down in Canada.  It is exaggerating and 
fearmongering which is typical of the Reform opposition.  It 
highlights the exceptions to the justice system rather than the 
rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform's simplistic attitude toward justice, an eye for an eye 
and a tooth for a tooth philosophy belongs in the jungle, not in 
this House and not in this country. That is exactly the Reform 
philosophy as far as justice goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think victims in this country believe in an eye for an 
eye or a tooth for a tooth philosophy.  They believe that the 
government has a balanced approach, both to youth crime and to 
victims rights. We are on the record— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  The punishment should fit the crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please. The Chair is very 
tolerant of heckling in debate but I am having difficulty hearing 
the parliamentary secretary.  To that extent I have to say I feel 
the heckling is excessive. Perhaps members might tone it down a 
little so the Chair is able to hear a member speak.  I am sure 
there are other members who would also like to hear the 
parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think they are 
really interested in hearing me but I will continue in any case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the young offenders proposals put forward two weeks 
ago, the government put forward a balanced approach focusing on 
front end initiatives in dealing with Canadian youth unlike the 
opposition who try to prevent crime by simply changing the 
Criminal Code or the back end of crime prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a brief overview of the most important changes to 
the legislation that the minister has announced.  She proposes to 
replace the current procedure for transfer to adult court with 
the procedure of assessing adult sentences in certain serious 
circumstances so that justice can be provided quickly so that the 
decision to transfer is made at the most appropriate moment after 
finding of guilt.  By speeding up the process we will ensure that 
the offender, the victim or the victim's family and the community 
see a clear connection between the offence and its consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change would allow that youth 14 years and older who are 
repeat violent offenders or who are convicted of murder, 
attempted murder, manslaughter, or aggravated sexual assault will 
receive an adult sentence unless a judge can be persuaded 
otherwise. The Minister of Justice would allow the publication of 
names upon conviction of youths who qualify for adult sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the new legislation will strengthen the 
commitment to use community based sentences and effective 
alternatives to the justice system for non-violent young 
offenders.  This new legislation will enhance the requirement 
that community based approaches be— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Where is it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Shall I continue, Mr. Speaker, or 
shall we let the opposition— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the parliamentary secretary 
has the floor.  I am able to hear her well so I have been 
reluctant to interrupt, but perhaps hon. members who are seeking 
to participate in the debate might restrain themselves until 
their time comes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are quite willing to listen to the hon. member make her 
presentation, but she is misleading the House because there is no 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member knows that it 
is improper to suggest that any hon. member is misleading the 
House.  I caution him very much in respect of those words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. parliamentary secretary is entitled to continue her 
remarks and speak about her intentions and I invite her to 
continue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the minister has 
indicated that she intended to work closely with the provinces to 
help promote and expand the kinds of sentences that help youth 
fully appreciate the impact of their actions, accept 
responsibility in a meaningful way and come to terms with a need 
for change in their lives.  These approaches provide youth with 
support to overcome criminal behaviour when traditional sources 
of support are unavailable.  Equally important, they engage 
victims and the community in the administration of justice and 
thus provide greater confidence by responding to legitimate 
concerns that justice be seen to be delivered at the local level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many models already in use across Canada.  Some 
involve restitution, that is, youth paying back to the victim and 
the community for damage done.  Other models involve 
victim-offender reconciliation programs, family group 
conferencing, community service orders or personal services to a 
victim.  All of these emphasize and reinforce basic fundamental 
Canadian values such as respect for others, their property and 
their community. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to increase its efforts to prevent youth 
crime. Canadians want to provide their young people with any 
assistance they may need and help them stay away from crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To 
do so requires looking beyond the legislation and the criminal 
justice system at ways available to our society to deal with 
problems such as child poverty and child abuse, which are often 
an underlying cause of youth crime, and to help young people not 
to make the kind of choices that may lead them to engage in 
criminal behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has agreed with provincial and 
territorial governments to pursue a joint child development 
strategy as part of the national action program for children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians realize that legislative changes are only one piece of 
the puzzle. Legislation alone will not stop young people from 
committing criminal acts and innocent people from being 
victimized. An efficient approach to deterring youth crime must 
reach beyond the criminal justice system and include crime 
prevention and a series of other programs and services to help 
children and young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the basic message conveyed by the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs in its report on the Young Offenders 
Act. The provinces and territories have been key partners in 
seeking new direction for the justice system as it applies to 
youth. 
More important, Canadians have made a major contribution by 
expressing their fears and concerns, and by demonstrating their 
support for reasonable and balanced solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These values—not those of the opposition—are the ones 
Canadians want our justice system to reflect. We must do a 
better job of ensuring that this is the case. There are 
effective community-based alternatives, but they are not used to 
their full potential. We rely too much on incarceration, as the 
opposition often advocates, but this solution, while simple, 
does not help young offenders, victims, or communities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party would want us to believe that the criminal 
justice system is in a deplorable state.  This is not what the 
statistics show, but of course Reform members do not know how to 
read or write.  The victimization rate has gone down between 1998 
and 1992.  The picture we get when we care to inform ourselves 
seriously is a far cry from those levels advanced by those who 
want us to think that we have to lock ourselves up for fear that 
we might be attacked if we dare walk out on our streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has been claiming that the system is broken 
ever since it came into this House in 1993 but it does not have 
any hard facts to prove it.  Yes there are crimes.  Yes there are 
victims and one is too many.  That we agree on.  But it is not a 
fair statement to say that the whole system has to be abandoned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it then that the opposition continues to claim that the 
system is broken when Canada's justice system is at least as 
effective as any of the other western societies?  What is it that 
is broken in Canada?  What is it that we are not doing in Canada 
that is much more efficient elsewhere? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest, if the members care to listen, it is because of 
the very failure of the opposition to demonstrate that crime is 
rampant in Canadian society that it has to resort to empty 
rhetoric and petty politics to instil the fear of crime and to 
try to put this government on the defensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best way to fight crime is to ensure that crime is not 
committed.  As the Minister of Justice indicated on May 12 when 
she outlined her strategy for the renewal of youth justice, crime 
prevention is at the heart of a criminal justice system that 
works effectively.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second phase of the crime prevention initiative will soon be 
launched.  These initiatives and others, which include the 
strengthening of aboriginal communities, place a strong emphasis 
on dealing with the root causes of youth justice and helping 
communities to support and provide guidance to their children and 
youth which is a key ingredient in making our young people less 
vulnerable to a life of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for victims, I would caution the reliance the Reform Party 
has been placing on a victims bill of rights.  Such a bill could 
only address matters within the federal government's 
jurisdiction.  I believe that the federal role in that area is 
rather limited. As the hon. member of the Bloc reminded 
Reformers, I would like to remind them that there is provincial 
jurisdiction in this area, in the administration.  They often 
forget that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the House that the justice and human rights 
committee is looking into the issue of what can be done to help 
the plight of victims.  In fact there will be a national forum 
for victims rights here in Ottawa in early June.  They also 
forget that. I have no doubt that the Minister of Justice will be 
interested.  We encourage hon. members to hold more town hall 
meetings to get the real opinion of Canadians as they often do 
when they hold their town hall meetings if they are willing to 
listen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will make this a very short question because I see there are lots 
of people who would like to ask questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just curious about a comment the hon. member made and would 
ask her for a response to this question.  She claims that the 
crime rate is down 13%.  At the same time her colleague from the 
solicitor general's office was complaining in a press conference 
that I was at that incarceration was up 28%. Could the member 
possibly explain, if incarceration is up 28% that maybe crime is 
going down because the bad guys are off the street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, statistics across this 
country do show that crime rates are going down.  There is a 
certain percentage, but I am not sure it is 28% as the member 
would like us to believe, of violent criminals that is going up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  That is what your member said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  That is why we have to begin at age 
zero, as I said in my speech.  We have to begin to take care of 
the problem that exists in terms of poverty and other problems 
which exist in this country in order to ensure that we prevent 
crime, not throw people in jail as the Reform Party would like us 
to believe. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was wondering if my colleague from the government 
could confirm exactly what she said about prevention being the 
best way and not throwing everybody in jail without looking at 
why they are there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member please give me her thoughts on the kind of 
system we would have if the Reform Party was the government 
today?  What would Reformers be putting toward prevention if they 
are talking about tax cuts?  And yes we know there are some 
people in this country whose taxes are too high and some large 
companies that do not pay enough.  Could the member please 
explain to the House what kind of system we would have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that with the cuts to the social programs now, there is 
no more room to cut.  We know that with the Reform Party there 
would be no real social programs. Could she please explain to us 
what kind of crime prevention program we would have in this 
country with the Reform Party governing this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for her question but I do not purport to talk for the Reform 
Party.  I will talk about what this government wants to do.  The 
Reform Party members can speak for themselves.  They are on the 
record and have proven themselves true to form again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as this government is concerned, the National Crime 
Prevention Council that was set up by the federal government made 
recommendations to this government concerning crime prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is an important issue in terms of preventing crimes, 
starting at age zero.  This would include taking care of 
nutrition, helping parents and single parent families to deal 
with the problems which start early and helping dysfunctional 
families from the very beginning.  We are investing, as is on the 
record and as was our commitment in the election campaign, $32 
million in terms of community based crime prevention initiatives. 
As I said in my speech, we will be doing the launch of these 
initiatives in a few days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the member that the recommendations of the 
National Crime Prevention Council are the basis of a lot of crime 
prevention initiatives.  We consider community based initiatives 
as being the most appropriate way to begin.  That is the route we 
are taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes we have to take care of other social problems such as 
poverty and child malnutrition. 
We can talk about fetal alcohol syndrome and all the other 
syndromes.  Those are the types of initiatives we are looking at 
in terms of funding and making sure we prevent crime at zero age.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would appreciate it if the parliamentary secretary to the 
Minister of Justice would explain the numerous contradictions 
between the statements of the current Minister of Justice and 
those of her predecessor, who both represent the same Liberal 
Party and promote the same policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will only quote a few short statements from the predecessor of 
the current Minister of Justice. During Oral Question Period, 
the then minister said “We must not amend the Young Offenders 
Act. 
Amending the act will not solve the problem of juvenile 
delinquency”. The former Minister of Justice also said “The idea 
is not to stigmatize these young people for life by publishing 
their names in the newspapers, which could prevent them from 
continuing their education and getting a job. Rather, we should 
follow Quebec's example as closely as possible in dealing with 
young offenders”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the parliamentary secretary to the current Minister of 
Justice explain that the minister did a complete turnaround and 
yielded to the pressures of western Canada, among others, on a 
very simple issue, by publishing the names of young offenders, 
which squarely contradicts what the Liberal Party used to 
suggest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B> Mr. Speaker, to respond to the question, I 
would like to reassure the hon. member by saying that our 
position has not changed.  Our approach remains balanced, with 
crime prevention on one side—and I have already told the House 
of our initiative of $32 million—and the treatment of those 
needing rehabilitation on the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we said when we announced them, the proposals are aimed at 
less than 1% of young offenders, the most violent and repeat 
offenders. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
invite the members of the Reform Party to listen carefully, as I 
am sure they will have questions to ask me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I think the Reform Party is right to question Canada's 
criminal justice system.  Unfortunately the arguments that lead 
us to criticize the government over criminal justice are at the 
other end of the spectrum from those of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This difference once again illustrates the incompatibility of 
Quebec's expectations and federalism as proposed by the 
government opposite and especially as proposed by the Reform 
Party and the people in the west.  I could debate this all day 
long.  I know the subject well and am passionate about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is vital that legislation to do with the criminal system be 
well thought out. 
Legislation must not be established on the basis of specific 
cases or stories from the <I>Journal de Montréal</I> or other 
gossipmongers in western Canada, but on the basis of a very 
thorough analysis of the situation.  Only then can we draft the 
necessary legislation, and it must be for the long term and not 
just to resolve a particular problem or a public irritant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party proposes a motion and attacks three 
subjects from three different directions.  I will deal briefly 
with each one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first, the Young Offenders Act, is another matter I could 
talk passionately about, because it is important.  I have always 
held and do so still that, a young 14 or 15 year old in trouble 
with the law for having committed a murder or armed robbery in a 
convenience store or elsewhere has a problem, but society too 
has a problem, because this is a societal problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Reformers, they criticize the Minister of Justice for 
not having gone far enough. They are calling for the electric 
chair, or almost; nothing will ever be enough for them, they 
want the problem solved once and for all. As far as we are 
concerned, when a series of amendments were made to the Young 
Offenders Act in recent years, we suggested that, before these 
amendments were implemented, the western provinces should first 
try to apply the legislation as it then stood to determine 
whether anything could be done with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we have been investing in a rehabilitation system for 
20 or 25 years, and the Young Offenders Act as it stands works. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is always room for improvement. As long as a 0.1% rate of 
repeat offenders remains, not enough is being done. There is 
obviously room for improvement. However, will it serve society 
to throw young persons in prison for life, in a different wing 
from adult prisoners perhaps but sharing cafeterias and dayrooms 
with real criminals? I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the problem be solved by publishing the name of a 16-year 
old who has committed murder? Will branding him on the forehead 
ensure public safety? No. The law must be enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have sufficient latitude under the existing 
legislation to help these young people return to society as 
anonymous citizens, earn a living, have a family, in a word 
re-enter society—that is the basic idea—and become anonymous 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, Reformers should listen to what the experts are 
saying, in Quebec. While political scientists may be caught up 
in their own views, there are also criminologists, sociologists, 
those enforcing the Young Offenders Act, those involved, to whom 
problem cases are referred and who enforce the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred briefly to the ACFAS earlier. These experts, who have 
gained renown across Canada and even in the United States, have 
made it clear that, in Quebec, enforcing the Young Offenders Act 
has paid off. 
As I was saying, Pierre Noreau, a political scientist at the 
Université du Québec en Abitibi-Témiscaminque, said “Twenty years 
ago, Quebec chose to equip itself with a system for handling 
troubled youth that is more sophisticated than in most other 
provinces”.  This is the secret of our current success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having heard what the Reform Party members have had to say, 
there is absolutely no way we will ever be able to reach 
agreement with them on the Young Offenders Act.  We have two 
different ways of looking at the problem.  The Reform position 
is incompatible with ours.  Increasingly, as the government 
takes a position on the Young Offenders Act, it is getting in 
line with the Reform Party view, the view of the western Right, 
and its position is becoming increasingly irreconcilable with 
the Quebec position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate, because the separatists, as we are labelled 
here, used to be able to talk to those the other side, the 
federalists, on a matter of great importance, and to reach an 
agreement on it, for the good and the protection of society. 
The Reform Party is not the only one to be concerned about this 
issue, we too are concerned about it. But our solutions are 
different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point deals with parole for violent offenders.  The 
parole system is part of a theory of criminal justice based on 
offender rehabilitation.  That is the initial premise, and the 
basis of the legislation.  If they are against it, they need 
perhaps to address the initial premise, the objective of the 
legislation, which is to rehabilitate the offender and 
reintegrate him into society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some offenders are harder to reintegrate than others.  Some, 
certainly, cannot be rehabilitated.  I am told that pedophiles 
do not respond to treatment. 
Is this true? Is it false? I do not know. I am a lawyer, not a 
doctor. I am told that, regardless of the treatment or drugs 
used, a pedophile cannot be cured. This problem must be viewed 
in a different perspective from other offences. The whole parole 
system must be structured accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Bill C-45 was passed, the formula used to expedite the 
release of some offenders after they have served one-sixth of 
their sentence has been of concern to the public. 
Obviously, people cannot agree or be pleased with what is going 
on, particularly when they see individuals such as Lagana and 
others like him, major drug dealers and big time money 
launderers—according to the media, and this seems to be 
confirmed in the legal files—released after serving only 
one-sixth of their sentence.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering all the problems created by drugs and the money they 
generate, we cannot be pleased to see these individuals released 
after serving only one-sixth of their sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois does not just criticize. It proposed an 
amendment to the act, to try to solve the problem. We think the 
problem has to do with how the parole board defines non-violent 
criminals. I could give a presentation on a supreme court 
decision in the 1980s or 1990s, the Smith case, in which the 
court associated drug money and any money from crime with 
violent crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money laundering does not seem like a violent crime, but where 
does the money come from?  It comes from crime.  After weighing 
the facts, the supreme court judges reached the conclusion—and I 
respect their very legal rulings—that it was violent.  The 
legislation could perhaps be amended to bring it more into line 
with the Smith ruling and deny such people parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final point is the victims bill of rights, which, as I 
mentioned earlier, is a provincial concern.  Certain provinces 
are undoubtedly more advanced than others.  I was delighted when 
the deputy attorney general of the province of British Columbia 
appeared before the committee and told us everything that was 
being done in British Columbia for victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is perhaps not enough and more perhaps needs to be done, but 
under no circumstances must the federal government interfere. 
If the federal government has money, British Columbia said it 
should hand it over to the provinces, who are responsible for 
implementing the legislation.  They will invest this money where 
it is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on for hours, but my time is up. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to my colleague who sits on the justice 
committee, as I do.  He talked about the administration of 
justice within his province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a judge from Quebec who, using alternative sentences, 
allowed two men who raped a young girl to walk free on 
conditional sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the member believes that is the proper 
use of the law or whether, if he had the authority and the power, 
he would limit the use of conditional sentencing to non-violent 
offenders as the government indicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the conditional sentencing bill came through, Bill C-41, 
and some of the judges began to use in a manner that the justice 
minister today felt was inappropriate, he introduced an 
amendment. It required the unanimous consent of this House to 
introduce it in the manner that he did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was to caution the judges that the safety of society must 
be taken into consideration when conditional sentencing is used. 
It was a warning to the judges about using it indiscriminately 
when violent offenders are involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member to bear in mind that the administration of 
justice in the province of Quebec overall does have some 
concerns.  There is a biker war there.  We have seen murders, 
including the murder of a young child.  We saw the gangland type 
of execution of two prison guards. We have not seen that for 
years, certainly not in my lifetime, in the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we start to cast aspersions on the administration of 
justice in the other provinces, perhaps the hon. member should 
take a look at some of these extraordinary criminal occurrences 
in his own province. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to answer that question.  Is he satisfied when 
that judge in Quebec, as do many judges across the country in all 
provinces, uses a law created in this House, called conditional 
sentencing, in a manner that allows a convicted rapist to walk 
free? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member support that?  Or, if he had the power, would he 
change that?  If he would change it, to what extent would he 
change it?  Or would he simply allow what the government is 
allowing, which is for the appeal courts to deal with it, 
plugging the appeal courts with case after case?  The attorneys 
general of the provinces and the crown prosecutors are appealing 
ridiculous decisions made by the lower provincial courts which 
have allowed violent offenders to walk free through the use of 
conditional sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to express his concern one way or 
the other, if he has a concern over that particular piece of 
legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member's comment is somewhat surprising, since the 
Reform MPs are the only ones criticizing the administration of 
justice at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never criticized the justice 
system of any province, I was merely repeating the allegations 
by the Reform member who spoke before me, criticizing not only 
the administration of justice but the very decision of the judge 
who stepped down, more or less labelling him as incompetent 
because he waited so long before indicating that he ought to be 
disqualified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not criticized the administration of justice.  On the 
contrary, I believe that the provinces, all in all, do a very 
good job with what resources they have available. 
I am very pleased with what I see at first glance as far as the 
administration of justice is concerned, in Quebec at any rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, there is room for improvement.  What the Reform 
Party wants, however, does not exist—a kind of machine you would 
load up with the facts, pull a handle, and out would come the 
result at the other end.  That is not how things work in real 
life.  There are cases where the facts have to be examined, 
legislation that has to be applied, there are no miracle 
solutions, and at the present time the legislation is good, 
overall, although there is room for improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go into specific cases, as they want me to, because 
that is not the role of a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am sorry to interrupt. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise to speak to this particular motion on this 
opposition day.  The topic is an important subject which 
Canadians want to talk about.  There is a great deal of interest 
in the subject and it is very timely to be raising it at this 
particular juncture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The YOA, victims' rights, the whole subject dealing with crime 
and urban safety is something that I am very well aware of and 
deal with every day.  I live in an inner city riding, the city of 
Winnipeg, that is home to some of the worst street gang problems, 
breaking and entering, nuisance crimes and a lot of property 
crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next to health care, the number one issue that arises from the 
people in my riding is:  Why are their streets not safer?  Why 
can they not feel comfortable?  They want to live the way we used 
to live in that community when I was growing up.  My father would 
give me $5 to go to the store to buy a quart of milk when I was 
eight or nine years old.  I would ride my bicycle to the store, 
buy the milk and return home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now a parent simply cannot do that.  They would not be acting in 
a responsible way if they sent their kid to the store with a five 
dollar bill.  It would not be smart.  They would not be doing 
their child a favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the number one concern.  It is a quality of life issue. 
People want it to be dealt with.  They want it to be addressed. 
They have a right to be angry.  Even a lot of the choleric 
language that I hear from members of the Reform Party I can 
frankly understand.  I can relate to it.  We all have a right to 
be angry when our streets are not safe and we do not feel that 
our families are safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently held a round table on this subject in my riding and 
two nuns who run a safe house for street kids in the inner city of 
Winnipeg came to that meeting.  They told me some stories that 
might be useful for members of the House to hear. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT16"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT16"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1120

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, to give an idea of the nature of the problem, in the area 
surrounding around the safe house people no longer sleep in the 
outside rooms of their homes.  They sleep in the inner part of 
their homes, in a den or in a living room that is away from any 
outside wall because there is gunfire every night.  Every night 
around Rossbrooke House in the inner city of Winnipeg people hear 
shots going off as gang members threaten each other with 
firearms.  It is serious.  It is not once in a blue moon, it is 
every single night and families will not sleep in their bedrooms 
because they are afraid of stray bullets coming in through the 
windows on the exterior walls.  Those are urgent circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also went on to talk about some of the services they 
provide in this safe house.  They provide a refuge for the 9, 10 
and 11 year old children who are being harassed and threatened 
into joining these street gangs.  The older gang members, when 
they approach these 10 and 11 year olds, whom they want to perform 
certain crimes for them because they are under a certain age, do 
not taking no for an answer.  In fact, they do not threaten the 
little children with beating them up.  They say “If you don't 
come and join the gang and do what we want you to we are going to 
beat up your mother or your sister or some family member”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should try to put ourselves in the position of a 10 year old 
child who has an 18 year old thug telling him “If you don't do 
this tonight I'm going to your mother's house to beat her up”. 
It takes a lot of courage for some of these children to say no to 
the gangs in my neighbourhood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the house that Sister Eileen and Sister Bernadette 
run is so critical.  They offer a refuge where these courageous 
children can go to feel comfortable and safe for a little while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing they pointed out is that it is difficult for the 
criminal justice system to deal with some of the young street 
gang members.  They are almost getting to the point where they 
are hyper acute.  They are difficult to deal with because there 
is no place they feel safe or comfortable.  They are always on 
edge like a caged animal.  They are always restless. Their heads 
are always spinning around because they are not safe on the 
street and often they are not safe in their homes.  At home they 
often face a violent situation.  All the predictable consequences 
of a poor family upbringing are very prevalent.  So it is very 
hard to reason with them.  Using reason and logic does not work 
when somebody is frightened and not thinking rationally.  It is 
very hard to negotiate with them, even in the safe environment of 
Rossbrooke House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to preface my remarks with some of that background of 
what it is like in the inner city of Winnipeg where I live 
currently, which has the gang problem, and why this particular 
issue is so important to me and to the people I represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not believe this argument is going to be fruitful 
or beneficial because of the sentiment, the tone and the content 
of the remarks that I have heard from the opposition, at least so 
far today, and I am sure there will be much more to come as the 
day goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of us are victims in the inner city of Winnipeg.  I have 
had my home broken into many times.  I have actually caught kids 
breaking into my home.  While I was holding them for the police 
one of them kidnapped my four year old son to use as a trade-off. 
It was a blackmail situation.  It turned into a horrible mess. 
Ultimately the kids did not get charged, but I got charged with 
assaulting the kids who broke into my house.  It took me six 
months to clear up that mess.  So I have been there.  I have been 
a victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a right to be angry, but there are different ways of 
dealing with it.  If we are serious about implementing change we 
have to go beyond revenge.  We have to go beyond the hang 'em 
high mentality that I have been hearing here too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party have indicated that victims are 
victimized twice in the system, once when a criminal does 
something to them and once by the criminal justice system.  I 
would argue that there is a third time the victims are victimized 
in this country.  They are victimized a third time by the 
exploitation that takes place in this House of Commons when their 
personal issues, when the crime that they just went through, is 
dragged before the House of Commons for cheap theatrical purposes 
to try to fan the flames of some kind of discontent around our 
criminal justice system.  That I have seen time and time again. I 
think it is really shameful.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the recent tragic case of the death of Reena Virk, the very 
next day members of the Reform Party were jumping up out of their 
seats saying “These kids are going to have to be punished.  We 
are going to sentence them like they are adults”.  Those kids 
were not even charged yet, never mind convicted.  What about the 
presumption of innocence?  Yes, perhaps there was a group of kids 
involved, but all the information we had was from a radio story 
that indicated that a young girl had been beaten up by other 
young people.  Yet members of the Reform Party were on their feet 
virtually calling for the gallows for these kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately the justice critic for the NDP challenged them and 
said “If you are so anxious to hang these kids, build the 
gallows right here in the House of Commons.  Build it the right 
number of feet high and bring these 14 and 15 year old kids in 
here and hang them.  You guys do it yourselves because we are not 
going to be a party to it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a pathetic thing to witness and listen to people drag out 
the worst possible aspect and dig deep for that most base sort of 
thing that all people have in them, hatred and intolerance. 
Reformers are capitalizing on that.  In fact they are marketing 
the malice which some people have inside them.  Reformers seem to 
be experts at digging down and finding the worst in the Canadian 
public, pulling it out and slapping it on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard graphic details about sexual assaults and 
pedophiles coming from those members.  Every time they stand up 
they seem to have some new horrific case, and the bloodier and 
gorier the better.  They recite them in great detail in the House 
of Commons, not because they are trying to do anything 
constructive in protecting Canadian people, but because they want 
the cheap populism that comes with being associated with that 
kind of enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sick.  There is a morbid fascination that Reform members 
seem to have with dragging these issues before the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The extreme right wing in every country has always been heavy 
handed in terms of criminal justice.  Let us face it.  The extreme 
right wingers, and we can go all the way through history, will 
avoid the obvious comparison which we are getting tired of using. 
Not only in Europe but in any right wing, fascist dictatorship we 
see a very heavy hand in terms of criminal justice issues, often 
extending beyond human and civil rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These things seem to get mixed up and confused in the rather 
simplistic world view of the Reform Party.  Reformers get the 
issues of individual rights, collective rights and human rights 
jammed into some unworkable, unmanageable ball.  I do not think 
they have thought it all through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are critical of certain aspects of the criminal justice 
system.  However, I do not share the opening remarks of the 
member who put this motion forward as they were full of a lot of 
sensational terms— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid that I 
must interrupt the hon. member as his time is up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, listening to the NDP member makes it very clear to 
me why we have such an unacceptable level of crime in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also makes it very clear to me that the Liberal philosophy on 
justice—and the Liberals have held power in this country for the 
majority of the last 30 years—is the reason we have crime in 
this country to the extent we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP member talked about the rampant gang related crime in 
Winnipeg.  He talked about personal instances where he was 
affected directly, yet he offers no solutions.  Why does the 
member not suggest that perhaps the authorities should go after 
the people who are committing the crimes and put a stop to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we hear from the NDP and from the Liberal government are 
phrases like “We have to look into it.  We have to do this.  We 
should do this.  We must do this”.  When is the government going 
to start saying “We will do this”?  Better yet, just do it. 
Start addressing crime in this country like it should be 
addressed, instead of talking about it with weak kneed analysts 
and advisors who tell the government that the protection of 
society and the people of this country is not the main priority 
of the criminal justice system, but rather it is the protection 
and rehabilitation of criminals and their reintegration into 
society.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do the law-abiding citizens come into this fuzzy, feel 
good attitude of the Liberals toward crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government talks about the new legislation that is 
coming in.  There is no legislation.  There is only more talk. 
The NDP is already supporting this more talk philosophy.  There 
is nothing happening from the Liberal government.  Yet the NDP is 
already supporting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this type of philosophy that we have had in the House for 
the last 30 years.  It has brought the country to the crime 
ridden state that exists.  Until we change things it will go on. 
It will simply not stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How on earth can the member stand there and talk about the gang 
related crime in the inner cities without offering any solutions 
about what to do with the people committing the crimes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, actually I ran out of 
time.  I was just getting to that point in my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are plenty of creative ideas in this recommendation to 
make a meaningful impact on the unacceptable incidence of petty 
crimes and nuisance crimes.  The most nuisance crimes in my 
community are things like property crime, break and enter, 
vandalism, et cetera.  We have had some terrible incidents with 
more serious crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recognize that currently the penal and criminal justice 
system is being starved for funding.  We give judges an 8% raise. 
Yet people who work in the system, whose job it is to get dirty 
every day and deal with some of the people on the street, have 
not had any kind of budgetary increase or raise in pay for eight 
years.  They are demoralized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard from a delegation from Stony Mountain penitentiary 
recently where people are being asked to go on open range walks 
alone.  That is a real problem.  They go on open range walks in a 
ward where the doors are open and people can circulate.  The only 
reason this is happening is that the whole system is stressed or 
maxed to the point where it is almost dysfunctional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not say that spending more money on the criminal justice 
system is the answer.  However I know it is more costly to 
rehabilitate than it is to punish.  When dealing with 10 and 11 
year old kids surely to God the objective is rehabilitation, 
turning them back into productive citizens and not strictly 
punishing them.  That costs money.   Meaningful social work to 
turn kids' lives around costs money.  I would argue it would cost 
us less in the long run.  Every soul we save will be a net saving 
in the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are predictable consequences of the tight money policy we 
have been going through.  The economy was ground to a halt. 
Unemployment went higher.  Many people are saying that U.S. 
cities are showing a real drop in the incidence of violent crime. 
In actual fact it is not more prisons.  It is the fact that the 
unemployment rate is the lowest it has been since the second 
world war—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in the debate.  A 
very important motion has been brought forward on this supply 
day.  I commend the mover of the motion.  It is also a subject 
area that is very close to my heart.  As a former crown attorney 
the criminal justice system was at the centre of my work every 
day.  As justice critic for the Conservative Party I hope to 
further my devotion to the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to focus my remarks today specifically on the issues 
that have been brought forward in the motion and hopefully on 
some of the points those in our party would suggest to improve 
the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no more important issue in my mind than that which 
touches the criminal system.  It deals with issues of health, 
education and employment and is the centrepiece for the quality 
of life of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The application of criminal law is playing a predominant role in 
society.  Sadly few have not been involved directly or indirectly 
with our justice system, whether as a victim, a family, a friend 
of a victim or a witness to a criminal act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians feel our present criminal justice system is not 
working and therefore we need to change the system in a 
significant way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act is perceived rightly or wrongly as being 
extremely flawed, inadequate and not sufficiently addressing 
those of a certain designated age who find themselves involved or 
in breach of the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also those who consider after the fact, after people 
have been brought to justice, gone through the court system, 
convicted and find themselves serving their debt to society 
either through incarceration or conditions placed on them through 
probation, that the National Parole Board again is falling down 
in its duty to protect Canadians.  We can never forget that 
protection of the public always has to be the priority when it 
comes to criminal justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are shocked almost daily at the way our judges are 
applying conditional sentences.  The clause itself was never 
intended by the drafters of the act to apply to those committing 
violent offences.  That is completely outside the purview of what 
was intended when it came to conditional sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It further reiterates the point I wanted to make earlier that 
lost faith in the justice system is prevalent.  Canadians are so 
taken aback when they hear about sensational cases that they are 
losing all faith.  This is an extremely crucial issue.  It is one 
I am glad we are having an opportunity to debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the concerns and the frustrations of many Canadians with 
the application of the justice system.  At times at least 
criminal law is set up in a way to benefit criminals, not 
victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been mention previously by members of the House of an 
open house that is to occur.  It will be a national forum to 
address some of the issues, a round table that will perhaps give 
us greater insight into the inequities that exist within the 
system.  I will personally be hosting one in my riding of 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough on June 1.  I look forward to the 
worthwhile and productive discussion that will take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youth crime, crime prevention and ways to ensure the safety of 
Canadians from criminals have always been priorities of the 
Conservative Party.  The emphasis on prevention or front end 
proactive initiatives has been promoted by this party throughout 
its history with the emphasis being on the protection of the 
public.  I assure the House that my colleagues in the 
Conservative Party and I will continue to vigorously press the 
government to reach the goals we need to attain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those goals is to ensure victims of crime become a 
centrepiece in the justice system.  Among the measures my party 
has brought forward were a victims bill of rights and the 
abolition of section 745 of the Criminal Code, otherwise known as 
the faint hope clause, or perhaps it should be known as the dope 
clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lowering of the age of the application of the Young 
Offenders Act from 12 to 10 years is another initiative we have 
put forward.  The passage of legislation which would target 
specifically criminal gang activity and the revision of the 
Criminal Code as it relates to impaired driving sections are 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time is limited in the debate.  I will try to address 
specifically some of the points raised in the motion. First let 
me speak to the very hot and topical issue of the Young Offenders 
Act which has been central in our news media of late.  Since the 
Minister of Justice has tabled her policy on youth justice I 
believe it is appropriate to speak to this issue first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act came into force in 1984 and has been 
amended several times in 1986, 1992 and 1995. These amendments 
addressed specifically the issues of penalties for violent 
offences and facilitating the transfers of violent offenders to 
adult courts.  Those are certainly worthwhile changes, but the 
most recent attempts to tinker with the edges of the Young 
Offenders Act or throw it out altogether are inadequate 
responses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the federal-provincial territorial task force on youth 
justice made a number of important recommendations to the justice 
department.  It included dropping the age of accountability, 
addressing serious offenders in a more efficient way and looking 
at alternatives to courts, transfers and sentencing.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over past months the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights examined the recommendations of the task force.  We have 
seen the minister's response which was released to the media. 
This seems to be the justice minister's preferred method of 
making public policy statements.  On May 12 the Minister of 
Justice released the strategy for youth justice renewal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we say about this initiative?  Can we say that it has 
addressed the concerns not only of the committee but of Canadians 
at large?  Sadly I have to say no.  Unfortunately the minister 
has missed a golden opportunity.  I interpret it to be a wish 
list or perhaps a philosophy of what Canada's worst law firm 
would like to see done with the young offenders system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are missing in this initiative concrete legislative 
initiatives.  We do not see a commitment to funding for such 
initiatives.  The federal government has a responsibility to 
enact legislation, not just to talk about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate this response is not what Canadians are looking for. 
The goal of the youth justice system must be to reduce youth 
crime through prevention, meaningful alternatives and meaningful 
consequences at times.  It must beef up or attach more emphasis 
on rehabilitation and reintegration for youth who find themselves 
involved in non-violent offences. There must be alternative 
measures or means of diverting young persons out of the justice 
system which can sometimes grind to a halt because of sheer 
volume.  We need to know where the money is and money has to be 
put into the system in a very effective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alternatives to formal court proceedings for non-violent 
offenders are very complicated and will need a great deal of 
attention, but greater emphasis must be put on that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party has always supported concepts 
of alternative sentencing for first time non-violent offenders. 
The Conservative Party has always believed that rehabilitation 
programs for young persons with an emphasis on education, social 
skills, personal responsibility and community service can be and 
should be developed as a priority in the young offenders system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the announcement of the minister.  It is important to 
see a recognition on the part of the government of the issue, but 
sadly we have not seen any concrete initiatives.  The $32 million 
crime prevention fund announced through the media will be useful. 
There is no question about that.  However it represents only 1% 
of the total law and order budget that exists to address problems 
in the youth justice system.  It certainly represents a fraction 
of the amount of money that will be put into the ineffective gun 
registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party advocates providing judges with more 
power to impose mandatory treatment for individuals, in 
particular young offenders.  We also advocate parents being more 
accountable and more responsible in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act is an area fraught with difficulties.  I 
wish I had more time to address it in a significant way and to 
make further suggestions.  The motion includes references to 
conditional sentences which I have addressed somewhat in my 
remarks.  The motion before the House talks specifically of the 
need to address crime in a more significant way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party will continue to push the government in 
that direction.  We recognize that efforts have been made but 
that they do not go far enough and we are pleased to take part in 
the debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and 
Africa), Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member and I were 
both crown attorneys.  I listened with much interest to what he 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drug abuse seems to be the matrix of much of the crime that 
occurs.  A statistic from Philadelphia showed that something like 
200 heroin addicts committed about a half million crimes in that 
city during a 10 year period.  Could he comment on that?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate very much 
the question.  In the Canadian context the involvement of drugs 
is certainly very relevant to the commission of crime, not only 
persons under the influence of drugs committing crime because 
their sense of reality is warped but also they would be out 
committing crimes to feed their drug habits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Emphasis on rehabilitative programs that help get people off the 
drugs I think is a focal point.  Sadly in places like the 
maritimes where we have such a large coastline the devolution of 
the ports police has caused problems in terms of the availability 
of drugs now in coastal provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I think that has been a failing of the member's 
government in the decision to take away the ports police.  But I 
do agree that this is certainly an area that we have to focus on 
in our criminal justice system and hopefully further funding and 
rehabilitative focus will address this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, on 
the drug situation, I agree with the hon. member and I find it 
strange that our prisons are the places where drugs are more 
readily available than anywhere else.  That is the kind of system 
Liberal governments have allowed to carry on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member a question because of his experience as 
a crown prosecutor.  As an example, a drunk driver killed four 
people in a head on collision.  There was no question about it, 
he admitted guilt immediately.  He was very remorseful at the 
time.  When they went to court and began the proceedings the first 
day, it was exactly two years to the day before sentencing was 
finally imposed. There were 18 court appearances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member please explain what kind of system would allow 
that kind of case to go on for 18 court appearances requiring 
victims to drive all the way from Saskatoon to Calgary in order 
to participate?  It happens an awful lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member for Wild 
Rose raises a very significant problem in our justice system, the 
backlog the courts are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say with all honesty, having been a participant in our 
court system, that delay is a tactic used quite often by the 
defence.  I have participated in that and it is not something 
criminal lawyers are particularly proud of, but the old maxim 
justice delayed is justice denied I think is very true in the 
case he refers to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simply unacceptable to have 18 court appearances and when 
there are victims involved this is very telling.  It is very 
pychologically damaging for victims to have to wait to have some 
form of closure on a criminal matter.  When loved ones are 
involved and they are faced with this continual legal wrangling, 
it is simply unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, because of the caseload and the number of criminal 
offences we are prosecuting throughout the country we find that 
time and time again this does occur.  This instance is perhaps 
not indicative of what happens in all cases but there are those 
exceptions where it drags on endlessly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot say specifically what happened in that case. It does 
happen and I am sure that through addressing this with more crown 
prosecutors and perhaps more judges would lessen the workload. 
That would be one way to address it.  Alternative measures for 
some of the less serious offences involving property would give 
more time to focus on violent offences and crimes where there is 
loss of life. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague who has just spoken.  He has a seat on the justice 
committee, as I have, and I appreciate his input into justice 
matters, as I appreciate his comments today on this supply day

</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to most of the debate on this issue today and I was 
dismayed when I heard the parliamentary secretary to the justice 
minister use such strident vocabulary, couching her terms when 
she dealt with the Reform Party's approach to youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also more disturbing when I realize that she has access to 
the minority report I submitted and made public in response to 
the 10 year review of the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We worked with the committee.  We travelled across the country 
and listened to 300 witnesses from not only the various sectors 
of the youth justice system but also to parents whose children 
had gone off track in spite of all they could do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary and the chairman of our justice 
committee knows full well our approach to youth crime.  It is 
within our report and it is contained within the private member's 
bill I submitted to the House on September 26. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our approach is early detection and prevention.  We had experts 
appear before our committee who told us very clearly that 
aberrant and overaggressive behaviour can be spotted as early as 
grades 1, 2 and 3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We compliment the Government of Quebec which has spent money on 
programs where a teacher, for instance, who sees a child who 
needs help and care can refer that child to a program of 
government where the child as well as the parents may receive 
assistance to keep that child on track.  We support that very 
much and that is part of our approach to youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We very much favour the diversion of young people who come into 
contact with the law for the first or second time in a minor way 
out of the court system, away from the court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw some excellent programs not only as we travelled about 
the country but since then.  Programs such as the Sparwood 
program and the Maple Ridge program have a very encouraging 
success rate in terms of directing these young children away from 
the court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago my colleagues and I met with Lola Chapman, a 
co-ordinator of the Maple Ridge program.  They began three years 
ago as a court watch group.  They saw the young offenders system 
was not working.  It was not helping young people.  They simply 
began by sitting in court, watching what was going on and 
reporting it to the newspapers by way of letters to the editor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It caused some concern among the court officials because they 
did not like to see what was happening in that system as far as 
their dealing with young people and the lack of success being 
published in the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It eventually resulted in Lola Chapman and her 17 volunteers 
having young people referred to them by the police and now by the 
crown prosecutor, and their success rate is phenomenal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years ago we were advised that there were 45 to 60 young 
people passing through the weekly young offenders court.  When we 
spoke with her a few weeks ago, it was down to eight. That is a 
phenomenal success rate.  We support that very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that statistic there are very encouraging 
statistics not only in her program but in the Sparwood program 
and other community programs emerging from the grassroots in 
spite of the young offenders system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is almost as an act of rejection to the young offenders 
system and these people are saying they want to do something to 
help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Maple Ridge program has a 94% success rate. What does that 
mean?  We asked Ms. Chapman what she considered a success.  She 
said any youth they accept into their program who does not 
reoffend within one year they consider to be a success. 
I agree.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, in 100% of the cases where restitution was required 
full restitution was paid.  We support that.  As the 
parliamentary secretary knows, in our executive summary we have 
pointed to the need for the federal government to work closely 
with the provinces to initiate these kinds of programs to 
encourage them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attorney general from B.C. has now asked Lola Chapman to 
co-ordinate with other communities to see if she can help to move 
forward these kinds of programs so that we can keep our young 
people who fall off the track for the first or second time and 
who need the second chance to get that second chance from people 
who are volunteers and who are committed to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to learn that when a young offender is 
assigned to one of those volunteers they stick with them.  They 
are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  They have the love 
and care for those young people that perhaps some of them need. 
That is one of the key elements to their success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the two first levels we very strongly advocate. Quebec 
has programs which I think are far ahead of some of the other 
provinces.  We encourage some of the other provinces and the 
federal government to do what they can to provide the funding 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another interesting point is that the witness from these 
organizations such as the Sparwood program who appeared before 
the standing committee said they did not want funding.  They said 
they would use the community resources because when federal and 
provincial funding is involved strings are attached and they 
wanted the flexibility to develop those programs to suit the 
community requirements, and every community is different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We very much encourage that.  It is also encouraging to hear 
that those programs are spreading.  We talked to the RCMP in 
Trail, B.C. which has introduced a program with the community. 
It is having the same very high success rate.  Over 90% of young 
people are being rehabilitated.  We find that by and large 
rehabilitation in closed custody facilities simply has not 
worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is very clear.  To quickly get the young offender 
before he or she develops a hardened attitude toward the abeyance 
of laws and rules in the home, in the school and on the street is 
very important.  We can deal with them in a way that they confess 
what they have done, they have to face the victim and the 
emotional expression, the groundwork is laid for the healing to 
begin.  Those young people are often never a challenge or a 
problem to any member of society again in a criminal way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of federal responsibility we must not shrink from 
the use of incarceration in order to protect the lives and safety 
of members of society who are threatened by that very small 
percentage of very violent young offenders who do threaten the 
lives and safety of members of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would we do in that area?  I want to briefly touch on the 
package the justice minister presented a week and a half ago. 
What she is recommending is of course only a recommendation.  She 
has used unspecified terms without definition.  We really do not 
know what the bill will look like. She promised one in the fall. 
It has taken her so long to bring even this proposal forward that 
we wonder why.  We were able, without the battery of lawyers and 
bureaucrats the justice minister has access to, to bring in a 
private member's bill that does reflect the recommendations and 
the testimony of many of the witnesses who appeared before the 
standing committee.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at her proposal there are two things I have a great 
deal of concern over.  First she has completely ignored the 
recommendation of her own standing committee to lower the age 
from 12 to 10.  She has rejected the research done by Professor 
Nicholas Bala who was commissioned by the justice department to 
do an in-depth academic examination of that very question.  He did 
the most thorough research we understand that has ever been done 
in the country on the question as to whether or not the age 
should be lowered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He recommended it be lowered and he had a very sound rationale 
for doing so. He pointed out that if a 10 or 11-year old commits 
a serious violent crime such as murder, rape or manslaughter, a 
child welfare response is an inadequate societal response to that 
type of very serious offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also became evident as we gathered testimony from across the 
country that the older kids are using younger children to commit 
crimes, knowing full well they are immune to the criminal justice 
system. In addition, my own view is that the justice system forms 
part of our educational system.  When our children learn that 
they are immune to the police and to the justice system for any 
criminal act they might commit until age 12, we are sending the 
wrong message to them.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an error for the Parliament of Canada to decriminalize by 
way of age what would otherwise be criminal acts. We are not 
inventing anything new.  Under the old juvenile delinquents act 
the police and the justice system were charged with the duty and 
the responsibility of investigating and dealing with any criminal 
act committed by anyone over seven or eight years of age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendation that was rejected by the justice minister was 
simply to reduce it from 12 to 10 years of age, not back down to 
age seven, eight or nine.  It was to move it down where the 
police have the authority to deal with a young offender, whom we 
cannot call a young offender because there is no offence for 
stealing a car by a 10 or an 11-year old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a young person in that situation in Edmonton.  He 
stole over 30 cars and the police could do nothing except bring 
the individual home and turn him over to the parents.  The social 
welfare workers could not touch him because there was no evidence 
of neglect.  They cannot act on a criminal matter because they do 
not have the authority.  It is only the federal government that 
can issue laws dealing with criminal matters and then it is the 
responsibility of the provinces to administer them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quickly touch on the whole area of the cost of 
the administration of the young offender system. The federal 
government passes the laws and the provincial governments have to 
administer the laws which costs money. They enter into 
federal-provincial financial agreements to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Manitoba is now entering into litigation to get 
out from under the administration of the Young Offenders Act. 
Why?  Because the federal government is reneging on its financial 
responsibility in terms of the administration of the Young 
Offenders Act in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we asked the justice minister and the officials when they 
appeared before the standing committee during the estimates 
whether or not they had anything to offer Manitoba at that time 
to bring it back on side so it would not simply abandon the 
administration of the Young Offenders Act, there was nothing on 
the table.  The government is not offering Manitoba anything. The 
minister is talking about $32 million in crime prevention yet one 
of the provinces is taking the whole issue to court to determine 
whether or not it can shed itself of a financial obligation of 
which the federal government has reneged on its part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about funding for crime prevention the government 
is not even living up to the financial agreements that ought to 
be in place now.  We find through our research that the federal 
government can renege and back away from any federal-provincial 
financial agreement it makes with complete immunity and has been 
supported by the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Government of 
Manitoba knows that because it took it to the Supreme Court of 
Canada when Brian Mulroney was the prime minister of this 
country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on one other serious flaw I see in the package 
presented by the justice minister which she has promised to bring 
legislation in to support later this fall. She wants to have 
young offenders from ages 14 to 17 convicted in youth court for a 
series of violent offences. She has four areas of violent 
offences.  Then the crown prosecutor will have to argue with the 
judge that an adult sentence should apply.  This leaves the 
discretion to the judge as to whether or not an adult sentence or 
a sentence under the Young Offenders Act will be imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say that is wrong.  We say that because the courts are 
unaccountable to the people, that discretion should be left with 
the agent of the attorney general who will be indirectly 
accountable to the people in a democratic fashion.  The crown 
prosecutor should have the full discretion based upon the 
circumstances whether or not a violent young offender is moved 
into adult court and then if convicted, our courts have no 
alternative but to impose an adult sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we not want the judges to have this discretion?  There 
are a lot of good judges in our judicial system at the provincial 
and federal levels.  However we have seen what some of them have 
been doing with conditional sentencing.  They have thwarted the 
intent of conditional sentencing, the intent of this parliament 
in conditional sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying in this party and in this caucus that we would 
sooner give the discretion to the crown prosecutor who is 
indirectly accountable to the people through the attorney general 
of every province, rather than give that discretion to the 
judges.  I say this not without a lot of dismay and concern and 
perhaps sadness.  We have judges sitting on the bench who through 
their power and discretion of interpretation of the law and their 
use of the law, are using it in a manner not meant by the 
Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former justice minister admitted in this House that he does 
not believe a conditional sentence is an adequate sentence for a 
conviction of rape.  Yet we are seeing this happen all the way 
from B.C. right across the country to Quebec.  Cases have been 
raised in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what our colleagues from the NDP say, I think the 
people of this country want those issues of crime and violation 
of the law and the destruction of people's lives raised in this 
House. What are we here for if we are not to do that, if we are 
not to show there are weaknesses in our criminal justice system? 
To suggest otherwise is utter nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, a degree of irresponsibility has created disdain 
for this House in the minds of too many people across the country 
and a disrespect for members such as yourself and myself.  I 
should correct that.  Not yourself, Mr. Speaker, but to myself 
and my colleagues. We are looked upon as do nothing people who 
just follow the whims of the leader, in this case the Prime 
Minister who does not really care about the victims of crime, who 
does not really care about the fact that since 1984 when the 
Young Offenders Act came in, the overall crime rate has risen 
300% and the violent crime rate has risen 100%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I thank the mover of this motion for giving me the 
opportunity to place the Reform Party's approach to youth crime 
squarely before the people.  We want early detection and 
prevention.  We want the diversion programs that are springing up 
across this country.  We want them to expand.  We want them to 
have the support of this government and the provincial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the resources brought from the back end of an $11 
billion justice industry to the front end.  Not only will we 
spend a lot less money, but we will be investing money in the 
lives of these young people which will keep them out of the 
prisons and out of serious crimes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would first like to 
read the motion that we are debating today.  It states “That 
this House condemn the government for the deplorable state of 
Canada's criminal justice system, and the government's lack of 
concern for public safety” and it cites three examples 
essentially in the areas of the Young Offenders Act, sentencing, 
and victims of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reading that motion I ask myself and more particularly I ask 
the opposition if it is arguing that everything in the justice 
system is in such a deplorable state as the motion says. Should 
everything this government has done in the criminal justice 
system be condemned?  Is the opposition also condemning certain 
aspects or particular aspects of the correctional system?  Is it 
condemning the system of policing, all our judges and the entire 
Criminal Code? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the federal government is doing much more than the 
Reform Party gives it credit for and I would like to give some 
concrete examples.  Rather than generalities and the sweeping 
denunciations by the Reform Party, let us give some facts and 
figures. Let us look at what is actually going on in criminal 
justice reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start with the first fact that Canada along with the 
provinces spends in excess of $10 billion a year in the criminal 
justice system, not as the member who just spoke said, in the 
criminal justice industry, if I heard him correctly.  It shows 
the difference between the opposition members and this 
government. As I said, it includes federal and provincial 
expenditures and it covers policing, prisons, penitentiaries and 
the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments in Canada are not exactly starving the justice 
system.  As an example, the federal government itself spends 
approximately $1 billion a year to support the efforts of the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police and it spends a similar amount on 
penitentiaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the opposition is saying that the federal government is 
not spending this money strategically, that is, not targeting the 
big challenges to public safety.  Let us take spending on 
penitentiaries as just one example because I know the official 
opposition is concerned about the state of our prisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several weeks ago the solicitor general and the commissioner of 
the Correctional Service of Canada announced that 1,000 new 
correctional officers will be hired in order to strengthen the 
safety and security of our penitentiary system.  Does the 
opposition disagree with the hiring of 1,000 new staff to make 
our correctional system better?  It is not cheap but it is one 
example of setting priorities and then funding them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion by the opposition seems to imply that the government 
is ignoring the allegedly deplorable state of the justice system. 
In this regard I believe it would be worthwhile to examine the 
criminal justice agenda of the government both now and in the 
recent past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the previous session of parliament the government introduced 
over a dozen major bills amending the Criminal Code and related 
statutes. For example the agenda encompassed new measures 
targeting high risk offenders, bills dealing with prostitution 
and child sex tourism, safeguards to protect the privacy of 
complainants and witnesses in sexual offence proceedings, and 
anti-gang legislation. There were reforms to the Young Offenders 
Act and more changes to that act are going to be launched very 
shortly by the Minister of Justice. In total over 250 changes 
were made to the Criminal Code in just the last session. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the main proposals in the strategy 
for renewing the justice system for minors in order to address 
juvenile delinquency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, replacing the Young Offenders Act by the Youth 
Criminal Justice Act, which gives priority to the protection of 
society, fosters such values as the sense of responsibility, and 
calls for heavy sanctions for wrongful acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the aim of the initiative is to expand the category of 
offences for which a young offender may be brought before a 
regular court, which will include, in addition to murder, 
attempted murder, manslaughter and violent sexual assault, the 
reiteration of the facts of the crime and will lower from 16 to 
14 the age at which young offenders may be transferred to an 
ordinary court.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the legislation authorizes the publication of the 
names of all minors found guilty in regular court and eventually 
the publication of the names of minors between the ages of 14 
and 17 found guilty by a juvenile court of murder, attempted 
murder, manslaughter, violent sexual assault and other stated 
crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the proposals is for the potential establishment of 
criminal sanctions for the most dangerous and violent young 
offenders and the application of intensive resocialization and 
treatment programs and of a longer testing period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we want to encourage the establishment of a broad range 
of sanctions and effective control mechanisms, other than legal 
ones, for small time delinquents, which encourage respect, 
promote responsibility toward victims and the community, help 
minors measure the consequences of their action and enable them 
to grasp the cause and effect relationship between their crime 
and its consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the government, we are aware that prevention is society's 
best protection against juvenile delinquents.  This is why our 
strategy promotes prevention by linking reform of juvenile 
justice to other government initiatives involving childhood and 
adolescence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give you a few examples.  In the 1998 budget, 
the government allocated $32 million annually to fight 
delinquency.  A new initiative to this end will soon be 
implemented. 
It is aimed at developing short term solutions and concerns 
mainly minors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are developing, in partnership with the provinces and 
territories, a national action plan for children to address a 
fair number of the underlying causes of delinquency, namely 
child poverty, childhood development problems, lack of structure 
provided by parents, unemployment and scarce family resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 we spent $850 million to create a more generous child 
tax benefit that will have a direct impact on the health and 
well-being of children. The 1998 budget provided for this benefit 
to be increased by another $850 million by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 we increased funding for the community action program 
for children. This program supports the implementation of 
hundreds of local projects promoting the development of children 
at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 budget increased funding for the Canada prenatal 
nutrition program designed to help pregnant women in precarious 
situations, such as teens and women who abuse alcohol or other 
substances, so that they can give birth to healthy babies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the government launched a strategy against family 
violence, which provided for major changes to the criminal 
justice system in order to prevent family violence and for an 
extensive long term effort to co-ordinate policies and programs 
at all levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the government announced its Youth Employment Strategy, 
endowed with $2 billion, offering school to work transition 
services and programs for young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1998 budget the government more than doubled its 
assistance to help young people at risk make the transition from 
school to work and this money will be used to fund company 
training, career counselling, coaching and literacy programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples, the government is also developing initiatives that will 
strengthen the government strategy of promoting native justice 
with respect to minors, in close co-operation with native 
peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the Liberal government introduced the head start 
program. 
This is an early intervention program designed to provide a good 
start in life for aboriginal, Metis and Inuit children living in 
cities and major centres in the North by providing social 
assistance to their families and involving parents in 
initiatives to promote culture, health, education and nutrition. 
The budget also set aside additional funds to expand this 
programme to include children living on reserves.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention these facts and these examples, in essence this track 
record, not to encourage our government to rest on its laurels but 
rather to show that the government began with a major criminal 
law improvement agenda and it accomplished very much of it step 
by step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This administration has not abandoned its criminal justice 
agenda.  On the contrary, it has continued a sensible, well 
targeted agenda of selective law reform and program development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already alluded to the major reform process of the Young 
Offenders Act.  The Minister of Justice has also stated her 
commitment to the interests of victims of crime and has made 
announcements in this area.  She has also indicated that crime 
prevention is a priority and over the past few years the National 
Crime Prevention Council laid the groundwork for a broad based 
crime prevention strategy and the government has indicated that 
it will spend $160 million over the next five years on crime 
prevention initiatives.  Moreover, this crime prevention strategy 
will give priority to the needs of children and youth and they 
will be community targeted programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the early years of a child's life hold the key to 
forming attitudes and to producing law-abiding citizens. Crime 
prevention strategies as promised by the government will link up 
to youth justice reform and will draw individual communities into 
the process of making our neighbourhoods much safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said there were two reasons for referring to the legislative 
and program reforms from the last session.  The second point is 
that the changes made to the Criminal Code over the last four 
years are starting to pay off.  I use an example that I think 
shows the criminal justice system is not failing or falling, as 
the Reform Party would lead us to believe, into a deplorable 
state, but rather much improving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to Bill C-55, the high risk offender bill that came into 
force on August 1, 1997 as chapter 17 of the Statutes of Canada, 
1997.  The bill targeted three areas.  It built on the success of 
the dangerous offender provisions in the Criminal Code, it 
created a new sentencing category for sex offenders called long 
term offender, and it created a new form of restraining order or 
peace bond designed as a means of deterring certain individuals 
from committing violent personal injury offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dangerous offender law was changed to make an indeterminate 
sentence of detention mandatory in every case in which a 
dangerous offender finding was made.  The initial parole review 
of dangerous offenders was also changed so that the review would 
occur four years later than previously in the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Than life sentences for murder and certain other offences, the 
dangerous offender measure is the only sentencing provision in 
the code that calls for indeterminate incarceration.  Bill C-55 
made this mandatory.  It was already evident that the dangerous 
offender procedure worked. A study at the time indicated not only 
that prosecutors were using it to go after violent sex offenders 
but that use of the procedure overall was on the increase.  Since 
Bill C-55 there has been an even greater increase in the use of 
dangerous offender applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the early identification of potential dangerous 
offenders has been made easier by the creation of a national 
flagging system and by complementary efforts on the part of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flagging system which was launched two years ago involved a 
special Royal Canadian Mounted Police database that allows police 
and prosecutors to put a special flag on the file of a convicted 
offender so that any prosecutor in Canada can check the RCMP CPIC 
database to identify the most serious cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some provinces, notably British Columbia and Ontario, have their 
own mechanisms in place to identify and investigate violent 
offenders with a view to a possible dangerous offender 
application.  There is evidence that Bill C-55 and the national 
flagging system have made this task easier and, more important, a 
lot more effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 also created a new long term offender category.  It 
resembles a dangerous offender category procedure in its 
operation but targets a slightly less serious category of sex 
offender.  In fact, if the dangerous offender criteria are not 
met it is quite possible that he will be covered by the long term 
offender category in which case, having been declared a long term 
offender, he is still subject to up to 10 years of intensive 
supervision being added to his initial sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have only been two long term offender designations so far 
but the tool remains available to prosecutors and the courts and 
we can expect to see more of these designations as more 
experience is gained with the new procedure.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other main component of Bill C-55 was a new peace bond as 
section 810.2 of the Criminal Code.  Essentially it allows 
someone to seek a restraining order where there is evidence that 
an individual poses a significant risk of committing a serious 
personal injury offence.  The court can impose a restraining 
order for up to 12 months with conditions attached to it such as 
a requirement that the individual report any change of address to 
the police or correctional authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian police forces were already reporting success with a 
similar peace bond in the Criminal Code which targets potential 
pedophiles.  Section 810.2 is not only an additional crime 
prevention tool but is now being used extensively across the 
country, particularly in Ontario.  Parliament has given police, 
prosecutors and the courts one more useful tool to prevent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the section 810.2 peace bond is worth mentioning because 
provinces are starting to use these restraining orders in 
conjunction with community notification orders.  There is a 
growing trend in Canadian provinces to identify offenders who 
after released from prison still constitute a potential risk to 
the community but who can also be controlled by appropriate 
notice to the community and supportive programs for the 
ex-offender. We are finding that provinces are using section 
810.2 orders as a complementary measure to ensure that 
ex-offenders stay on the straight and narrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise Bill C-55 as only one example of a measure that is 
having impact and responds to the trends in the administration of 
justice in the provinces and the public concerns regarding crime. 
It is a measure that demonstrates this government's concern for 
public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will list many of our initiatives to show that the Reform 
motion is totally out of bounds when it states our system is in a 
deplorable state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has introduced legislation recently for the 
creation of a DNA databank which will certainly go a long way 
toward helping the police in their efforts to solve crime.  We 
have introduced $32 million a year in funding for community crime 
prevention programs. Over 5 years that amounts to $160 million. 
We have also, through the solicitor general's office, undertaken 
nationwide consultations on the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act in order to improve the overall effectiveness of 
Canada's correction system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has introduced legislation for a comprehensive 
new extradition act in order to fight international crime more 
effectively.  Let us not forget the strengthened gun control 
legislation we introduced as well as the amendments to the 
Criminal Code to prevent use of the drunkenness defence for 
general intent crimes of violence, including sexual assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also introduced measures to deal more effectively with high 
risk offenders through Bill C-55.  We passed legislation to 
improve public safety through changes in the parole and 
corrections system, including measures for easier detention of 
sex offenders in penitentiaries until the end of their sentences 
and measures to strengthen rehabilitation and treatment programs 
for sex offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We amended the Criminal Code and the Young Offenders Act to make 
it easier for peace officers to obtain DNA samples from suspects. 
We passed equally tough anti-gang measures, including the 
creation of the new criminal offence of participation in a 
criminal organization.  These tougher sentencing provisions and 
additional police powers to seize the proceeds of crime and 
organized crime and to conduct surveillance of gangs have been 
used very frequently lately, especially in my home province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We amended the Criminal Code to toughen the laws on child 
prostitution and child sex tourisms.  We amended the Criminal 
Code to tighten the faint hope clause, making it more difficult 
for offenders to obtain the right to apply for early parole and 
to prohibit persons who commit multiple murders from using 
section 745.  We amended the Criminal Code to ensure that those 
who commit crimes of hate receive harsher sentences.  I could go 
on and on with the list but I know time is running out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reassure Canadians that this government will certainly 
not sit on its laurels.  We have a very heavy agenda for the next 
session of parliament and we will continue to ensure that the 
priority we have set, not only in our ministry of the solicitor 
general but also the ministry of justice, the safety of 
Canadians, is met with concrete action.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the hon. Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Solicitor General of Canada.  I appreciated the outline of 
what his government had done which he placed before the House. 
That was refreshing, compared to what we heard from the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice who gave a 
strident and almost nervous response to her participation in the 
debate.  She simply attacked our critique of the laws and the 
manner in which some of them were being administered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague referred to 250 changes and covered them quite 
well.  There is not a hope of the child sex tourism law being 
enforced, in other words stopping Canadians from travelling to 
another country and engaging in sex with children.  This is 
window dressing to create the impression that they are doing 
something when we do not have enough money to send to Manitoba to 
keep it onside in the administration of the Young Offenders Act. 
We are to expand funding to do what for child sex tourism?  It is 
window dressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw what the government did with the faint hope clause when 
thousands upon thousands of Canadians signed petitions, phoned 
and e-mailed members of parliament, to get rid of it completely. 
They did nothing.  Clifford Olson was allowed a full court press 
with a judge and jury.  We saw that happen.  It is tinkering 
again and it is window dressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is effectiveness?  Where is safety for society? Where is 
fair and just punishment for crimes committed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We supported the new gang law which was moved through the House 
and passed a year or so ago.  The chiefs of police asked us to 
support it because it would at least open the door to an area of 
legislation not before entered into by parliament, organized 
crime.  How many individuals have been charged for belonging to a 
criminal organization or for such a crime?  We looked at that and 
we saw how ineffective and how unenforceable it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member touched a couple of times on our concern about and 
our labelling of the justice system as being in a deplorable 
state.  When a province initiates litigation to get out from 
under the administration of the Young Offenders Act as Manitoba 
is doing because there is insufficient funding coming from the 
federal department to maintain its financial agreement, surely it 
is the greatest sign that at least in this area the 
administration of justice is deteriorating badly.  I have never 
in my lifetime seen such a precedent as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General 
of Canada tell the House today whether or not his government has 
taken any action to keep the Manitoba government onside?  He must 
bear in mind that when the justice minister and the justice 
officials appeared before the standing committee weeks ago they 
had nothing to offer the Manitoba government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From that time until now has there been any agreement or offer 
made to keep Manitoba onside?  Suddenly the province of Manitoba 
will not be there to administer the Young Offenders Act and the 
federal government will have to do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member tell the House anything about dealing with 
the crisis in Manitoba with regard to the administration of the 
Young Offenders Act?  Could he offer anything?  I would be 
pleased to hear what the hon. member has to offer in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been here for 
five years.  I guess it is inherent in our democratic system or a 
tradition for the opposition to criticize the government and for 
the government to try to advance legislation and ideas.  It would 
be refreshing from time to time to hear concrete ideas from all 
opposition members. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far too often we hear criticism, criticism, criticism and never 
any concrete suggestions whatsoever to improve the system. We are 
constantly striving to improve the system.  I recall several 
attempts by the government to improve the system.  We are always 
confronted by Reform Party members in particular who vote against 
us.  They have had a fixation on trying to solve a particular 
problem.  They always invoke the memory of the Bernardos or 
Olsons of the world when we try to enact legislation.  Section 
745 legislation was a clear example of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had we had the co-operation of the parties—and I know the 
Reform Party agreed but the Bloc reneged on its 
commitment—Clifford Olson would never have been able to have a 
section 745 hearing.  The member knows full well that the 
amendments and changes we have put in place will prevent serial 
killers such as Clifford Olson from even applying under section 
745. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other initiatives like DNA, for example.  I wish we 
could evolve to a point where opposition and government members 
would work more closely together but I do not think that will 
happen.  It is the duty of opposition to criticize and I guess it 
is our duty as government members to advance and to take the 
criticism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In direct answer to the member's question, just because the 
administration of justice is the responsibility of the provinces 
does not mean that legislation is bad.  The member has identified 
a problem in the area of funding.  I reassure him that the 
Minister of Justice and our government are currently negotiating 
with not just the two provinces mentioned but with my home 
province of Quebec to make sure the provinces have the right 
tools to ensure the administration of the YOA act and other acts 
is adequate.  I believe also, though, that the provinces have a 
very important role in this regard.  It is not just the federal 
government. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
continue in the same vein as the Reform Party member who just 
spoke, the question is, did the minister come up with the money 
and did he suggest to the province of Manitoba that it take over 
responsibility for enforcing the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the parliamentary secretary represents a riding in 
Quebec, I hope that he is making his point of view known to 
cabinet or at least to his minister when he meets with him. 
I remind him—and there is even agreement on the other side 
about the figures—that an amount of between $77 million and $82 
million is owed to Quebec by the federal government for the 
implementation of the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before finding money to help Manitoba enforce a law, and 
since Quebec has been enforcing the legislation for quite some 
time, I would ask the government to pay its debt of between $77 
million and $82 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, my question has more to do with the speech made 
by the parliamentary secretary. If the hon. member was present 
when the Secretary of State for Latin America and 
Africa spoke, he may have noticed that the secretary of state 
mentioned that narcotics are at the root of several problems, 
that they are largely responsible for crime in Canada. We know 
about narcodollars, money laundering, etc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very simple question for the parliamentary secretary. 
Since Canada is known internationally as the number one country 
for money laundering—possibly hundreds of billions of dollars 
annually—what is the federal government waiting for to 
introduce legislation that would prohibit this and make it 
impossible to launder money in Canada as in other countries 
including the United States where it is a lot more difficult to 
launder money than it is here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a good question. Our 
government is concerned by this issue. We have been consulting 
the various stakeholders for two years now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the House and the hon. member that, by this fall, 
the solicitor general will introduce a bill providing for 
various controls over money laundering, as well as other 
appropriate measures.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Colleagues in other departments—and I am referring to the likes 
of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration—will try to 
review the legislation to stop or prevent organized crime from 
committing crimes in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be pointed out that Canada and the United States 
share the longest undefended border in the world, which makes it 
easy to enter our country. We are nonetheless addressing the 
issue, and I can assure the hon. member that the minister does 
understand the issue and will soon be introducing legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Surrey 
North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to make a few corrections for the Liberal member 
opposite who just spoke.  He said that Reform has not given many 
concrete suggestions.  How totally inaccurate that is.  Look at 
what happened to the victims bill of rights that was passed in 
the House.  The Liberals consequently swept it under the rug. 
Listen to what we said about DNA samples and how they should be 
treated just like fingerprinting to give the police an adequate 
tool.  The Liberals dismissed that out of hand.  Time after time 
we give positive suggestions and they are completely disregarded. 
For him to say that we are not giving positive suggestions is 
totally inaccurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This afternoon we are dealing with a topic of great concern to 
all Canadians right across the country.  As I go through my 
speech I know the Liberals will say that I am using examples that 
are not representative of our justice system.  That is again 
totally inaccurate.  The examples that I will relate are good 
examples that illustrate what is broken and what needs to be 
fixed.  The Liberals should be listening very carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first example is Billy Jo who was not hungry to see the man 
who raped her rot behind bars.  However she did not expect him, a 
few weeks after his conviction for rape, to be at her local 
grocery store.  She said “I expected him to be in prison”.  She 
is 24 years old and lives near Windsor, Ontario. She said “I was 
amazed and very angry to see him there.  My first reaction was to 
protect my children.  I was scared for my kids.  He had never 
seen them before and I didn't want him to.  I shoved them under 
my coat and I rushed out”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This man received 18 months of house arrest.  Why?  It was 
because of the government's policy, the thing it is so proud of, 
of conditional sentencing which allowed this person to spend not 
even one day behind bars for a brutal sexual assault.  That is a 
symptom of what is wrong with our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put this in context.  What is the primary purpose of 
government?  In a civilized society the primary role of a 
government is to provide for the peace and safety of its 
citizens.  When Reform chose this topic today and wanted to have 
the government discuss it, it was striking at the very heart of 
why we organize ourselves in a civilized society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need the rule of law.  We need proper enforcement of the law. 
We need to live by rules that we have all agreed upon, and they 
must be properly enforced so that the citizens of a nation are 
free to pursue their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will relate three principles today that I believe must be used 
to test to see whether our justice system is the proper justice 
system.  First, the laws must simple, clear and easy to 
understand for everyone in society.  If the laws are too complex 
and not easy to grasp they will not be respected.  Those laws 
must be fair. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1245
<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the laws must be enforced equally.  If they are not 
enforced equally and if every citizen is not treated equally 
before the law, that law will not be respected.  There must be no 
exemptions.  There must be no special status for certain people 
under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third principle is that if the laws are broken, there must 
be clear consequences or punishment.  If we do not have that in 
our justice system, we will not have the respect for the law that 
we should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because this government is not taking those three foundational 
principles into consideration when it passes laws and enforces 
those laws, we are having the problems we are having. They are 
three basic principles of justice.  That is why we are debating 
this topic today.  This government has failed in implementing 
these principles in the legislation and in the enforcement of 
that legislation through the country's law enforcement agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The laws are too complex. I have had a lot of dealings with the 
gun registration system.  It is not fair and it will not be 
respected.  It is much too complex for one thing. There are 128 
pages of legislation with almost as many pages of regulations 
which were brought in.  The Liberals a couple of weeks ago 
defended it by saying it is no more complex than the Income Tax 
Act. Just think about that type of defence, saying that it is no 
more complex than the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I know about that system is that someone can get 
up to 10 years for not registering a firearm.  It may be a 
firearm that is lying in the basement of their house. It may be 
an antique.  It may not have been looked at or used for a long 
time. To be made a criminal and to be imprisoned for 10 years 
because of that is totally unacceptable. It causes people to 
disrespect the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the example I already gave of 18 months not even in 
closed custody for a brutal rape.  Compare those two.  That is 
why people ask questions about what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again the firearms act will not be applied equally to all 
citizens.  Citizens of a certain race living in certain areas 
will not have that law apply.  The justice minister said that we 
have one law for all but it will be flexible in its application. 
There is a problem right there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certain provinces wanting to opt out of the Young 
Offenders Act.  Over half of the population of Canada, the 
provinces that represent over half the people of Canada want to 
opt out of the registration system. There is a problem when a 
government is trying to impose something on people that they are 
resisting.  They have not agreed that this is a law which they 
want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about another very recent example in my riding.  A 
horrific murder took place approximately a month ago. A young 
mother was killed by her husband.  The house was burned.  Her 
body was found later.  The trial is not over, however when the 
man was put under arrest, he was released on bail. What would be 
an appropriate bail to set for someone like this?  Do you know 
what it was set at, Mr. Speaker?  Three thousand dollars and he 
was let out. That man is walking the streets today. Not only 
that, but the judge gave him custody of the children. The people 
in that community are very angry.  They are very agitated that we 
have a justice system that would allow for this kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you do not know the agony it has caused me as these 
people contact me and relate their concern.  They question a 
system that is going to allow for this kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law needs to be seen as fair to all and applied properly. 
Members can look at the case that I have just sketched very 
briefly.  I will not go into detail. 
Look at it through the eyes of the victims.  The parents of this 
woman who was killed see what is going on.  They are absolutely 
shocked.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the terrible murder which took place in the southern 
part of my riding where these people lured an elderly gentleman 
out and brutally killed him as he tried to help them with their 
vehicle.  What happened to them?  This was murder. They were 
punished and are out two and a half years later.  We have huge 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have visited the inmates in the prisons across Canada.  I have 
asked them what advice they would give me as an MP in the House 
of Commons.  These are inmates in the prisons.  Several of them 
have told me voluntarily “I wish they would have gotten tougher 
with me sooner.  When I started acting up as a young person, I 
wish they would have done something”.  People who have fallen 
afoul of the law, who have received sentences from 10 to 25 years 
are saying why do we not get tougher sooner with young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not even half done my speech.  There are so many things 
which I think are important.  I will try to squeeze them in later 
in the day.  All of these things have to be put into perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to talk about the family and the need for strengthening 
the family in Canada.  We need to have this balance.  We are not 
just talking about becoming tougher.  We have to apply the law 
fairly.  There are other aspects.  I will emphasize them later on 
in the day.  I hope I will have time to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole topic and the three principles I have related need to 
be emphasized over and over.  I wish the Liberals would test 
their laws by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  In view of the fact that my colleague from 
Yorkton—Melville is making some excellent points which need to 
be brought out in terms of this debate, it seems to me it would 
be in order to ask for unanimous consent that his time be 
extended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to extend 
the time for the hon. member? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There is no consent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do not understand why the government would not give 
unanimous consent but so be it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the member's speech.  He made some excellent 
points.  I would like to ask the member a question.  I was always 
taught to believe that when a government is elected its foremost 
responsibility is to the law-abiding citizens of the country.  At 
least that was always my belief.  Since I have been in parliament 
I no longer doubt that it is the case, but I know that it is no 
longer the case with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to get the opinion of the member.  It seems that 
the criminal element of our country has far more rights than the 
victims do today.  We had a case in my constituency a little 
while ago where a husband stabbed his wife to death.  He stabbed 
her 37 times.  He was only given three years. What kind of a 
message does that send to our youth and to the rest of the 
Canadian citizens who are looking for some kind of leadership 
from this government which they have yet to receive?  Does the 
member see the same problem? Does the criminal element of this 
country seem to have far more rights than the victims? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague 
makes a very good point. The criminal element does have more 
rights than the victims.  That is why we brought in the victims 
bill of rights several years ago.  The Liberals swept it under 
the rug and refused to bring it back to parliament. It was a bill 
that was passed with huge support in this House.  I do not know 
why it has been stalled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminals today have access to all kinds of money for their 
defence but the victims have access to virtually nothing. The 
criminal is read all of his rights.  He is told all about the 
wonderful programs that are available and all the things that he 
has access to, such as legal aid and so on.  The victims have 
access to none of them.  The victims have to constantly contact 
the courts and the police to find out what is happening in a 
particular case and how the people who have committed the 
horrific crime against them are treated. 
Those are just two examples of how the criminal in our society is 
almost elevated and given all these wonderful rights and the 
victim is given nothing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When those criminals get into prison I cannot believe some of 
the things that are given to them that the rest of the people 
even in my little community never enjoy.  Golf courses, wonderful 
pool tables, terrific training facilities, cable TV, health and 
dental services, all of these things that they assume are their 
right. I could not believe that some of them live at a standard 
that is higher than the seniors in my community.  Fourteen 
wonderful cottages. The only responsibility they have other than 
making sure they clean the microwave and that the TV is turned 
off at night is to keep it clean.  Seniors in my hometown shake 
their heads when they see the type of facilities that are 
provided for these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to seriously question the justice system that allows 
this injustice to take place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to speak to such a worthwhile motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I have not been here as a member of parliament for very 
long, I have been here long enough to understand that today's 
debate will likely not encourage the government to pursue 
meaningful changes or improvements. The government does not 
appear to be too interested in changing the status quo.  In fact 
I would go so far as to say it is primarily responsible for most 
of the ills and complaints that our citizens have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion makes three specific recommendations: one, to 
strengthen the Young Offenders Act; two, to abolish conditional 
sentencing for violent offenders; and three, to introduce a 
victims bill of rights. These three issues are prominent reasons 
why I became a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previously I had been actively involved in pursuing improvements 
to the Young Offenders Act.  I was able to review the proposals 
made by the member for Crowfoot in his minority report subsequent 
to the 10-year review of the Young Offenders Act. His proposals 
helped me to choose the Reform Party as being the most likely 
opportunity to achieve improvements to our laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just days ago the Minister of Justice finally announced her 
youth justice strategy.  After almost a year on the job we 
expected some comprehensive legislation in response to last 
year's justice committee recommendations to significantly change 
laws regarding young offenders.  Instead of legislation the 
minister produced a strategy.  The minister has become so fond of 
the term “in a timely fashion” to describe her intentions 
regarding change that I believe she may have difficulty in 
understanding what that term actually means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act was first made law in 1985.  The 10-year 
review was not completed until 12 years later.  It then took a 
year for the minister to ignore some of the key recommendations 
and merely announce what she hopes to do in the coming fall 
session.  Meanwhile she intends to spend many more months 
studying, reviewing and analysing. I have heard that law 
professors are known for studying and analysing.  I guess those 
among them who come to this place have difficulty in 
understanding that a minister has a responsibility to do 
something about a problem, not merely study it to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate that these comments may sound somewhat harsh but 
young offender legislation is of particular interest to myself 
and my family.  Each day the minister reacts “in a timely 
fashion” means that additional victims in communities have to 
live with what even she has admitted to be seriously flawed 
legislation.  And it is seriously flawed in spite of the attempts 
by her predecessor to address the failings of the Young Offenders 
Act, but I will save further comment in that regard for a future 
date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of victims rights, I introduced Private Members' 
Bill C-294 last December.  It is intended to balance the rights 
of victims and the rights of criminals.  For years Canadians have 
complained that this government falls over backward to ensure 
that criminals receive all their rights and all their freedoms 
while not being nearly so vigilant as to ensure that victims and 
society at large also receive due consideration for their rights 
and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill would provide a formal recognition of victims as a party 
to the criminal justice system.  The system would be mandated to 
keep victims informed of developments in their case.  There would 
be provision for the broader use of victims impact statements and 
restitution could be ordered for psychological harm done to 
victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over two years ago the former justice minister promised to 
address his government's failure to properly amend our laws and 
to fully recognize the interest of victims.  At that time he 
stated “Although steps have been made toward progress in recent 
years, they have been imperfect.  There remains a great deal to 
be done”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost a year ago the present Minister of Justice stated: “We 
have not done enough to accommodate the interests of victims 
within the criminal justice system”.  Canadians are still 
waiting.  Our laws are still inadequate and the government still 
has done nothing to address the interests of victims within the 
criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice committee has finally begun to consider the issue, 
but will the government have the fortitude to act?  Only time 
will tell.  Hopefully for the sake of victims of crime and 
society at large it will approach victims rights in a responsible 
manner, but I know better than to hold my breath. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now move on to the issue of abolishing conditional 
sentences for violent offenders.  It is distressing that we even 
have to resort to a motion in an attempt to convince the 
government to do what it should have done over three years ago. 
The former government brought conditional sentences into the 
Criminal Code in 1995 through Bill C-41.  Reform has no 
difficulty with the concept of alternative measures and 
conditional sentences, but we did argue to limit them to 
non-violent offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former minister in his infinite wisdom decided that he would 
not and could not give credit to the Reform Party for exposing 
his failure to appreciate the ramifications of unlimited 
conditional sentences.  He initially held the position that of 
course the courts would not apply conditional sentencing for 
violent offenders.  We all know the courts did use these lenient 
provisions for violent criminal acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court said that if parliament intended to limit the 
provision it should have said so in the statute.  What did the 
minister do?  He pretended that it was a problem of 
interpretation by the courts and to assist them he again tinkered 
with the legislation.  In Bill C-17 which passed in 1997 he made 
minor changes to section 742.1 of the Criminal Code to try to 
direct judges as to when to permit conditional sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should have said something more to the effect that thou shalt 
not use conditional sentences for violent offenders and drug 
traffickers.  I guess that was too direct and uncomplicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of mess are we in?  For one thing the former minister 
has definitely helped his colleagues in the legal profession.  A 
little legislative issue has generated millions of dollars for 
those at the legal bar.  It has cost taxpayers in many different 
ways.  Cases have to be appealed, justice is delayed until cases 
are finally adjudicated to closure, appeal courts are clogged 
with matters that never should have been an issue, and our crowns 
are tied up with arguments and cases which should have been 
straightforward.  After three years of outstanding government 
ineptitude the minister of timely fashion has announced that 
maybe we should study the issue of conditional sentencing to 
determine why it is being used for unacceptable violent offences. 
Perhaps she should review some of the decisions of the various 
courts of appeal.  She will soon realize how our justice system 
is being thrown into disrepute over this provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Derek Anderson Austin, convicted of cultivating marijuana and 
possession for the purpose of trafficking, received a conditional 
sentence.  He had a long record, including possession, 
trafficking, four failures to appear, driving while disqualified, 
unlawfully at large and obstruction of police.  On appeal the 
court of appeal stated: “We are very surprised that such a 
person would be given a conditional sentence”. What happened? 
Nothing, because the sentence had already been served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who receive conditional sentences together with 
community service.  The lawyers ensure that some or all of the 
community service is completed before an appeal can be heard.  At 
that point the hands of the appeal court are tied as the offender 
has already been punished and it would be illegal to incarcerate 
them.  The former minister of justice solved the problem of our 
growing prison population by providing even those who deserve to 
be imprisoned with this lenient and abused conditional sentencing 
provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Court cases are brimming over with examples of individuals who 
obtained conditional sentences in appropriate circumstances but 
the courts of appeal were barred from rectifying matters because 
some or all of the sentence had in effect already been served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ronald John Schmidt received a nine month custodial sentence for 
sexual assault.  He told his seven-year old victim not to tell 
anyone or he would do it again.  He appealed for a conditional 
sentence even though none existed at the time he was sentenced. 
He was granted a nine month conditional sentence.  There are a 
number of cases of sexual assault by persons in positions of 
trust over children where conditional sentences have been 
imposed.  Conditional sentencing does not carry with it society's 
denunciation for these offences.  Deterrence will not be effected 
by such leniency.  Parliament's support for these inappropriate 
sentencing provisions will only reduce the standards of our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are hundreds of other cases of improper and questionable 
use of conditional sentencing for violent offences but my time 
will not permit me to go into them in detail. 
We have a flawed Young Offenders Act and a minister who is taking 
forever to do what she could have done years ago.  We have 
promises upon promises to address victims rights issues but the 
government wants more studies.  We have a sentencing regime which 
permits violent offenders to serve their sentences at home.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the member's speech with interest.  I have 
a couple of questions for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I travelled around my constituency back home in 
Okanagan—Shuswap, I had occasion to drop into the schools every 
now and then.  I am finding more and more often as I visit the 
schools and talk to the young people that they themselves are 
afraid.  They are afraid of a few people of their generation who 
have some of them living in fear, fear of wearing certain clothes 
to school and fear sometimes of taking money to school in case it 
is taken from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the member has run into that type of 
situation as he has travelled around his constituency.  Is this 
also going on in his area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.  It is an important question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I became a member of this place I spent a lot of time in 
the schools over the past five years talking to young people 
about violence, trying to work with them and trying to make them 
understand the ramifications.  It certainly has been my 
experience over those years from the number of young people I 
have talked to in the schools that there is fear among our youth. 
They are the majority of victims of youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dare say that when a class full of high school students is 
asked what it would do with the Young Offenders Act I find that 
most students would be far more harsh than anything members have 
ever heard from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That explains the kind of fear students experience in their 
schools.  It is not only something I have seen in my riding or 
the hon. members has seen in his.  I have seen this throughout 
B.C. at every school and youth group that I have had the pleasure 
of addressing on these issues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for his intervention.  I know he has spent considerable 
time working with victims groups across Canada, particularly in 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he would share with the House and with people who 
are watching at home the sense of frustration and bitterness and 
anger people feel once they realize the justice system is 
weighted much more toward the criminals and those accused of 
violent crimes than the victims of those crimes.  Maybe he could 
share with us some thoughts and some flavour of the sentiments of 
people who have been deeply touched by violent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My experience over the past number of years with victims groups 
and with individual victims certainly highlights the stresses 
imposed on victims, particularly the families of victims of 
homicide.  These are cases that obviously inflict incredible 
trauma and stress among the families.  The last thing they need 
is to not be told what is going on, and this happens time and 
time again.  It does not happen all the time, I must admit. 
Through my own experience I am not afraid to basically go to the 
horse's mouth for the answers.  But most people cannot do that 
sort of thing.  It delays the grieving process.  It is part of 
dealing with the issue to be kept informed and to be able to talk 
about these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard of cases where a person takes an afternoon off to 
go to court because somebody who is accused is supposed to appear 
and when they get there they find out the accused appeared in the 
morning and nobody bothered to tell them about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of cases where an accused has been released on parole and 
their victim has come across them on the main street in town. It 
retraumatizes victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims rights legislation and dealing with those kinds of 
issues regarding specifically notification and the victim's role 
in the criminal justice process is long overdue.  I am happy to 
say the justice committee is finally starting to hear testimony 
on this.  We will keep our fingers crossed and see what the 
government plans to do.  Like I said in my speech, I am not going 
to hold my breath for a long time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we see the spectacle of the opposition attempting to 
lead Canadians to believe that our criminal justice system is in 
a deplorable state.  With hyperbole and theatrics it plays 
directly into the hands of criminals by promoting fear and 
exploiting victims for its own political purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its motion for debate states, without demonstrating it of 
course, that our justice system is broken and that this 
government has done nothing to fix it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make one thing very clear. Our criminal justice 
system is one of the best in the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian criminal justice system is not broken.  According 
to a Gallup poll released in March of this year only one quarter 
of Canadians say they are fearful to walk at night in their 
neighbourhoods.  This is the lowest level of fear in 12 similar 
surveys in the last 29 years, since 1970.  It is also a 
significant drop from the 37% level in 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has done more in the last parliament than any 
other government in the past to modernize our criminal law and to 
make it more efficient.  We have continued to bring forward 
progressive measures for the purpose of improving what is already 
an efficient system that protects Canadians better than any in 
other democratic societies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is irresponsible to repeat without having our facts straight 
that crime is on the rise or that the situation is out of 
control.  We do not have the right as responsible 
parliamentarians to create unnecessary and unfounded fear in 
Canadians when the facts do not support the bare assertions being 
made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want and deserve a safe society and we as a government 
are committed to ensuring just that.  My predecessor made more 
than 250 amendments to the Criminal Code, a record that is surely 
unsurpassed.  He did this in the areas of child prostitution, 
high risk offenders, gun control and organized crime, to name a 
few.  He also began the process of reforming our youth justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this parliament the government has taken strong measures to 
provide law enforcement with the tools it needs to enforce the 
law.  In less than a year we have proposed Canadian legislative 
measures that reflect our commitment to more effective law 
enforcement without abridging the values all Canadians share and 
which are enshrined in our Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-16 we have given back to law enforcement the ability 
to do its job without jeopardizing the constitutionality of those 
powers.  This government tabled Bill C-20 which will give federal 
law enforcement officials the power to go after those who target 
the more vulnerable in our society for the purpose of defrauding 
them through telemarketing fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government tabled Bill C-18 which gives customs officers 
the powers of peace officers at border posts for the purpose of 
stopping illegal activity. This government tabled Bill C-3 which 
will provide for the creation of a DNA databank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago I tabled Bill C-40 which will give Canada a 
modern extradition regime to ensure that those who are wanted 
abroad for crimes committed will be brought to justice in an 
expeditious manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exactly two weeks ago I announced this government's strategy for 
renewing Canada's youth justice system.  It is a strategy that 
addresses youth crime and is much broader than simply amending 
existing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that Canadians want a youth justice system that 
protects society.  They want a system that fosters values such as 
respect for others and their property.  They want a system that 
insists on accountability and that provides both violent and 
non-violent youth offenders with meaningful consequences for 
their actions, and they want a youth justice system that responds 
to the needs of victims and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I announced last week that the system will be improved to 
reflect these concerns.  We can do much more to prevent youth 
crime in the first place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must respond more firmly and more effectively to the small 
number of the most serious violent young offenders whose actions 
and how they are dealt with can impact most profoundly on the 
credibility of our youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can develop and employ more effective and meaningful 
community based responses for the majority of non-violent youth, 
more effective and meaningful for the young person, the victim 
and the community.  We can also do a better job of reforming and 
rehabilitating young offenders to increase the chances that they 
do not re-offend and that they become productive and responsible 
members of Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will replace the Young Offenders Act with a new youth 
criminal justice act.  We will build on the strengths of the 
Young Offenders Act but address its weaknesses.  We will send a 
signal to Canadians of all ages that there is a new youth justice 
regime in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new legislation will propose changes to several areas.  We 
will develop more meaningful consequences for the most serious 
and violent young offenders.  It will propose to replace the 
current procedure for transfer to adult court with a process of 
transfer to adult sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also be proposing an important change in relation to the 
publication of names.  The debate on this issue essentially 
involves two legitimate and competing values:  the need to 
encourage rehabilitation by avoiding the negative effect of 
publicity on youth versus the need for greater openness and 
transparency in the justice system.  Both values are important, 
but I do not feel that the current legislation reflects the 
appropriate balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act will permit the publication of the names upon 
conviction of all young offenders who qualify for an adult 
sentence.  Publication of the names of 14 to 17 year olds given a 
youth sentence for murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, 
aggravated sexual assault or repeat serious offences could also 
be permitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the Reform Party which apparently believes in throwing 10 
year olds into the formal criminal justice system, I do not 
propose to lower the minimum age.  The standing committee 
recommended that in exceptional cases 10 and 11 year olds 
suspected of committing extremely violent offences be subject to 
the criminal regime for youth.  They made a thoughtful argument 
for doing so, namely, to provide a safety valve to capture the 
very small number of youth who may not get picked up by child 
welfare or mental health systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This recommendation has been seriously considered by this 
government.  However, rather than criminalizing the behaviour of 
children at such a young age, the government has decided to work 
with the provinces to find a more appropriate way of dealing with 
these few tragic individuals who are obviously desperately in 
need of professional help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will reduce the legal complexities in determining whether 
voluntary statements by youth can be admitted into evidence.  I 
will make changes that respond to victims' concerns about 
adequate notification of proceedings and access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, I will change the rules to allow the provinces to 
recover the costs of court appointed counsel after the 
proceedings from parents and young people who are fully capable 
of paying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meaningful consequences for violent offenders, however, require 
more than firmer sentences, tighter rules and control.  We want 
to develop in consultation with the provinces a special sentence 
for the small group of the most violent, high risk young 
offenders.  This sentence would allow for long periods of custody 
and treatment for young offenders who commit murder, attempted 
murder, manslaughter or aggravated sexual assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have an obligation to ensure that all young offenders, 
including the most serious, receive effective treatment and 
rehabilitation.  It is in their interest and ours that they be, 
upon release, productive, well adjusted Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our strategy will increase the emphasis placed on treatment of 
all offenders, including provisions for mandatory treatment, as 
part of the special sentencing for the most violent young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has proposed a balanced, integrated youth justice 
strategy that goes beyond a simple reform of existing youth 
justice legislation.  There is a consensus in Canada that the 
time for change is now.  I look forward to continuing to work 
with concerned Canadians and concerned parliamentarians to create 
a fair and effective youth justice system in which we can all 
have confidence.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now turn briefly to conditional sentencing.  The creation 
of a new sentencing option was the centrepiece of the 
comprehensive sentencing reform package introduced in the last 
parliament by my predecessor.  While primarily intended for 
non-violent offences, the appropriate use of conditional sentence 
orders in cases involving personal injury is permitted in the 
code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me simply say in relation to conditional sentencing that I 
have asked the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights to 
review the first two years of conditional sentences and I look 
forward to its recommendations and guidance on this important 
subject. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
find it interesting that the minister mentioned that 25% of 
Canadians are afraid to walk the streets.  That means that one 
member of a family of four is afraid to walk the streets at 
night.  I would like to inform the minister that one quarter of 
my family of four walked down the street one night, unafraid, and 
I now have a family of three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend Chris Simmonds had his family reduced from four to 
three by a man who was out on bail after shooting a man in the 
face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister really feel that 25% of Canadians being afraid 
to walk the streets is acceptable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know why he is 
saying that.  As usual the official opposition misrepresents 
situations for its own short term political purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, 25% of Canadians did express a fear in terms of walking 
on the streets in their communities.  Obviously nobody is 
suggesting that is acceptable.  However, because of the actions 
of this government what we have seen is a decrease from 37% of 
Canadians who expressed that view to 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly my goal and the goal of this government is to ensure 
that all Canadians live in safe and secure communities.  Perhaps, 
as opposed to the hysterical fearmongering of the official 
opposition, if they worked constructively with us we would see 
safer and more secure communities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to say that I am very glad to see the 
minister here in the House.  She has obviously displayed a great 
depth of knowledge on these criminal justice issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initiatives that she has taken in this policy platform are 
certainly welcome initiatives, but legislation is what is vital. 
This session of parliament is coming to a close and we are yet to 
see some substantive legislative initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten year olds, she said, might be thrown in jail if a change was 
made to the Criminal Code that would hold them accountable.  I 
suggest that is not the truth.  The fact is, having a system in 
place that would bring youth into the system at the age of 10 
would allow her government to bring about the necessary change 
that would encompass and hold young offenders responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to question the minister on what policy direction we 
are going to see this government take with respect to the area of 
parental responsibility, which is a huge problem in the area of 
youth justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to ask, when is the money going to be put 
out?  When are we going to see some of the figures to indicate 
what these initiatives are going to cost Canadian taxpayers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me make it 
absolutely plain, as I and other members of this government have 
done over the past number of weeks.  Nobody is suggesting that 10 
and 11 year olds should not be responsible for the harm they 
create or be held accountable in ways that are commensurate with 
their age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the hon. member knows this because of his experience 
in the justice system in Nova Scotia.  We have three systems in 
which young people can be picked up:  we have the child welfare 
system, we have the mental health system and we have the criminal 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying as a government is that we believe, when we 
are dealing with children, when we are dealing with 10 and 11 
year olds, that the best way to deal with the harm and make those 
young people accountable and responsible and help them to recover 
from what has happened in their lives is to make sure that they 
are dealt with through the child welfare or mental health 
systems.  My pledge is to work with the provinces to ensure that 
they have, in part, the resources to be able to make sure those 
kids are picked up and do not fall through the cracks.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough—Agincourt, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to see the minister moving in that 
direction.  There was a serious offence in 1984 in my riding of 
Scarborough—Agincourt.  In 1989, when we were both novices here, 
I presented a private member's bill.  After 10 years a lot of the 
recommendations I presented are coming to light.  I want to thank 
the minister for moving in that direction.  It is an honour to be 
part of a government that has seen the light at the end of the 
tunnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could we not look at the legislation for automatic transfers? 
Could we not look for mandatory treatment?  For a serious crime 
like a killing where the young offender is over 14 we could 
automatically transfer that case to adult court.  We have 
mandatory treatment.  If the young offender refuses mandatory 
treatment we could withhold these special considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the reality is that we 
can force no one, adult or child, to submit to mandatory 
treatment.  However, it is obviously possible to help a young 
person or an adult to understand that it would be in their long 
term best interests to participate in some sort of treatment 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The animating spirit behind the member's question is important. 
Even with the most serious and violent young offenders it is 
important for us as a society to ensure they are provided with 
the necessary treatment programs to ensure their long term and 
eventual successful rehabilitation and reintegration into 
society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I seek the unanimous 
consent of the House to extend this portion of the debate.  We 
have the minister with us.  I am sure the minister would love to 
be here for an extended time to answer the many questions— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is the House prepared to give its 
consent to extend the time for questions and comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not hear consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of 
order. 
Is it appropriate for the minister herself to say no, that she 
would not extend the— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The question is not who does or does 
not say no.  The Speaker puts the question to the House.  There 
was not consent.  Consent was refused.  The Speaker is not saying 
who said it.  I do not know who said it.  I heard no, and that is 
enough. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I actually said it because I wanted to have an opportunity, if 
the members do not object, to put some thoughts on the record on 
this very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  You may not enjoy them.  You say good, 
but you may not enjoy them.  I can assure you that some of them 
will reflect on your philosophy and policies.  I do not think 
they will— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know the hon. member for 
Mississauga West will want to address his remarks through the 
Chair rather than to some “you”.  I realize he has not named 
another member, in his view, but I would invite him to address 
his remarks through the Chair please.  It might help in the 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will suggest through 
you that they may not think my remarks are particularly good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested in one of the comments made by the minister in 
response to a question from a member opposite.  She said that 
their issue is for their short term political purposes.  Just 
about everything they do in here is for their short term 
political purposes.  The operative phrase should be short term. 
That is exactly what they do.  They do not think in the bigger 
picture or in the long term about the consequences of some of 
their policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like to think of them not so much as the Reform Party, but as 
the “ing” party because the Reform Party's three cornerstones 
are based on caning, whipping and hanging.  Those are the 
solutions of the “ing” party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the members opposite do 
not seem to agree with that.  Let me share with everyone 
something spoken by one of the Reform Party members.  I believe 
the member for Wild Rose said in the May 10, 1994 Edmonton 
<I>Journal</I> “I do not think that kind of punishment hurts one 
doggone bit”.  He was referring to caning.  “In fact I think it 
probably has more effect than what we do today”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice critic for the “ing” party decided that he wanted 
to travel to Singapore to study the merits of introducing caning 
to Canada's justice system.  What a spectacle. Imagine in our 
public places, in our courtyards, in our school yards, in our 
homes that we would actually resort to caning as a solution to 
violence.  That is the Reform mentality.  If we cane them it will 
hurt so they will stop being violent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not profess to be an expert, unlike many members opposite, 
but I have read many articles written by experts and any expert 
will tell us that violence begets violence. That is exactly the 
kind of thing we want to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same member went on to say “I do not think caning is too 
extreme”.  That is from the Calgary <I>Herald</I> of May 10, 
1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party, or the “ing” party as I like to call it, has 
not excluded young offenders from what it refers to as its two 
strike and you are out policy.  This would mean, as the justice 
critic who is sitting here right now listening to this, said in 
the Toronto <I>Sun</I> of August 15, 1996 “the repeat 
offender”—and because they have not excluded young offenders, 
young offenders would be included in this policy—“will never 
see the light of day after committing his second act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is just terrific.  That is going to solve our problems.  We 
will throw them in a dungeon, lock them up and forget about them. 
Young offenders need to be treated properly by professionals not 
locked up in some medieval archaic way as that party would 
profess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the member from Wild Rose has come in, the member who was 
illustriously quoted in the Edmonton <I>Sun</I> in March 1995 in 
referring to his time as a school principal.  He saw remarkable 
change in behaviour among those who had “tasted a piece of 
wood”.  That is just brilliant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a remarkable quantum leap to go from the motion that was 
put very responsibly by the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, 
whom I saw on <I>Canada AM</I> this morning speaking about his 
policy on the headstart program dealing with young people.  It is 
a quantum leap in logic to go from dealing with a pregnant woman 
and helping her give birth and raise a healthy, happy child to 
caning, to hitting them with a piece of wood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where in the world did you guys come from? When they loaded up 
the wagon train to come east I guess they checked their brains at 
the Manitoba border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know the hon. member is perhaps 
enjoying the rhetoric but I think he knows he must address the 
Chair rather than any of the “you guys” he may be referring to. 
I invite him to continue to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my apologies.  It becomes 
a little frustrating when we read some of the things those hon. 
members have talked about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another problem.  The hon. members from the “ing” 
party across are confused.  Some of the members want to scrap the 
Young Offenders Act and some of them simply want to amend it. The 
member for Nanaimo—Cowichan stated in <I>Hansard</I> in March 
1998 “As the justice minister dreams about changes to the Young 
Offenders Act, violent acts among youth are escalating and 
revealing why the Young Offenders Act should be scrapped”. 
Then we have others like the member from Wild Rose saying “When 
are you going to amend the Young Offenders Act?” 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some of the extreme right saying to scrap it and then we 
have others who generally are seen as being on the even more 
extreme right saying to amend it.  Their own policies in this 
place do not coincide with the policies of their own party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear one of those members stand up and tell me 
why they would not support replacing the Young Offenders Act with 
new stronger youth justice legislation.  That has been announced 
by our minister.  Why would they not support that?  Do they just 
want to be negative?  Do they not want to have input into it? 
This is a policy.  They have a chance to have input into it. All 
Canadians will have that chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would they not support expanding the offences for which a 
young offender can receive an adult sentence to include a pattern 
of serious violent offences? I have heard members opposite call 
for that.  The minister has said she agrees with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What seems to be the problem here?  Why do we not just get on 
with it?  Let us take that policy statement and build it into 
legislation.  That is what the Canadian people expect us to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister would not agree to lower the age to 10 but why 
would it be 10 by the members opposite?  Why not nine?  Why not 
eight? In fact, as a parent of three young men I am a firm 
believer that if you have not put your values into your children 
by the time they are seven years old, then you may have lost 
them. The first seven years of a young person's life are probably 
the most critical years in their entire life.  Why not seven? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us do what they have suggested.  Seven years old, they 
commit a crime, we throw them away.  They do it again, we throw 
them in a dungeon and lock them up.  What kind of a society would 
we be purporting to represent if we were to adopt those kinds of 
policies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has said that the bill will lower the age limit for 
which young offenders are presumed liable to adult sentences from 
16 to 14.  Why would they not support that?  It is a positive 
step in the right direction, things that many members opposite 
have called for, some who are not quite so extreme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would expand the provisions allowing the publication of the 
names of young offenders who have been convicted and who qualify 
for adult sentences. But no, what the Reform Party wants does not 
matter if they qualify for an adult sentence or not.  If they 
commit a crime, their names should be published.  They should be 
tarred for the rest of their life, instead of working with those 
young people to help educate them, to help teach them that 
violence is not a solution. They are not taught that by smacking 
them on the back with a cane or hitting them on the rump with a 
piece of wood. That party is spouting archaic nonsense. Those 
members should be ashamed of themselves. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
obviously this fellow missed his spankings when he was a young 
person.  That is pretty obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 10 years, since the Young Offenders Act, 1984, 
2,400 cases of violence were recorded.  Now it is up to 24,000 
and climbing which is over a 100% increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand where the member is coming from.  Articles 
come out like the one today, May 26 “Teachers in Montreal's 
largest school board, the Montreal Catholic School Commission are 
rightly denouncing the climate for fear and violence in which far 
too many of them are forced to work. In the past two years, MCSC 
teachers have reported 90 incidents in which they have been 
physically assaulted by students, 30% in cases considered so 
serious that police were called in. Teachers were punched, 
kicked, choked, bitten and scratched. They have had chairs, bags 
and books thrown at them.  They have had desks pushed into them. 
This March a teacher abruptly left her job after finding out that 
one of her students, a member of a gang, had put a price on her 
head”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we have come to.  There are guys like that member 
who probably majored in bleeding heart 101 when he went to 
university, if he got that far, teardrop 102 and all the other 
socialist subjects they teach in these garbage places, so he can 
come here, stand and brag about how wonderful a job they are 
doing.  And we have over a 100% increase in that kind of a crime. 
He is close to my age.  Surely he was brought up a little better 
than that in the schools.  I do not think that we had that kind 
of a problem when I went to school. I know we did not when I was 
a principal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the member explain this terrible increase in crime? 
Does a little bit of discipline not ring some bells in his 
brainless head? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the best four years of my 
life were not in grade nine, unlike the member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer, the problem is very real in terms of discipline 
within the schools, but discipline is not violence.  I went to a 
catholic boarding school.  Does the member want to talk about 
discipline? Does he want to talk about violence?  I would be 
delighted to tell him some stories that would curl what little 
hair sits on top of his head.  I can say that I know a little bit 
about this from some personal firsthand experience in a school 
like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally what happens is a parent will say “I believe in 
corporal punishment as long as you are going to strap the kid who 
sits beside my Johnny.  That will scare the dickens out of my 
Johnny, but do not strap my Johnny”.  You would hear that as a 
principal, Mr. Speaker.  He would hear that as a principal. That 
is the problem.  We have to give our teachers the authority to 
discipline young people, but that is not the strap, that is not 
the cane and it sure as hell is not a piece of wood. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder if we could bring this debate to another level, another 
plain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that with the Young Offenders Act there must be some 
rehabilitative process.  Right now with the federal government 
and the provincial governments there are young offender services 
and programs in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the minister would have answered this question herself, 
but the hon. member for Mississauga West is going to have to do 
his best. The minister talked about working with the provinces. 
The minister talked about a consultative process with the 
provinces. The minister talked about cost sharing with the 
provinces. Right now federal funding of the young offenders 
services and programs has been reduced to the point where in 
Manitoba it is funding only 34% of the programs.  In B.C. it is 
only funding 22% of the same programs that the member for 
Mississauga West embraces.  It is now funding only 31% of the 
programs in the province of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that the member embraces these programs on one hand, 
but now all of the funding from the government is removed on the 
other hand? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is important that we 
take it to a different level than talking about the size of our 
individual brains or lack thereof.  I appreciate the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will know that the province of Manitoba to which he 
refers incarcerates more young people than any other province in 
the country.  It should be examined as to why that is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard a speech earlier by a member from the New Democrats who 
talked about having his home broken into and the violence he has 
experienced at home in his riding.  That is absolutely shameful. 
No one here is saying that there are not problems with our young 
people.  We believe that the way to treat those problems is to 
work co-operatively with the provinces to try to put in place 
programs that will rehabilitate and help these young people lead 
normal productive lives. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
difficult to follow a speech from a person who obviously does not 
know a lot about young people.  I wish he had worked at a 
schoolhouse for a number of years.  He would have seen the number 
of changes I have seen over the 30 years I have spent in the 
schools.  It used to be that chewing gum was the major problem in 
the schools but today violence is a major problem.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame because this system and this government have put 
certain things in our Criminal Code that have made it very 
difficult for people in the school houses to maintain any kind of 
discipline any longer.  If they lift a finger or shake too hard 
or even touch them they can be arrested for assault because of 
the bleeding hearts over there who will not allow these kinds of 
things to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately for them there have been parents who have lost 
their kids today.  Why?  Because they were caught spanking their 
children.  Is that not a shame?  I would like to know where a 
person like the individual over there grew up.  What era was he 
in?  Did he come from another planet where discipline was never 
used? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate I reiterate the things that have happened in the 
government under the rule of the Liberals more than anyone else. 
They have been in charge for a greater percentage of the time, 
unfortunately for this great country.  The Liberals have brought 
us to the time that we get headlines like “Violence grows in 
schools”.  This is today's headline about a major school in 
Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got a large kick out of the speech I heard from a separatist a 
while ago that everything was wonderful in Quebec and all the 
right things were being done.  Yet these kinds of headlines come 
out from Quebec indicating a huge increase in violence in 
schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something must be wrong.  Some changes have to be made.  When we 
talk about changes and the suggestions we want, we receive in 
glossy print from the Minister of Justice all the things she has 
been yapping about for a year or longer.  She puts it all down in 
print, but nothing comes before the House in the form of 
legislation that would say to victims across the land that it is 
time we did something because the number of victims is rising too 
fast and people are being harmed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are sitting on their butts here doing nothing except 
putting out a press release with something in glossy print which 
those guys opposite will say are wonderful proposals.  They 
should stop the proposals, get something on the table and let us 
debate it to fix the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about conditional release.  Here is the positive 
attitude of the Liberals in a headline “Conditional release 
working 92% of the time”.  Most people would say 92% is pretty 
good.  However, my headline would give a little more of the 
facts.  I would say that our conditional release program is not 
successful because of an 8% failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That group over there would not understand what we are talking 
about.  Let us take a look at what happened during a 10 year 
study that they provided to me.  The 8% that were not successful 
under the conditional release program went on to reoffend.  As a 
result we have another 2,237 new victims in Canada, of which 217 
were murdered and 900 and some were violently raped.  There have 
been many other violent crimes because of the policies the 
government has put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They sit back and say they have a 92% success rate.  However the 
8% out there hurting people, killing people and raping people is 
too big a sacrifice to ask Canadian people as a whole to make. It 
is not a successful program when those figures come across my 
desk from their own offices and their own people.  Something has 
to be done about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the NDP member who talked about how we exploited 
all things that happen in the land.  For his information and for 
the information of the NDP, I have talked about many individual 
cases.  I talked about the case regarding the Manning family from 
Quebec when we tried to get DNA testing in place.  In fact when I 
talked about it the Manning family was sitting in the gallery 
encouraging me to do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ambose family from Scarborough, when the Young brothers 
campaign was on, encouraged me to rise in the House to talk about 
their political situation because nothing was happening.  I 
talked about the Boyd family when we tried our darndest to kill a 
Liberal law, section 745 of the Criminal Code. 
We tried desperately to get rid of it.  It was suggested by one 
of their previous members who is now an independent.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Boyd family and other families encouraged the Reform Party 
to do its best to get rid of those kinds of laws.  They sat in 
the galleries begging us and asking us to do these things.  We 
had their support and what we got from the other side was 
political nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said that we are exploiting these crimes for political 
gain.  Hog manure.  There are many ways to get political gain. 
All we have to do is talk about all the stupid things they have 
done financially and we will get political gain. We do not need 
to talk about crime.  It is bad enough as it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To suggest for a moment that we are exploiting these cases for 
political gain is really getting sick.  It is the victims who 
have come to our offices to encourage us to do these things. They 
do that because they know the group opposite does not have the 
intestinal fortitude or the guts to even consider doing such a 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bleeding hearts in the left end of this room, from the 
separatists on clear to the wall, would not even dare talk about 
those things.  They would rather talk about the mushy stuff that 
goes on around here: the warm fuzzy feeling that we should be 
giving to the criminals of our land and how we need to do more 
to help in rehabilitating them instead of looking at the victims. 
Is giving them more golf courses a great way to do it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drugs are rampant in the prisons.  They are absolutely out of 
control.  There is not a guard in the whole country who will not 
say that is the truth.  What are the wimps over there doing? 
Nothing.  They do not have the guts to do anything.  The only 
thing they can do is sit over there and heckle like my 
bald-headed friend.  I can say that because I have more hair than 
he has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of sickness exists in the government.  Its members sit 
back while the statistics go up and up because not one of them 
has the courage to say it is time to do something.  It is a 
shame.  They had one member on that side of the House who had the 
courage to demand certain changes such as section 745.  He sits 
over here now because he was way out of line with this group of 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have another one over there who constantly insists that 
things are wonderful, that we must not let things get out of 
control by daring to discipline children in our schools or in our 
homes with a strap or a paddle, et cetera.

invite them to come to small towns in my rural riding where there 
are no police stations.  They have bars or deadbolts on their

do everything they can to protect their property and in some 
cases to protect their lives.

Speaker, as chair of the justice committee I have frequently 
enjoyed having the hon. member for Wild Rose on our committee.  I 
have to say that his appearance in the House is a little 
misleading because he certainly does not present himself in quite 
the same way in committee.  I say this as a compliment because he 
is an active contributing member of the committee and I 
appreciate his participation very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is also very well known for his candour as we can see today. 
I would like to ask him to candidly express his view on a couple 
of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a school principal I am wondering if he employed corporal 
punishment in his school.  Once and for all let us finalize it. 
Are they true, these quotes that have been attributed to him 
supporting caning? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the school board act 
in my particular district we were allowed to administer corporal 
punishment under section 43 of the Criminal Code, which I 
understand many on this side of the House would like to get rid 
of.  We used it, not sparingly, but as a tool that was used when 
deemed absolutely necessary.  It was kind of a last straw type of 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who spoke before me and got me riled up to begin with 
would have a hard time understanding that the strap or the paddle 
can be very effective.  He ought to try it some time. Maybe he 
should have received it.  I received it and I guarantee it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admire people like the hon. member who would like to abolish 
all this stuff with all his warm fuzzy bull that will never get 
anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I wonder if the member would consider not 
using the word bull again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I usually say Durham 
after it and I forgot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as corporal punishment in prisons is concerned, I believe 
there might be a place for it.  I would like to see it here for 
discussion.  I cannot for the life of me understand why anybody 
would object to that kind of punishment for an individual who 
would rape, hurt and slaughter little children, sex offenders of 
little kids of five and six years old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should tell me what is the best thing to do in 
terms of punishment.  I think 90% of Canadians would say maybe 
that is what we ought to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly FAS children can reflect severe neurological disorders,

growth retardation, speech and vision impairment, and physical 
deformity.  The list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The personal human devastation is horrific.  FAS is estimated to 
cost $1.5 million during the lifetime of a child in terms of 
increased health needs, special education and social service

justice system.  In reality we are all affected.

the Reform Party has called for extreme right wing changes to 
Canada's criminal justice system.  It favours a two strikes and 
your out law that would jail young Canadians for life if they 
commit two relatively minor offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of Reform's extreme ideas include public scorn, caning and 
other forms of corporal punishment.  Reform members even wanted 
to send a parliamentary delegation to Singapore to witness the 
caning of young offenders in that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this what Canadians want?  No.  Canadians want public policy 
that makes sense.  That is why this government launched a 
balanced strategy to renew our youth justice system, a strategy 
that emphasizes prevention and rehabilitation, not public 
beatings.  That is why we have established a DNA bank to store 
samples and why we increased crime prevention funding by $32 
million a year.  That is why we passed tough anti-gang 
legislation and why, to the consternation of the Reform Party, we 
introduced gun control.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
my riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan there have been many incidents 
which highlight the fact that the Young Offenders Act is not 
working and needs to be changed.  The most recent involves Tasha 
Pederson.  She is the owner of a small hairstyling shop in 
Cassidy which has become the target of a group of youth intent on 
vandalizing her establishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, this businesswoman has had to pay over $500 in repairs 
to property that these youths have damaged on several occasions. 
That might not seem like a lot of money to the Liberal MPs who 
recently spent that amount of taxpayer money for each night they 
stayed in a posh Italian hotel, but to this woman it means the 
difference between paying her suppliers and putting food on the 
table for her family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the truly sad part in all this is that the local RCMP 
is powerless to do anything about it because the Young Offenders 
Act does not apply to youth under the age of 12 and these young 
vandals know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than address situations like these, this do nothing 
justice minister has stayed the course again and ignored the 
justice committee recommendation to lower the age at which a 
youth can be charged.

have to pay for those who got hepatitis C from drug addiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister not recognize the difference between

When you talk about compassion you talk about only one type of

</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that Reform is coming back to a notion of responsibility.

“Compensate those who got the hepatitis C virus through the 
blood system”.  No one else.

again.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister cannot

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We made a deal with them to offer some compensation to those who 
have hep C because of a problem that existed between 1986 and 
1990.  There was an agreement signed by all the governments of 
Canada.

him quickly before he leaves the country again.  I want to ask 
him about this hep C deal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening is that this so-called working group that the

together last July and is offering the same options.  What is 
happening is that the Prime Minister and his government are

is too much.  More meetings, more memos, more technical talk is 
not going to solve the problem for victims.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
yesterday's oral question period, $17 million has accrued in the 
employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this time, all the Minister of Human Resources 
Development has said in response is that he ordered an 
investigation by Statistics Canada, because he cannot figure out 
what is happening with his reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all his investigations and studies, is the minister not 
simply stalling for time while his colleague, the Minister of 
Finance, keeps taking $700,000 an hour from the pockets of 
workers and the unemployed? 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I said yesterday was not 
that we did not understand the effects of the reform, quite the 
contrary, but we were not in favour of any hasty decisions, as 
the Bloc Quebecois apparently is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What astounds me about the Bloc is that none of the bills it has 
tabled in this House aims to help any of the unemployed to 
return to the labour force.  The measures are passive, old hat. 
There is no constructive reform relating to the modern market. 
They are proposing a return to the past, and we are saying no. 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister should stop being the pompous technocrat and holder of 
all truth and get on with answering questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What those excluded from his reform want—and it is not studies 
and investigations—is for him to come out of his bubble and 
deal with a real problem.  Will he, once and for all, deal with 
their problem, not in six months, but now, today? 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the opposition still does not 
understand the courage and boldness displayed by our government 
to adequately serve Canadians from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our reform sought to change an unemployment insurance system 
that was neither fair nor equitable. We wanted to help Canadians 
break the cycle of dependency that existed in certain regions. 
We want to help create jobs in the regions that need them most. 
This is what our reform is all about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, whenever the

that the minister lives on another planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may keep saying that everyone loves his reform, the fact 
remains that three out of every four young people who are 
jobless do not qualify for employment insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister finally admit that, because of his reform, 75% 
of young Canadians who lose their jobs are left to fend for 
themselves? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, eligibility criteria for 
employment insurance may be tougher for young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we on this side of the House are not trying to make it 
easier for young people to collect employment insurance, but to 
ensure that they stay in school as long as possible, benefit 
from the youth employment strategy and have access to higher 
education and knowledge. We have greater ambitions for young 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois basically wants us to encourage young people 
to leave school as early as possible by making it too easy to 
collect employment insurance. This would not be good for the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, such comments 
make no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister admit that his system is ridiculous and is 
much too hard on young Canadians, given that only one in four is 
eligible for employment insurance? Can he not admit and 
understand that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what young people need is not 
easy access to employment insurance.  What they need are 
placements in businesses, community work, useful experience they 
can put on a CV to help them get a job.  This is a sensible job 
strategy. It is a strategy of providing opportunities for access 
to knowledge and education so that people can improve their 
future and raise a family.  This is what young people need, this 
is what they have told us, and it is what we are giving them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's watchdog on the environment has said that the

minimizes any negative impact and maximizes any positive impact

the government received its environmental report card today and

<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment,

have realized that we did not meet voluntary obligations we set 
for ourselves at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in the company of many other developed nations in the

</I></B></P><P align=left>We could tell this seasonal worker that, under our new

build up many more insurable hours and get EI more easily

eligible for unemployment insurance with a teaching load of only

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
appears as though the government minister is becoming an expert 
in creating loopholes and finding technicalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take her so-called firm measure to move 14 to 15 year 
olds to adult court.  It is crafted so that there are so many 
exceptions, exemptions and loopholes that only 21 cases in all of 
Canada last year would be affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister honestly think that changing the law for 21

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

involved in crime in 1996 and 833 of those were violent crimes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

in terms of young people under the age of 12.  No one on this 
side of the House is suggesting that a young person, at the age 
of 10 for example, who hurts another individual should not be 
held accountable or take responsibility. What we believe on this 
side of the House is that the most effective way to deal with 
those children is not through the formal criminal justice system 
but through either the child welfare system or the mental health

albumin is an important product which is essential to the health

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a shortage of albumin available from likely suppliers 
in Canada.  As a result, physicians asked Health Canada for 
permission to go to an American company named Alpha to supply 
that product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is not where the product comes from.  The issue is, is 
it safe.  As I told the House yesterday, this product has been

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's own department has ordered 45,000 vials of 
albumin at the same time as his American counterpart has put out 
the red alert and slapped a consent decree on Alpha Therapeutics 
not because of a technicality, but because it was not keeping 
proper records to distinguish between bad blood and good blood.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's report on environment the auditor general's

results in inadequate environmental assessments that will have 
significant consequences on the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the majority of the environmental screenings examined

all environmental regulations. Her response to the House was that 
“there is within my department resources available to deal with 
all enforcement issues necessary”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given today's auditor general's report and the environment

</I></B></P><P align=left><B> The Speaker:</B> Yesterday, the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine rose on a point of order about a word 
supposedly uttered during yesterday's oral question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said yesterday, I heard the word, but I did not know who 
said it.  The member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine mentioned that 
it was the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot who used the word 
“liar”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, members get a bit more excited than usual during 
oral question period.  If the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot is 
here now, and if he used this word yesterday, I would ask him to 
please withdraw it now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I will hear the member for Roberval, but only for a 
moment, because I am addressing the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not wish 
to be disrespectful, quite the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will simply say that I have reviewed the <I>House of Commons 
Debates</I>, and nowhere are these words attributed to the member 
for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot.  I do not see why he should have to 
give an explanation for words that are not attributed to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I heard the word myself.  I do not know where it 
came from, but if the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot did 
not use this word, he has only to say so. If he used the word, 
he has only to withdraw it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now addressing my colleague, the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, directly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
great respect for you and your office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not recall having used those words yesterday.  Many words 
are uttered in the House of Commons in any given day.  I am also 
looking at <I>Hansard</I> and I am not identified as being— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Here is the situation.  We have one member who says 
that another member said something in the House.  We have the 
other member who rises and gives his word that he does not 
recall having used the word.  I therefore accept the member's 
explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not recall having used the 
word.  But if I did so inadvertently, I am prepared to withdraw 
it.  In order to satisfy my colleague, I will not make a fuss 
over the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> As I understand it, if the hon. member used the 
word, he withdraws it.  Is that correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Just a moment. The hon. member is here, we have had 
a discussion and, as I requested, the hon. member withdrew the 
word.  It has been done and I accept the withdrawal.  At this 
point, the matter is concluded. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK194">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have two minutes 
left for questions and comments on the intervention by the hon. 
member for Wild Rose. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a very interesting debate today on justice issues.  During 
question period we also had a very interesting question and 
response time from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member for Wild Rose could comment on the 
response by the justice minister. She was very pleased because 
she is willing to swear and she can prove, and apparently 
Statistics Canada will show, that not a single person under the 
age of 12 was convicted of a serious criminal offence in Canada 
in 1996, the latest year for which she has statistics available.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member for Wild Rose could describe why she 
thinks that statistic is so profound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is exactly the 
answer I heard.  What I heard was that no one under 12 was 
convicted of a serious crime.  That is a pretty good statement 
considering that no one under 12 can be charged.  So how can we 
convict them?  But then that is the brilliance of the Liberal 
government.  What do we expect? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more important is that there are serious violent crimes 
committed by people under 12.  This government is not willing to 
deal with that problem whatsoever.  It talks about passing it off 
to social welfare, passing it off to other provincial 
institutions.  It does not have what it takes to do the right 
thing.  It ought to be ashamed of itself. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am taking the remainder of the time of my hon. 
colleague for Wild Rose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am honoured to rise once again to speak on behalf of the 
people of Cariboo—Chilcotin and to speak on the official 
opposition supply day motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for the deplorable state 
of Canada's criminal justice system, and the government's lack of 
concern for public safety, as demonstrated by their refusal to: 
(<I>a</I>) strengthen the Young Offenders Act; (<I>b</I>) abolish 
conditional sentencing for violent offenders; and (<I>c</I>) 
introduce a victims bill of rights. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of weeks ago, in my hometown of Williams Lake I hosted 
a town hall meeting dealing with exactly these issues. 
Ironically, this was the very same day the Minister of Justice 
finally introduced her response to the standing committee on 
justice report explaining her strategy for the renewal of the 
youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over a year after she promised a swift introduction of massive 
changes to the Young Offenders Act she outlined a strategy which 
appears on the surface to make only cosmetic changes to this act, 
one of which is getting rid of the name.  There are many serious 
things that need to be done.  I am sure that getting rid of the 
name is very important too.  This is a name across the country 
which prompts negative comments and stories of horrific crimes 
committed by young people who merely get a slap on the wrist for 
the crimes they have committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past five years I have heard my constituents' concerns 
about the current state of the criminal justice system.  These 
concerns cover all aspects of the system, how violent and repeat 
offenders are treated in the system, how all too often victim 
rights are completely ignored, how the current federal government 
time and again ignores the safety of the average Canadian 
citizen, how it ploughs ahead with legislation not at all 
consistent with the needs of those law-abiding citizens who are 
directly affected by this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clearest example that comes to mind is the government's 
handling of the gun control issue, Bill C-68.  This is a 
bureaucratic mess where the budget was blown long ago.  The 
government's experts are saying the registration system will be 
filled with inaccurate and useless information.  All the while 
law-abiding citizens will be held accountable for this failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has proposed an excellent approach to deal with 
the complex issues surrounding youth crime.  Before I comment on 
this approach I take this opportunity to thank the chief Reform 
justice critic, the member for Crowfoot, and his colleagues on 
that committee for their long and dedicated service to this 
issue.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform's approach to dealing with youth crime has three 
components.  The first component concerns early detection and 
intervention as an effective means of crime prevention.  The 
second component deals with community based resolutions and 
sentences for non-violent offenders, and the last component deals 
with substantive changes to the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Included in the amendments are changes to the age range for 
those who fall under the act from 12 years to 10 years for the 
youngest and from 17 years to 15 years for the oldest, as well as 
the publishing of names for all violent offenders charged as 
adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party also proposed that a distinction be made between 
non-violent and violent offenders.  We feel that less serious 
offenders can be diverted from formal court proceedings and 
incarceration while at the same time we want to ensure that 
violent offenders are held in custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After she was sworn in as the justice minister last June, the 
minister stated that one of her top priorities was to reform the 
Young Offenders Act and that we could expect changes shortly.  It 
is almost a year later and we are told that legislation will be 
introduced this fall after further consultations this summer with 
the provinces, the territories and various stakeholders. 
Although I welcome the federal government consulting the 
grassroots of our country when changing legislation, there comes 
a time when consultations have to result in some action, and that 
time has come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister is armed with an extensive report from the 
standing committee which was tabled before the election call last 
April.  It was accompanied by a comprehensive list of 
recommendations.  She also has the minority report submitted by 
the Reform Party.  It is a thorough report which also provides 
the justice minister with well thought out and comprehensive 
proposals to significantly reform the youth justice system.  The 
justice minister also has at her disposal the recommendations of 
several provinces for reforming the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all this comprehensive information what does the justice 
minister do?  She admits that the current system is flawed and 
needs to be changed.  Did we not know that already?  After a year 
of inaction she introduces a framework with no real specifics, no 
real details on how the system is going to be reformed and 
restructured.  There are no concrete proposals for change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has proposed to spend approximately $32 million 
on crime prevention programs, but as we have seen before with 
this Liberal government it does not have any concrete plans as 
to who will be in charge of these programs and it cannot provide 
details on what programs will be available.  Included in this 
mess of disorientation, disorganization and lack of leadership, 
the minister has also failed to assure the provinces that there 
will be the necessary funding for any new programming 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gauging from the various provincial responses in their own 
reports on reforming the youth criminal justice system, it looks 
like the provinces do not share the justice minister's vision. 
For example, the people of Cariboo—Chilcotin have told me that 
they want change to the youth justice system that is fair, that 
works at preventing youth crime and that looks at alternative 
measures for dealing with and rehabilitating youth who break the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of conditional sentencing, the changes made to 
section 742 of the Criminal Code in June 1995 under Bill C-41 
have made it possible for a variety of offenders to serve their 
time in the community.  This provision has been applied quite 
liberally.  It applies to anyone from those who have committed 
fraud to those who have committed sex offences.  Although the 
previous justice minister acknowledged the problems with the 
legislation in allowing certain sex and violent offenders to have 
conditional sentences, he took no action to amend the 
legislation.  The current justice minister has not taken action 
on this issue either, despite repeated calls from the opposition 
and from the Alberta court of appeal. 
Violent offenders are still being put back into the communities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I would like to take a moment to comment on the issue of 
victims' rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has now been over two years since this House passed a motion 
introduced by my colleague, the official opposition House leader. 
The motion read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the House urge the government to direct the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs to proceed with the 
drafting of a Victims' Bill of Rights, and that, in such areas 
where the committee determines a right to be more properly a 
provincial concern, the Minister of Justice initiate 
consultations with the provinces aimed at arriving at a national 
standard for a Victims' Bill of Rights. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion received widespread support from all parties in this 
House:  154 yeas; 24 nays.  Since that time it has languished in 
the justice committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this month the committee finally started formal hearings 
and will hopefully submit a report to the House sometime this 
fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy that these formal hearings are finally taking place, 
but I wonder why it took the government so long.  I am sure it 
has heard from many Canadians, as have I, who want the government 
to move forward on this issue of establishing a victims' bill of 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister of the day was in support of a victims' 
bill of rights, but what does today's justice minister think? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During her appearance before the justice committee last month 
she announced a national office for victims of crime to help them 
navigate through the justice system, but was lukewarm to the idea 
of a victims' bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said that often these bills are rhetorical and that she was 
not interested in rhetorical flourishes, but in actually 
improving the services and programs for victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the recent proposals by the Minister of Justice, I think 
she is far more interested in those rhetorical flourishes than 
she is in delivering on her promises for actual change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to close by conveying the comments I received from 
my constituents at the town hall meeting at Williams Lake earlier 
this month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want fair and comprehensive change to the criminal 
justice system, change not only to provide alternative programs 
to rehabilitate those young offenders who commit less serious 
crimes, but also adequate and effective punishment for the more 
serious offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These constituents call for safe streets and for victims to have 
as many rights as those criminals who commit crimes against them. 
Canadians are demanding change and it is past time for the 
government to listen.  It must act with concrete proposals and 
substantive changes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the previous speaker on the 
content of his speech.  I think he makes some very compelling 
points.  He is obviously representing his constituents very well 
when he makes those points here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on one issue that he spoke of which concerns a 
rather perverse anomaly that exists in our current justice 
system.  We currently have under the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act and the parole board someone called the correctional 
investigator; that is, an investigator who acts in the interests 
of those who are incarcerated.  That person is there to represent 
the interests of the inmate.  There is no question that there is 
a need for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is the anomaly.  There is no such person presently 
in our Canadian justice system to play a similar role for 
victims; that is, victims who, to use the words of the hon. 
member, must navigate through this elaborate system which 
sometimes results in revictimization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member his opinion on what the present 
government should do and what his party's position is on having 
an ombudsman, a person akin to the correctional investigator, to 
act for victims and assist them in any way possible in navigating 
our very complicated and sometimes slow justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my party has begun by 
trying to establish some guidelines to support victims in a 
victims' bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all agree that the rights of people need to be respected and 
that the rights of those who have been charged and convicted need 
to be looked at carefully.  However, the rights of those who have 
been caught up in circumstances of other people's criminal intent 
or action, through no fault of their own, have received no 
support from the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victims are there for the charge, the trial, the appeal and 
the re-appeal if that is the case.  The scabs are opened and 
re-opened.  They are continually reminded of their pain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party of Canada is absolutely determined that 
wherever there is a choice to be made between the rights of the 
victim and the rights of the criminal that the rights of the 
victim will always come first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the subject of the ombudsman, that is something 
that I believe should be duly considered after we have come to a 
decision on the rights of the victim.  At this point, how can an 
ombudsman act when we have no idea how the government will 
respond to legislating the rights of victims?  I think that is 
the first step.  Following that we should then look at the means 
for providing those rights and ensuring that they are secured for 
victims. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to my colleague from the adjacent constituency.  I 
know he is very knowledgeable about the First Nations in his 
area.  I suspect also that he is well briefed on the native 
justice system that has developed on the Navajo reserve in the 
United States.  Over the years they have developed a very 
sophisticated system in terms of dealing with young offenders on 
their lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member aware of that system and, if he is, does he see 
some use in adapting and adopting some of their practices to what 
we are considering doing here in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as we look at the 
difficulties that we as Canadian citizens are having in dealing 
with those who choose to commit crimes we are compelled to begin 
to try to understand how we can protect ourselves and look after 
the interests of those who are hurting, which perhaps results in 
them committing crimes, and those who have been affected by the 
commission of those crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need in Canada is a fair and consistent system that 
applies to all citizens, where everyone knows the rules. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is with pleasure that I rise today in the House to provide 
hon. members with some information about the status of victims' 
rights in Canada and the progress that has been made in 
addressing the concerns of victims of crimes.  The topic is 
obviously very timely.  It certainly is of interest to the 
residents of my riding of Waterloo—Wellington and indeed to all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is also important to ensure that we present facts 
instead of distortions, myths and other incorrect information 
which we have heard today from members of the Reform Party and 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members must surely be aware that the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights is currently examining the role of the 
victim in the criminal justice system.  This review is under way 
due in part to a motion made by the hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford in April 1996 which called on the government 
to ask the standing committee to explore a federal bill of rights 
for victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee heard from several witnesses in April 
1997 and concluded that a more detailed examination of this and 
other related issues was necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the standing committee will address a range of 
issues, including the need for additional services for victims, 
the information needs of victims, how such services can be funded 
and whether additional Criminal Code amendments are necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice has already discussed several options 
with provincial attorneys general, but has noted that further 
information will be gathered by the standing committee.  Their 
consultation process will assist the minister in refining many of 
the options under consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government cannot be faulted for any lack of concern for 
victims.  Quite the contrary.  The Minister of Justice has 
identified this as one of her highest priorities, and rightfully 
so.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that members opposite are exhibiting impatience 
rather than focusing on fully participating in the standing 
committee's review which they in fact encouraged and are now 
criticizing this government for a lack of concern. Would they 
bypass the committee process?  I would certainly hope not. It is 
very important that that process take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter sent by the Minister of Justice to the chair of the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights emphasizes the 
minister's eagerness to move forward with concrete proposals but 
defers to the advice of the committee in order to permit the full 
participation of all parties represented in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also refer members to the Canadian statement of basic 
principles of justice for victims of crime which was adopted by 
provincial and territorial governments in 1988.  That statement 
was intended to guide policy and legislative development and it 
has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All provinces and territories have enacted victim legislation 
which generally includes a statement of purpose or principles 
echoing that Canadian statement.  Some jurisdictions, including 
Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan, Yukon, 
Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, also 
provide for a victim fine surcharge on provincial offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial legislation already deals with the notion of victims 
rights in several different ways.  For example there are 
provisions referred to as a declaration of principles or simply 
principles in the victims legislation in Alberta, Manitoba, New 
Brunswick, Newfoundland, Ontario and Prince Edward Island. 
Ontario's Victim's Bill of Rights also includes a preamble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Northwest Territories Victims of Crime Act provides that the 
purpose of the victims assistance committee established by that 
act is to promote inter alia the courteous and compassionate 
treatment of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yukon Victims Services Act sets out in section 2 the purpose 
of the victims services fund, for example to promote and provide 
services and to publish information about the needs of victims 
and available services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly Saskatchewan's Victims of Crime Act includes a 
statement of purpose in section 3, to establish a fund to be used 
to promote several principles including that victims should be 
treated with courtesy, compassion and respect for their dignity 
and privacy, that their views should be taken into account and 
appropriate information and assistance should be provided to them 
throughout the criminal process where appropriate and consistent 
with criminal law and procedure. In addition wherever reasonably 
possible, victims should receive through formal and informal 
proceedings prompt and fair redress for harm suffered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that some provinces have used the term 
“rights”.  For example British Columbia's Victims of Crime Act 
sets out several rights for victims of crime in sections 2 to 8. 
Nova Scotia's Victims Rights and Services Act also employs the 
term “right”.  Section 3 sets out the victim's absolute rights 
and section 4 sets out the victim's limited rights. Quebec's act 
respecting assistance and compensation for victims of crime 
provides for victim's rights and obligations under title 1, 
sections 2 to 6. Manitoba recently introduced new victims rights 
legislation which addresses a victim's entitlement to services 
and information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be noted that despite the varying terminology 
used, all provincial victims statutes include provisions which 
clearly state that no cause of action lies based on the statute 
for anything done or omitted.  In other words there is no remedy 
for the inability to provide for a right or fulfil a principle 
set out in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the minister has noted also that when it 
comes to responding to the concerns of victims of crime the 
provinces, territories and the federal government have a role to 
play.  It is an important role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are responsible for investigating the majority of 
criminal offences, enforcing the law, prosecuting criminal 
offences and administering justice within the province. Given 
that responsibility, provincial legislation can appropriately 
address victims rights which relate to the provision of 
information about the investigation, the prosecution, for example 
the charges laid, bail decisions, trial scheduling, et cetera and 
available services. Provinces have done exactly that in their 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal victims rights legislation to address matters of 
provincial jurisdiction would not be either possible or 
practical. That too is important to note.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When discussing the issue of victims rights, I fear we may be 
influenced by events south of the border and I would hope that is 
not so.  Practically every state in the United States has a 
victims bill of rights and some even have amended their state 
constitutions. Canadians may think we must follow suit.  However 
recent studies suggest that these rights are only paper promises. 
Although we should keep an open mind about the need for more 
rights, I am sure all members would agree that it is pointless to 
have symbolic victims rights which are not enforceable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the report of the standing committee that will 
greatly assist the government in addressing the victim's role in 
the criminal justice system, whether that be through legislation 
or through other initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to review some of the background information on 
provincial victims legislation.  I will highlight the legislation 
in four provinces to provide examples of the various approaches 
taken which are worthy to note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first relates to British Columbia.  British Columbia's 
comprehensive legislation, the Victims of Crime Act, sets out a 
range of entitlements for victims and assigns a responsibility to 
justice system personnel or for example to the crown, 
commissioner of corrections, or attorney general. For example, 
section 2 provides that all justice system personnel must treat a 
victim with courtesy and respect and must not discriminate 
against a victim on the basis of race, colour, ancestry, place of 
origin, religion and other similar grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 4 directs that crown counsel must ensure that a victim 
is given a reasonable opportunity to have admissible evidence 
concerning the impact of the offence as perceived by the victim 
presented to the court before sentence is imposed for the 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 5 directs that justice system personnel must offer a 
victim certain information regarding the justice system, victim 
services, the victim legislation and privacy legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 6 provides that certain information must be provided for 
victims such as the status of the investigation, the name of the 
accused, court dates and probation or parole conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 7 addresses information that will be provided on request 
of the victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, section 8 sets out several goals that the government 
must promote, including the development of victims services, 
prompt return of stolen property and protection from 
intimidation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to highlight Nova Scotia.  Nova Scotia's Victims Bill of 
Rights and Services Act sets out a victim's absolute right in 
section 3, including the right to be treated with courtesy, 
compassion and dignity and the right to the prompt return of 
property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victim's limited rights are set out in section 4.  They are 
subject to the availability of resources and any other limits 
reasonable in the circumstances.  These limited rights include 
the right to information about the charge laid, progress of the 
prosecution and services or remedies available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like now to highlight Ontario.  Ontario's Victim's Bill 
of Rights, proclaimed in June 1996, sets out a range of 
principles in section 2 regarding the treatment of victims of 
crime, including that victims should be treated with courtesy, 
compassion and respect for their personal dignity and privacy; 
that victims should have access to information about services, 
protection against intimidation, the progress of investigation 
and prosecution, court dates, the sentence imposed and release 
conditions.  On request, victims should be notified of release 
from prison and in the case of persons found unfit or not 
criminally responsible on account of mental disorder of any 
dispositions made by the Criminal Code review board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation clarifies that these principles are subject to 
the availability of resources and information, what is reasonable 
in the circumstances of the case, what is consistent with the law 
and public interest, and what is necessary to ensure that the 
resolution of the criminal proceedings is not delayed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario legislation has created a civil cause of action for 
victims of prescribed crime.  The offender is liable in damages 
to the victim for emotional distress and bodily harm. The 
legislation creates a presumption that a victim of sexual assault 
or attempted sexual assault or spousal assault suffers emotional 
distress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation also creates a provincial victims justice fund 
account which will include federal and provincial surcharge 
revenue, donations and appropriations from provincial general 
revenue. The fund is used for provincial victims services 
provided by the solicitor general and attorney general and for 
grants to community agencies.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to highlight Alberta as well.  The Alberta Victims 
of Crime Act, proclaimed August 1, 1997, consolidates the former 
victims programs assistance act and the criminal injuries 
compensation act and makes significant reforms to the 
compensation scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 2 sets out the principles which apply to the treatment 
of victims, including that victims should be treated with 
courtesy, compassion and respect, receive information about 
relevant services and their participation in criminal 
proceedings, scheduling and ultimate disposition and that their 
views and concerns should be considered where appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act also empowers the minister to appoint a director to 
implement the act, to provide information to victims, to resolve 
the concerns of victims who believe they have not been treated in 
accordance with the principles of the act and to evaluate 
applications for benefits, financial and others, formerly 
referred to as criminal injuries compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act also imposes a surcharge on provincial offences and 
establishes the victims of crime fund into which both federal and 
provincial surcharge revenue is deposited.  The fund may also 
receive other revenue, including appropriations from general 
revenue.  The fund is used to provide grants with respect to 
programs benefiting victims of crime and for financial benefits 
to eligible victims of crime, for example specific victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The director is mandated to determine the eligibility and the 
amount of the financial benefit for the victim applicant.  An 
appeal board is also established to adjudicate appeals of the 
director's decision.  Eligibility criteria and the amount of the 
applicable financial benefits will be prescribed and are 
prescribed by regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it is important in light of the motion presented 
today to review some of the recent Criminal Code initiatives 
which in fact do respond to the needs and concerns of victims of 
crime.  These are Criminal Code responses which Canadians think 
are very important and clearly support.  I would like to 
highlight some of those now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 in response to victims concerns, the maximum penalty for 
leaving the scene of an accident was increased from two to five 
years to achieve consistency with the maximum penalty for 
impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 3, 1996 amendments to the sentencing part of the 
Criminal Code included amendments to the restitution and victim 
impact statement provisions.  The scope of restitution is 
expanded and courts are now required rather than permitted to 
consider a victim impact statement when one has been prepared. 
Bill C-41, an act to amend the Criminal Code, sentencing, related 
to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 section 33 was added to the Criminal Code to clarify 
that intoxication is not a defence to any general intent crimes 
of violence, such as sexual assault and assault.  Bill C-72, an 
act to amend the Criminal Code, self-induced intoxication, 
referred to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other legislation provided for special warrants to be issued to 
collect bodily samples for DNA analysis in specified 
circumstances.  These were outlined in Bill C-104, an act to 
amend the Criminal Code, DNA warrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 Bill C-17, the criminal law improvement bill, included 
amendments to benefit victims.  The peace bond provisions were 
strengthened.  Provisions regarding the use of blood sample 
evidence in impaired driving prosecutions were clarified and the 
mandatory prohibition from driving provisions were strengthened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specific amendments came into force in May 1997.  These 
amendments include provisions to facilitate the testimony of 
young victims and witnesses by expanding the use of screens and 
closed circuit TV to include both complainants and witnesses 
under 18 years of age, an important move. It also included 
provisions designed to facilitate the giving of testimony.  It 
will now include offences of prostitution, child pornography and 
assault, in addition to the sexual offences already listed.  It 
also included amendments clarifying that the existing provisions 
which prohibit publication of the identity of sexual offence 
victims apply to current and historic sexual offences as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 715.1 which permits a young victim of a sexual offence 
to adopt video testimony at trial will now be available in the 
prosecution of other offences, including assault, prostitution 
and child pornography.  This was outlined in Bill C-27, an act to 
amend the Criminal Code, child prostitution, child sex tourism, 
criminal harassment and female genital mutilation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-46, an act to amend the Criminal Code, production of 
records in sexual offence proceedings, was passed and proclaimed 
into force on May 12, 1997 to protect sexual offence victims by 
restricting the production to the accused of irrelevant personal 
and private records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures underscore the commitment of the government to 
make protection of the public a top priority.  That is understood 
and that is clearly apparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that while others talk we as a 
government have acted.  It is important to maintain those kinds 
of actions and to ensure that these actions are consistent with 
what Canadians want and what Canadians expect the government to 
do. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its vision of the future, the federal government attaches 
vital importance to the security of all Canadians.  The federal

Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the message the hon. member was giving, but 
I am afraid he missed the whole idea with regard to victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote Phyllis de Villiers, president of CAVEAT: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The credibility of the justice system depends on the way in which 
victims are treated and the system's sensitivity to their 
experience.  Currently, victims are often revictimized by the 
justice system itself.  While inordinate attention is paid to the 
rights of the offender, the victims are marginalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the murder of my daughter, I suddenly became a victim with 
no voice, no face, no standing, no representation.  I received no 
legal assistance nor advice to help me understand the process at 
a time when I was barely functioning.  There is little 
recognition of the financial toll of violent crime, both on the 
victim and the community. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was on May 30, 1997.  We have heard some mighty fine words 
from the hon. member.  He talked about paper promises.  He 
mentioned that we have to show courtesy, compassion and respect. 
That is only normal.  One would have to show those, but victims 
are not looking for compassion, respect and courtesy.  They are 
looking for some action where justice is being served, where they 
could stay home and feel satisfied that they have been truly 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parole system is in a shambles.  People are not happy with 
that.  The victims cannot understand how their sons and daughters 
could be murdered, raped and vandalized by a person who has just 
got out of prison for the same crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On section 45 tons of people across the country cannot 
understand how a first degree cold blooded killer could apply to 
get out of jail in 15 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people keep talking about how they are compelled to 
address these issues and they are not. Liberal members came up 
with conditional release.  They dreamt that up and it applies to 
violent offenders. Then there was statutory release even when the 
guards and the people on the frontline in prisons said that they 
should not be released because they would kill again.  They do 
it, sit back and do nothing about it.  We could ask the Melanie 
Carpenter family how it feels about statutory release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CAVEAT exists as do FACTS, CRY, Kid Brother Campaign and MADD. 
All these victims groups exist because governments like the 
Liberal government have done nothing on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the member propose to do for victims?  I say to him 
“Don't give me any more of this courtesy, compassion and 
respect”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in response to the question 
of the hon. member opposite it is my understanding that it is 
Priscilla de Villiers and not Phyllis de Villiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former chairman of the Waterloo Regional Police I dealt 
extensively in that part of Ontario, in that part of Canada, with 
victims and the rights of victims.  I see the government making 
enormous strides in terms of making sure that we have in place 
facilities and programs that assist victims in their time of 
need.

measures to be put in place for sex offenders.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, to address the hon. member's statements continually put 
forth in the House, they are as true as saying that the earth is 
flat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is wrong.  This party put forth the private member's 
bill on victims rights.  This party is the one that passed it 
through.  This party has been pushing the government for victims 
rights ever since we got here. This party wanted to put 
equability and fairness into the justice system.  This party 
passed yesterday a private member's motion on crime prevention 
using existing programs that have been proven to work.  This 
party is trying to work with members across party lines and put 
our partisanship aside to build a stronger justice system.  The 
facts speak for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members in our party have reached out their hands 
repeatedly to members from the other side.  Some members have 
taken that hand and would like to work with us.  I find it 
personally offensive, and I am sure members from this party find 
it personally offensive, that the member continually chooses to 
put partisanship ahead of the truth.  I hope the member would 
choose to put constructiveness ahead of partisanship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member take to the Minister of Justice the 
private member's bill my colleague put forth on victims rights 
since he spoke for it and push it forward with the minister to 
make sure it is enacted in legislation before the end of the 
year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
opposite for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a government have always moved forward in a non-partisan 
way hoping to do what is best for the interest of all Canadians 
and for the country.  It is important we continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am amazed at the allegation made by the hon. member in terms 
of what we as a government are doing.  It is clear through not 
only this debate but through question period and other times that 
the Reform Party repeatedly wants to take the position of 
negativity, of extremism, and all kinds of outrageous and 
outlandish positions when it comes to offenders, victims and 
everyone else in the criminal justice system.  It is quite 
outrageous.  Canadians see through that kind of nonsense and I am 
glad they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time we as a government have tried to take concrete steps 
to address the causes of crime, child poverty, educational 
opportunities and other issues related to these kinds of things, 
it would appear we were stymied by members opposite.  It is 
outrageous and too bad.  That party would slash over $1 billion 
from social services programs in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we could accept the changes the Liberal government 
put forward in criminal justice programs if they were concrete 
steps, if they were steps that moved the prevention of crime 
ahead.  There has been little more than tinkering done with the 
justice system since 1993 and prior thereto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about how the Reform Party would not support 
some of the justice bills that were brought in by the Liberal 
government.  The reason for that, and he knows it very well, is 
that within all the pages of changes there might be one minute 
piece of legislation, one clause that we could consider to be 
something that was a positive step. 
The rest was simply window dressing.  In many cases it was a 
backward step in dealing with criminals and the crime situation. 
That is why we could not support the Liberal bills.

They would not do that and we had to vote against the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I was saying, all this 
from the party that wants to slash $1 billion from social 
services and literally gut the whole system.  It would be 
absolutely outrageous in terms of what that party would propose 
and try to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a non-partisan way we have tried to ensure that the criminal 
justice system is in place in a manner consistent with what 
Canadians want, deserve and need.  It is something to hear 
members opposite speak in terms of what they want to do and the 
extent to which they want to drag the country down.  I find that 
ludicrous.  Canadians see through that and they will not stand

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the problem.  The problem today is that crime is 
increasing.  Some like to trot out statistics that it is not. 
They say it is going down.  The reason crime is increasing is 
that 50% to 60% of non-violent crime and 40% of violent crime is 
not reported to the police.  The fact is that crime is 
increasing. Youth violent crime in particular is increasing.  It 
has doubled since 1986.  What can we do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a failure of the system to deal with it.  Our 
traditional response of detection, detention and deterrence 
simply has not worked.  If one looks at them carefully the 
statistics bear that out.  We have not been able to put forward a 
system that protects victims rights.  We do not have a system 
that prevents crime, but there are solutions out there.  What can 
we do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put forth some constructive solutions that members of my 
party and other parties have been putting forth for some time. 
The first thing—

will live up to its advance billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this hopefully riveting speech I was talking about justice 
and the Reform Party's motion today on what we can do to improve 
and revamp our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing we have to realize is prevention.  How do we 
prevent criminal activity? If we are to do this we have to peer 
at the roots of criminal activity.  If we look at the people who 
are incarcerated in our jails many of them have had family 
histories that can only be described as a house of horrors. 
While their history does not exonerate them from their actions, 
perhaps it makes us understand how they came to have fractured 
psyches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It starts often at time zero.  It is estimated that half of all 
people incarcerated in our jails have fetal alcohol syndrome or 
fetal alcohol effects.  Fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading 
cause of irreversible neurologic damage in our society today.  It 
is increasing in geometric proportions.  Some communities have 
incidence rates as high as over 60 per 1000 live births.  These 
people have IQs of an average of 68. 
They have a great deal of difficulty in interpersonal 
relationships, a great deal of cognitive disabilities.  It makes 
it very difficult for them to interact and engage in society. 
Some of these people go on to lives of crime or at best have 
difficulty interacting in society.  We need to prevent this.  In 
order to prevent it, we have to work in utero.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to make sure that children are not subjected to 
abuse, sexual abuse, violence, improper nutrition or more subtle 
factors such as improper parenting and inconsistent parenting. 
All those factors in a cumulative effect have a dramatic effect 
on the building blocks of a normal psyche during that critical 
first eight years of life and in particular in the first three to 
four years of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Study after study demonstrates that the input we make in the 
first four years of life has a dramatic and profound effect on 
those individuals and is also highly cost effective.  Programs 
from Moncton to Hawaii to Michigan have demonstrated a 50% to 60% 
reduction in youth crime, a 50% reduction in teen pregnancies, 
higher rates of employment, less dependence on welfare and a $6 
saving for every $1 invested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Head start programs are a win-win situation if they are done 
properly.  I was very pleased that Motion No. 261 calling for a 
national head start program was passed yesterday by this House 
and I want to thank all the members who supported it from all 
parties, except the Bloc Quebecois that voted against it, and I 
applaud them for putting partisanship aside for the betterment of 
the children of this country.  My hope is we will be working 
together to make this a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already five provinces and territories are on side and they want 
to work with the federal government, with parliament, to make 
this a reality.  We can save a lot of people's lives and save a 
lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Fraser Valley East put forth a very 
comprehensive victims bill of rights that we have been pushing 
forward. The government should adopt it.  Far too many times we 
see victims are left in the shadows and salt is actually poured 
on to their open wounds as the result of a system that puts a 
preferential onus on the convicted and not on the victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look too at alternative measures of sentencing. 
Restorative justice has been used in British Columbia and is 
starting to be used in a very cost effective manner.  In British 
Columbia under this program it costs as little as $290 per 
individual, a dramatic saving from the $95,000 it takes to 
incarcerate a youth in a jail for a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Restorative justice works for a select group of individuals who 
are first time offenders for non-violent offences and where they 
have the approval of the community and, most of all, the approval 
of the victim.  In a restorative justice program the incidence of 
recidivism has dropped dramatically.  It is over 95% successful 
for individuals selected for that program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also look at tougher penalties for individuals who are 
committing violent offences, repeat offenders, pimps, individuals 
who have shown an utter disregard for society. This population 
needs to be separated from the other individuals who are 
non-violent offenders, non-repeat offenders, first time offenders 
where there is a hope of trying to break them out of a cycle of 
crime, punishment and recidivism. My colleagues have put forth 
many constructive suggestions along those lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at naming young offenders, not only those who 
are committing violent offences, who are 16 and 17 years of age, 
but all violent offenders. The rationale is if we accept that 
restorative justice works at least in part on the principle of 
shaming, then why do we not name all individuals who are young 
offenders and committing offences, be they violent or non-violent 
offenders?  Society has a right to know.  The neighbour has a 
right to know whether the person beside them is a B and E artist 
or a sexual predator.  The public has a right to know and public 
safety must be first and foremost in our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While these individuals are in jail let us make it obligatory 
that they engage in counselling sessions for violent behaviour or 
for their substance abuse problems.  Let us make it obligatory 
that they take training programs so that once they get out of 
jail they can take up a role as an integrated part of society. 
There is no obligation.  Right now people can be let out of jail 
and paroled with spending as little as one third of their 
sentence.  When a person gets sentenced for nine years, they can 
be out after three.  What kind of justice system is that?

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it is a better thing to say they are going to be 
sentenced to nine years but that they can earn having that 
sentence whittled down if they take the measures necessary to 
treat whatever problems they have, be they psychological, to get 
the skills necessary to become a functional member of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also we have to look at post-discharge issues.  When criminals 
get out of jail, we should have the systems in place to help them 
integrate into society.  Many of them get lost in the shuffle, 
fall through the cracks and go back into a life of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about streamlining the justice system.  We have a 
justice system that too often engages in a system where somebody 
is arrested and it takes a long time for that person to get to 
trial and be convicted.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  We 
can put forth a streamlined system and this is not difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have immediately put forth a small group of 
individuals who can take constructive suggestions from around the 
world that have worked to implement right away into our system, 
to streamline it so that we manage to get the arrested person 
through to the court system to be judged by their peers and to 
either be exonerated or convicted and sentenced in an expeditious 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be fair to society and to the victims.  We also need 
to look at the system of how we put accountability into our 
system.  Why do we not examine electing judges?  Look at the 
experience in California where they have managed to elect judges 
while still managing to retain that separation of judicial 
independence from other parties such as this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is possible to do that.  It is possible to have elected 
judges and to still maintain judicial independence.  It is just 
the way in which the individuals are elected.  It would add 
accountability to a system that desperately needs an element of 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to consider looking at changing our system of legal aid. 
Look at the public defender system. Again in certain parts of 
the United States they have managed to institute a public 
defender system that saved taxpayers millions of dollars while 
still, with retrospective analysis, showed that those individuals 
got as good or better treatment under the law as they would have 
in the existing system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at a public defender system to replace the legal aid system 
we have now that is actually crushing under the demands placed on 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we fail to act that will be our biggest crime in this House. 
We have an opportunity not to study these issues for the nth time 
as we are apt to do in this House of Commons, not continue to 
examine an examination or study a study, but use the studies that 
have been done in this country, use the constructive solutions 
that have been put forth not only here but around the world, take 
the best of these solutions, discard what does not work and 
implement it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For heaven's sake, for Canadians, for the victims, for the 
people we can prevent from getting into a life of crime, let us 
act now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member has a good 
vantage point and has listened well to some of the strategies out 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of the comments he made fall very clearly into the agenda 
on a motion that passed in this House yesterday.  Much of that 
motion of this hon. member was also relying on the ideas that the 
crime prevention council, especially with respect to young 
offenders, brought to the foreground in the last parliament and 
that is why this government supported that initiative and funded 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this member very sincerely believes in restorative 
justice.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the member for Wild Rose talk about advisability, 
that he wished to have corporal punishment in our prison system. 
Could the hon. member advise me how this could be restorative 
justice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
parliamentary secretary for her intervention and for her support 
in passing Motion No. 261.  I know she believes in crime 
prevention.  I also thank her for bringing up the fine work that 
the National Crime Prevention Council has done for so long and I 
hope we can use the constructive solutions the council has been 
putting forth and enact them into this legislation rather than 
for us to merely talk about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not privy to the previous discussion the member refers to. 
The member for Saanich—Gulf Islands and the member for Surrey 
had come to my riding and spoken very eloquently about 
restorative justice, about preventive measures and I hope members 
on the other side would consult with them along those lines. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor—St. Clair, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his intervention but also 
for his motion which I was proud to support yesterday. I think it 
fits very well with some of the goals the government has and 
clearly it fits with the goals that some in his party have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an amendment voted on which the hon. member supported 
and I noticed the members for Nanaimo—Alberni, Prince 
George—Peace River, Blackstrap, Cypress Hills—Grasslands, 
Okanagan—Shuswap, Athabasca, West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, 
Calgary Southeast, and Skeena, all of whom are Reform members of 
parliament and colleagues of this hon. member, did not support 
that motion, the intent of which was extend the benefits of the 
hon. member's initial motion to native Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if he discussed this with them and what could 
possibly be their reason for not wanting to extend these benefits 
to our native children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for her question and also for the support she has given on Motion 
No. 261 and her actions on prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not discussed the issue with my colleagues but members 
from this party have always supported a head start program for 
aboriginal people.  The head start program that exists today 
exists within the aboriginal community and has been highly 
effective for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Toronto Centre—Rosedale has been working with 
members of the public who have been leaders in pushing forth the 
aboriginal head start program which has been highly effective.  I 
am hoping we can take elements from the aboriginal head start 
program and use those in employing a national head start strategy 
from which all Canadians will benefit regardless of whether they 
are aboriginal or non-aboriginal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps all members from this side do not differentiate or like 
to categorize people as to whether they are aboriginal or 
non-aboriginal but would prefer to look at everybody as 
Canadians, respecting everybody's differences, everybody's 
individualities and respecting all what those people through 
their differences bring to our multicultural society. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Order, please. It is my 
duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that 
the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment 
are as follows: the hon. member for Charlotte: Hepatitis C; the 
hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill, The Budget; the hon. member 
for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, Employment 
Insurance; the hon. member for Halifax West, Aboriginal Affairs;

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B>  I 
am pleased to speak to the Reform Party's supply day motion, the 
Reform Party that has been the only party that has been crusading 
against crime since we came to this place, the only party that 
has been listening to the voices of average Canadians who have 
some genuine fears about our society and the safety in our 
streets and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion today says that this House condemns, and condemn it 
should, the government for the deplorable state of Canada's 
criminal justice system and the government's lack of concern for 
public safety as demonstrated by its refusal to strengthen the 
Young Offenders Act, abolish conditional sentencing for violent 
offenders and introduce a victims bill of rights.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has failed miserably on all three counts.  Since 
1993 when it had an opportunity to bring in some real changes 
that would reflect some positive steps in our criminal justice 
system, it failed to do it.  It has at best settled for some sort 
of tinkering around the edges of a badly flawed criminal justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot go on with this speech without bringing up something 
that happened earlier today. Under a barrage of questions from 
the Conservative Party and the Reform Party, we stood here in 
utter amazement and watched the Minister of Justice of the 
Government of Canada and her parliamentary secretary flee from 
this House in an attempt to evade questions. They were questions 
that came from real Canadians.  They were questions about their 
safety and about the safety of their children.  They were 
questions about the terrible crime rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter what the Liberals say about crime rates going down 
in some areas, the level of crime in this country is at an 
unacceptable level.  Whether it has gone down or up, whichever 
way, the level of crime is simply unacceptable.  The Canadian 
people have been saying do something to address crime. 
The government has failed miserably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They fled from the House.  Cowardice was shown by the minister 
and her parliamentary secretary as they fled from the House and 
from the questions that we brought forward from Canadians from 
all across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I want to make sure there is no misunderstanding by the hon. 
member.  He keeps using phrases like fled from the House.  I 
believe the situation was one that unanimous consent was required 
to continue with the question beyond the allotted time for the 
minister— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That may well have 
been a point of clarification but it was not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the minister did have the 
opportunity to stay and answer the questions.  She chose not to. 
She chose to not give unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has continuously accused the Reform Party 
of fearmongering.  Let me tell members that it is the Liberal 
government that is spreading fear among society by its inaction 
of dealing with the criminal justice system and by its inaction 
of dealing with crime and the people who commit crimes. That is 
what is scaring people, not the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about real life crime situations and things that are 
actually happening. We talk about people who are getting 
assaulted, killed, raped and molested.  When we talk about those 
things, this is reality.  The government accuses us of 
fearmongering.  The people are afraid of this government.  That 
is what they are afraid of. They are afraid of the inaction that 
is happening with this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a justice minister who has come up with this set of 
proposals to change the Young Offenders Act.  It took well over a 
year to take some action.  Now after all this time and after the 
continued questioning by our justice critic from Crowfoot on when 
she would be bringing it forward, she said in a timely fashion. 
Day after day we asked her when she would bring it forward. 
Finally, her version of making some changes and bringing forward 
legislation is bringing forward a strategy, nothing concrete, 
just a bunch of ideas that could change six ways from Sunday by 
the time they actually hit the House if they ever do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no legislation.  There are no changes to the Young 
Offenders Act.  There is nothing. 
That is exactly what the Liberals have done with the criminal 
justice system since they came to power in 1993.  Nothing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to deal with conditioning sentencing, the scourge of the 
justice system.  People are committing violent crimes every day 
and are walking out of the courtrooms without doing one minute of 
jail time because the disgraced health minister, the former 
minister of justice, brought in legislation to allow conditional 
sentencing.  If ever there was a screwball idea in the justice 
system that was it.  People are committing violent offences, 
assaults, attempted murders, rapes, molesting children and are 
walking out of prison without doing a day's time because they 
fall under the conditional sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conditional sentencing provision is as heinous as some of 
the crimes that are happening which allow criminals to get out of 
jail and never serve any time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe you would find consent for the following motion, Mr. 
Speaker: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That for the remainder of this session motions pursuant to 
Standing Orders 57 and 78(3) shall not be receivable by the 
Chair. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for 
Prince George—Bulkley Valley has asked that for the remainder of 
this session motions pursuant to Standing Orders 57 and 78(3) 
shall not be received by the Chair.  Is there consent for that 
motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to continue 
talking about conditional sentences.  For people who are watching 
the debate, conditional sentencing is simply a loophole created 
by the former minister of justice which gives a judge the option 
of making a decision on whether people will be a threat to 
society and, if not, the judge can give the convicted people a 
conditional sentence of two years less a day that allows them to 
walk out of the court house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no problem with someone getting a conditional sentence 
for shoplifting, for writing a couple of bad cheques or for 
committing some other misdemeanour crime because they are 
non-violent crimes.  Certainly they will not be a threat to the 
safety of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give some examples of people who are walking out of court 
under conditional sentencing.  A fellow by the name of Fabian 
Torres received a conditional sentence in May 1997 after he 
pleaded guilty to manslaughter, which incidentally is killing 
somebody, in the shooting death of a 13 year old lad in 1995.  He 
killed him and he walked out without serving one single day in 
jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 10, 1998 the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> reported “No jail 
term shocks victims”.  A man who hypnotized his wife and forced 
his two step sons to have sex with her will not serve any time in 
jail.  Justice Robert Desmarais handed Robert Demers a 
conditional sentence of two years less a day and two years 
probation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question once again the sanity of conditional sentencing.  I 
also question the sanity of Justice Robert Desmarais who felt 
this was not a serious crime.  The fellow did no jail time.  The 
Edmonton <I>Sun</I> of March 18, 1998 reported that the sex 
exploiter was spared jail and talked of healing reserve.  The man 
was convicted by Justice Cecilia Johnson of sexual exploitation. 
The judge noticed his lack of remorse when he denied the charges 
right up to sentencing but agreed to the defence lawyer's 
suggestion that he should receive a conditional sentence. 
Something is wrong with this picture.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood—Assiniboine, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as I listened to the hon. member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley I could tell that he and his Reform Party 
colleagues thoroughly enjoy this kind of debate.  It is not the 
first time that members of the Reform Party have raised the issue 
of crime.  They do it over and over again.  The reason is that it 
scares people.  People get very afraid when they hear the kind of 
talk that comes from the Reform Party.  What is that called?  It 
is called fearmongering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has been in the House for about five years. 
Hardly a day goes by that it does not raise the issue of crime. 
What is that called?  That is fearmongering.  We could spell it 
with capital letters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley talks about 
conditional sentencing.  He suggests that this is a terrible 
innovation in the criminal justice system.  Let us make it 
absolutely clear that what he dislikes is giving discretion to 
judges.  It is another attempt on his part and on the part of the 
Reform Party to smear judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not long ago when there was an issue in the House about 
the salaries of judges and Reform members smeared judges. They 
are doing it again today.  It is absolutely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Just before the hon. 
member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley responds, I remind the 
House that it is our custom not to refer to members of the 
judiciary by name in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is very clear to me that 
while the member for Charleswood—Assiniboine and his colleagues 
would prefer to dream in Technicolor about the criminal justice 
system, that everything is all right, the Reform Party prefers to 
talk in real terms.  We prefer to relay what the voices of the 
Canadian people are telling us when we come to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not prefer to talk about some fuzzy philosophy that 
everything is okay and it is no one's fault.  The fact is that 
crime is happening, serious crime.  While the Liberals would 
prefer to cover it over and pretend it is not there, the Reform 
Party talks about it and will not stop talking about it. If the 
member for Charleswood—Assiniboine is getting tired of hearing 
us talk about it, I would suggest he not show up any more because 
we will not stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks about our talking about the judicial system.  When I 
look at some of the decisions and sentences handed down by some 
judges, quite frankly if I were king of picking judges I would be 
throwing a lot of them off the bench for some of the idiotic and 
insane sentences and decisions they have been making. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor—St. Clair, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I point out to the member for Prince George—Bulkley 
Valley that in the period September 3, 1996 to December 31, 1997 
there were 18,284 conditional sentences imposed.  He has given an 
example of three that have gone awry, all three of which have 
been appealed.  Others have been appealed and the courts of 
appeal are now stating that it is inappropriate to use 
conditional sentences in certain circumstances.  Those 
circumstances are the very circumstances these members are 
complaining about.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also remind the hon. member and his erstwhile colleagues 
of something that is very important.  They are every bit as much 
a part of the criminal justice system as any judge.  They have a 
responsibility that they abrogate every day not to fearmonger, 
not to malign people who are—

Prince George—Bulkley Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is absolutely amazing. 
The member just said that the courts of appeal are now saying 
that some of these conditional sentences are not appropriate. 
What a revelation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time I looked I thought it was the Liberal government 
that was supposed to be directing what happens in the criminal 
justice system.  The former justice minister was the one who 
brought in conditional sentencing and it was his Liberal 
colleagues who supported it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where the mistake was made.  Now, surprise, surprise, 
after the Reform Party has been talking about it ever since the 
Liberal government brought in that insane legislation, the courts 
of appeal are now saying that it is not appropriate to let 
violent criminals walk out of jail with no jail time after being 
convicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will never stop talking about the deplorable state of our 
justice system.  We will never stop talking about the reality of 
the crime that is happening. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to participate in the debate because I think it is a 
serious matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first want to address myself to all young people in Canada and 
applaud the majority of them who managed to get through the teen 
years, very difficult years, without having to engage in the 
youth justice system.  I do not think young people do this in a 
vacuum.  Most of them have parents and teachers.  Perhaps they 
have support through sporting activities and their daily lives. I 
applaud those young people, the majority of youth between ages 12 
and 17 in Canada.  They look like every other child on the 
street.  They look the same as they walk down the street. They 
walk in groups and not in gangs.  Most of them are wonderful 
children.  They are at a time in history when it is very 
difficult to grow up and face the challenges in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am having trouble even 
hearing myself with the rhetoric from the other side. The Reform 
Party never seems to want to stay and listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that a lot of good children are growing up healthy 
and responsible.  I wanted to start with that premise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second premise is that during the very short period of the 
difficult teen years many young children go through a temporary 
period where they get into trouble in the sense that they may 
come into conflict with our laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of them get into trouble because they commit 
property offences.  I will not say that property offences are 
insignificant because they are not.  I am sure all members of the 
House feel they have worked hard for their properties, homes and 
family security.  Canadians value and want a safe community to 
live in.  They do not want to be fearful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Property offences are far different in nature and need a 
different response than offences that a slim minority of children 
engage in involving violence.  Most violent offences of a 
criminal nature—and I want to stress this and maybe have 
Canadians understand it—are not committed by children, by young 
offenders, but actually by adults.  That is important to 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also stress that when we hear about rates of offences they are 
actually charge rates.  They are not conviction rates.  They are 
backed up by Juristat, a tracking mechanism in society doing 
victimization studies after the fact and tracking the charge 
rate.  They correlate quite well.  There is accuracy in these 
figures which show that crime is going down across the board in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not mean that a society ignores what crime there is. 
It just means that we must be doing something right. 
Something must be happening inside the system, inside society. 
The values of the majority of the Canadian public who seek a safe 
Canadian society are being responded to in a way that does work.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A safe society, how do we accomplish that?  If I create a new 
act or I change this or change that or put some more words into a 
statute and put it through a parliament, is that going to make my 
society better?  Some people think so.  But in reality what has 
to happen is that whatever legislation and whatever we call it 
which is accepted by the majority of the people living under 
those rules, people have to accept the rules of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words our legislation has to be based on the values 
that society holds dear.  That means responsibility.  That means 
some compassion.  That means accountability.  And it means giving 
an individual in this country a chance to rehabilitate. That is 
the major difference between the Canadian society, our system of 
justice, and some systems of justice in different countries 
around the world where the rights and the protections are not 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that mean we ignore victims?  Absolutely not.  In fact in 
the last couple of parliaments a lot of legislation and the 
actions of organizations across the country have very much taken 
to heart the need for all members to have a say for those people 
who are aggrieved by people who are not in control of their 
actions for period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to situations where we did change those rules.  In 
fact in the last parliament we strengthened and changed some of 
the rules with respect to young offenders.  We strengthened the 
rules with respect to DNA situations.  We strengthened the rules 
with respect to gun control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who in our society in Canada is not thinking today that down in 
the States they have a bigger problem than we do.  They have not 
had the will of their population to change the social more that 
thinks of a gun as a tool to which anyone of any age should have 
access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a different set of values.  If we want the values at the 
end of the system to be ingrained in a productive manner 
especially for the young children in our society who come into 
contravention of the law, then we have to put some values into 
the system which will surround the individual and try to change 
the behaviour while they are captured for a limited amount of 
time inside our justice system.  It starts right at the beginning 
of the charge and ends for an adult at the parole system and for 
a juvenile at the end of the system in which we deal with that 
child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are differences in the individuals before our justice 
system just as there are differences in the individual needs of 
people inside a family, inside a community, inside a school, 
inside an organization.  People are not clones of one another. 
They come with their positives and their deficits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of the children who go through our young offenders system 
have some social deficits.  They have social deficits that may 
stem, not always but may stem from poverty conditions or that may 
stem from illiteracy. Maybe they have a dysfunctional family.  In 
fact many do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all wish that there would be healthy, nurturing families 
surrounding every child in Canadian society, that there would not 
be child poverty.  For some children with attention deficit 
disorders or learning disabilities, we might wish that we could 
put a white picket fence around them, give them a mother and 
father who are employed and functional and supportive.  Where we 
cannot though we have to have systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of those have to come in the form of the social welfare 
system that is administered by the provinces.  There are 
situations where we have good integration. I applaud the province 
of Quebec because it has a better system than many of the 
provinces for dealing with its young offenders.  The solution is 
not to criminalize so as to access the social welfare system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are provinces where there are gaps. We know from evidence. 
We have to be careful to stay with evidence, things we can prove 
as opposed to thinking about or perhaps have a perception which 
is usually a misperception.  We have to divorce the perceptions 
from the realities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of very good work done has been done on what are the 
causes and what can be the benefits of a well integrated, well 
defined program for young offenders to have a better outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is a party in the House that would not want 
a better outcome and that includes the Reform Party.  Sometimes 
the rhetoric and partisanship that surround this issue rob 
Canadian taxpayers of the viewpoint that is best for Canada, the 
viewpoint that kids come first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot penalize kids more than when we have a choice between 
money spent on penalties and money spent on rehabilitation.  We 
could probably tell 3 year olds or 10 year olds that they will be 
in trouble when they hit the young offender system.  We could ask 
any teacher in any riding and they would be able to point out who 
is having problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need systems outside the justice system supporting children. 
That is where there needs to be some financing.  If we spend 
money preventing children from turning into young offenders we 
will have accomplished something of which we can be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People often talk about costs and wastes in government. In my 
mind a waste is to build a building that incarcerates people and 
warehouses them without giving them good programming so that 
there is some benefit for those individuals and hence for 
society. If young or old people are put in a building and their 
behaviour is not changed during the time they are there, we have 
wasted that dollar.  Eighty per cent of adult offenders will be 
on the street again.  What do they learn while they are 
incarcerated?  They learn about brutalization and anger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in our penitentiaries.  I am five foot one.  If I 
stretch out my hands I can touch both walls of a cell where often 
two prisoners are housed.  It is not a cell built for two but a 
cell that is accommodating usually two adult males.  There are 
sleeping accommodations and a toilet facility in the cell. People 
ask “Why do I care if they are crowded or it is uncomfortable 
for them?  There many other better human beings to spend money 
on”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That tells me in the double bunking system of our justice system 
that there is not enough money to provide programs. There is not 
enough money for programs for these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is much easier for an opposition member to talk about a nine 
hole golf course, the extreme exception.  What is more the rule 
is the double bunking situation where there is insufficient 
programming, a situation which breeds unrest, violence and many 
things people do not want to think about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a mother of two teenage boys and another younger child coming 
up through the system I could not think of a worse place to send 
a child, especially if they are in trouble.  It would be 
horrific.  It is not in line with the values of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can go through the process of looking at some of the 
recommendations the justice committee has worked on. All members 
of all parties on the justice committee and members of the 
communities have worked hard.  We just returned from a week in my 
riding where I talked with the partners in my community involved 
in these issues.  They regularly talk with me and voice their 
ideas.  Their ideas work.  The community is where the best ideas 
will come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot sit in parliament and dictate to people what will solve 
the issues in their communities. 
We have to facilitate a mechanism that may involve for young 
offenders and adult offenders some alternate measures. Then the 
community will have to find a much cheaper way. Alternate 
measures are much cheaper than incarceration, especially for 
juveniles. Up to $100,000 a year can be spent on a custody 
situation for a juvenile.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in my riding in London, Ontario we have something 
called the youth justice system.  It is a diversion for young 
offenders out of the court system, not on serious crimes, but 
again I stress most young offenders are not involved in serious 
violent crimes.  It takes those young offenders and the community 
chooses people, adults and youth, to sit in a discussion group 
and the young offender has accountability for the offence. There 
is counselling. They are trying to figure out what created the 
problem.  They are not pointing a finger saying “you are the 
problem”, but they are figuring out what created the problem and 
how will it be fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That youth then often is involved in a restitution situation to 
whomever he has harmed.  There is often a community working 
restitution order.  It is whatever is wanted as a creative 
solution at a very low cost and which is very fast.  Most 
sentencing youth justice circles take less than three hours. 
Often the parents, or whoever is living with the child and is 
responsible for the child is in attendance.  In fact if they are 
not, it tends not to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no long time schedule.  We who deal with teenagers know 
that tomorrow is forever.  A court system is slow.  In my opinion 
I would rather see the majority going to alternate measures 
outside the very formalized courtroom setting and into something 
which I think will bring real value and real solutions at far 
less cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be looking at the community to help us design these 
measures.  As members of parliament we should be there as 
facilitators.  It is so much cheaper, so much better and so much 
safer for society to prevent the offence than it ever is to come 
after the fact and punish for the offence.  In that way we can 
build the values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of those systems are there now.  It could be the sports and 
recreation system or the tutoring system.  It could be as basic 
as nutrition programs. There is a need for breakfast programs in 
some of our communities, let us face it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that Canadian youth are far from perfect. 
Our justice system is far from perfect.  There is a need and I 
believe a desire in this country to get beyond the rhetoric of 
crime and the fear of crime, and into the real working situations 
day in and day out.  This will model a justice system that 
actually does benefit our society, as opposed to always focusing 
on unfortunately what the media can sell a paper with, which is 
the latest crime.  There is nothing I would wish more than to 
never have those horrific crimes occur, but when they do there 
will be a stricter discipline system.  However those crimes are 
the minority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our legislation has to cover everything from the extremes 
through to the broad middle section. It is important that we also 
remember all of those youth and those adults in this country who 
never come into contact with our criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final thing I will say is that it is so very important for 
Canadians to understand that there is judicial independence from 
the politics of a nation in our justice system in Canada.  I 
applaud that concept.  I believe in that concept.  Judicial 
independence is as fundamental to our system of working in a 
Canadian democracy that values rights and freedoms as is privacy 
of information in our taxation system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I want to thank the hon. member for her intervention today on 
what I think we all agree is a very important topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate at times that in the heat of debate the 
atmosphere in the Chamber does not allow for reasoned debate.  I 
think we all participate in that.  I know I do.  I confess that 
from time to time we do not allow it to be a chamber of reasoned 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It saddens me, as a member of parliament and as a member of the 
opposition, when we bring in a motion like this, which will 
hopefully serve to open the debate even further, that sometimes 
members opposite and even those on my left would heap only scorn 
and anger upon us because they do not agree with our position. 
They do not acknowledge that we are speaking for a number of 
people in the country who are very concerned about this problem 
perhaps from a little different perspective than theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met last week with a group of people in my riding who were 
concerned about the Young Offenders Act.  Some of them were young 
people. I want to pay tribute to a young person in my riding by 
the name of Sarah Taylor who, in response to concern among young 
people over youth crime in her school and the surrounding area, 
started a youth against crime club in her school.  I commend this 
young woman.  She has taken an initiative to tackle the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the feedback I get from her and from others is that 
there is the perception that somehow either there is no fear of 
consequence of action in our country because of our laws or kids 
just do not get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should our laws act somehow as a deterrent to crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think it is correct to 
say that most teenagers will say that the Young Offenders Act has 
no teeth.  They actually believe that.  Yet when the police do a 
criminal investigation, the whole system surrounding an offence 
has exactly the same investigative powers, the same charge 
powers.  So that is just wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a misperception about the system.  They would get a 
very quick surprise at how fast that system would take them in. 
It is not sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the analogies I use when I am talking to groups is that 
if I was sick and people were concerned about my illness they 
would tell me about the remedies that cured their disease.  But 
in the long run, if I was really sick, I would still go to my 
doctor.  If I was really, really sick, I would want the best 
specialist I could get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes I think it is our obligation as members of parliament 
responsible for these issues to actually go and seek the best 
evidence we can get and then act on what will actually fix the 
problem; what will help to solve the problem, as opposed to what 
will satisfy the fears and the anecdotes.  I think that is 
important to remember in this debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, when I 
have been in the Yukon in the last while there has been a lot of 
dissatisfaction with the justice system and there is some fear. 
However, when there is satisfaction, it is very clear where it is 
coming from.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The First Nations people have the option of circle sentencing. 
They still go through a trial procedure, but they have the option 
of going to their community for circle sentencing where they will 
have to face their victims, their parents, their aunts, their 
uncles and the community.  That also makes the community 
responsible for that person.  There seems to be a bit of envy 
that the option is there for some people to serve their sentences 
in their communities with the support of the people who matter 
most to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member see that sort of situation becoming available to 
all of us?  It does put a lot of responsibility on individuals to 
follow it through.  We cannot just stick the criminal in a jail 
and pay someone to look after them.  It means that they come into 
our homes, our schools, onto our streets and we are all 
responsible for them.  Can the member see that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for that excellent question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it was my desire, all kids in this country who have been 
convicted of less than violent offences would be in a justice 
circle modelled after the native sentencing system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is happening in my riding right now.  It was an interesting 
partnership that started it.  Neighbourhood Watch teamed up with 
the St. Leonard's Society in my riding of London West, Ontario, 
and put it to together.  Even the provincial Government of 
Ontario, which often talks about boot camps, is helping to fund 
some of these circles, or justice circles as they wish to be 
called in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recently as last week there was a movement to put the 
partners together with the Fanshawe College social worker, 
students together with the local board of education, to alleviate 
some of these partnership concerns and to get the synergy of 
people working in an interdisciplinary fashion on the same 
problems, surrounding the offender with a system that would be 
supportive long after the sentencing circle had gone for the 
evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very inexpensive thing to do.  It is done mainly with 
volunteers and expert supervision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that this is something we could see a lot more of in 
different communities around the country.  It makes communities 
take ownership of and embrace their own children.  They do not 
have to rely on prisons for a period of incarceration, pretending 
that they can forget about them and they will come back better. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, certainly our role in the opposition is 
to hold the government to account.  Our job is also to present 
constructive alternatives.  When we bring the issue of justice to 
this Chamber, certainly the government should not mischaracterize 
our points in defence when perhaps in the public view it is found 
lacking in the operation of the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals say we are extreme, they are just plain wrong. 
It is the failing system that is extreme.  When they say we are 
simplistic, I think that is somewhat of an admission from the 
government that these complex issues of justice administration 
are rather confounding the government and it just does not know 
what to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the justice minister talked about the criminal justice 
system, the mental health system and the social welfare system, 
especially for young offenders.  However, she forgets that it is 
the criminal justice system which provides the railway track for 
the train to be able to get to the social welfare system and the 
mental health system, for it is the police that form the 24 hour 
social agency in most of Canada, especially in the outlying 
communities.  It is often in that context that the mental health 
worker or someone from the hospital and the local social welfare 
agency get together with the local justice system person to deal 
with problem families and issues.  Unless we have the criminal 
justice system to provide the authority to act, we cannot bring 
to bear the other social services in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to talk about what the justice minister said the other 
day.  The justice minister said “justice delayed is justice 
denied”, but she continues to delay the introduction of the 
needed amendments to the Young Offenders Act and fails to bring 
in a victims' bill of rights.  When are we going to have some 
legislation rather than continued reports and press releases?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak in the House on the motion put forward 
by one of my colleagues in the Reform Party on this opposition 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to admit that the current criminal justice system has 
some major failings, in terms of both its application and its 
principles.  However, I should point out that the Bloc Quebecois 
vigorously distances itself—and I underscore the word 
vigorously—from the positions advocated by the Reform Party, 
which represent in our opinion a vision of things worthy of the 
best westerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party places itself at the far right of the political 
checkerboard, whereas the Bloc is right in the centre, just 
because of the people it represents.  This dichotomy in a matter 
so complex illustrates the state of Canadian federalism and the 
impossibility of its being properly reformed.  Quebec's 
expectations are incompatible with the perceptions of the rest 
of Canada.  This matter is simply one more example that two 
completely distinct societies are living within a single state 
and this arrangement does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of the Young Offenders Act, we were right to 
criticize the initiative of the Minister of Justice, because she 
was giving in unduly to western pressure on the application of 
criminal justice to young people, something that is totally 
unacceptable and simply a way to make political points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's parliamentary secretary herself said on <I>Le Point</I> 
on CBC French television that the aim of the reform was to 
solicit public support rather than to expose the real problems 
and propose solutions.  Need we add anything?  I do not think 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Toughening sentences for young offenders is not the best way to 
discourage criminals in waiting.  There are other much more 
flexible methods that would ensure a better performance and 
therefore greater justice within our society.  Branding a young 
person for the rest of his life will help neither him nor 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to those in the criminal justice system in Quebec, 
this message must be brought home.  The Young Offenders Act 
raises problems in its application and not in its present form. 
If the Young Offenders Act were applied as it ought to be, 
according to the way it is written, everything would be fine. 
The proof of this is that the province which applies it best is 
Quebec, and Quebec is where there are the best results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are perpetually confronted by the incompatibility between 
Quebec and the rest of Canada, the west in particular. We are 
caught in a vicious circle and, with her fake reform, the 
minister is endangering the very foundations of the justice 
system and the efforts expended against youth crime, 
particularly in Quebec where, as I have said, it is working 
fine, though not perfectly. 
Before changing the act, however, I believe that, as the former 
Minister of Justice said himself, it must be applied as it was 
intended to be applied, and the other provinces would be well 
advised to follow the example of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning the conditional sentencing of young offenders, the 
parole system is based on the principle of rehabilitating 
offenders.  This is a principle that is dear to the hearts of 
the large majority of Quebeckers, and of Canadians I believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commission has followed on commission, report after report, and 
consultations of all kinds were held on the early parole 
procedure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What we can conclude, without fear of being wrong, is that there 
is a problem with the system itself, not the principle 
underlying it.  There are numerous examples of offenders being 
released for good conduct after serving one-sixth of their 
sentence.  Several examples could be given, but it would waste 
the time of colleagues in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Authorities are applying the principle of good institutional 
conduct, which, by definition, should guarantee the same conduct 
outside the establishment.  This is the crux of the problem. 
The same conclusions are based on two completely different 
realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois have drafted a bill along these lines 
that will be introduced shortly, so that offenders are not 
released after serving one-sixth of their sentence.  I urge all 
colleagues in the House to support us in this undertaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for victims' rights, beyond all the considerations we accord 
the criminal justice system, it must be remembered that those 
most affected by this issue are still the victims.  Before all 
else, we must think of these people, the innocent victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a necessary balance to be achieved between the 
treatment reserved for offenders on the one hand and victims' 
rights on the other, and finally the general public.  If the 
balance between these three categories is destroyed, nobody 
wins, not the victims, not the offenders, who also have rights, 
not society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without saying that we support the Reform Party on the issue of 
victims' rights, we cannot deny that the government's initiative 
of passing legislation on this thorny issue must be examined 
more closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</B> Yes, indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> The Bloc Quebecois is demonstrating its 
open-mindedness in all the debates and this issue will be debated 
in the same way.  I appreciate the verbal support of my 
colleague, the member for Richelieu. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> And others as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> And others as well who are with me in this 
august Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in all this debate over victims rights, sight must not 
be lost of the provinces' role in the administration of justice, 
because the provinces are in the best position to meet the needs 
and expectations of the societies they represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must not become another example of useless, costly and 
unproductive duplication.  The federal government must respect 
the jurisdictions of the provinces, especially, and I bust my 
britches with pleasure here—since we are often accused of 
working ourselves into a state over things—because Quebec's 
treatment of victims is exemplary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should not be currying public favour, and 
especially that of the west, as it did with the reform of the 
Young Offenders Act. The stakes are high and should not be the 
focus of petty politicking by the other parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite all the other parties to follow the example of the 
behaviour and positions taken by the Bloc Quebecois, because its 
apolitical and impartial behaviour sets the example for all 
parties in this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we did the 10 year review of the Young Offenders Act of 
course we went to Quebec and we listened to a number of 
witnesses.  I was impressed with the advance that the Government 
of Quebec extends beyond what most other provinces have in terms 
of the treatment of young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet according to an editorial in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I>, 
there is a way to go even in the province of Quebec. Teachers in 
Montreal's largest school board are indicating that they live in 
a state of fear.  In the last two years 90 incidents occurred 
where teachers were physically assaulted by students and 30% of 
the cases were considered so serious that police were called in.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Teachers have been punched, kicked, choked, bitten and

youth crime problem in Montreal, certainly in this school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we travelled about in the last two months, we were in a 
number of urban schools.  When talking to the high school 
students, grades 11 and 12, I was amazed at the number of 
students who raised their hands and said they lived in 
apprehension and fear.  That is very sad for me to hear that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were in western Canada. We will be holding public meetings in 
June in Ontario and will be asking the same questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a degree of apprehension on the part of our students 
and I imagine there is a degree of apprehension with the students 
in the Montreal school this article refers to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if I might address a question to the hon. member 
dealing with this whole concept of the recommendation made to 
parliament by the justice committee with regard to the lowering 
of the age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We questioned some of the officials from the department when we 
were in Quebec and they seem to have a very good system of 
dealing with youngsters under 12 who get into difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member would care to share the response of 
the authorities.  When the police are investigating an offence 
and they realize it has been committed by someone under the age 
of 12, what is the process that occurs in Quebec? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Crowfoot for his question.  Although we do not always share the 
same position, I believe our debates within the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights are productive for all of 
its members and for everyone in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that my hon. colleague referred to 
what I would call the exemplary treatment the Government of 
Quebec gives to young offenders.  This merits attention, and 
should even been copied outside Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member referred to an editorial in <I>The Gazette</I>.  With 
all due respect to my colleague and to the newspaper, I must say 
that it does not constitute a reference for myself or a number 
of my colleagues. 
That is, to put it mildly, an understatement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I taught in a number of secondary schools in my riding before 
being elected to this august Chamber.  I believe, once again, 
that it is important to distinguish between reality and 
perceived reality.  Are teachers and the general public afraid 
of crime?  I believe the answer is yes.  Do the facts justify 
that fear?  Not as much, I think, as some would have us believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to minimize the hazards to which teachers are 
exposed, but the emphasis should not be on punishing young 
people who beat up a teacher, but rather on raising awareness, 
prevention, information programs and promoting non-violence. 
This should replace the threat of the strap if the child 
misbehaves.  We used to think that a smack on the fingers with a 
ruler worked, but that is no longer done, and our schools are 
none the worse for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to repeat for the benefit of my 
colleague that the members of the Bloc Quebecois are against 
lowering the age in the Young Offenders Act, because we 
unanimously believe that, as my colleague to the left has said, 
we will arrive at a fairer and less violent society not by 
stigmatizing young people but by raising their awareness.

provide us with some information.  Is it true that there is an 
argument between Canada and Quebec as to whether this 
government, the government of which the parliamentary secretary 
is a member, owes Quebec the considerable sum of $77 million, 
which is not peanuts, considering that we are administering this

on Quebec's approach?  I am sure he will have much to say on

<A NAME="LINK219">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.)</B> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights be instructed, in accordance with 
Standing Order 68(4)(<I>b</I>), to prepare and bring in a bill to 
prevent the use of conditional sentencing in cases where someone 
is convicted of any sexual offence, drug trafficking, or any 
other violent crime. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise this evening to 
elaborate on my Motion No. 383.  It is very appropriate, almost 
ironically so, that the one day allotted for my private member's 
motion concerning conditional sentencing happened to fall on this 
Reform supply day.  In its role as official opposition the Reform 
moved a supply motion that was debated by all parties in the 
House.  We debated conditional sentencing, the Young Offenders 
Act and other aspects of the failed legal system which is 
presently masquerading as a justice system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that Motion No. 383 is limited to simple 
elaboration.  The committee responsible for determining which 
private members' motions are votable and worthy of three hours of 
debate in this House did not feel inclined to allow all members 
of this House to explore the issue further.  Naturally I am 
extremely disappointed in that decision as this motion is 
non-partisan in nature.  It is simply a mechanism I proposed to 
remedy a legislative error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The granting of conditional sentences to violent and sexual 
offenders is indeed an error.  It was never the intent of this 
House in the last parliament to have Bill C-41, which instituted 
the concept of conditional sentencing, apply to those types of 
crimes.  That is one of the issues that was being debated 
virtually all day in the House. Even the justice minister at the 
time publicly stated that was never the intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through this motion I wanted to right that wrong by using the 
resources and co-operation of the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Human Rights.  This motion does not propose something 
concretely unpalatable to any members of this House.  It is a 
first step in drafting a reasonable remedy to the ambiguity of 
conditional sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe certain members of the private members' business 
committee did not understand that intent.  During my presentation 
the chair of the committee asked  “And just how many more 
prisons would have to be built if your motion were passed?”  In 
case any members of the House are asking themselves that same 
question, I caution that they do not understand the motion.  I 
emphasize that the prison population will not suddenly expand to 
phenomenal proportions if conditional sentencing were disallowed 
for violent and sexual offenders and drug traffickers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional sentencing is a recent development.  It has not been 
responsible for significantly reducing the prison population 
throughout the years.  It did not take effect until September 3, 
1996, so the answer is no.  There will be no sudden overwhelming 
need to build more prisons. I fear the chair of the committee 
missed the entire point of my motion when she asked that 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional sentences have created confusion and ambiguity in 
the legal system across the country.  It is ironic that when Bill 
C-41 was before the House the justice minister at the time said 
the bill would improve the process of sentencing and criminal 
law.  I ask government members to listen carefully to his words 
which so specifically describe the intent of Bill C-41: “In this 
bill, parliament is given the opportunity to declare the key 
purposes of sentencing, to put before judges a list of factors to 
be taken into account, to provide direction, to encourage 
uniformity so that the purpose of the process can be properly 
understood and so that it might be rendered more predictable than 
it is at present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“What are those purposes and principles? 
They are spelled out clearly and in plain language in the 
statute. The sentence would reflect the seriousness of the 
offence.  There would be similar sentences for comparable crimes. 
Those who contravene the criminal law must face punishment”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were the words of the justice minister in June 1995.  He 
said that Bill C-41 was to assist the courts in making the 
sentencing process more reliable and more consistent with the 
intentions of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now fast forward to January 1998, more than a year after Bill 
C-41 provisions took effect.  The current justice minister 
publicly stated: “There have been some circumstances in which I 
believe conditional sentences were used when it was not the 
intention of parliament to have them used and those should be 
appealed”.  She added that conditional sentencing was never 
intended to apply to violent or sexual offenders. While Bill C-41 
was supposed to clear up ambiguity in sentencing she said she 
prefers to allow the appeal courts to address the inappropriate 
use of conditional sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, this is entirely opposite to the promises of 
consistency and reliability for the courts in using Bill C-41 as 
a guide which were given by the former justice minister in 1995. 
Since its implementation conditional sentencing has been used in 
cases of rape, assault, drug trafficking and other violent 
offences.  Canadians are alarmed at this application of the 
Criminal Code and communities feel threatened.  The punishment 
certainly does not fit the crime.  This is not a tough on crime 
perspective.  This is just the simple facts of the wrongful use 
of conditional sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rapists, violent offenders and those who attempt to exploit 
children and the weak through a profitable drug trade should face 
jail time.  In Grande Prairie, Alberta a judge released a man on a 
conditional sentence after he fired a .22 calibre sawed-off rifle 
at his wife but he missed.  He received an 18 month conditional 
sentence to be served in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a B.C. case a man who confessed to sexually assaulting his 
babysitter once a week for three years from the time she was 11 
was excused from serving any time in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Nova Scotia a convicted wife beater received a conditional 
sentence.  In Ontario another man pleaded guilty to carrying a 
pellet rifle while assaulting and forcibly confining his 
estranged wife in her Mississauga home while his children 
watched.  His punishment was an 18 month conditional sentence 
through which he was to live with his parents and stay at least a 
kilometre away from his wife and children, despite the fact that 
his wife believes he will return to kill her some day and the 
children remain fearful of even seeing their father. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A B.C. man was convicted of two counts of indecent assault and 
three counts of gross indecency. The victim was a child he helped 
raise from the age of three months and the sexual assaults began 
when she was three and ended when she was thirteen.  This man was 
spared jail time on a conditional sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another B.C. case a man who threatened, raped and sodomized a 
38-year old woman with the handle of racquetball racquet received 
a conditional sentence exempting him from serving two years in 
jail.  The sentence was appealed and the offender eventually 
received a sentence of two years in jail less time served; in 
other words, just a few months in jail for that horrendous crime. 
The appeal itself was a drain of resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about fearmongering here.  We are talking 
about legal precedents.  These are just a few of the examples of 
phenomena occurring with increased frequency.  In any of these 
cases I find it impossible to believe that any reasonable and 
feeling human could consider that these offenders should not go 
to jail for their crimes.  The victims of these criminals deserve 
better.  It sends the message that despite the pain and suffering 
resulting from the violent trauma they have endured society does 
not feel it is worthy of punishment for the offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine how this must feel to the victims of these crimes.  Many 
victims have compared an inadequate sentence to enduring the 
attack all over again. Unfortunately in some cases an inadequate 
sentence may actually mean the attack will occur again. This is 
certainly a very real possibility for victims of domestic 
violence and sexual crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A woman whose husband, ex-husband or boyfriend has beaten or 
raped her and is released on a conditional sentence lives every 
day in fear of that happening.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since he is not in jail he is able to strike again.  As we have 
seen, once these offenders are obsessed with the intent to harm 
their victim the restrictions imposed under conditional 
sentencing are not much deterrence, little deterrence if any at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two fundamental reasons for sentencing are punishment and 
deterrence.  Fair and just sentences are required to denounce 
unlawful conduct, deter offenders and others from committing 
criminal offences, separate offenders from society when 
necessary, provide reparations for damages and promote a sense of 
responsibility in offenders and an acknowledgement of the harm 
done to victims and the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What deterrence is there for a convicted drug trafficker granted 
a conditional sentence?  The trafficker has already shown a 
preference for profit over the welfare of children and other 
users.  What part of a conditional sentence could possibly 
convince that person to give up their trade?  They are 
immediately back out on the streets on a conditional sentence. 
The best source of income they know is to continue pushing drugs. 
There is certainly no deterrence.  As for fair punishment, is a 
ticket to freedom justifiable for an individual motivated by 
greed through the physically harmful exploitation of others?  I 
ask that question to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sentences handed down in these cases and many others across 
Canada have created even more of a backlog in our justice system, 
as the legal wrangling ensues and appeal after appeal is 
initiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Keeping in mind what the former justice minister said about Bill 
C-41, making the sentencing process easier for the courts, and 
keeping in mind what the current justice minister said about 
leaving the subject of conditional sentencing up to appeal 
courts, listen to what the appeal courts have to say about 
conditional sentencing and parliament's role in it.  An Ontario 
appeal court judge stated: “The new sentencing direction set by 
parliament requires that the courts give these provisions a large 
and liberal construction and wherever possible the court should 
resort to the community sentence option”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Parliament clearly envisioned that a conditional sentence 
would be available even in cases of crimes of violence that are 
not punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment.  Parliament 
also contemplated that the conditional sentence would be 
available even where, absent appropriate controls, there may be 
some risk of reoffending”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much for the certainty in sentencing the justice minister 
claimed to have come with Bill C-41.  So much for the current 
justice minister's belief that parliament did not intend for 
conditional sentences to be granted for violent and sexual 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we really have is a wide ranging legal interpretation of 
parliament's intent and tremendous ambiguity.  My motion is a 
method to remedy this situation by instating more specifications 
in the Criminal Code on conditional sentencing.  The B.C. court 
of appeal agrees.  In a August 1997 decision the B.C. court of 
appeal ruled that violent offenders are entitled to serve time in 
the community under conditional sentences: “If parliament 
had intended to exclude certain offences from 
consideration under section 742.1, it could have done so in clear 
language”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is plainly and clearly an invitation for this House to 
enact clear language and to provide more certainty for 
conditional sentencing under section 742.1 of the Criminal Code. 
I believe we and this government have an obligation to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not get into blame and partisan finger pointing.  Let us 
just fix it.  We owe that to Canadians and we owe that to the 
victims of crime.  Canadian courts are already bogged down in 
legalities and appeals.  If it truly was the intention of Bill 
C-41 to relieve the confusion, we must ensure the conditional 
sentencing is not a further source of backlog in the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since parliament is responsible for initiating this ambiguity, 
parliament must also rectify the situation.  This motion was to 
send a clear message that we have a flexible and responsive 
democracy.  It is my hope that even though my motion has not been 
deemed votable other similar initiatives such as the motion 
debated by my hon. colleagues today, or even a legislative 
initiative by the government, will ultimately right this 
injustice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Motion M-283 arrives on a day when this subject is being 
discussed a fair bit, since the Reform Party had tabled a motion 
addressing conditional sentencing among other things, and 
therefore the same area of criminal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will understand that I am not going to go back over 
everything I said this morning on this.  This will, however, 
give me the opportunity to go more specifically into one part of 
this motion which relates to conditional releases in their 
entirety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand the hon. member's questioning this aspect, 
because there have been media reports in recent days of certain 
releases which were, all in all, very questionable, and very 
much so in certain cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall though, once again, I believe that the Bloc Quebecois 
and the Reform Party will not be able to agree, because it is 
not true that the system is rotten and needs to be demolished 
completely, and the law amended, nor that this act does not 
reflect reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said this morning, there is certainly room for improvement. 
There is always room for new ideas, in order to attain the very 
precise objective the Bloc Quebecois wants to see, as does the 
government.  Any responsible party shares that point of view, 
that objective of protecting the public. 
I think that, if there is one point on which all the members of 
this House agree, it is the protection of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, I believe the legislation on parole 
protects the public.  Does it protect enough?  Can it be 
changed?  No doubt.  Can it be changed to close up the loopholes 
in the system, and in the act applicable in such cases?  Yes, 
certainly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This must be looked at as dispassionately as possible, not by 
dragging out specific cases that make the headlines, dreadful 
cases that make one nauseated and affect our attitude toward the 
bill.  That is not what is needed.  I feel it must be looked at 
as coolly and objectively as possible, trying to find what we 
need to make this the best piece of legislation possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to devote the rest of my time to parole and to 
violent crime. 
There is one incontrovertible fact on the matter of parole. 
Offenders serving long sentences are more likely to obtain 
parole than those serving shorter sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance, that may appear horrifying, but I understood 
looking at the problem more carefully that 65% of  judges 
apparently, after very careful study, take the probability of 
parole into account in sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, a judge who knows very well that an offender will be 
paroled may, in the case of a violent crime, impose a harsher 
sentence.  Judges are therefore influenced by the possibility of 
parole and release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that a judge about to sentence someone for five, six 
or ten years will calculate that the individual will be released 
after serving a third or two thirds of his sentence, whichever 
case applies.  He will lengthen the sentence to ensure that the 
accused will serve a sentence that is respectable within our 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is wrong to say that the longer the time a person serves, 
the more quickly they are released.  The effect of certain 
amendments was somewhat contrary to the objective set for them, 
that is, in terms of rehabilitation and return to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My proof is the series of amendments made to the law as a result 
of the passing of Bill C-45, on the famous quick review 
procedure.  I think it was a good example of poor performance or 
rather the poor application of the intent of the legislator with 
this review. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are therefore going to take a closer look at the accelerated 
review procedure.  In a legislative reform in the fall of 1996, 
the government passed the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act.  Certain amendments were introduced in Bill C-45, 
particularly with respect to the accelerated review procedure 
found in section 125 of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a few months in practice, the new provisions resulted in 
numerous irregularities, not to say some rather strange 
sentences.  The result of Bill C-45's passage was that major 
organized crime drug traffickers were released on parole after 
serving only one-sixth of their sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as the 36th Parliament opened, the Bloc Quebecois began 
calling on the government to amend the new accelerated review 
procedure criteria in the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act.  The Bloc Quebecois member for Charlesbourg introduced a 
bill along these lines to try to plug the loopholes in the act 
in order to resolve the problem and particularly to improve the 
public's perception of the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act, an extremely important piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 125 provides that an offender may be released after 
serving one-sixth of his sentence if there are reasonable grounds 
to believe that he will not go on to commit a violent offence. 
There are a series of exceptions in section 125, but one was 
omitted, or perhaps there was a misunderstanding, because it 
seems to me that I asked the question in committee.  Whatever 
the case, the exception applying to drug traffickers is still 
not included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be easy to take care of the problem at this 
level and to improve the public's perception of the judicial 
system if the act were amended so as not to release someone 
found guilty of trafficking, money laundering, or importing or 
exporting drugs, after serving one-sixth of his sentence.  But 
this is a long time in coming.  The government does not seem to 
be in any rush. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have reason to hope that the bill introduced by the 
member for Charlesbourg, a Bloc member and our party's critic 
for the solicitor general will progress and that eventually we 
will manage to convince the government to make the necessary 
amendments to have the bill implemented and, especially, to 
improve people's perceptions of parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I was saying that I put questions to the committee and 
I thought I understood that money laundering and drug 
trafficking were excluded. 
We must certainly not forget that, in the Smith decision by the 
supreme court, Justice Lamer rendered a very important decision, 
establishing some link between drug trafficking and money 
launderers and violent crime, since we know that there is always 
violence at the end of the line with these activities, because 
those who want drugs steal, murder or whatever to come up with 
the money illegally to buy drugs. Yes, in the end these are 
violent crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the national parole board does not make the same 
interpretation. 
I invite those who may be listening to reread the Smith 
decision.  It is very interesting and will perhaps influence 
their decision in the application of section 125 of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, members will understand that I do not support the 
member's motion.  There is perhaps room for examination and the 
need for certain amendments in the law to make it more 
applicable and surer of meetings its objectives, but, in short, 
I think we have a good system.  There is room for improvement, 
but we must be reasonable and look very objectively a the 
problem in trying to find solutions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the comprehensive sentencing reform legislation introduced in the 
first session of the last parliament as Bill C-41 has been in 
force since September 3, 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this legislation included many reforms, including the 
first ever parliamentary statement of the purposes and principles 
of sentencing, several provisions addressing the needs of 
victims, the possibility of diversion for adult offenders and the 
new provisions for fines and fine enforcement, one of the 
centrepieces of the legislation was the conditional sentence of 
imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conditional sentence concept was first suggested in a white 
paper on sentencing in February 1984 by then minister of justice, 
the late Mark MacGuigan.  It is a sentence of imprisonment of 
less than two years which may be served in the community if the 
court is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community 
would not endanger the safety of the community and would be 
consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of 
sentencing now set out in the Criminal Code of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The offender must abide by whatever conditions are ordered by 
the court.  If the offender is found to have breached a 
condition, the balance of the sentence can be ordered to be 
served in custody. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to determining sentencing, there will always be 
decisions that will generate controversy and will seem 
questionable at first glance.  This is precisely why our appeal 
courts are so useful.  Without in any way minimizing the 
concerns we all have about certain conditional sentences, I 
believe that the hon. members must look at things in a balanced 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 18,000 orders for conditional sentencing have been 
brought down since September 1996, and the great majority of 
these were the result of well-informed and wise decisions. 
Certain questionable decisions have been brought to the 
attention of this House by various members. 
As usual, the opposition is passing off the exception as the 
rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, we shall be continuing to work in close 
collaboration with the provinces, as the minister has already 
said in this House, in order to monitor the application of the 
clauses relating to sentencing closely and to assess whether 
further changes are required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working with the provincial and territorial authorities 
responsible for prosecutions and correctional services in 
monitoring the use of conditional sentencing.  From September 3, 
1996 to December 31, 1997, there were 18,247 conditional 
sentences in this country, most of these for non-violent offences 
relating to property, operating a vehicle and the administration 
of justice. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario, for example, fraud is the offence which attracts the 
highest proportion of conditional sentences in terms of all 
sanctions.  We must also bear in mind that prior to the 
availability of conditional sentences a significant percentage of 
offences involving violence resulted in probation as the most 
serious sanction. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say a word about the case law that is 
developing.  Over 200 conditional sentences have been appealed 
since September 1996.  The courts are now working on an 
analytical and reasoned approach that could be used by judges in 
determining when to hand down a conditional sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They could invoke the purpose and principles of sentencing set 
out in paragraphs 718(1) and 718(2).  The specific purposes of 
sentencing, such as setting an example, deterrence, and 
rehabilitation, are being analysed and the courts are trying to 
determine how the sentences handed down can achieve these 
objectives. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Courts are placing emphasis on denunciations, deterrents and 
proportionality in sentencing offenders convicted of serious 
sexual offences.  Let me refer with approval to some of the 
statements which appellate courts have made in the context of 
considering whether a conditional sentence should be granted for 
an offender convicted of a sexual offence. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Justice Ryan for the majority of the British Columbia 
court of appeal in Ursel said “Violent, degrading sexual attacks 
against women demand denunciation and deterrence.  In a case such 
as this those sentencing objectives could not be adequately 
addressed through a conditional sentence”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec court of appeal in P.C. said “nor would the imposition 
of a less restrictive sanction” than imprisonment “satisfy the 
objectives of a general deterrence and denunciation of assaults 
against children by those who are supposed to be protecting 
them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario court of appeal in MacNaughton said “In our view it 
should only be in rare cases that a conditional sentence be 
imposed in cases of breach of trust involving the sexual touching 
of children by adults”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that these citations should reassure the House.  I 
subscribe to the thinking that these courts of appeal have 
adopted in the cases cited and in many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the courts have done well to focus on the fact 
that these offences do not generally lend themselves to 
conditional sentences, excepting in extenuating circumstances 
having to do with such things as the advanced age of the 
offender, and the severity of his mental or physical condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind hon. opposition members that a 
conditional sentence is no less a sentence of imprisonment. 
The court orders the offender to spend a certain period of time 
in prison.  The offender who meets the terms of section 742.1 
may, under certain conditions, serve his sentence in the 
community.  He may, however, be sentenced to serve the remainder 
of his sentence in prison if he violates any one of these 
conditions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, may I say that while I understand and share the 
concern citizens sometimes feel when reading accounts of certain 
sentencing decisions, and those exaggerated by the opposition 
members, I think the conditional sentence has added an important 
sentencing option to the Criminal Code of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without complete information about a case, the particulars of a 
case and all the possible mitigating circumstances and other 
factors, it is very difficult for us to sit in judgment of the 
appropriateness of a conditional sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trial courts have, for the most part, exercised their discretion 
with prudence.  Appellate courts continue to provide guidance and 
perspective and no doubt the Supreme Court of Canada will have 
the opportunity to give its views on conditional sentences at 
some point in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Justice appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights last month she tabled a 
letter to the chair suggesting it would be useful for the 
standing committee to undertake a review of the operation of 
conditional sentences at some point after the two year 
anniversary of the proclamation of Bill C-41. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be an opportunity for victims, criminal justice 
professionals, the public and even the opposition, because we do 
value their opinions when they are valuable, to express their 
views on the conditional sentencing option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One issue on which the minister indicated she would particularly 
appreciate the committee's advice related to whether or not there 
should be further limits on the availability of conditional 
sentences than those presently set out in the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the minister looks forward to working with the members of 
the justice committee, the member for Prince George—Peace River 
and all members in a shared desire to improve the criminal 
justice system for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this referral and the minister's desire to benefit 
from the committee's thinking on this important issue, it would 
be premature for this House to pre-empt the committee's work by 
voting in favour of the hon. member's motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased this afternoon to be able to speak to 
this motion.  I believe it is an excellent motion and I commend 
the hon. member for Prince George—Peace River for bringing this 
matter forward.  It is consistent with his party's motion that 
was debated in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls for the House to instruct the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights, of which I am a member, to 
prepare and bring for a bill to prevent the use—and I might 
suggest the word misuse—of conditional sentencing in cases where 
someone is convicted of a sexual offence, drug trafficking or a 
violent crime.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, the use of the words “sexual offence” and 
“violent crime” I could not agree with more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, members of the Conservative Party support the 
motion.  However, I find it somewhat disturbing and almost 
embarrassing that the government has taken the position that it 
would be opposed to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that this particular section of the Criminal Code 
originated from this government.  It is unfortunate that it does 
not recognize that it has been misused.  I do not criticize the 
intent so much as I do the fact that common sense should have 
allowed the government to see that it was going to be misused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The application of conditional sentencing has deeply affected 
Canadians' confidence in the criminal justice system.  It is 
another instance where, unfortunately, Canadians seem to have 
their confidence undermined when the government passes 
legislation that fails to protect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandatory use of this type of disposition is not something 
we are dealing with here, but the discretion is there.  The 
discretion exists and, sadly, discretion allows lawyers—and I am 
a member of that group—to potentially push the limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be honest.  That is what lawyers do.  That is what 
lawyers are going to do when given the opportunity.  They are 
going to argue their case in front of a judge and try to push the 
limits as far as they can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional sentencing was put in the Criminal Code to address 
in a better way the issue of non-violent offenders.  It would 
help to reduce the number of individuals who, if convicted, would 
find themselves serving time in a federal or provincial 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not argue with that philosophy.  We certainly want to 
divert individuals away from incarceration if and when the 
circumstances allow it.  However, the emphasis should be on the 
denunciation of violence, general and specific deterrents, which 
is something many cases, including the case of the Queen v Grady, 
espoused.  We want to generally and specifically deter 
individuals and denunciate violence when a specific criminal act 
occurs, but it always has to be balanced with the protection of 
the public, coupled with the reaffirmation and rehabilitation of 
a person when they run afoul of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely violent offences, sexual offences and offences involving 
children, in particular, were never the intent of conditional 
sentencing.  The hon. member opposite spoke of the fact that 
probation exists, that probation was an option when it came to 
sentencing and that this is, in essence, a perpetuation of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what we want to see and what this bill addresses is 
truth in sentencing.  Let us let the judges make that discretion. 
This is a halfway measure.  That is what it amounts to.  We want 
judges to have discretion, but this is on the horns of a dilemma 
where the person is basically allowed a second-second chance.  We 
are putting them back on the street and saying “We are going to 
give you one more shot at it.  If you offend again, then you are 
going to come back and complete the sentence that you would have 
received had their been truth in sentencing the first time 
around”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are becoming far too tolerant when it comes to offences of 
violence.  The minister herself has said time and time again that 
this is a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really fear there is a lot of lip service, a great deal of 
discussion and a great deal of intent on the part of the 
government to address these types of offences, when what we need 
is hard core legislation.  We need the government to do what it 
was elected to do.  If it is going to change the law this is the 
place to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due deference and respect to the Supreme Court of 
Canada, it does not make the law.  The Supreme Court of Canada is 
charged with interpreting the laws that are made in this place. 
What we have seen in recent years is the Supreme Court of Canada 
setting the standard or striking down significant pieces of 
legislation, as it did in the Queen v Feeney, sending them back 
here and telling us what we are to do.  That is not the way our 
criminal justice system should operate in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges are, contrary to the will of parliament, using 
conditional sentences in cases that involve violence and sexual 
abuse.  That was not the intent. 
Surely there is not one member on the government side who would 
stand here and say that was the intent of the legislation. It has 
to be corrected and it has to be done quickly.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly we have seen a lack of speed and a lack of response time 
on the part of the government when it comes to dealing with 
criminal justice issues.  Are there any more fundamental issues 
that need to be dealt with quickly and need to be dealt with in a 
non-partisan way, I might add? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is something that the government is serious about, if it 
is something that it really intends to do, here is an 
opportunity.  This is a golden opportunity for it to stand and 
say:  “We support this initiative.  This is something that 
Canadians would want”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, again I would emphasize, is the litmus test.  Does it 
offend Canadians' sensibilities?  Do Canadians look at this piece 
of legislation, conditional sentencing, and say:  “Yes, that is 
something that we embrace if is to protect our communities, if it 
is to help people to deal with issues of violence?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely that is not the case.  We need only to pick up an 
editorial article in any newspaper and it will say that Canadians 
are losing confidence in our justice system day after day.  I ask 
rhetorically if the government is ready to support this member's 
motion.  Is the government ready to act and make a difference by 
embracing and moving on this motion?  Unfortunately I am afraid 
that will not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one should be getting a free ride in our justice system.  I 
think that goes almost without saying, but precisely that is what 
can happen when a conditional sentence is applied.  As I said 
earlier, it is a halfway measure.  It is almost a way out for 
some judges in instances where they cannot quite come to grips 
with a certain set of circumstances, where they want to give the 
person another chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That decision can be made by our correctional services.  They 
are charged with that responsibility now.  Let the judges do 
their job but do not give this halfway measure, this out that 
judges are permitted to use on conditional sentences when they 
pertain to violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not saying to do away with conditional sentences 
altogether.  That is not the intent of the hon. member's motion. 
It is to specify when it is appropriate to use them.  That is the 
key issue here.  It is not that the law itself is entirely bad, 
but it is the application with which I and other members on the 
opposition side take issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not recite horror cases to emphasize the need to bring 
the legislation about, but we are certainly aware, all too aware, 
of cases where conditional sentencing has been applied improperly 
and resulted in individuals not being sentenced properly, further 
undermining the confidence of the general public and certainly 
undermining the confidence and perhaps having a more direct and 
life shattering effect on victims who have been victimized by 
offenders and then go through the trauma of seeing the 
individuals who put them in that position walk out the courtroom 
doors.  I have seen it happen myself and it is not a happy day 
when that occurs.  Conditional sentencing is one small but very 
important example of what is currently wrong with our justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the government has an opportunity.  We have heard 
a lot of talk, a great deal of talk in the Chamber.  What we 
really need and what Canadians want to restore their faith in the 
justice system is action, legislative action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has failed to act on what it should be doing in 
condemning this type of use of conditional sentencing.  It has 
talked a great deal about strengthening the Young Offenders Act, 
cumulative versus consecutive sentencing, the faint hope clause 
and victims rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these issues have been given a great deal of air time, but 
we are yet to see the concrete legislation the government could 
and should be bringing in.  That is what we are here to do in the 
Chamber.  We are here to make laws.  We are here to make changes 
when they need to occur.  I believe the motion that has been 
brought forward is a step in the right direction, and that is why 
we support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have had the pleasure of speaking to preventing the use of 
conditional sentencing for violent criminals and drug traffickers 
earlier today on our supply day motion.  My comments in that 
speech are just as applicable here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated earlier, the former minister of justice erred when 
he refused to limit the scope of conditional sentencing.  Through 
Bill C-41 it is available to even violent offenders and drug 
traffickers. 
At first the former Minister of Justice said the courts would of 
course restrict the application to non-violent offenders and they 
did not.  Then he attempted to tinker with the wording through 
Bill C-17 and that still has not worked.  He and the government 
for political reasons refuse to admit their error and correct it. 
In the meantime those Canadians affected are holding our justice 
system in disrepute.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To support these criticisms I will first of all refer to the 
Alberta Court of Appeal case of Steven James Waldner.  Mr. 
Justice Berger made it very clear that conditional sentencing was 
open to violent offenders and drug traffickers when he said at 
page 6 of the decision “Parliament has made the legislative 
choice to exclude only those offences punishable by a minimum 
term of imprisonment from the regime of conditional sentencing”. 
At page 7 he said “Unless parliament has barred what would 
otherwise be an option, the starting point must be that all 
options are open”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will provide a case of drug trafficking and conditional 
sentencing.  The Court of Appeal for British Columbia decided 
that Trung Viet Bui's conditional sentence was appropriate.  Mr. 
Bui and his brother-in-law were in the drug trafficking business 
and undercover agents caught Mr. Bui.  He sold approximately 
$3,000 worth of cocaine in the first transaction and about 
$35,000 worth of cocaine in a second transaction, not exactly a 
nickel and dime operation.  Obviously these individuals were well 
connected to be dealing at this level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know of the damage done to our society by the sale of 
drugs.  Younger members of our communities are particularly 
susceptible to addiction and to criminal actions to support their 
habits.  The court of appeal decided that since Mr. Bui had 
served a year of his conditional sentence without difficulty, he 
should continue.  Little discussion occurred regarding deterrence 
of denunciation over high level drug trafficking and what it does 
to our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now move on to some sexual assault cases.  The Court of 
Appeal for British Columbia in the Ronald Neil Scott case dealt 
with the issue of conditional sentencing.  Mr. Scott was 
convicted of sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching in 
relation to incidents with his step-granddaughter from when she 
was five or six years old until she was 10.  His actions came to 
light when the victim told a school friend that Mr. Scott would 
offer money for touching his privates.  He was sentenced to nine 
months imprisonment and placed on probation for two years. He was 
sentenced prior to conditional sentencing coming into effect but 
his appeal occurred subsequently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court decided that conditional sentencing was a lesser 
punishment available to the accused and he should be considered 
for its application.  It also stated that parliament had formed 
the intention to provide for and encourage the imposition of 
conditional sentences and wherever appropriate the courts must 
carry out that intention. The court decided that the offender was 
not a danger to the community because he had only done these acts 
with his step-granddaughter.  He obtained conditional sentencing 
even though it was not available at the time of his offence or at 
the time of his sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of British Columbia in the case of Regina v 
M.M. also took advantage of conditional sentencing.  The accused 
was convicted of three counts of gross indecency with the three 
children of his girlfriend.  He commenced his sexual activities 
with one victim when she was nine years old and with the other 
when she was 10.  He was often left alone to babysit the three 
girls.  The abuse continued over a period of nine years and 
involved countless acts of gross indecency.  Evidence was 
presented that he often had sex with their mother in front of the 
three girls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In deciding whether to accept conditional sentencing as a 
possibility, the court viewed the purpose of the reform to reduce 
the number of persons sentenced to prison.  The court viewed a 
conditional sentence as still a jail sentence but one that is 
served in the community.  The court decided that no sentence 
could right the wrong done to the three girls.  The court agreed 
that sexual assault was a crime of inherent violence but 
recognized that parliament had decreed a scheme of conditional 
sentencing.  A conditional sentence was applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now provide another case which goes to show how we permit 
and maybe even encourage criminals to move up the scale into more 
serious crime.  The Court of Appeal in British Columbia in the 
case of John Paxton McEwen had to consider conditional 
sentencing.  In 1997 at age 24 he attacked a 78-year old woman 
who was out walking near her home at 10 o'clock in the morning. 
When he stole her purse from around her arm she suffered a broken 
and dislocated arm.  Surgery was likely required and she suffered 
serious psychological injuries.  The experience had a very 
serious effect upon her life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His previous record indicated that he had had a large number of 
second opportunities. In 1992 he was convicted of mischief and 
given a suspended sentence and probation for eight months.  Also 
in 1992 he was convicted of impaired driving and fined.  In 1994 
he was convicted of driving while disqualified and fined.  Also 
in 1994 he was convicted of assault, sentence was suspended and 
he was placed on probation for a year. 
In 1996 he was convicted of theft and he was fined.  He was also 
convicted at that time of failing to appear and he was fined.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trial judge gave McEwen a conditional sentence for one year 
for his attack on this elderly woman.  He was also ordered to 
take drug and alcohol counselling and to stay away from the 
victim. The court of appeal decided that the trial judge's 
decision did not go far enough.  It ordered the remaining portion 
of his one year conditional sentence to be served in custody but 
subject to any parole as if he had been incarcerated for the 
entire period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at his continuing record and the growing 
seriousness of his offences we can see that he is not getting the 
message.  The conditional sentence will certainly do little to 
convince him of the error of his ways.  More individuals will 
likely be victimized in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to question just what messages are being sent to victims 
in communities by these conditional sentences.  These cases show 
that you can traffic in cocaine at highly profitable levels and 
if caught, serve your sentence at home.  You can sexually assault 
children in your care and serve a little time at home.  You can 
even attack senior citizens while they walk in the community and 
be sent home for your efforts, even if you happen to hurt them 
badly or possess an extensive record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is just not good enough. The justice committee must be 
encouraged to fill the void which the Minister of Justice has 
refused to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reducing the number of prisoners serving time in our 
institutions is one thing.  Failing to deter or denounce violent 
crimes is something else entirely.  The former justice minister 
brought in conditional sentencing to reduce the pressures on our 
institutions.  Obviously little thought or consideration was 
given as to how the best interests of offenders and the 
corrections system would impact negatively on the interests of 
victims and society at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of conditional sentencing is not at issue here. What 
is at issue is who should qualify to benefit from it.  Violent 
and multiple repeat offenders as well as major drug traffickers 
should be excluded.  I urge the government to fix this problem 
immediately. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, with my eye on the clock I thought it would be useful 
and at least it would make me feel a little better if I spoke to 
some of the issues raised in this motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has properly focused on a relatively new section 
of the Criminal Code that deals with sentencing, specifically 
conditional sentencing. This sentencing mechanism was introduced 
into Canadian law quite recently.  I recall being in the House 
when it was introduced.  I recall sitting on the committee when 
it was reviewed. The member and others who have spoken are quite 
correct when they suggest that the parameters or restrictions or 
the guidelines for its use were on the light side as opposed to 
the complex side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall at the time, and I certainly was not alone as a member 
of parliament in looking at this, that we found it quite 
difficult to attempt to draw a line as to when conditional 
sentencing might be used and when it should not be used.  Every 
time we bundled up and grouped certain types of offences 
generically there were always one or two situations or scenarios 
where one might suggest that conditional sentencing would be 
appropriate. There is always an exception to the rule in other 
words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We felt that the judicial community, the judges of this country, 
would be well up to the task in deciding when to use these rules. 
It turns out that in 99% of the cases they were.  There are 
certainly cases now where it appears that judges need guidance 
from the appeal courts. If the appeal courts find that the 
problem is more widespread, if the judicial community is not able 
to handle it and draw the line themselves as we had hoped they 
would, then it is an area for statutory amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's motion certainly points down that road and may in 
fact lead in that direction. I sense the possibility for change. 
I commend the member for his motion.  I look forward to seeing 
what the House will do in this area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, once again I must say it is a sad day in this House of 
Commons that this government has shown itself to be completely 
unresponsive to the general public about this issue, unresponsive 
to the victims of crime and unresponsive to the cries of those 
victims for real justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the parliamentary secretary sitting across the way shaking 
her head.  I heard her say in response to some of the examples my 
hon. colleague from Surrey North cited that it is fearmongering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  She says it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like her to come to my riding and other ridings in the 
country and say to the victims that it is fearmongering when 
criminals who have brutally raped them walk out of court and do 
not face any time in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  How many? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  How many?  Why did she not tell us how 
many?  She commented during her remarks that there have been more 
than 18,000 times since September 3, 1996 that conditional 
sentencing has been used by our courts.  But she did not say how 
many times it was used in cases of rape, how many times in cases 
of drug trafficking.  How many times?  How many of the 18,000 
were for rape?  How many were for violent offences?  How many 
were for drug trafficking?  Because if it is one, then it is one 
damn well too many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this government to say it will leave it up to the courts, 
leave it to the judges to decide or it will appeal, there can be 
no doubt that the Liberal Party of Canada and the government is 
made up mostly of lawyers.  They want to perpetuate this type of 
nonsense. They want to keep the courts busy.  They just want to 
keep appealing it instead of correcting the problem. Even if 
there is one person who does not serve time in jail, and I am not 
talking about four star hotels where they can flex their muscles 
and exercise, I am talking about putting them to work, I am 
talking about real justice and punishment that will deter these 
people from doing it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary in her comments said, and I wrote 
this down maybe not word for word but something close, that the 
government is willing to work with the provinces to monitor and 
see whether further changes are needed.  To monitor.  That is 
about all bloody well good this government is for, to monitor. It 
certainly is not intent on making any meaningful justice changes, 
any meaningful justice reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see I am about out of time.  That is unfortunate.  The member 
for Scarborough—Rouge River says that they wanted to rely on the 
judges when they passed Bill C-41 to draw the line because there 
is always an exception to the rule.  That is what he said. Yes 
there are always exceptions to the rule. I can say that less than 
two months after these conditional sentencing provisions came 
into effect in September 1996 I raised the issue of how it was 
being inappropriately used in cases of rape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a young mother whose ex common law spouse broke into 
her home and raped her on the kitchen floor.  He was found guilty 
and convicted but the judge did not give him any time in jail. 
One of the conditions he imposed upon this criminal was that he 
felt it would be better for the mother and the children if this 
individual continued to pay his child support.  That was one of 
the conditions.  That is what conditional sentencing does.  It 
imposes these harsh conditions on rapists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the hon. House leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party and my hon. colleague from Surrey North for 
their participation in the debate. I want to say to everyone 
watching this debate at home tonight that I and the victims of 
these crimes are absolutely appalled at the parliamentary 
secretary's callous disregard for meaningful justice reform.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am here 
tonight to speak on the hepatitis C compensation package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position the government has taken on this package to 
compensate hepatitis C victims is untenable.  It is untenable 
simply because it leaves too many innocent victims out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The compensation package as supported by Ottawa, by the federal 
government, compensates only those victims between 1986 and 1990. 
That is wrong.  I am glad and I am sure all members of the House 
are to see that these victims are being compensated.  The tragedy 
in that package is that the victims prior to 1986 are not being 
compensated, nor are the innocent victims after 1990. What I am 
telling the House is that position is untenable and the Canadian 
people are making that known from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a pretty generous country.  We are ranked number one 
in the world by the United Nations.  There is no way the Canadian 
people are going to allow a package that screens out, that 
discriminates between innocent victims. They want all victims 
compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister presented a new twist to the compensation 
package the other day.  I am reading directly from the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I>, today's edition, the Prime Minister talking about 
the compensation package.  He is linking drug abusers and AIDS 
victims into the package.  The Prime Minister stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about those who have used needles, who are those who have a 
problem with...transmitted by sex, and after that, the others? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister does not get the message.  We are talking 
about innocent victims who received tainted blood through our 
health system.  There is something wrong when that happens.  I 
think all of us agree on that.  When the Prime Minister clouds 
the issue there is something wrong with his thinking.  What we 
are talking about is compensation for innocent victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need some movement on this file by the health minister.  I 
have been asking him since the Krever report was released back in 
November 1997 to act unilaterally, to act alone, as a federal 
government should, on this issue. At the end of the day we have 
only one federal health minister and he and no one else is 
responsible.  He is solely responsible for the safety of Canada's 
blood supply system.  It is as simple as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking for compensation for all the victims of hepatitis 
C outside that package already announced.  We want the victims 
prior to 1986 covered and we want all victims after 1990 covered.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime

the full support and confidence of the government. 
His unwavering commitment and hard work to obtain financial 
assistance for victims of hepatitis C as a result of blood 
therapy is known to all and bore fruit when provincial and 
territorial governments collectively announced with the federal 
government the financial assistance package for those victims 
during the period from 1986 to 1990, a period clearly identified 
by Mr. Justice Krever as a time when those responsible for 
Canada's blood system could have and should have acted to prevent 
this type of infection but did not.

is essential in sustaining the strength of the Canadian

that he was able to weave that consensus premised on the 
principle of governmental responsibility.  We all know the events 
of the past couple of weeks necessitated revisiting this initial 
consensus but that does not detract from its desirability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following that meeting a working group of officials was created 
to review a number of possible options to address remaining 
questions on the issue.  That they have agreed to this process 
indicates that all parties understand the importance of finding a 
pan-Canadian response.  Members of this House have a duty to 
facilitate directly and indirectly the attainment of that 
pan-Canadian consensus.  It serves the interests of all when we 
achieve it.  It serves the interests of none if we fail.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this government has created uncertainty, confusion and 
unnecessary anxiety for Canadians about their retirement 
security.  It announced changes to seniors programs that would be 
costly and disruptive for millions of citizens and then neglected 
to bring in legislation which left Canadians twisting in the wind 
when trying to figure out how to sensibly plan their retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Financial experts are uncertain as to what to advise their 
clients.  Middle income Canadians fear that the clawbacks and the 
taxes on their retirement savings will be so high that they will 
penalize their thrift.  Lower income Canadians do the numbers and 
have no doubt that RRSPs will merely be offset by a lower 
government pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget of 1996, over two years ago, this government 
announced proposed changes to old age security, the guaranteed 
income supplement as well as the elimination of the retirement 
income tax credit and the seniors tax credit based on age.  These 
proposed changes were called the seniors benefit.  Some benefit. 
Those planning for their sunset years quickly saw this proposal 
as ad hoc, flawed and illogical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Financial advisers and citizens have been seeking certainty so 
they can figure out how best to maximize their retirement 
dollars.  The official opposition and other parties have asked 
many questions in this House. They have been urging the Liberal 
government to end the suspense, decide on a policy and let us all 
know where we stand as Canadians.  Still from this government 
there are only trial balloons, empty rhetoric and more foot 
dragging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the government should say we screwed up, we are 
going to withdraw our proposal and come back later when we get 
our act together.  At least it could assure Canadians that their 
hard work and sacrifice to save for their own retirements will 
not simply be eaten up by another Liberal tax grab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister tell Canadians when the government will 
introduce legislation to let people know where they stand with 
respect to seniors programs, and what it intends to do to ensure 
fairness to Canadians who have scrimped and saved for years for 
their retirement and who now fear their thrift will be penalized 
by cuts to benefits promised to them by their government?  I look 
forward to the answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
March 20 the story broke in the Calgary <I>Herald</I> about the 
government's responsibility for radiation death and sickness in 
the Dene community of Deline.  Sixty-eight days later and the 
community still waits for written confirmation of a meeting with 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 30, I called on the ministers of health, Indian affairs 
and natural resources to meet with the community to immediately 
address this crisis.  Fifty-six days later continuing silence. 
Speaking with the community representatives, as of noon today 
this meeting had not been arranged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A gentleman diagnosed with bone and lung cancer last week has 
just died.  The community has already laid out its plan.  This 
government should immediately respond with actions, not words, to 
the plan for essential response and necessary redress outlined by 
Chief Raymond Tutcho of the Dene First Nation. This plan calls 
for immediate crisis assistance, comprehensive environment and 
social assistance, full public disclosure, clean-up and 
monitoring, acknowledgement of government responsibility, 
community healing and cultural regeneration. Immediate crisis 
assistance, yet 68 days of government silence on this request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1939 what has this community received from the government? 
Nothing.  Yet a federal crown company profited from this 
obscenity while it served to fuel the atomic arms race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Dene had a community meeting arranged on this issue for 
tomorrow and Thursday.  That meeting was cancelled and replaced 
by a funeral for the community member who died of bone and lung 
cancer.  The minister knows bone cancer is linked to exposure to 
radioactive dust and particles.  What is even more sickening is 
the government has known about this since the early 1930s, over 
65 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sahtugot'ine, the Bear Lake people, made this clear in a 
statement showing a government official in 1932 claimed: “The 
ingestion of radioactive dust will cause a build-up of 
radioactive material in the body.  Lung cancer, bone necrosis, 
and rapid anaemia are possible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the community buries its dead the government tries to bury 
the tragedy.  How can this government state it must examine more 
history?  Why are the ministers of health, Indian affairs and 
natural resources not there right now dealing with this 
catastrophe?  There are literally millions of tonnes of this 
poison buried in the region.  It is in the water and the food 
chain.  Is this government through its inaction willing to 
consciously condemn yet another generation of children, women and 
men to radiation death?  While whites were told to shower, the 
Dene children played with radioactive dust.  This community is 
now losing its elders to this tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stated in her interview with CBC on May 17 that she 
is under the impression that the clean-up at Sawmill Bay employed 
current radiation standards and implementation measures.  This 
suggests the minister is disregarding out of hand the testimony 
of the Dene record and the oral history of the clean-up crew. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister consider the provision of federal dollars for 
radioactive clean-ups, where even dust masks are not provided, as 
meeting radiation standards?  The minister responded to my 
questions with comments like “it behooves us to understand the 
circumstances and we will act to include the Dene people in our 
review”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government may be content looking at the history, the 
death and illness toll from this obscenity continues to mount. 
Where is the Minister of Health while people are dying? Immediate 
crisis assistance?  Will this government commit right now that 
all three ministers will meet this community and lay out an 
action plan before this House recesses for the summer, yes or no?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the 
hon. member for Halifax West regarding the Deline community 
concerns about past mining activities involving the Port Radium 
uranium mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is taking this matter extremely seriously and is 
seeking to gain a better understanding of the activities 
associated with the mining and the transport of the uranium ore.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has 
been assigned the lead role in co-ordinating federal government 
activities.  Key to these activities will be the active 
participation of Natural Resources Canada and Health Canada.  A 
collaborative approach with the Government of the Northwest 
Territories health and social services department has been 
established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal ministers are committed to meeting with the Deline 
community members in the near future to determine an appropriate 
course of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past year the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development has been working in collaboration with the community 
to address a number of environmental issues of interest to them. 
Drawing upon this existing good working relationship, a strategy 
for meeting the information, research and communication needs 
related to the radiation concerns in the community is being 
developed with the Deline uranium committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact we are already working with the Deline uranium committee 
to answer questions about present day levels of radiation. 
Current conditions will be assessed through a research proposal 
developed earlier this year by the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope to build on this spirit of co-operation as we work to 
address concerns about the historic operation of the Port Radium 
mine and the transportation of ore from the mine.  The next steps 
will be determined as our collaborative work with the community 
progresses.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, more and more Canadians are asking why the Liberal 
government will not agree to all party meetings on the proposed 
bank mergers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 7 I pointed to recent U.S. evidence on the behaviour of 
big American banks toward small business, evidence that was being 
presented to a bipartisan congressional committee in the U.S. 
House of Representatives studying their proposed bank mergers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence showed in the U.S. four things:  big banks make 
fewer loans to small business, big banks lend more money to 
bigger business, the bigger the bank the smaller their small 
business loan portfolio, and big bank service charges are at 
least 15% higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover a <I>Wall Street Journal</I> analysis found that small 
business lending declined in the U.S. banks which merged but went 
up in their non-merged competitors over the same period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to know why American legislators can study 
proposed bank mergers in their country while the Liberals reject 
all party hearings on the proposed bank mergers in Canada.  Why 
can the U.S., the birthplace of modern capitalism, strike an all 
party inquiry into bank mergers and their impact on Americans but 
the Liberal government turns a blind eye?  Is it because the 
Liberals are protecting their friends, or is it because they 
support the mergers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I proposed that the industry committee hold hearings on 
the impact of the bank mergers on small business, consumers and 
rural Canada.  The Liberal majority on that committee voted it 
down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what the Liberals want to do instead.  They have 
appointed a Liberal dominated task force, the so-called MacKay 
task force, but this task force is not mandated to look into bank 
merger proposals or lost jobs or service charges for consumers, 
business and farmers.  Three of its members have already had to 
resign because of a conflict of interest.  They were employees of 
the banks that want to merge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has set up a committee of Liberal backbenchers to 
study the bank mergers as well.  They get to stand up and say 
they care while they play both sides against the middle.  There 
is only one problem.  The hepatitis C vote showed us all how much 
Liberal backbenchers and their points of view count for in the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day they can produce their report but it will 
not matter a bit to the Prime Minister or the finance minister 
because they will make whatever decision they will make 
regardless of what the Liberal backbenchers recommend.  The 
backbenchers will be told to fall into line and history shows 
they will to the last MP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government not want all party hearings now?  Would 
not the recommendations of an all party committee have much more 
credibility than what we would get from Liberals alone?  Are the 
Liberals buying time for the bankers association's million dollar 
PR campaign to soften people up and allow the banks to persuade 
Canadians that bank mergers are inevitable anyway?  The CBA is 
spending millions of dollars on TV ads and the individual banks 
are spending millions on lobbyists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, the Liberals want to wait until the fall, wait until they 
get their marching orders from the blue ribbon panel, throw a 
bone or two to their backbenchers, and only then will they allow 
the finance committee of the House of Commons to conduct a study 
which will be the equivalent of closing the barn door after the 
horses have left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will benefit from the bank mergers and who will suffer? Bank 
CEO's stock options whose value goes up every time the market 
goes up on the excitement of all this merger mania will benefit 
to the tune of millions of dollars.  The figure I would like to 
see is the comparison between the total increased value of these 
stock options and the payroll savings the banks will be making 
after they downsize their merged workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many jobs will be lost and where will these jobs be lost? 
Small business is very worried about the future of banking 
sector.  Small business representatives have a lot of questions 
about the mergers themselves as do farmers and other consumers in 
other parts of Canada including rural Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of questions we believe an all party 
committee could effectively study now.  That is why we are 
calling upon the Liberal government to strike an all party 
committee to review the bank mergers immediately. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, despite the rhetoric from the 
NDP the government remains concerned about the growth and support 
of small businesses in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small businesses are the backbone of economic growth and job 
creation.  That is why the government has worked hard over the 
past few years to improve the environment for small businesses, 
including the issue of access to credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have worked with the banks to improve the reporting of small 
business lending activity.  As a result statistics are now 
available publicly on bank lending to small and medium size 
enterprises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerns have been expressed that the proposed mergers in the 
banking sector may result in reduced access by small businesses 
to bank credit.  The government is indeed concerned about the 
potential effects on the Canadian consumer including small 
businesses of allowing bank mergers.  The proposed mergers have 
the potential to fundamentally change our domestic banking 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work of the task force and the future of the Canadian 
financial services sector will be valuable in the government's 
deliberations of the merger issue and I look forward to its 
report in September. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will not allow any merger in the banking sector 
to proceed without understanding its impact on the small business 
community in Canada and without the input of Canadians during the 
consultation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the hon. member to join the Standing Committee on 
Finance when we hear from Canadians on this issue as we go across 
Canada.  The last time I checked the Standing Committee on 
Finance was an all party committee.  I believe a member of the 
NDP sits on that committee.  I invite the hon. member to 
participate.

House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
