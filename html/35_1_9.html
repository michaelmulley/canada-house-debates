	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
our party has indeed granted consent, and I would like to point 
out that we may have created a precedent in holding the vote in 
the evening of Tuesday. I hope that we will have an opportunity 
to discuss, within the framework of parliamentary reform, the 
issue of concentrating votes on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and 
Thursdays so as to allow hon. members of this House the 
opportunity to work in their respective ridings on Mondays and

	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me this morning to present a petition signed by 
residents of my riding of Leeds-Grenville; residents from 
places such as North Augusta, Addison, and Spencerville.
<P>
	The petitioners are expressing their abhorrence at the crimes 
of violence which, as we all know, are on the increase in Canada. 
These petitioners are asking for amendments to be made to our 
laws to prohibit the importation and the distribution and sale of 
what is known as killer cards.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to have the manufacturers of these 
killer cards informed that they will be stopped at the border and 
destroyed. The manufacturers should be so informed before they 
try to export these things into Canada.

one petition to present this morning. The petitioners point out 
that single income families with special needs children should 
be eligible to claim child care expenses on their income tax. 
They feel these families are discriminated against for their 
decision to remain at home with their children.
<P>
	They point out that there is often a significant cost incurred by 
families advised by physicians to place their children in day care 
centres catering to special needs children and these costs remain 
the same whether the family has a single or double income.
<P>
	The petitioners believe this policy is unfair and 
discriminatory. They ask that it be reviewed and if possible that 
something be done in the forthcoming budget.

	The House resumed from January 24 consideration of the 
motion for an address to His Excellency the Governor General in 
reply to his Speech at the opening of the session.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Throne Speech contains a paragraph that is devoted 
to culture, heritage and the Canadian identity. The paragraph 
states that the Government will announce measures to promote 
these essential national values.
<P>
	One might wonder how such a short paragraph can respond to 
the challenges facing a department that is as wide-ranging as the 
one I am honoured to head. So a few words of explanation seem 
to be appropriate at the beginning of this parliamentary session.
<P>
	Straight away, the very name of the Department of Canadian 
Heritage poses a problem. What do we mean by ``Canadian 
heritage''? How can we justify grouping together in a single 
department elements as diverse as communications, the status 
of women, cultural industries, official and heritage languages, 
multiculturalism, national parks and sites, State protocol and 
amateur sport?
<P>
	If we take the term ``heritage'' in its widest sense as meaning 
all of the combined property that enables each of us to see 
ourselves as an individual who belongs to a group or country, we 
can see that the department's name is fitting.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Today we can no longer restrict the meaning of heritage to the 
legacy of the past. Far more than a simple collection of traces 
left by history, the country's heritage is first and foremost the 
manifestation of the connection among members of a 
community and of its distinctiveness inside the global 
environment. Thus it is closely associated with the question of a 
country's identity.
<P>
	In this perspective the seemingly vast range of activities 
supervised by the Department of Canadian Heritage is justified.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I can see three broad structures that will lead us to the same 
goal. First, the management of our natural and physical 
heritage: our national parks, our historic monuments, and our 
heritage canals.
<P>
	Second, the management of programs that protect official 
languages, that promote the status of women and amateur sport, 
and that enhance our society's culture in other ways.
<P>
	Third, the management of cultural development in Canada, 
and of means of communication which are of the utmost 
importance, not only in ensuring that we remain independent, 
but also as potent tools for economic development.
<P>
	I would like to describe each of these three structures in 
greater detail. Our heritage appears at first glance to be a 
collection of historic sites, composed of 36 national parks, 750 
historic sites and nine canals, located in all parts of the country. 
This sector is of enormous economic importance as it generates 
annual revenues of more than a billion dollars and provides jobs 
for around 30,000 people.
<P>
	This sector lies at the very heart of our tourism industry and it 
is the envy of the international community, as we are at the 
forefront of what is known as ``eco-tourism''. One single 
statistic illustrates the popularity of these sites among tourists: 
in 1992, some 27 million people visited Canada's national parks 
and sites.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	They are, of course, associated in our collective psyche with 
the beauty of our country. But they are also benefitting from the 
growing emphasis that western societies are placing on 
environmental quality. I feel, therefore, that they must follow 
the principles set out in the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Choices will have to be made and all parties, including the 
federal, provincial, municipal and territorial governments, will 
have to work together to make these choices. For instance, we 
want to make progress toward our goal of establishing land and 
marine base parks in all our distinct ecological zones. We also 
want to increase the number of historic sites which must serve as 
witness to all facets of our history.
<P>
	In this respect I will encourage the unveiling of new areas of 
our collective history such as those related to women and native 
people, but we are facing as well severe financial constraints.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Some degree of self-financing might well open up some 
interesting avenues, but we must avoid the indirect 
consequences of over-commercialization. My role in this will 
be to safeguard the ecological and commemorative integrity of 
this important component of our heritage, as well as to make 
judicious decisions about its development.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="453"> 453 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I wish to share a few thoughts regarding the benefits that lie 
with a diverse society such as ours.
<P>
	The history of our country is closely linked with successive 
waves of immigrants and the interaction between newcomers 
and the existing society. How immigrants adapt to the Canadian 
way of life will always be a major factor in the development of 
the Canadian identity.
<P>
	The challenge is how to integrate diverse cultures with our 
existing cultures without melting them down into a single 
mould, thereby assimilating them out of existence. We must 
promote the development of a wholly Canadian identity as a 
rallying point for diverse cultures in support of a blueprint for a 
society based on consensus and continuity with our history.
<P>
	Let us face the facts. The coexistence of cultures throughout 
the world is one of humanity's greatest challenges as this 
century draws to a close. Every day we hear people talk about 
racism or ostracism, both of which are exacerbated by hard 
times. This is a global phenomenon from which Canada is not 
exempt. We must consider the dangers inherent in self-centred 
attitudes. We must keep in mind the benefit Canada can derive 
from the diverse cultural makeup of our society.
<P>
	In a world increasingly focused on economic and cultural 
globalism, our diversity could be to our great advantage as we 
strive to maintain our place in the community of nations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have to respond to this wave of intolerance that has swept 
western countries with better information about the advantages 
of cultural diversity. Perhaps we should begin with the very 
young and, together with the provincial governments, as they 
have jurisdiction over education, explore new ways of 
responding to the irrational violence that a fear of someone from 
a different culture may engender.
<P>
	A foundation on race relations will be established precisely in 
order to throw new light on productive exchanges between the 
numerous ethnic groups that make up our population, the old 
and the new, and to unite the forces of multiculturalism around a 
cultural identity that is specifically Canadian. It might also be 
worthwhile to make more effective use of gatherings like the 
Canada Games and transform them into an authentic illustration 
of Canadian diversity by incorporating a cultural component.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	I take this opportunity to remind the House that athletes from 
coast to coast are getting ready for the Lillehammer Winter 
Olympic Games. We all know how exciting it must be for them 
to represent their country at such an outstanding event. I am sure 
the House will join me in wishing them all the success in the 
world.
<P>
	I might add that, in my opinion, the preservation and the 
promotion of our official languages does not turn Canada into a 
tower of Babel. Let us keep the individual freedom to use the 
language of our choice, but recognize that the English and the 
French languages give us access to two of the greatest sources of 
world culture. They are part of our national heritage that the 
government must maintain and develop.
<P>
	Allow me finally to express a few thoughts on cultural policy. 
Culture is neither an abstraction nor a decoration. It is above all 
a viewpoint on the world and a manifestation of our civilization. 
There can be no identity without culture and this is recognized in 
the Liberal Party's plan of action: ``Culture is at the very core of 
our national identity. It is the basis of our sovereignty and the 
pride of our nation''.
<P>
	In an era of trade globalization and fantastic breakthroughs in 
information technology, our cultural resources have become 
powerful tools of economic development. In 1992, the cultural 
sector contributed about 22 billion dollars to the gross domestic 
product. It employed nearly half a million people, which 
represents an employment growth rate of about 21 per cent 
between 1987 and 1992.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As impressive as it may be such growth must not mask the 
problems facing our cultural industries. These industries do not 
have access to the capital and market they need to compete on 
their home turf with the major producers of mass culture, mostly 
our neighbour to the south, the United States. This is why I think 
it is of paramount importance for Canada to maintain its 
freedom of action under the international agreements linking us 
with the United States, Mexico and our GATT partners. We 
achieved success in this respect and we can now bring new 
policies to the forefront.
<P>
	In the past we have set policies in place to stimulate 
production, strike a better balance with foreign products and 
pave the way for greater creative expression from our artists. We 
made great progress. Nevertheless I do not think our traditional 
policies alone will be enough to surmount the challenges 
presented by the globalization of cultures, by financial 
constraints and by the revolution of the communications field. 
We will still be called upon to adapt our policies and to be 
innovative.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our new policies will always seek to stimulate the production, 
the marketing and the distribution of our cultural products at 
home and abroad. We are preparing legislation which should 
allow our authors, producers and performers to earn a decent 
living.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="454"> 454 </A></B>
<P>
	I hope to update the Copyright Act so as to take into account 
new technologies that have changed the way cultural products 
are distributed and to recognize the rights of creators. We must 
also diversify the funding sources of our cultural industries. We 
absolutely need a better marketing plan for our cultural 
production at the international level.
<P>
	In addition to being composed of two linguistic groups, the 
Canadian market is too small to ensure that our producers and 
creators survive and thrive. A global cultural market is coming 
into existence and Canada must promote in that market its 
unique production whose international reputation is well 
established.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	I wish to remind the House that the department of heritage 
also has the mandate to ensure Canadian participation in 
international exhibitions. I was thrilled to learn that the last 
Canadian manifestation of this kind, which took place last year 
in Taejon, South Korea, has proven to be most profitable 
because for the first time Canada relied on the economic 
partnership.
<P>
	Furthermore, the evolution of our society prompts us to 
review the operation and the mandate of our great cultural 
institutions. Among them, broadcasting is without doubt the 
most popular and most powerful cultural tool. More than 99 per 
cent of Canadians own a radio, 99 per cent a television set and 
more than 75 per cent a VCR. That shows the immense power 
which these media have at their disposal.
<P>
	In this perspective, it is important that the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation find its proper place as a public 
broadcaster and that a funding mechanism better suited to the 
present situation be put in place.
<P>
	The government will announce shortly the appointment of the 
new president of the CBC.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government's commitment to Canadian strategy for an 
information superhighway is a good sign for our cultural 
industries. The information superhighway will be more than a 
technological infrastructure. It will be a powerful vehicle for 
Canadian content. It will enable us to distribute our cultural 
products more effectively and make them accessible to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	This initiative will naturally be in keeping with our Canadian 
cultural policy. I will soon begin working on this project with 
my colleague, the Minister of Industry.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Just as important for our creative industry is the Canada 
Council. Cultural products are not just consumable and 
exportable goods. They are, first and foremost, the works of 
artists, creative men and women without whom the cultural 
industry could not survive.
<P>
	The Canada Council's function is to support those artists 
when they start on a project or do experimental work. It also 
provides a fund that offers financial stability to the performing 
arts, theatre, ballet and orchestras. It is therefore vital that we 
ensure maximum efficiency on the part of this institution which 
is essential to the promotion of the creative spirit in Canada.
<P>
	Given the shift toward globalism which marks the end of this 
millennium, we must rely more than ever on our creative men 
and women to provide us with a feeling of identity and a sense of 
belonging.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is clear that the mandate of the Department of Heritage is a 
challenging one lying at the very heart of the major issues facing 
our country today.
<P>
	Now more than ever Canada's cultural complexity must be 
seen not as a problem but as an asset at a time when opening up 
to the rest of the world is just as important as preserving our own 
identity.
<P>
	Whether it is our historic sites, our national parks, the 
achievements of our athletes, the influence of our artists, the 
diversity of our population or the success of our cultural 
industries and institutions, all these things highlight our 
willingness to excel as a people.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I intend to bank on this huge wealth and particularly on the 
younger generation to ensure our country holds an enviable 
position at the dawn of the third millennium.
<P>
	It is no doubt clear by now that the Department of Canadian 
Heritage, far from being obsessed with the past, is instead 
looking toward the future. It is resolutely concerned with the 
important challenges which face the societies of today.
<P>
	I have faith in Canadian men and women, and I call upon them 
to take up these challenges and help our country to advance in 
the world of tomorrow.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I must 
congratulate the member and minister on his election in 
Laval-Ouest. This time he was luckier than in 1988, when he 
was my opponent in Longueuil. I am pleased to ask him some 
questions in accordance with his responsibilities as Minister of 
Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	First, as he spoke about multiculturalism, it would seem that 
multiculturalism has not necessarily been a success, because we 
seem to have created ghettos between cultures instead of 
promoting the integration of citizens. We know that it takes 
about twice as long to integrate new arrivals in Canada as it does 
in the United States.
<P>
	There is definitely a major problem with multiculturalism. I 
know that in Montréal at the moment there are conflicts between 
different cultures and it is my impression, and also the opinion 
of some experts, that multiculturalism is something that has 
created ghettos instead of promoting integration.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="455"> 455 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, he also spoke about creators and copyright. I think 
that Canadian legislation may not protect creators' copyright 
adequately. If we want to make it possible for our creators to do 
more, we must First protect what they create. We must promote 
what they create; that is how we are going to improve 
productivity and create new products from both the cultural and 
economic points of view.
<P>
	My third question has to do with the national parks. We know 
that for a long time Quebec has been calling for equity where 
national parks are concerned. We do not have our fair share of 
parks, and each time Quebec asks for new parks, there always 
seem to be a lot of problems. However, we have great open 
spaces in which excellent parks could be created, but it never 
happens.
<P>
	What is the problem, and will the minister make the necessary 
efforts to ensure that we in Quebec can have our fair share of 
national parks?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dupuy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Longueuil for his congratulations. I am delighted that we can 
continue a dialogue.
<P>
	About multiculturalism, basically I agree with him. I feel that 
multiculturalism, the government's policy, must not create 
ghettos. It must not fragment our country. Basically, it must try 
to use its extremely rich and extremely valuable contributions to 
forge a grand Canadian culture. This Canadian culture will not 
be uniform. If we look at what is happening in the world, it is the 
countries that are managing to reconcile diversity whose 
progress is the most successful.
<P>
	About copyright, I also agree with the member for Longueuil. 
I feel that the existing legislation is a bit outdated. It has not kept 
up with changes in technology, and that is exactly why I 
announced this morning that we intend to amend our copyright 
legislation.
<P>
	Last, about the national parks. Quebec has remarkable natural 
and ecological areas and we want to develop national parks in 
Quebec. What may have slowed down the development of these 
parks is the fact that there is legislation in Quebec that does not 
allow the Government of Quebec to assign parcels of land to 
federal jurisdiction. That means that everything we do in 
Quebec, we do in co-operation with the Quebec government. As 
you know, when there are two governments that have to 
negotiate to get something done, things usually take a little 
longer.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	That, then, is the main reason why plans for parks in Quebec 
may not have advanced as quickly as the MP for Longueuil 
would like.
<P>
	However, I can tell him, for example, that there is a marine 
park we are developing at the mouth of the Saguenay that will be 
a model, not only of this co-operation between the two levels of 
government, but also of environmental protection.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the hon. minister on his speech.
<P>
	There are areas in Canada today that feel the government's 
policy on official bilingualism is expensive and unnecessary. In 
light of the comments of the hon. minister I would like to ask 
him whether he is aware of the real costs of the official 
bilingualism program. I would also like him to comment on 
whether another form of regional bilingualism would be more 
effective than universal bilingualism.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dupuy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am of course aware of the cost. 
There will be opportunities later in the course of the year to look 
at estimates, discuss the figures and give them a close look.
<P>
	I believe the Canadian model, if I may call it that, is a 
worthwhile model. In another career I lived in Belgium. I have 
seen there how the division, the linguistic border between two 
linguistic groups, has created many problems.
<P>
	My vision of bilingualism in Canada is not to force every 
Canadian to be bilingual. It is a matter of personal choice. Those 
who want to be able to use their language in Canada should be 
given a chance to do so.
<P>
	If we accept this as a principle, the issue which my friend is 
raising is really a matter of how you reconcile this with a decent 
control of expenditure. I shall be pleased to discuss this with 
him in the context of the estimates.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question for the minister is with regard to the definition of a 
multicultural Canada. It appears to me to be somewhat 
contradictory to state that immigrants under the present system 
are being integrated into Canadian society.
<P>
	My understanding of what integration means is that an 
immigrant embraces the Canadian way of life and Canadian 
culture, while having the freedom to preserve his own culture, 
but if he chooses to do so he should have to do at his own 
expense, on his own time without government assistance.
<P>
	Multiculturalism as it is now practised, emphasizes 
differences and tends to separate the different ethnic 
communities, while being funded by the federal government. I 
would like some clarification from the minister as to what he 
means by integration. There seems to be a problem with the 
definition. Multiculturalism and integration should mean two 
different things.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="456"> 456 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dupuy:</B> Mr. Speaker, we must of course be clear in our 
minds on the distinction between integration and assimilation. 
The comments I made earlier in my speech were very much 
addressed to assimilation.
<P>
	In my view integration means that you enable the people who 
are newly arrived to become fully operational in our society. 
This is what they want and this is what is probably best for the 
existing community because they become active and productive 
members of that society. If we do not want to achieve that result 
through assimilation, we have to find ways of enabling them to 
contribute to our society while at the same time preserving their 
inner values.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	This is not easily done. However, I think it is a public 
responsibility. We cannot leave every one of these people to 
fend for themselves.
<P>
	We have been able to see how the attitudes of other 
governments create difficulties and ghettos as we were talking 
about earlier. If we can see it that way, integration is a desirable 
goal. It needs some government support. I doubt that 
assimilation will be achievable in our society today. We enjoy 
too many personal liberties and freedom to be totally 
assimilated and moulded.
<P>
	There is a public responsibility. At the same time we are being 
humane toward people who want to retain some cultural values 
of their own.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, 
I would like to congratulate you on your appointment to the 
Chair and wish you every success in your new duties. The very 
fact that you were elected shows the admiration and esteem in 
which you are held by members of this House.
<P>
	I would not want to miss the opportunity, during this reply to 
the speech from the throne, to thank the men and women of 
Sherbrooke who, for a third time, placed their confidence in me 
under circumstances in which the outcome was rather uncertain. 
I was elected for the first time in 1984, carried by a Conservative 
wave. This time, I was re-elected on the undertow, with the wind 
blowing in the opposite direction.
<P>
	To new members of this House, I have to say, and my 
colleague from Beauséjour knows exactly what I mean, one has 
to go through both experiences to fully appreciate the privileges, 
the rights accorded to members of Parliament.
<P>
	To the people of Sherbrooke of whom I am so fond and for 
whom I work relentlessly, I say thank you.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am speaking also on behalf of a political party that occupied 
a different place in this House before October 25. Some 
members may have noticed our circumstances were quite 
different.
<P>
	I want to speak very frankly and honestly about that because it 
is important for us to recognize and acknowledge the magnitude 
of that defeat. On October 25 a lot of Canadians went to the polls 
with a very clear determination to put aside the government and 
a political party that had been there for the last nine years.
<P>
	I do not need to expand on the fact that they did it with a great 
deal of determination and with very little equivocation on 
October 25. That being the case it puts us now in a position is 
which even though we had 16 per cent of the vote, we have only 
two members in this House.
<P>
	I do not quarrel with that. Those were the rules before the 
campaign. We did not complain about them then and I am not 
going to complain about them now. It also means that we have 
found a level of freedom that we had not anticipated.
<P>
	I am the first to recognize that how we deal with that as a 
political force in this country and as the political force that 
founded Canada will determine our own future.
<P>
	It is now up to us as Progressive Conservatives throughout 
Canada to live up to the high expectations that Canadians have 
set for us in the past and into the future. It is up to us to rebuild 
our party and to present ourselves as a national-I want to stress 
national-alternative to the governing party by the time the next 
election campaign comes around.
<P>
	What I do know, having spoken to Canadians across this 
country, is that a lot of them, whether they are Progressive 
Conservatives or not, do feel it is very important that there be a 
national alternative to the governing party. They are concerned 
about the way Canadians view their country and that is 
something I feel very strongly about.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	It means that our party will continue to stand on the principles 
it has always lived by. One is fiscal conservatism. We are a party 
that will promote fiscal conservatism because we do want a 
country that is able to afford social programs and continues to 
have a strong social conscience and also a flexible view of 
federalism. We think it is critically important in this country. We 
proved in our last nine years that we were able to practise a 
method of governing in the area of federalism that responded to 
the different needs of the regions of this country.
<P>
	It was far from being perfect. I want to be clear on that. 
Anyone who would pretend that certainly would not meet with 
the approval of most Canadians, but there are  real accomplish-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="457"> 457 </A></B>
<P>
ments there and this new government will build upon many of 
them.
<P>
	As I looked at the speech from the throne, and in responding to 
it today, I have to admit I had mixed feelings, very much so. I 
was a bit surprised.
<P>
	I want to start by congratulating the members on the other side 
for their election and their success, in particular the Prime 
Minister. I do not share his views on a lot of issues, but beyond 
that I think a lot of Canadians have gained a certain admiration 
and respect for the fact that in difficult times he held tough. He 
made it through and won the confidence of Canadians. I want to 
congratulate him sincerely for that success. From a personal 
point of view I think that is quite an accomplishment.
<P>
	As I read the speech from the throne I had mixed feelings for 
the following reasons. There are a lot of things in it that were left 
over by our government and were taken up by this new 
government, things that quite frankly the Liberals were not very 
enthusiastic to support when they were on this side of the House.
<P>
	I went through the speech from the throne and had mixed 
feelings as I read the things the government was putting 
forward. In the seventh paragraph the speech reads: ``In order to 
achieve this agenda integrity and public trust in the institutions 
of governments are essential''. In the next paragraph the speech 
goes on to say: ``My ministers will insist upon integrity, honesty 
and openness on the part of those who exercise power on behalf 
of Canadians''.
<P>
	This House has not sat for very long and already this 
commitment has been put to a very strong test. We have heard 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has been using 
government flight services and it has met with some 
controversy. We find today that the Minister for International 
Trade is in some difficulty over a fund raiser and the way it was 
presented. We also know that another member of that caucus has 
run into some difficulty regarding things he had done in the past.
<P>
	I am not passing judgment on any of them, but is it not unusual 
that after only about 10 days I can stand in this place and recite 
three different areas in which the government has run into 
difficulty and with this in the seventh and eighth paragraphs of 
the speech from the throne?
<P>
	I am not passing judgment but let us be very clear. Is it not 
very different sitting on that side of the House dealing with these 
matters from what it was sitting on this side? I see members on 
the other side nodding, admitting that is the case. Well, it is.
<P>
	I hope that Canadians who are now going to look at this 
government will maybe see the previous government in a 
different light. I am not in any rush for that. I just know that the 
passing of time will deal with a lot of those issues.
<P>
	Let me rapidly go over the things proposed in the speech. The 
second page refers to lobbying. On August 9 the then Prime 
Minister, the Right Hon. Kim Campbell, made a speech and in it 
promised a lobbyist registration act. How could I disagree with 
any action in that area?
<P>
	The paragraph that follows talks about the credibility of 
Parliament and how we have to reform Parliament. In the same 
speech the same Prime Minister also made a commitment to 
parliamentary reform and the things we had to change. She gave 
a very detailed list of things we had to do. We have yet to see 
what the details of this government will be in this area, but I look 
forward to hearing what this government has to say, so I cannot 
disagree with that.
<P>
	The third measure was about reform of MPs' pensions. Would 
we not know that on August 9 the previous Prime Minister also 
made the same commitment? However, she went a little further 
and said that we would change the pension system not only 
double-dipping but also pensions being taken before the age of 
55. Therefore, we will wait to see what the new government 
proposes in this regard.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	On the same page of the speech from the throne there is some 
allusion to small business and the Canada investment fund. In a 
speech given on August 27 by the then Prime Minister there was 
also an announcement made of the venture capital fund.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A venture capital fund was announced by the previous 
government on August 27 and later established. The Small 
Business Loans Act was also changed at that time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is a paragraph in the speech from the throne that really 
made me feel good, the paragraph relating to trade. I know my 
colleague from the NDP will appreciate this one because he has 
his views on trade and I do not think he has changed them. The 
hon. member has indicated he has not changed his views. Has he 
changed his view on NAFTA?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Not at all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> The NDP has not changed its view on NAFTA. 
The paragraph reads: ``Job creation and economic growth also 
require Canadian firms, especially small and medium sized 
businesses, to adopt an aggressive trading mentality to take 
advantage of export markets''. I know my colleague does not 
agree with that. Mike Wilson has said that very often, in fact. 
Then it goes on to say: ``With the successful conclusion of the 
Uruguay round and the implementation of NAFTA, the 
government will assist Canadian companies to translate 
improved market access into greater export sales''. Well those 
were stock Tory speeches for the nine years I was in government 
and now they are taken on lock, stock and barrel by the new 
government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="458"> 458 </A></B>
<P>
	To all those people who during the election campaign were 
told by their Liberal and NDP candidates that they were opposed 
to NAFTA, that they would renegotiate NAFTA and would 
change NAFTA, ladies and gentlemen, they were just kidding. 
They adopted NAFTA lock, stock and barrel. Not a paragraph, 
not a word, not one single dot was changed in the law that was 
passed in this place. The new Liberal government adopted the 
whole thing.
<P>
	Do I disagree with that? No, I do not disagree. I support the 
government members in their change, in their transformation on 
the road to Damascus. What I find extraordinary is how little 
time it took them to do it. What a feat to be able to fight this in 
the House of Commons for years. Some members were not here 
at the time but I can tell them because I was on that side. They 
fought this. There were screams in the House. It was 
extraordinary. How many days did it take them? Was it 10 days, 
20 days? Twenty days after being sworn in, NAFTA was the 
greatest thing since sliced bread. The conversion was 
extraordinary.
<P>
	I want to be honest about this. Our colleagues from the NDP, 
although I disagree with them, did not change their minds. They 
have been consistent. I am sorry, I cannot say the same for the 
government side.
<P>
	The same speech talks about internal trade. Internal trade is an 
important issue. I wish the government well because quite 
frankly it really points to the fact that this country is doing better 
at trade with other countries than it is within its own borders. In 
the end it does not make sense because Canadians are paying the 
price for unfair and unreasonable trade barriers in this country.
<P>
	The new government proposes to deal with that issue in its 
speech from the throne. It meets exactly with the commitment 
we made during the campaign. It builds on what the previous 
government had done to complete negotiations of a committee 
of ministers of internal trade to eliminate trade barriers, to free 
the movement of goods, services, people and capital within 
Canada by June 30, 1994.
<P>
	Last week I was delighted to hear the Minister of Industry, 
after meeting with his colleagues, reiterate and take up that 
commitment. It is a good idea. I agreed with it when we were the 
government. I still think it is a good idea.
<P>
	To get back to trade, there is allusion to the Pacific Rim and 
Latin America. We had announced we were going to establish a 
foundation for the Pacific Rim and Latin America. It is the same 
thing.
<P>
	It just goes on. We had also announced changes to the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	There is another very interesting paragraph: ``A centre of 
excellence for women's health will be established to ensure that 
women's health issues receive the attention they deserve''. I am 
sure many members from the Reform Party agree with that. 
Probably totally.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Who wrote this throne speech?
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> I suspect the same public servants who wrote 
our speeches from the throne with us probably shared their notes 
with the new government because on August 23, 1993 would you 
not know it, the previous minister of health announced that she 
would put forward a new bureau for the health of women. This 
was before the campaign and there is exactly the same 
commitment. I cannot disagree with that.
<P>
	The last one I want to point to is the overlap in government. 
On September 2, 1993 the same commitment and type of 
initiative was put forward.
<P>
	I am not going to quarrel with the government on those issues. 
I will support the government. On NAFTA, GATT, Latin 
America, Pacific Rim, all those issues, let us go right ahead. I 
will be happy to support the government in any way I can.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> How does it differ from you?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> The government differs in key areas. How jobs 
should be created in this country is one example. That is an issue 
that the government campaigned on but that is where there are a 
few disappointments in the speech from the throne. The best 
question is where is the meat?
<P>
	Where this government seems to have made a commitment is 
for the infrastructure program. It was going to build sewers and 
roads. What we are finding out is that the money is now going to 
convention centres. I do not have any problems with that but the 
municipalities wanted the money for roads and sewers.
<P>
	Who exactly is going to make the decisions and how will that 
happen? Is there going to be an infrastructure program or not? 
Or is it going to be a slush fund, as seems to be alluded to in this 
secret memo I made public two days ago? The ministers of 
public works and human resources were fighting not only for 
direct control over the program as stated in the memo written to 
the Prime Minister by the Clerk of the Privy Council, but they 
also wanted federal control over all projects.
<P>
	There was a question on this in the House yesterday and the 
Prime Minister did not answer. We know they are responsible 
for ACOA and western diversification. The Clerk of the Privy 
Council does not have to write to the Prime Minister to ask him 
whether they were responsible for ACOA and western 
diversification. They know that. We know that. He felt this issue 
was so important that he had to write to the Prime Minister to 
find out whether their mandate was to have control over all 
federal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="459"> 459 </A></B>
<P>
projects. We have yet to know whether it is the minister from 
Nova Scotia who will decide whether New  Brunswick gets this 
money there or elsewhere, not just for infrastructure but for 
other programs as well.
<P>
	I have to admit I may agree on some things but there is a 
discrepancy between what was said during the campaign and 
what seems to have happened behind closed doors since this 
government was sworn in.
<P>
	I was disappointed about a few things in the speech. There was 
no mention of agriculture or very little. I have concerns also 
about natural resources. I am very concerned this government 
may be considering taxes on petroleum products or a carbon tax. 
It may be tempted to go that route, but it would have to think 
very carefully because we already tax our resources in this area. 
We do that now. Any thought about such an initiative has to be 
very closely looked at.
<P>
	On the deficit and debt there is a general statement but I guess 
we will have to wait until the budget comes forward to really 
find out where the government's mind is on this. What I do know 
and what I can say is that the government up until now has not 
been very forthcoming in the way it has masqueraded or 
camouflaged the numbers. There is quite evidently a deliberate 
move to increase the amount of the deficit for this year, to pump 
it up, to make the previous government look bad and make itself 
look better. That move is quite obvious.
<P>
	I ask hon. members to take a second and think about one thing. 
Let us assume the situation is as the government says it is. We 
have had these situations before. I remember when we were in 
that same position as a government. What did we do? We froze 
spending for the rest of the fiscal year. That is what we did. Why 
is it that this government has not frozen spending, if not because 
it wants to pump that number up for political reasons?
<P>
	Where does the Canadian interest lie in all of this? Where is 
the interest of the taxpayers?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I see the member for Chicoutimi. Let us ask him where lies the 
interest of Chicoutimi voters in all this if the government, 
instead of freezing expenditures, lets the deficit run unchecked 
as is the case right now. This is nothing new, I am not imagining 
it.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	There is no need to worry that I will spring some new theory 
on him. The concept is simple enough. All the government needs 
to do is declare an immediate freeze on expenditures for the rest 
of the fiscal year, instead of letting the deficit grow to 
astronomical heights. This, however, it has chosen not to do. 
Why, do you ask? For political reasons.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are signalling that I only have one minute 
left. With your permission and leave of this House, I will end my 
comments promptly so as not to omit anything important, after 
which I will be pleased to answer questions and respond to 
comments. With your  consent, I will then take five more 
minutes to discuss other subjects.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I must ask for unanimous 
consent. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members: </B>Yes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Our friends in the Bloc and the Reform Party 
are consistent in their refusal. I will therefore use up the minute 
that is left to finish my comments, to tell briefly how worried I 
am by the new turn taken in this House, by the accent that is 
being put on regional views as a result of the elections when 
Canadians democratically made their choices.
<P>
	We end up with, on one part, an official opposition party 
dedicated to breaking up Canada-it has the right to represent 
this view, I do not object-and on the other part, a Reform Party 
which just as legitimately represents a view, but a view that is 
not national. It did not field candidates in all ridings in the last 
election.
<P>
	Facing them, we find a government seemingly determined to 
let events run their own course. I am worried. This country and 
this Parliament must squarely face this challenge to our future. 
Our duty requires that we better stress what unites us as a 
people. That is what a country is all about, not this expression of 
narrow viewpoints which tends to blame others for everything 
that goes wrong.
<P>
	I do not agree with this type of nationalism, this rather narrow 
and simplistic view which has nothing in common with my own 
vision of our country. Canada is badly in need of a sense of its 
future and of a shared project.
<P>
	In the next few years, I will be fighting to preserve this 
country's integrity and to bring out what exactly we have in 
common.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the stand-up comic from 
Sherbrooke on such an entertaining presentation. Members of 
the Progressive Conservative Party really missed out last June 
by electing someone else as their leader. They certainly made 
the most monumental mistake of their lives because history has 
proven that our gentleman from Sherbrooke is now a leader in 
opposition, a leader of the former Progressive Conservative 
Party.
<P>
	I said ``opposition'' because he sees himself as the official 
opposition. The hon. member should recognize in his usual 
jovial manner that he is leader of absolutely nothing, but he is 
obviously a very good entertainer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="460"> 460 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	He talks of Canadian citizens. For five years straight I have 
heard the member for Sherbrooke, previously minister of this 
and that, talking about Canadian big business without ever 
mentioning Canadians. Today he remembers them.
<P>
	I know the member is a grassroots politician. All of a sudden, 
he is forced to start all over again, to go from door to door. I 
congratulate him on his door-to-door campaign. It is a good 
start. Maybe, 25 or 30 years from now, the Progressive 
Conservative Party will become the official opposition.
<P>
	I am not particularly attempting to reply to the member for 
Sherbrooke who seems suddenly to have taken it upon himself to 
change the rules of the game. I have always thought, during the 
five years that I was here, that one was not to address other 
members directly in the House, that one had to address the 
Speaker. The rules seem to have changed. I would like to 
comment on the House rules. Following the speech by the 
minister for Heritage Canada, opposition members were 
allowed to speak.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger)</B> I would just like to remind 
the member for Carleton-Gloucester that when a point of order 
has been raised the Speaker deals with it after questions and 
comments.
<P>
	The member for Sherbrooke's speech seems to have aroused a 
lot of interest. In order to allow members on both sides of the 
House to comment or ask questions, I would ask the member for 
Carleton-Gloucester to confine himself to the speech. Later, 
we could certainly discuss any other matter which he might want 
to raise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, agreed. I give notice that I 
would like to raise a point of order as soon as questions and 
comments are over.
<P>
	I wish to go back to our comedian from Sherbrooke and tell 
him that the difference between the new government and the old 
governement he was part of is that: there are glib talkers and 
then there are people of little action. The member for 
Sherbrooke has become one of those glib talkers.
<P>
	The member for Sherbrooke for whom I have much affection 
and admiration, has made great progress. I would like to have 
heard him use the same tone to defend the public good over the 
course of the last five years. I must then congratulate him on his 
speech. He has finally seen the light. At long last, he is talking 
about people from Sherbrooke, from Chicoutimi. He has not 
mentioned the citizens of the national capital region but he has 
spoken of the westerners and the Reform Party. He referred to 
the Bloc Quebecois and to Canadians in general. He did forget to 
ask for absolution for the great sin he committed while in 
``another world'' during nine years; that is, being spokesperson 
for big business rather than for Canadian citizens.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, allow me to return the compliment 
to my friend from Carleton-Gloucester. I know him well and 
have great affection for him, but I hope the showering of my 
affections on him will not be quite so painful as his on me.
<P>
	I can accept the member's reproaches. I do believe the 
Canadian people passed judgment on October 25, as I recall, and 
that judgment was quite harsh. I do not know how long the hon. 
member intends to rehash the fact and harp upon it. There are 
two members left in the House representing the Progressive 
Conservative Party. My colleague still feels the need today to 
rise and strike another blow. What can I do? Such is human 
nature.
<P>
	All I can say is that I have also seen that feeling. The 
member's comments, when he says that I am the leader of 
nothing, border on scorn. I heard him clearly. That is his point of 
view. About 16 per cent of the Canadian population would 
disagree with him. I do not need any advice from my colleague 
about going door to door or about winning people's faith. I wish 
to remind him where he is. He is in a Parliament in which each 
person present has been elected by his or her riding. I was thus 
elected and I defer to the good judgment of the citizens of my 
riding. I leave it to them to decide if my presence here has any 
less value than his own, as he seems to think.
<P>
	If this is an example of his feelings and attitude to come 
during his tenure in government, I can only wish him luck. I 
have seen it before, and I have also seen the results over time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened 
with keen interest to the speech by the former Deputy Prime 
Minister of Canada. Obviously he has told us that in this House 
or in this Parliament, it is six of one and half a dozen of the other.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	During the last election, Canadians elected a new government 
and Ontario has majority representation in this government, 
luckily for Canada and for its regions. In Quebec, we had 
another choice and the majority voted for the Bloc québécois. 
The same thing happened in the West where voters elected a 
majority of Reform Party candidates.
<P>
	I think we must give the government a chance to prove itself. 
Obviously, it will soon have to tackle job creation and deficit 
reduction. It is true that the former government showed us 
clearly that it was incapable of solving the serious problems 
confronting Canada and Canadians let them know clearly what it 
thought of them.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="461"> 461 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think we must be 
serious in this House, and even if my honourable colleague from 
Sherbrooke rose to speak to this House, as he has the right to do, 
his speech reminded me of the death of a swan or, should I say, 
the agony of a swan. As far as we are concerned, in Quebec we 
had a choice and the majority prevailed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is always comforting to see that 
in our democracy people have choices to make and that they can 
make them freely, albeit for different reasons. There are some in 
the hon. members ranks who claim that he was elected to 
achieve the independence of Quebec. Others will say that maybe 
his mandate was a bit wider and that many people who voted for 
the member from Shefford also wanted a change of government. 
It is hard to judge after the fact, but time will tell.
<P>
	I want to say to the member from Shefford, while thanking 
him for his advice, which is always useful, that he has just 
arrived here. I too know what it is to be elected with the wind at 
my back and on a wave. When you arrive here in those 
circumstances, you are always full of confidence and very 
happy. Here is what I have to say to the member from Shefford 
for what it is worth, since I do not seem to have the benefit of his 
vast experience. If he is forecasting our demise, the swan's song, 
he surely knows things that I do not. I do not know him very 
well, but he must have a lot of parliamentary experience to be 
able to say that.
<P>
	In any case, I can say to the member from Shefford in all 
humility that like him the member from Sherbrooke was once 
elected with the wind at his back and that the member from 
Sherbrooke has also been elected with the wave running in the 
opposite direction. When he has lived both experiences, maybe 
he will share with us his thoughts and his great wisdom.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is a short time left 
and I would ask for the co-operation of members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be very quick indeed. As the 
member knows, I have deep affection for the member for 
Sherbrooke.
<P>
	When he was going through the litany of policy initiatives he 
agreed to in terms of supporting the government, I wondered if it 
was some type of early olive branch and that he might like to 
consider coming over here and joining us.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Just as short an answer 
from the hon. member for Sherbrooke.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a little surprised by the 
comment. I have a lot of friendship for my friend from 
Broadview-Greenwood, but I think it would be the reverse. We 
could form the government pretty fast and continue the agenda. I 
look forward to sitting with the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood and forming a new Progressive 
Conservative government who knows?
<P>
	I know the member for Broadview-Greenwood will 
acknowledge that I sat on that side of the House for a period of 
time. I would be curious to know whether he shares the view that 
things are a little different, the perspective on fund raisers and 
other things.
<P>
	I heard the Prime Minister yesterday make a very good 
explanation on using government aircraft. Why did he not give 
that explanation when he was on this side of House? I look 
forward to working with him in this Parliament.

	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was extremely disappointed 
a short while ago when you did not recognize me after the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage spoke. It has been my experience 
in the House and my observation of years before that when 
someone spoke in the House the Speaker would recognize 
people from different parties.
<P>
	I understand full well that if someone from the government 
makes a speech, especially a minister, it would be good 
parliamentary manners to accept comments or questions 
immediately from opposition members of Parliament.
<P>
	However, when members of the government wanted to make a 
comment or question to the minister I believe in the past they 
have always been recognized. A member may agree or disagree 
with his own minister. A member like myself may want to make 
a comment. I may want to make a comment about something that 
affects my riding. I may want to question the minister.
<P>
	Are we changing the way we have been operating in the House 
whereby after someone's speech there is an alternance between 
parties so that backbenchers, members of Parliament, can have 
their say in the highest court of the land?
<P>
	I beg you, Mr. Speaker, not to change that good practice. 
There should be an alternance among the five parties. We on the 
government side should not be muzzled as ordinary members of 
Parliament because of possibly a new practice of which I have 
not been made aware to date.
<P>

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member 
for Carleton-Gloucester for raising his point of order, 
particularly at this early stage in this 35th Parliament. I will 
quote for him two precedents that will enlighten us all, certainly 
including myself in the chair at this moment.
<P>
	In the first instance I will refer to the <I>Annotated Standing 
Orders</I> of the House at page 144:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-preference in this period is to be given to Members of parties other than 
that of the original speaker, but not to the exclusion of Members of other 
parties-amendments to a bill cannot be moved-</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="462"> 462 </A></B>
<P>
	And so on. In effect I largely founded my decision in the 
selection of members for questions and comments following the 
intervention of the hon. Minister of Canadian Heritage on the 
basis of my limited knowledge according to that annotated text.
<P>
	On the same point of order raised by the hon. member, I have 
learned that there is also a greater latitude given to members 
from both sides-in this instance from the government 
side-when a minister of the government speaks.
<P>
	I will refer him to the January 17, 1983 edition of <I>Hansard</I> as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the Chair will try, as much as possible, to give priority to Members 
representinga party other than that of the Member who made the speech. However, 
backbenchers on the Government side will also be entitled to ask questions 
following a speech by a Minister.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The point raised by the member for Carleton-Gloucester is 
an important one, as I said earlier, at the beginning of the 35th 
Parliament. I thank him for raising the issue at this time and 
making us in the chair even more sensitive to this procedure so 
that in effect we will address the matter with even greater justice 
in the days ahead.
<P>
	I thank the member for Carleton-Gloucester for raising this 
point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand your reading from 
former <I>Debates</I>. When you mentioned that preference would be 
given to MPs of other parties and so on, I did not hear the word 
exclusive or must. I heard what I interpret as words like may and 
good practice and good custom.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	I appreciate very much your diligence in checking to see what 
the proper practice should be. I also say that I do respect that you 
are new on the job, as it were, and I respect your position.
<P>
	However you have just informed me, Mr. Speaker, that I was 
right but too bad, member of Parliament for 
Carleton-Gloucester, you could have had your day in court; 
you were right but sit down and we are going to go on with 
whatever we are supposed to go on with today.
<P>
	Since I have not been hanged, as capital punishment does not 
exist any more, and I am still alive and standing, perhaps the 
Chair, as a gesture of penance or whatever it might be called, 
would allow me to have 60 seconds to comment on whatever I 
would like to say to the minister.
<P>
	I think it would be fair to allow me as a backbench member of 
Parliament to make comments that would affect my riding after 
a minister has spoken.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We have heard the request 
of the hon. member for Carleton-Gloucester. I do in the first 
instance as the Speaker at this time humbly submit to the 
member that I erred in my judgment, not being fully aware of all 
of the rules and procedures of the House.
<P>
	I would ask the House for unanimous consent so that the 
member for Carleton-Gloucester might at this time make those 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have no 
difficulty giving my friend 60 seconds to make a comment. If he 
is simply reflecting the frustration he feels about not having 
ample opportunity to make interventions, I am sure it is 
something that we all feel.
<P>
	The Standing Orders restrict us to 10 minutes for questions 
and comments and yet you will notice, Mr. Speaker, that at the 
end of that period there are still, almost inevitably, four or five 
members standing.
<P>
	I simply want to say I respect the frustration my hon. 
colleague feels, but I remind him that it is probably a frustration 
that we all feel a good part of the time. We are restricted by the 
Standing Orders. However, if he has a comment which he feels 
compelled to make now and requires 60 seconds, I certainly 
would give him unanimous consent to do so.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a new member 
of this House. I have had the good fortune to listen to the 
remarks of the member for Sherbrooke. I admit that I am 
perhaps a less experienced orator than he, but I have just as 
much fire in my belly. A Latin tag comes to mind, although I am 
not big on Latin, which sums up what I have heard Asinus 
asinum fricat means that as a junior MP I have to expect verbal 
sparring matches, quite virulent ones sometimes, in the House.
<P>
	Since I am speaking after the member for Sherbrooke and he 
talked about riding in on a wave and being elected with the wave 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="463"> 463 </A></B>
<P>
running in the opposite direction, I shall start my remarks in the 
same vein, coming as I do from a maritime riding, by pointing 
out that the member for Gaspé has continued, unlike his party, to 
ride the wave  that the people of Quebec directed toward that 
party in 1984. In 1984 we talked about le beau risque, the gallant 
gamble. In 1988 they talked about returning with honour and 
enthusiasm. The riding of Gaspé has taken the same wave, and 
perhaps the Conservative Party was not listening to it.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	As a member of the Bloc Québécois I intend to continue to 
repeat what the people of the riding of Gaspé and of Quebec said 
in the recent federal election.
<P>
	The House of Commons is for me a place to speak out for the 
residents of the great riding of Gaspé. It is one of the most 
beautiful parts of Quebec. Whether my fellow members from 
Quebec agree or not, I would say it is the most beautiful part of 
Quebec. It is such a jewel that in the early 1970s the Liberal 
Party decided to create Forillon National Park on the tip of the 
Gaspé Peninsula.
<P>
	It was in the Forillon National Park affair that the man who is 
now Prime Minister of Canada first took up arms against 
Quebec. In 1972, the member for Shawinigan expressed his 
delight at having gone over the head of the Bourassa government 
to create Forillon Park, and I quote his remarks at the time: ``I 
used the Park to break the Quebec government and I'm proud of 
it!'' Our new Prime Minister started his career fittingly.
<P>
	We have a saying where I come from: you can take the 
Gaspésien out of Gaspé, but you can't take the Gaspé out of the 
Gaspésien. To a Gaspésien, having land expropriated forges 
character. As the motto of Quebec has it, we remember.
<P>
	This maritime riding developed to a great extent thanks to 
cod. Centralizing federal management of this marine resource 
leaves a bitter taste in our mouths, just as the Forillon Park affair 
did. Management imposed from outside dismisses local 
attempts to solve the industry's problems. This is not the first 
time the fishery has undergone a crisis.
<P>
	In the early 1970s, the cod stock was in about the same state as 
it is today, but the resourcefulness of the fishing folk of the time 
turned them toward other species. When in the early 1970s they 
could catch no more cod, they went after crab. Crab fishing was 
no gold mine then, but it is now.
<P>
	A little later, around 1976, it was the turn of the ocean perch 
fishery in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to decline. The people who 
had been catching ocean perch started harvesting shrimp 
instead, because shrimp was not so well known. Their 
resourcefulness enabled them to get through a crisis.
<P>
	I would conclude that these maritime communities have the 
ability to adapt as long as they have the freedom to work 
together. They can let each other know when there are other 
species around that are undervalued and could be marketed. For 
that to work there have to be channels of rapid communication 
between the decision makers and the ordinary people, the 
fishermen on the front line. The ability to make rapid feedback 
possible was lost by Quebec under its Liberal government in 
1982 when jurisdiction over fisheries was returned.
<P>
	It is high time the federal government opened its eyes. In 
1986, rapid feedback would have enabled the people who fished 
for cod inshore and saw the stocks were declining to adapt. 
While cod stocks were declining, other species, wrongly 
thought to be undesirable, should have been promoted.
<P>
	The problem goes a lot further than the exhausted stocks the 
department has proclaimed. It is the whole structure of the 
industry that has to be rethought. Instead of getting on with the 
structural changes needed to react to cyclical variations in cod 
stocks, the throne speech is still looking for someone to blame 
for their disappearance.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	In order to get the economy going again, the government must 
set directions for the future of the fishing industry. I will address 
two important aspects of this issue; harvesting the resource and 
protecting workers.
<P>
	Cod fishing is older than Canada. Since the fishery began, fish 
have been harvested using the preservation methods we knew. In 
the beginning, we salted and dried cod. With the arrival of 
electricity and freezers, we made blocks of frozen cod. That is 
what we are still doing, or were until the minister turned off the 
tap.
<P>
	These types of harvesting resulted in the setting of an implicit 
standard on the length of fish caught. In order to meet these 
standards, which were set for a specialized industry, fishermen 
had to throw back undesirable fish solely on the basis of length.
<P>
	The restructuring of the fishing industry, or rather, the 
revolution of the fishing industry, was not addressed in the 
speech from the throne.
<P>
	Despite decades of intervention by the federal government, 
the structure of the fishing industry is still at the elementary 
school level. What does the government intend to do in order to 
upgrade it to the university level?
<P>
	University is the top of the line. We must no longer limit our 
efforts to the traditional mass market. Instead we must seek out 
new market niches, such as those for fresh fish and 
under-utilized species. This means that we must support the 
fishing communities so that they are able to meet these new 
standards. We must enable them to make more money while 
catching fewer fish.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="464"> 464 </A></B>
<P>
	In order to reach this objective, the government should apply 
business methods to the fishing industry; in other words, it 
should bring the sales operation closer to the harvesting 
operation.
<P>
	If all the steps or all the links in the industrial chain are 
respected, fishermen will be able to sell everything they catch. 
At present, they depend on overspecialized plants and as a result 
what they harvest is overspecialized.
<P>
	In the past, the government pinned all its hopes on harvesting 
the natural resource. Today, we must rely on human resources, 
the grey matter of the people in the communities, to make more 
money while being more respectful of the marine resource. 
These people are familiar with the problems, they have 
solutions. Is the government prepared to support their efforts?
<P>
	These communities need concrete measures like those put 
forward by the Bloc during the election campaign, which I will 
list. One such measure was the creation of landing warehouses, 
in order to group together underutilized species and promote the 
sale of fish turned down by traditional plants.
<P>
	The second measure put forward by the Bloc was the creation 
of a provincial clearinghouse to implement the logistics of 
transportation to the various markets because they will be new.
<P>
	The third measure, which I will mention but about which I 
will be speaking again later, was returning the management of 
fishing licences to the provinces.
<P>
	What I mean to say is that the government, instead of looking 
to the future, set up short focus programs that did not address 
existing problems. Meanwhile, the situation has deteriorated 
and workers have found themselves without work.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	The government is proposing pointless training programs. 
Rather than forcing workers to bend over backwards to meet the 
requirements of these programs, we should be listening to them 
and taking their tastes and their skills into consideration. We 
have to rely on people's experience and help them to put their 
ideas into practice. It is up to Ottawa to understand how people 
think, not the other way around. As I said during my election 
campaign, there is a local solution to a local problem. Real 
solutions will not come from Ottawa.
<P>
	However, a transition period is necessary in order to revitalize 
industry. Since it was the government that allowed the situation 
to get worse over the years, it is up to the government, if it wants 
to be a responsible government, to support the people who are 
now unemployed. The current minister of fisheries has already 
made an attempt to simplify access to assistance programs for 
workers in the industry. It is a step in the right direction.
<P>
	However, a great deal remains to be done. Words are wasted 
on a starving man. Throughout this transition period, the 
government must make sure that the people affected have bread 
and butter on the table. It is not the fault of the people in the 
coastal communities if the previous federal government 
preferred to waste public funds rather than investing in projects 
that would create jobs. Coastal communities are in shock. Now 
is not the time to let them down and force the residents to find a 
job that does not correspond to either their inclinations or their 
skills.
<P>
	Those who live in coastal communities have passed on their 
fishing practices from father to son, from mother to daughter, 
and have never had to change their way of doing things.
<P>
	The Gaspé poet, Maurice Joncas, described their lives in the 
song ``<I>Les expropriés de Forillon</I>'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Their universe was filled with these: Fishing boats upon the seas, Trees to fell 
in winter snow, Pleasures that were theirs to know.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think these lines are a fitting description of past life in the 
communities which now, because of the federal government's 
management mistakes, have been turned upside down. For them, 
life will never be the same. They have to reinvent a way of life. 
All this cannot be done by waving a magic wand, and the 
government must respect the rate at which the communities are 
able to adapt. This revolution requires that the various levels of 
government give the coastal communities new development 
tools.
<P>
	These tools will have to enable coastal communities to take 
stock of the human and natural resources in their surrounding 
area, because all too often the government has acted 
unilaterally.
<P>
	Now is not the time to boast and brag about the merits of 
federalism. We really have to work together and ensure that the 
coastal communities feel they are full partners in the enormous 
changes to come, changes that affect them. It would be 
irresponsible to act otherwise.
<P>
	The appalling collapse of the Atlantic fish stocks is the direct 
result of federal intervention in the fishery. The Liberal 
government does not have a spotless record in this area. Early in 
the 1980s, the Liberals gave out a large number of subsidies for 
shipbuilding that sometimes reached to 60 per cent of the price 
of the boat. They contributed to the current situation of 
overcapacity. Instead of diversifying the industry, the federal 
government of the day-we will see what the new one plans to 
do-made the problem worse.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="465"> 465 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	For their part the provincial governments had no choice but to 
assist the processing sector to adapt to the higher volume of 
catches. They invested money while the resource itself, the 
cornerstone of the industry, slipped away.
<P>
	There cannot be a valid and coherent fisheries policy unless 
the provinces share in managing the resource. The vulnerability 
of Quebec and the other provinces regarding fisheries arises 
from the fact that the final decision making power rests with the 
federal government.
<P>
	Quebec and Newfoundland are perhaps closer on the issue of 
managing the fishery than we might think. In Quebec, we say 
Newfoundland is more separatist than we are. In the context of 
fisheries and oceans' reform-the research carried out last 
year-Newfoundland has asked for exclusive management of 
the resource and exclusive authority to issue licences for fishing 
in its waters.
<P>
	I would be in favour of returning licensing management to the 
provinces. However, because fish stocks are migratory, the 
provinces cannot claim exclusive jurisdiction. If Newfoundland 
believes that the federal government is managing the resource 
inadequately, we hope it will support us in working to achieve 
joint management among the provinces. With joint management 
the resource would be managed more efficiently and we would 
have a better chance of preserving it.
<P>
	However, a sovereign Quebec, with a seat on the Northwest 
Atlantic Fisheries Organization, could achieve a degree of 
rational management more rapidly. A sovereign Quebec would 
determine total levels of allowable catches just like any other 
sovereign state. It would distribute its share by issuing Quebec 
fishing licences.
<P>
	This approach would enable Quebec to voice its opinions, as a 
people, at the international level and to manage its biomass 
jointly as it saw fit, without the federal government acting as an 
intermediary.
<P>
	I want these remarks to be a plea for common sense, plea for 
respect for the maritime communities and their respective 
provinces. I have always tried to be fair. My remarks are not 
inspired by short-term interests but by a desire to counter the 
trend toward centralization in Canada that is responsible for the 
collapse of our fish stocks.
<P>
	It is thus with a profound respect for the parties concerned 
that I submit my vision to the House. This is my reply to the 
speech from the throne, which in my opinion showed no 
understanding at all of the problems endured by maritime 
communities in Canada and Quebec.

	He did not have only negative criticism to give in his speech. I 
notice he also suggested several solutions to improve the 
welfare of the citizens of that area, particularly regarding 
fishing. He also said that if Quebec had full jurisdiction over 
fishing, the people of the Gaspé Peninsula would not be in the 
terrible slump they are presently experiencing. As he put it so 
well, the Gaspé Peninsula is probably the most beautiful region 
of Quebec. It might be a bit cold, but it is still a most beautiful 
area which I had the opportunity to visit as recently as last year.
<P>
	To the hon. member for Gaspé, I want to say that listened to 
his speech with great interest. I congratulate him and urge him to 
keep up the good work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
Longueuil for his remarks. I will often take the floor in this 
House to defend the interests of fishermen, Quebec fishermen 
certainly, but also fishermen in general. I have a motto, and 
when we want to be impartial and show fair play, as we used to 
say in my former business, to be able to defend our own, we must 
determine what is our fair share of the resources and be 
respectful of our colleagues on the other side so as to agree on 
regulations and achieve administrative agreements that will 
ensure long-term harmony for the good of the communities as 
well as of the resources.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="466"> 466 </A></B>
<P>
	It is in that frame of mind that I extend my hand today to the 
members opposite and ask them to work with me, to take me 
seriously and not dismiss my remarks on the pretext that I am a 
sovereignist. I may be a sovereignist but I am not a racist. I want 
to work for the good of the fishermen. In my speech I 
endeavoured to show the government that if it intends to make 
communities which have nothing to do with it carry the can for a 
situation they have not chosen, the members and ministers will 
find that I will stand in their way and they will come to know me 
and learn what it is to deal with a quick-tempered son of the 
Gaspé Peninsula.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the member for Gaspé on his first speech in the 
House. I noted his concerns about his constituents, especially 
with regard to fish and the fact they derive their livelihood from 
the sea.
<P>
	In his speech he mentioned that if the province of Quebec 
were more involved in the determination of the potential 
solutions to the lack of fish and lack of cod in the Atlantic 
region, somehow that would alleviate the problem for his 
constituents.
<P>
	I do not think having the province of Quebec become involved 
in the negotiations for the allocation of fish quotas will create 
any more fish to be harvested. Is he suggesting that the province 
of Quebec be given a larger share of the quotas available, or is he 
suggesting some other alternative that we are not aware of, 
whereby more fish could be harvested and in that way improve 
the prosperity and the livelihood of all the fishermen on the 
Atlantic coast?
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the hon. 
member for St. Albert for his question. When I spoke a moment 
ago, I did not mean to say that Quebec could make fish appear 
out of nowhere at this moment. What I meant was that in the 
past, because we had the right to jointly manage the stocks, we 
were entitled to manage them in Quebec. The process for 
feedback, as it occurred in a field as complex as that of the 
fisheries, was implemented much faster.
<P>
	In that sense, I understand that all Canadians, including 
Quebecers, must tighten their belts and participate in 
reconstituting the stocks. When I spoke a moment ago, I meant 
to invite the government not to make the mistakes of the past all 
over again. Since a man grows when he learns from his mistakes, 
I believe we all have a great opportunity to grow, because the 
federal government has made a lot of mistakes in the past, and I 
wish we could learn from them.
<P>
	If we jointly managed the stocks, it would be so much easier 
to harmonize the industrial policies of the provinces in the field 
of fisheries. At the present time, we take advantage of the fact 
that the decision will be made at the federal level, and that 
everyone will pull uncle Prime Minister's sleeve to get a little 
piece of the pie, whereas if we all sat around the same table as 
equals in mutual respect, we would achieve harmony, but it 
would be for the better of the resource. We must never forget 
that people depend on that resource. Their survival is linked to 
that of the stock, they need it to eat, to earn their living, to 
maintain their lifestyle because the Canadian fisheries industry, 
including that of Quebec, is an export-oriented industry. We 
therefore owe it to ourselves to take good care of the stocks. 
They are a gold mine and I wish we could all work together to 
that end.
<P>
	I am 5 feet, 10 inches tall and I am a sovereignist but that is 
not all there is. The most important thing is that we come to 
agree on the management of the fish stocks, and I would be 
extremely happy if we could achieve that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the member for Gaspé on the positive tone of his 
speech. I suggest to him there is no doubt the federal 
government has mismanaged the east coast fisheries.
<P>
	The member seems to suggest that the solution to what ails the 
east coast fishery lies in turning jurisdiction of the fisheries over 
to the provinces. Would this not just exacerbate the problem and 
simply lead to endless bickering between the provinces rather 
than a real solution?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, when someone wants to 
find solutions to a problem, should he be afraid to say what he 
really thinks? Should he be concerned that it could start a 
squabble? I certainly did not speak with the intention to cause an 
argument. I simply invited the members collectively to improve 
the condition of the industry and the sharing of resources so we 
could perpetuate these resources.
<P>
	I do not expect to start a constitutional squabble. If that were 
the case, I would face the music. With all my colleagues sitting 
here, I think I am strong enough to do that. Nevertheless, that 
was not my intention this morning.
<P>
	I understand that the riding of Delta is in British Columbia. I 
would like to give my regards to the people of British Columbia 
and to apologize for not having mentioned their province when I 
talked about fisheries.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	This morning I wanted to take a stand and respond to the 
speech from the throne. This speech overlooks many serious 
points. Two things were mentioned: find the reason for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="467"> 467 </A></B>
<P>
depletion of stocks and create an  emergency program for 
Atlantic fishermen who are at the moment greatly affected.
<P>
	I would like to tell my hon. colleague from British Columbia 
that I intend to visit the fishermen from his province once my 
English has improved somewhat.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and 
a privilege for me to rise in my place as a new member for the 
riding of Brant and participate in this throne speech debate.
<P>
	Before I make my comments in that regard, I would like to 
thank the people from the riding of Brant for electing me as their 
representative to this House. As well, I would like to recognize 
the contribution made to this House and to my riding by my 
predecessor, Mr. Derek Blackburn. I wish him well on his 
appointment to the Immigration Board and thank him for 
accepting that appointment prior to the call of the 1993 federal 
election. Certainly that is one political appointment that I will 
not argue with the previous government.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize you and congratulate 
you on your appointment to the Chair and on behalf of the people 
of Brant congratulate the Speaker for being elected as our 
presiding officer. I have every confidence in his ability to keep 
our House in order and I offer all my support and my 
co-operation in that regard.
<P>
	There are a couple of things I would like to share with the 
House this morning. First of all, I would like everyone to know 
why I so strongly support the speech from the throne as it was 
presented to us by the Governor General on the opening of this 
historic 35th Parliament.
<P>
	Second, I would like to offer to the government an idea. It is 
not a new idea, but it is one which, if implemented more broadly, 
would help us effect real change in government.
<P>
	Why do I support so strongly the agenda that has been 
presented to us in the speech from the throne? In a word, it is 
because it is practical. The people of Brant are tired of smoke 
and mirrors. They want no nonsense. They want a common sense 
approach to the challenges that face us. What we find in the 
speech from the throne is just that.
<P>
	Take, for example, the infrastructure program. It is a program 
that can be used by municipalities all across the country. My 
riding of Brant is a wonderful mix of rural and urban. Brantford 
and South Dumfries townships boast some of the most fertile 
and productive farm land in Ontario and they are dotted with 
beautiful historical villages like Glen Morris, Mount Pleasant, 
Harrisburg and the community in which my family has been for 
over six generations, the village of St. George.
<P>
	We need road improvements to connect our rural residents 
with these villages and with our urban centres, the town of Paris 
and the city of Brantford. Paris is a wonderful town, located 
between the rivers Nith and Grand. It needs new sewers for their 
residential areas. On the other hand, the city of Brantford needs 
support to improve its landfill site, its water treatment facilities 
and its roads if it is going to compete for the economic 
development that we so sorely need. The infrastructure program 
makes sense. It is practical for the people in my riding and I 
believe members will find it is practical for the people in theirs.
<P>
	When we look at the government's approach to small and 
medium sized business we see yet another set of practical 
strategies. In my riding we have historically depended on the 
manufacture of farm implements and farm equipment. 
Companies like Cockshutt, then White, Massey-Harris, then 
Massey-Ferguson, are the companies that employed the people 
of Brant.
<P>
	Not very long ago the city of Brant boasted having 5,000 of 
the highest paying manufacturing jobs in North America. 
However, those jobs are all gone. Those companies are all 
closed and we, like many communities, are now trying to rebuild 
our economy. We know that it is small and medium sized 
businesses that are going to do that for us. My employers are 
very supportive of this government's understanding that they 
need better access to capital and less government red tape. They 
need support if we are to build local economic, industrial 
clusters.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	As a final example of our government's practicality let us 
look at the approach to youth and youth employment. Again, two 
very practical programs have been suggested. The national 
apprenticeship program is one example. It is a very important 
strategy for us because we need to transfer our young people 
more effectively from school to the work place.
<P>
	It might interest members to know that the city of Brantford, 
despite a population of over 100,000 people, does not have its 
own post-secondary educational institution. This is a real 
liability for us. It means that we do not have a history of lifelong 
learning. It means it is very difficult for us to attract new high 
tech investment.
<P>
	When we think of the apprenticeship program we see some 
possibilities for partnerships to be forged between the private 
sector and government, perhaps in starting technological 
institutes that can help with apprenticeship training. Of course, 
we believe Brantford is a perfect place for such an institute.
<P>
	We talk about the national youth services corps, an idea that 
received great support in my riding over the course of the 
campaign. There are a number of organizations in my riding that 
could provide opportunities for our young people. One of our 
great natural resources is the Grand River. It is a wide, slow 
moving river that comes right through the centre of my riding. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="468"> 468 </A></B>
<P>
The Brant Waterways Committee, I am sure, has 
environmentally related jobs that would help our young people 
get that very important first work experience.
<P>
	There is also a vibrant seniors community in my riding and the 
opportunity for inter-generational work, training and 
experiences exist. Our schools need young people to help 
younger people learn to read, write, do math and improve their 
computer skills.
<P>
	When I read the speech from the throne I saw all kinds of 
opportunities for me as a member to go back to my riding and 
work with the people to make things better and to improve our 
local economy.
<P>
	However, there is one idea that is not included in the speech 
from the throne and I would like to suggest it to the government 
for consideration. It is the idea of government decentralization; 
of taking certain government agencies, ministries and 
departments and moving them out of large urban centres like 
Ottawa and Toronto into smaller centres like those in my 
community.
<P>
	The people of my riding are very supportive of this notion. In 
fact, we had been promised the relocation of the computer and 
telecommunications services department of the provincial 
government into our riding early in 1993. This made a lot of 
sense to us because Brantford is the telephone city. It is where 
Alexander Graham Bell made the first long distance phone call 
between Brantford and Paris.
<P>
	We were very excited about the possibility and expected this 
relocation to occur. Unfortunately, with the change in 
government, there was a decision made to cancel that program. 
With that cancellation came depression, not only economic but 
social, to my community.
<P>
	Decentralization is an interesting idea. It is not new. However, 
it can help us meet a number of our priorities. It can help 
improve economic equality across the country. It can help 
improve the physical and social well-being of Canadians. It is a 
strategy that we can use as we look to streamline the public 
service and increase participatory democracy. It certainly would 
require us to make quantum leaps in the development and use of 
the electronic highway.
<P>
	Whether the federal government chooses to utilize the 
strategy of decentralization by itself or in concert with the 
provincial governments, as we try to affect reduction in 
duplications of government servicing or in new and innovative 
ways by working with the private sector in out-sourcing models 
and concepts, I believe that government decentralization is an 
idea whose time has come. I would encourage all our ministers 
as they look at their departmental management to consider this 
strategy. If they find that they have opportunities, particularly in 
the area of telecommunications, agriculture, the environment 
and others, I hope they would think of the riding of Brant.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	I have enjoyed the opportunity to share with the members of 
this House a little bit about the riding that I represent. I also 
appreciate the opportunity to share with them the reasons why I 
so strongly support the agenda that has been put before us in the 
speech from the throne.
<P>
	I would ask them all to vote in favour of the motion that is on 
the floor, put there by my colleague, the member for 
Bruce-Grey, and seconded by my colleague, the member for 
Madawaska-Victoria.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the hon. member from Brantford. I 
was in that community numerous times and it is indeed a 
beautiful community.
<P>
	I am interested in asking the hon. member about the 
infrastructure program which she so adamantly supports. The 
question I have is, what does the hon. member see as the longest 
term effect on her community for infrastructure? Is it the bill 
that the taxpayer picks up from the municipal, federal and 
provincial portion or the short-term job that may be arranged as 
a result of the program itself?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
question.
<P>
	I do not see these projects as only being of value in the short 
term. We are very anxious of course to get the shovels in the 
ground in my community because we do need job creation.
<P>
	Certainly in the discussions that I have had with all my 
municipalities there is a true expectation that this work will 
provide longer term opportunities. It will provide economic 
benefits to Brantford, Paris, South Dumfries and Brantford 
township.
<P>
	I have been extremely excited by the energy that all the 
municipal councils have shown toward the project. They feel 
they do have the moneys and can reallocate moneys collected for 
these projects.
<P>
	I have no hesitation in supporting the program and 
encouraging it to other municipalities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
too want to congratulate the hon. member on an excellent 
presentation to the House. I was extremely impressed.
<P>
	I want to follow up on one area that she touched on toward the 
end of her presentation concerning government offices moving 
out to, I assume she was suggesting, various parts of the country.
<P>
	In that light, I would ask the hon. member if it was her thought 
to do this only after investigation might take place as to the 
economics of making that transition and the economics of where 
they were going compared to where they are at the present time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="469"> 469 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, absolutely. There is no 
question that not everything can be moved. There is no question 
that we have to look at the economics. However, I think we have 
to look at the longer term.
<P>
	While there may be costs associated with the physical move 
and with restructuring and organizing particular agencies or 
departments selected to move, in the longer term there is a 
tremendous advantage to be held. It would be a very broad 
advantage for the country. I mentioned several reasons why that 
is important.
<P>
	I do not want the hon. member to get me wrong. Certainly 
there is a reason for many government departments and 
ministries to stay centralized.
<P>
	As I look at our need to stabilize economies across this 
country, in my area and particularly in the east, I think of the 
money that we put in in terms of unemployment insurance and 
social services and think maybe we should also be providing 
government jobs.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to support the motion on the address in reply to 
the throne speech and to explain how the government intends to 
dedicate its resources and energy to the future of our young 
people.
<P>
	First, however, I want to thank those hundreds of volunteers 
and the people of Vaudreuil who elected me to speak on their 
behalf in this venerable institution, the House of Commons. I 
will represent them with great pride, integrity and a sense of 
purpose, to defend our common goals.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To my friends and fellow citizens from Kirkland, selected as 
one of the top ten towns in Canada, thank you for your 
confidence, your support and trust over the past ten years. I have 
been honoured to serve you in my capacity as councillor and 
mayor. I am now proud to include you in the new family of the 
riding of Vaudreuil where I hope to serve you with equal 
dedication.
<P>
	I also want to express my love and gratitude to my wife Mary 
Alice, to our four children, Lisa, Laura, Michele and Marco, for 
their patience and unconditional support. They have been a true 
source of inspiration for me. To my parents, Domenico and 
Immacolata, thank you for teaching me the values and the 
importance of education and family values.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To you, Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to say that I admire 
your setting down a code of ethics for politicians, in order to 
restore the dignity of public office. Your great integrity is an 
example to us all. I thank you for it.
<P>
	To you, Mr. Speaker, I offer my sincere congratulations upon 
taking up your new duties.
<P>
	As a Quebecer, I always felt the opportunities for myself and 
members of my family were unlimited. Thirty-seven years ago, 
four Discepola brothers left the village where they were born, 
Volturara Irpina in the Campagna region in Italy, to settle in 
Canada with their families. Their dreams came true.
<P>
	Today, their children include judges, one doctor, teachers, 
engineers and accountants. One of them even wandered off to 
become a member of the House of Commons. I do not know of 
any other place in the world, any nation, any country where this 
would have been possible.
<P>
	The riding of Vaudreuil has many concerns and a number of 
priorities, but I have decided to use my maiden speech in the 
House of Commons to talk about the government's program for 
the future of our young people, because like all Quebecers and 
all Canadians, I am concerned about the future of my children 
and my children's children.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to have this opportunity to explain what the 
government intends to do to ensure that our young people have a 
decent future.
<P>
	Canada is proud that it can give its young people a wonderful 
place to grow up in. They enjoy the kind of life that is the envy of 
the whole world. Like the generations before them, these young 
people are looking for rewarding jobs, a comfortable standard of 
living and a satisfying family life. The ideals of youth have 
changed very little, although the circumstances have changed 
dramatically.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The recession, high youth unemployment and the prevailing 
uncertainty in the work force put enormous pressures on our 
youth, pressures that older Canadians have never had to 
experience.
<P>
	Today, students who graduate with a high school graduation 
certificate and choose not to further their studies seriously limit 
their future. In the 1990s, 60 per cent of available jobs will 
require grade 12 education or better. It is evident that our youth 
are not very well prepared to penetrate the work place. Their 
lack of competency will have tremendous social and economic 
consequences for us all.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Science and mathematics are the two engines that power 
innovation and progress that in turn will determine our survival 
in the age of technology. According to international studies, 
Canadian high school students are barely average in science. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="470"> 470 </A></B>
<P>
Compared with other OECD countries, Canada has a low 
percentage of graduates in science and engineering. There is no 
question that we must improve our performance. As the 21st 
century fast approaches, Canada must find the way to make its 
labour force more competitive. We believe that co-operation at 
all levels among governments, the provinces, management and 
labour will enable us to find solutions to our country's human 
resource needs.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Canada spends in excess of $55 billion per year on education 
and training. Of this total, $13 billion comes from the federal 
government, which represents 7.4 per cent of our Gross 
Domestic Product. This puts us well ahead of all OECD 
countries in this area.
<P>
	Not only is this government determined to promote education 
and the acquisition of knowledge, it also wants young people to 
get the best possible training to fill the jobs of the future.
<P>
	Despite the current high rate of unemployment among young 
people, some employers are still having trouble finding skilled 
workers. Serious gaps exist between school and the work world. 
With the emergence of new technologies, training in traditional 
fields has become outmoded. Many young people continue to 
opt for careers in fields which have become saturated, ignoring 
others in which workers are more in demand.
<P>
	Within the context of the new economy, there is a shortage of 
training programs in emerging fields in which job opportunities 
are plentiful. I am thinking here, for example, about information 
technology and telecommunications.
<P>
	Governments, labour and business leaders must join forces to 
revitalize our training system and create new apprenticeship 
opportunities geared to new, rapidly growing sectors of the 
economy.
<P>
	This recession has dealt a harsh blow to the aspirations of our 
youth. After years of study and part-time work, they cannot find 
work, even with a degree in hand.
<P>
	We have to come up with better solutions. It is clear that our 
country's social security safety net is not working in its present 
form and does little to encourage integration of young people 
into the labour force and develop their full potential.
<P>
	The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development will be 
consulting with the Canadian public and working with the 
provinces to ensure that together we are able to adapt our social 
programs to the realities of the nineties. Our social security 
system is the envy of the entire world. Whether it survives and 
remains effective, however, will depend on its ability to adapt to 
the new labour context.
<P>
	One of the options that the government is presently 
considering is the development of more and improved training 
programs geared to employment in order to ease the transition 
into the labour force for young people and help them acquire the 
skills in demand by employers.
<P>
	The second option under review by the government involves 
setting up a program in which young people would have an 
opportunity to serve their community. The government has 
made a commitment in this area by announcing plans to create a 
Youth Service Corps to give young people who are out of work 
the chance to gain some experience.
<P>
	The goal of the Youth Service Corps is not only to enhance the 
quality of life in our communities, but also to give young people 
back some hope and sense of accomplishment. Young people up 
to the age of 25 who participate in the Youth Service Corps will 
gain some on-the-job experience, have a head start on finding 
work and maybe even have a chance to break out of the vicious 
cycle of social dependency which destroys ambition and wastes 
talent.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development is 
determined to improve the Canada student loans program. He 
will consider making some changes which would increase the 
amount of short-term assistance provided and will hold 
consultations with the provinces and the other interested parties.
<P>
	The government also wants to increase the level of support 
provided to the co-operative education program which it sees as 
a way for students, the provinces, labour and business to work 
together to build a highly skilled workforce.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Canada's future rests with our young people who need an 
opportunity to become productive adults. In its pursuit of this 
objective, the federal government will vigorously support 
programs that enable young people to acquire the know-how to 
get good, well paid jobs and to look to the future with optimism.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank and to congratulate my hon. colleague from 
Vaudreuil for his speech. Obviously, he is deeply concerned 
with our youth, especially with respect to job training. I would 
like to ask him-and this may take a lot of courage on his part, 
considering his political affiliation-to tell me where he stands 
as a Quebecer on the issue of job training.
<P>
	If there is an issue for which there is a consensus today in 
Quebec, where public opinion is often divided, it is job training. 
The Conseil du Patronat du Québec, the CNTU, the FTQ, the 
government of Quebec all agree. The Liberal Party of Canada 
may well be the only one not to agree that the jurisdiction for job 
training should finally be given back to the government of 
Quebec and its natural allies, which are labour and management. 
Given that, where does the member for Vaudreuil, who  has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="471"> 471 </A></B>
<P>
proven to be sensitive, stand on the whole issue of young people 
and job training?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I think that our 
government has clearly stated its intention to review the entire 
subject of social programs, including job training.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, as the member for Vaudreuil, I think 
it is in the interest of all Quebecers and all Canadians to make 
sure that future programs are well structured and clearly meet 
the needs of the public in general.
<P>
	It is also clear that our government did not take a stand against 
manpower training. What we said is that we were not prepared to 
sign the agreement immediately. We want to review the 
programs first, but I am fairly confident that the member will 
soon get the answer he was hoping for.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, while the 
member talked about the envy of the world of our social 
programs it would seem to me that our social programs in many 
ways have been part of the destruction of the economic viability 
of this country. We are now $500 billion in debt and I think it is 
past time that we took our social programs and re-evaluated 
them to ensure that they are focused only on those who are in 
need rather than those who have collected by virtue of being part 
of a specific group.
<P>
	The hon. member also talked about the right or the 
relationship between study and work and one particular 
situation that was posed to me by a constituent a few weeks ago 
was that we seem to have a situation in our labour training in 
which we pay unemployment insurance to people who are in the 
apprenticeship training program while they attend school. This 
appears to be a good move yet we deny unemployment insurance 
to those who are going to university for a longer period of time.
<P>
	The point being made to me was that here we have someone on 
a training program who has a guaranteed job because he is on a 
release from his employer who is entitled to pick up 
unemployment insurance. Someone going to university has to 
fight for a summer job in order that he may continue his studies.
<P>
	It seems to me there is a vast divergence between the two 
attitudes toward the two different kinds of qualifications of 
study. I would think that university training has to be 
encouraged as much as possible. How do the hon. member and 
his government think we can ensure that money is available to 
enhance and motivate and pay for the education we so greatly 
need in this country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Mr Speaker, I could not agree more with the 
comments made by the hon. member. I think that when it comes 
to youth training programs and experience, it has always been 
my experience-having had in my other life a small computer 
business-that I was able to hire young students coming out of 
CEGEP, which is a pre-university entry program.
<P>
	I must say that in hiring those young students I was able in my 
own humble way to give them the experience that is so lacking 
when one is trying to find permanent employment.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	I think those kinds of programs are the initiatives that our 
minister, Lloyd Axworthy, is trying to put into place. What I am 
hearing from my two daughters who are in CEGEP is that once 
they graduate they cannot go anywhere. That is what our 
government has to do and what we have to respond to. Those are 
the needs of our youth. It is essentially this: ``Give me the ability 
to get some experience and I will show what I can do as a 
youth''. That is what I have done in my whole career and that is 
what I think we owe our youth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to congratulate the two previous government speakers, the hon. 
members for Brant and for Vaudreuil, for their very pertinent 
comments on youth employment. These two hon. members told 
us that they were willing to take a lot of steps and participate in a 
lot of discussions to allow our young people to work, and I 
congratulate them on their position.
<P>
	On the other hand, I thought that the hon. member for 
Vaudreuil gave a very evasive answer to the question posed by 
my Bloc Quebecois colleague concerning the decentralization 
of job training in Quebec. His response gave me the impression 
that he was not ready to transfer all this responsibility to the 
Quebec government. We are perfectly aware that the people who 
know best what our young people need are those closest to them. 
As a teacher I can say that to offer our young people an 
interesting lifestyle and lasting employment, we must bring 
them closer to the decision centres, namely the schools, or to the 
government that is more attuned to their needs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Once again, I think the important thing for the 
youth of today is to get the training that they so desperately 
need. I do not think it is really my job as a member of Parliament 
to decide who delivers that service. I think it is incumbent upon 
our government to make sure that it is delivered and done with 
the most efficient cost possible and that we respond to the 
aspirations of the youth of today. We should not get into another 
quasi-constitutional debate on who has jurisdiction over what.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going to 
address my comments this day to the speech from the throne on 
the matter of health.
<P>
	Let me first, however, make my traditional comments as a 
novice member of this House to thank the electors of my riding 
of Macleod who sent me to this august Chamber. Macleod is in 
southwest Alberta and extends from Calgary down to the U.S. 
border from the mountains to far out in the grain farming 
country. Macleod has a fine group of people I intend to represent 
as best I can.
<P>
	I would also like to thank my children for their sacrifice and 
my wife, Sue, for her support and the sacrifice that she is making 
in sending me here.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate the Speaker on his performance in 
the chair and pledge my support.
<P>
	I would finally like to thank the members who sit in this 
House, for I believe that they deserve some applause, each one 
of them, for serving this country by a contribution to public life.
<P>
	I am a novice in Ottawa. When I first came to Ottawa I was 
interested in looking at the call letters for the Ottawa airport, 
YOW. I am not sure what this means in French but in English 
YOW has an interesting connotation. I will leave one to imagine 
what my connotation was for the call letters for the Ottawa 
airport.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	What does the throne speech say about health? There are four 
items in the throne speech relating to health. The first is a 
commitment to the Canada Health Act and a rejection of 
measures that would undermine that act. The second suggested 
that there will be a national forum on the renewal of Canada's 
health system led by the Prime Minister. The third talks about a 
centre of excellence for women's health. The fourth is a 
pre-natal nutrition program for low income women. To these 
four statements I extend my compliments to the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	However, is this system sick? Is our health care system in 
trouble and does it indeed need renewal?
<P>
	Let me go through a few specific items on Canada's health 
care plan. First, Canada spends more on health care than any 
other country except the U.S. We are spending over $60 billion a 
year on our health care system, yet we are less healthy than 
many other countries that spend less. If we consider life 
expectancy, perinatal mortality and morbidity statistics then 
Canada does not stand at the top of the heap. Almost daily as 
well we read of bed closures, hospital lay offs and longer 
waiting lists for urgent surgery.
<P>
	Here is an interesting recent statistic that I read. In 1992 
Canada lost 689 highly trained physicians who emigrated from 
Canada. That is approximately the output of five medical 
schools. This is a resource that Canada should not be losing.
<P>
	In the short time I have available today I would like to suggest 
what I think is wrong with our medical system. Canada is truly 
in a debt crisis that threatens all our social programs. With over 
$30 billion spent on interest alone on the debt and with no end in 
sight our social programs are in serious jeopardy.
<P>
	There are many internal problems in health care that I could 
address, but those internal items are primarily a provincial 
responsibility. I will not speak of those at all today, but I will 
speak about what we can and I think must do federally.
<P>
	The Canada Health Act has five principles: universality; 
portability; accessibility; comprehensiveness; and public 
administration for necessary medical services. I underline the 
words: ``for necessary medical services''.
<P>
	When the program was started, established program financing 
provided 50 cents of every dollar back to the provinces for 
medical services. These funds have been allowed to slip until 
today when on average 29 cents on the dollar is all that the 
federal government is providing in cash transfers to the 
provinces. This slide of transfer payments must be stopped.
<P>
	Reformers say to the Government of Canada that the number 
one issue on health care is to stop the slide of transfers. That can 
be done at this federal level. In real dollar terms the transfers 
must be frozen.
<P>
	Second, I spoke of necessary medical services. Necessary, as I 
underline it, means a definition of what in our country is truly 
needed. Here I say that the federal government should be 
standing up and setting national standards for our health care. 
These national standards would define what is necessary and 
would also imply what is unnecessary.
<P>
	Might I suggest a few things that in my view are not necessary 
under the terms of universal health care: vasectomy reversal, 
cosmetic surgery, routine circumcision, tattoo removal and I 
could go on.
<P>
	Finally, another issue that in my view deserves federal 
government attention is the issue of medical malpractice. At the 
start of my career my medical malpractice premiums were $300. 
At this point in my medical career they are up to $3,400. I cannot 
say what engine drives medical costs like the threat of suits in 
Canada. Many tests are ordered and X-rays are ordered just to 
be on the safe side.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	In my view this is a spot where the federal government could 
step in. I personally favour a no fault medical malpractice 
system that could save untold millions of dollars.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="473"> 473 </A></B>
<P>
	The real threat to our social programs is the debt-deficit 
crisis. Ignoring this problem will surely see us on the path that 
New Zealand followed. It ignored its debt-deficit crisis and lost 
its health care system in one day. Now it has new measures like 
advertising on its ambulances simply to pay for the fuel.
<P>
	This should be a truly non-partisan question in my view and 
one that transcends all party lines since health care is number 
one for Canadians, Reformers and the member for Macleod.
<P>
	Just before taking my seat in this House I delivered by 
Caesarean section a 6-pound, 15-ounce baby boy, Zachary 
David Birney. As I held that little child in my arms and washed 
him off and handed him to a delighted father, nothing could be 
happier. That infant, however, owes to the federal treasury over 
$17,400. This debt is wrong. This mortgage on his future is 
immoral. We in this House are the guardians of that debt. I 
dedicate my service in this House to the physical and financial 
health of all the Zachary David Birneys.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In fairness to the hon. 
member for Macleod, I was simply indicating that he had 
approximately one minute left. If you have any other remarks or 
comments you would like to make in the one minute remaining, 
I will be glad to give you the floor. Otherwise we will go back to 
five minutes of questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate my colleague for Macleod on his maiden speech in 
the House. I understand that he is a very renowned surgeon. I do 
not know if that is an exaggeration or not, but I was told that.
<P>
	I was kind of curious when he mentioned the drain that 
Canada has had in its medical profession. That has been going 
on for a number of years. We invested in 600, 700 or 800 highly 
trained people and then lost them.
<P>
	Does he see any simple solution to that? For what reasons 
would highly trained Canadian professionals leave their country 
and go to a neighbouring country? There must be some 
attraction there. I am sure the hon. member for Macleod has 
wondered about that. I have wondered about it. I know that some 
of them come back. What did they go for in the first place? After 
a while did they get disillusioned? What brings them back to 
Canada? What could we be doing in our system to discourage 
them from going in the first place? Do we not have enough 
resources to accommodate them? Do we not pay them enough? I 
do not know. I am asking the question.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member for Macleod as a professional, a 
doctor, would like to give his interpretation of that problem. It is 
a big problem in this country to lose those highly trained, highly 
specialized and very expensive people from our society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to be called 
a very distinguished surgeon. Possibly only in my own mind am 
I so distinguished.
<P>
	To the member's question as to why there is a tremendous 
drain in our country on our medical resources, it is an increasing 
drain and the figures I gave are quite alarming. It was the highest 
number that had ever departed and this was in 1992.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Most of my colleagues who leave this country depart for one 
of three reasons. First, there is the financial reason. The pay is 
much better in the U.S.. The second reason that I hear is the 
bureaucratic meddling in their affairs. It is bureaucratically 
difficult in medicine. Third, there are freedom issues, taxation 
and so on.
<P>
	Primarily these issues revolve around money. The social 
standing of a physician in our country is still fairly secure so I do 
not think that is a major issue. I do not have the answer to this 
particular problem. I simply say that protecting our medical 
environment is very important and I hope to be able to do that 
somewhat in this House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must 
congratulate the hon. member on the quality of his message 
concerning health. We all know that health is very important. 
But, to stay in good health, we must offer favourable conditions. 
That is why we should keep our social programs.
<P>
	What I liked about the hon. member's speech is that he was 
suggesting that the government freeze transfer payments to the 
provinces. Not only freeze these payments but also try and find 
additional savings in other government expenditures.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member whether, in addition to health, he 
was also thinking of social housing. We all know that inadequate 
housing can have a detrimental effect on people's health and 
lead to massive expenditures for the state. These people are 
usually families and households where the main breadwinners 
are women. It is under such circumstances that children are 
ill-treated and become sick. I would ask the hon. member 
whether he considers the social housing issue as important as the 
health issue, so that we can continue to protect the health of 
Canadians?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member for his question.
<P>
	I mentioned that health care has the highest priority for 
Canadians and this is not something that I manufactured. This is 
something that I learned from studies. Social housing does not 
have the highest priority for all Canadians and so I would not put 
the same emphasis on it as I put on health care.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="474"> 474 </A></B>
<P>
	As we talk about cuts to government expenditures-one 
knows that Reformers are very fiscally conservative-we look 
upon all areas that can be reduced. By reducing in other areas 
and giving us the high priority ones, the most funds are 
available. I would not in this instance equate the two.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I understand there have 
been some discussions between the parties regarding a 
statement from the Minister of Transport. I wonder if the 
Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs would approach the 
Chair and maybe give us some indication.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> Mr. Speaker, my comments 
today will be addressing fisheries issues but first I would like to 
offer my thanks to the voters of Delta for allowing me the 
honour and privilege to represent them as their member of 
Parliament. I would especially like to thank those people who 
worked so hard to get me here. I am sure that all my colleagues 
would agree that none of us would be here if it was not for the 
love, patience and support of our families and for that I am truly 
grateful.
<P>
	I would like to thank my wife Sue, my stepdaughters Kristi 
and Erin, and most of all my little Carolyn. She is not talking to 
me on the phone these days. She does not seem to understand 
why I have to be away so much.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	At the other end of the scale, despite 24 years of ill informed 
advice from me, my son Martin remains a reasonable loving 
person of whom I am most proud and I thank for his support.
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not also thank my father, John 
Cummins, and my late mother. Life is a little easier when you 
can look at your mother and father and say with pride ``that is my 
mother and that is my father''. I have been able to do that. My 
parents gave their all so that my brother, Mike, my sisters, 
Colleen and Joan, and I could have the opportunities they could 
only dream of.
<P>
	We in this House should dedicate ourselves to the task of 
ensuring that the parents of every child in this country can 
provide the opportunity for their children to realize their 
dreams.
<P>
	On a personal level, I believe that in building a better Canada 
we should not lessen our efforts in the area of medical research. 
Having lost loved ones to cancer and to Lou Gehrig's disease, I 
believe that no matter how hard things get we must always 
dedicate the necessary funds to find cures that would eradicate 
diseases such as these.
<P>
	Might I also take this opportunity to congratulate all members 
of the House on their election. If I may I would like to share 
three thoughts with them. First, remember who you are; second, 
remember why you are here; and third, above all else remember 
who sent you here.
<P>
	I represent the people of the federal constituency of Delta. It 
includes the municipality of Delta and a small chunk of the 
neighbouring municipality of Surrey. My riding is a desirable 
piece of real estate bordered on the north by the south arm of the 
Fraser River and on the west by the Straits of Georgia.
<P>
	The temperature today in Delta is about 8 degrees and that is 
just one reason why I am going to be leaving here a little later 
today.
<P>
	There are many reasons why the people of Delta elected me, 
the least of which was my personal popularity. I was elected 
because the people of Delta supported the policies of my party. 
They accepted as reasonable and desirable, and indeed 
necessary, my party's suggestion for parliamentary reform 
including an elected, equal and effective Senate. I am sure the 
people voted for us because of our desire to change the 
extravagant pension plan for MPs.
<P>
	They supported my party's deficit reduction package and our 
calls for the reform of the criminal justice system. Many people 
in Delta voted for us because of our support for the continuation 
of two viable airlines in this country. Many voters supported us 
because of their concern over the future of west coast fisheries.
<P>
	Pacific fisheries products account for 25 per cent of the total 
value of Canadian fish products. Fishing is, depending on the 
yardstick, the third or fourth largest industry in British 
Columbia. Although more than half of British Columbia's fish 
processing jobs are concentrated in the Vancouver area as a 
proportion of the local economic activity the industry is 
relatively more important in Prince Rupert, Port Hardy, 
Ucluelet, Tofino and other coastal communities.
<P>
	To date we are encouraged by the actions of the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans and support his decision to break off 
negotiations over the Pacific Salmon Treaty. We have sent a firm 
signal to the Americans that we will not continue to pay the tab 
to conserve, enhance and manage Canadian fish stocks for the 
benefit of American fishermen.
<P>
	Recently, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans announced his 
intention to introduce legislation to extend Canada's coastal 
jurisdiction on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks. In our view, 
article 116 of the 1982 convention on the law of the sea gives the 
minister, gives us, the right to enforce our fisheries regulations 
to the edge of the continental shelf.
<P>
	We were very pleased to see the minister make clear to 
members of the European Community that Canada will no 
longer stand idly by while foreign draggers continue to pillage 
our fish stocks.
<P>
	The minister is taking a tough approach on this crisis and if 
and when he decides to take tough action we will be there with 
him.
<P>
	Those who would test our resolve should be duly warned.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="475"> 475 </A></B>
<P>
	We on this side of the House support a Canada in which 
everyone is treated equally in the Constitution and the law 
regardless of race, language, creed or culture.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	The aboriginal fishing strategy imposed on the fisheries on 
both coasts by the past government is an example of the exact 
opposite. The creation of a separate commercial aboriginal 
fishery was not demanded in the Sparrow decision of the 
Supreme Court as some would have us believe.
<P>
	Furthermore, last June the British Columbia Court of Appeal 
found that an aboriginal right to a commercial fishery did not 
exist. One would then have to ask why this unfair and 
discriminatory policy was foisted on the commercial fishing 
industry in 1992 only five months after the then fisheries 
minister, Mr. Crosbie, stated that he would never commercialize 
the native food fishery on the Fraser River.
<P>
	Was it because of the constitutional negotiations that were 
going on at that time? Was the fishery simply a carrot to 
encourage native leaders to drop their demands to be considered 
a distinct society? Was the AFS put in place simply to encourage 
native support for what was to become the Charlottetown 
accord? One can only wonder.
<P>
	This separate native commercial fishery was set up despite 
the fact that aboriginal people make up only 3 per cent to 4 per 
cent of British Columbia's population. Yet, they hold 20 per cent 
to 25 per cent of all commercial fishing licences in British 
Columbia and their share of the commercial catch is estimated 
to be 25 per cent to 30 per cent.
<P>
	Continuation of this ill considered policy will only serve to 
drive Canadians apart. It will not and cannot achieve any of its 
stated goals.
<P>
	In 1969, the Trudeau government white paper echoed the 
principle in the famous Brown versus Kansas City Board of 
Education decision that ended official discrimination against 
blacks in the United States school system.
<P>
	It said: ``you cannot have separate but equal. To be separate is 
to be inherently unequal''.
<P>
	I urge the Prime Minister to use the insight and wisdom he 
displayed then, as minister of Indian affairs and the minister 
responsible for this white paper, to put an end to the aboriginal 
fishing strategy.
<P>
	On another point, we fully support all efforts by the 
government to put the thousands of east coast fishermen back to 
work. We know the seriousness of the problem and would urge 
the government to listen to those people who are affected, those 
people who fish and understand the problem. These people have 
valuable knowledge and experience that would benefit the 
minister in any future decisions he may make.
<P>
	Finally, we understand that being minister of fisheries today 
is not an easy job. Indeed, some people would suggest that it is 
punishment for something one has done wrong. However, 
having spent some time with the new minister, I am sure he has 
done nothing wrong and appears to have the best interests of 
fishermen and Canadians in his heart.
<P>
	We will not always agree with the government or the minister 
of fisheries, and at those times we will let them know loud and 
clear. In those instances where we do agree, no matter how 
controversial the stand, we will be there firmly beside him.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Mr. Speaker, following consultations with 
the opposition parties, I think that there would be agreement to 
revert to Statements by Ministers, so that the Minister of 
Transport could make a short important statement.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Would there be 
unanimous agreement to revert to Statements by Ministers?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to thank my colleagues on all sides of the House for the 
unanimous consent granted in order that I may make this 
announcement.
<P>
	I am announcing that, as Minister of Transport, I intend to 
designate Air Canada as the second carrier to Japan following 
completion of negotiations with the Japanese government. 
Under the current Air Services Agreement between Canada and 
Japan, Canada has the authority to designate more than one 
carrier to serve that country. We have advised the Japanese 
government that we want to resume air negotiations as soon as 
possible.

	On September 1, 1994, a new airport is to open in Osaka, 
Japan's largest air transport market after Tokyo, of course. With 
a population of over 20 million, the Osaka region offers 
important opportunities for Canadian carriers in the Asian 
market.
<P>
	A number of desirable landing and takeoff slots at Kansai 
Airport have been provisionally reserved for Canada. The 
federal government must now move quickly to finalize the 
details of an agreement to use these valuable slots.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="476"> 476 </A></B>
<P>
	The Japanese air transport market is large and profitable. It is 
in Canada's best interest that our two major carriers have a 
presence there. Canadian Airlines International will continue to 
have exclusive access to the largest Japanese centre, Tokyo.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Air Canada stated yesterday its clear and unequivocal 
undertaking that all litigation that prevents Canadian Airlines 
from closing its deal with AMR Corporation will be stopped 
immediately. Air Canada's announcement yesterday was an 
important one for restoring stability in the airline industry.
<P>
	I understand that today's decision is a difficult one to accept 
for Canadian Airlines. However, I am looking forward to a new 
era for the airline industry in Canada.
<P>
	Our government is committed to a viable, competitive airline 
industry. Canada's two great airlines can now get on with their 
business. They are in a position to move forward with 
confidence into the future.
<P>
	I could not let this occasion pass without expressing my 
sincerest gratitude to Rhys Eyton of Canadian Airlines and to 
Hollis Harris of Air Canada for having been able to move with 
great courage toward this resolution of a problem that has 
plagued the Canadian airline industry for far too long.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before proceeding, I 
simply want to advise all members that having reverted to 
statements by ministers I will recognize a spokesperson from 
both the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party and extend a 
duration equal to the minister's intervention.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, like 
many Quebecers and Canadians, I was very glad yesterday when 
the media announced the end of the conflict between Air Canada 
and Canadian International. This news shows light at the end of 
the tunnel, which is good for both air carriers and their 
employees.
<P>
	I am also pleased with the statement by the Minister of 
Transport on allowing Air Canada access to the Osaka airport. 
However, since this airport is not a hub for the Japanese market, 
the Official Opposition would have liked the government to end 
the exclusive rights which Canadian Airlines International has 
to the Tokyo airport.
<P>
	It is essential to promote competition, for the good of 
consumers, especially in a growing market like Tokyo.
<P>
	We hope that the government will recognize Air Canada's 
needs and that these will be taken into consideration in bilateral 
discussions which the government intends to begin to settle the 
question of Hong Kong and China in the near future, for the sake 
of many jobs in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the end of litigation is a positive thing both for the aviation 
industry and the Canadian travelling public. It might also be 
mentioned that it will not break the hearts of government that it 
will not have to get further involved in this dispute. That having 
been said, it is my opinion that the government has been 
involved in Air Canada's withdrawal from the litigation process.
<P>
	I believe that the announcement by the Minister of Transport 
is as a result of a unilateral deal between his department and Air 
Canada. I have many concerns if these types of arrangements are 
being made without proper input from all the major parties 
concerned. The deal appears to be done. I am not convinced it is 
in the best interests for Canadian aviation, however it is done.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	With the dispute between Air Canada and Canadian Airlines 
ended, both airlines should now be proceeding to build their 
respective companies. This is done by competing with foreign 
carriers, not with each other. Air Canada has a major portion of 
the market in Europe and the U.S., and Canadian has always had 
a major portion of the Orient. That balance has now been shifted.
<P>
	I call on the minister to confirm that it will go no further, to 
pledge that there are no further deals to hand over Hong Kong or 
the People's Republic of China to Air Canada. The deal has been 
made. It is now time for the government to get out of the 
manipulation process and let free enterprise operate as it should.
<P>

	The House resumed consideration of the motion for an 
address to His Excellency the Governor General in reply to his 
Speech at the opening of the session.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
most pleased to rise on this occasion and add my congratulations 
on your appointment to the Chair of this House.
<P>
	First I would like to thank the electors of Brandon-Souris 
riding for allowing me the distinct pleasure to serve them in this 
Chamber. I would further add my congratulations to all the hon. 
members who were elected in the most recent election.
<P>
	On a personal level, I wish to thank most sincerely my wife, 
Karen, in Virden, Manitoba, and my daughters Corleen, in 
Edmonton, Alberta, Richelle in Victoria, British Columbia, and 
Lindsey in Winnipeg, Manitoba, who have all shown 
unwavering support. As one can see, my family is well 
represented by the multi-party process in this House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="477"> 477 </A></B>
<P>
	Like most of my colleagues, I would not be here without the 
presence of a strong and effective campaign team. To all of you, 
a team too numerous to mention individually, I salute you and I 
thank you.
<P>
	I come from the riding of Brandon-Souris which is nestled in 
the extreme southwest corner of Manitoba. Most of my staunch 
supporters would never dream to have lived long enough to have 
seen the vanishing of the political support enjoyed by two of my 
predecessors, Mr. Walter Dinsdale, who served and represented 
the riding for over 30 years, followed by Dr. Lee Clark, a 
member for almost nine years up to and including the 34th 
Parliament.
<P>
	My riding was colonized in the 1880s as the CPR spawned a 
string of towns across southern Manitoba. At approximately 
16-mile intervals towns sprang up, roughly the same, along 
Brandon, Kemnay, Alexander, Oak Lake, Virden and Elkhorn on 
the northerly end and a second branch line of Crystal City, 
Killarney, Boissevain, Deloraine and Melita at the south.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the towns in general conformed to the 
CPR square mile survey system with 18 blocks to the mile. 
Grain elevators and lumber sheds were on one side of the track 
and the residential area on the other. Fairgrounds and stockyards 
were on the extremities of these hamlets and schools were 
located several blocks back so as not to disturb or endanger the 
children in attendance.
<P>
	The colonists were largely French, Belgian, Scottish, Irish 
and English, with a predominance of the latter three. They were 
experienced farmers from Ontario who had capital and 
equipment and who were well educated and extremely 
self-confident. They soon came to dominate the province 
politically, economically and socially, a domination that some 
would argue has lasted to this day.
<P>
	My riding is approximately 100 kilometres square in 
dimension. It has roughly 70,000 people, 45,000 of its citizens 
residing in the city of Brandon and 25,000 to 30,000 outside. We 
are not without unemployment, recession, high costs, low prices 
and a shrinking rural economy and population. Like most rural 
Canadians we are optimistic about our future with a new 
government in power, a government committed to rebuilding 
our economy and the revitalization of the elements that support 
our quality of life: jobs, roads, technology, education, personal 
integrity and social security.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	The riding is home to numerous significant components, not 
the least of which is CFB Shilo, the home station of the Royal 
Regiment Canadian Artillery of Canada and the best artillery 
range in Canada. Shilo is the seventh largest community in the 
province of Manitoba and the fourth largest employer. To 
illustrate the breadth of activity in Shilo are the peacekeeping 
duties in Cyprus and the IRCHA and augmentation of the UN 
forces in former Yugoslavia. Shilo also serves as a  training 
centre annually for 5,000 armoured troops of our NATO ally, the 
Federal Republic of Germany.
<P>
	In Brandon-Souris we incorporate two aboriginal 
communities, Sioux Valley and Oak Lake, both of which are 
well positioned to assume greater responsibility under 
self-government.
<P>
	At the most southerly end of this constituency is the 
International Peace Gardens located 10 miles south of 
Boissevain. This is a spacious park and a recreational centre 
dedicated to the peaceful relations between Canada and the 
United States and is part of the longest undefended border in the 
world.
<P>
	Brandon University is another important component in the 
riding. It is an outstanding facility and I am proud to say it is my 
alma mater. It has a tradition of academic and social service 
spanning over 100 years and is well represented in this House by 
the Hon. Stanley Knowles, our chancellor emeritus.
<P>
	Brandon University is home to the Bobcats, three times 
national university basketball champions, and is the producer of 
the Canadian Journal of Native Studies and a new innovative 
partnership program in education and business administration.
<P>
	<I>Maclean's</I> magazine called Brandon one of the ten best cities 
in which to live, an observation which I would extend to the 
other communities I mentioned earlier.
<P>
	There are several issues of major concern to the 
Brandon-Souris constituents.
<P>
	Agriculture is the most important industry in Manitoba. It has 
diversified greatly in the value added process. There are strong 
views about the intent to expand or diminish the role of the 
wheat board and allow more choices to market products on a 
niche basis.
<P>
	Every town and city in Brandon-Souris has a list of 
infrastructure projects that are necessary in rejuvenating our 
rural economy. The city of Brandon is proposing bridge, water 
and flood protection projects that are desperately needed. Other 
specific infrastructure projects from the rural components of my 
riding are also being submitted.
<P>
	Communication and transportation infrastructure will 
increase the job opportunities and ability of rural Canadians to 
compete internationally and be employed locally. 
Brandon-Souris is the only riding in Manitoba that has an oil 
resource. Oil has been a key player in our local economy, 
particularly in my home town of Virden, Manitoba.
<P>
	Brandon-Souris also wants to develop a stronger tourism 
base aimed at its natural attractions and world class sporting 
events. I am honoured to say that Brandon-Souris will be 
playing host during the life of this Parliament to national and 
world curling competitions, Canada games and world junior 
baseball.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="478"> 478 </A></B>
<P>
	In the area of transportation, another concern we have is the 
absence of air service and VIA rail service. This is of major 
concern to all rural and city residents of Brandon-Souris. We 
must try to re-establish the ties that first brought our country 
together. Also the high cost of western grain transportation is an 
item of concern.
<P>
	The state of our postal services and how they affect rural 
Canadians, specifically senior rural Canadians, is an area which 
should be investigated before any further cutbacks take place.
<P>
	I come to this House after completing a 33-year teaching 
career mainly at the high school level and I have the greatest 
empathy and respect for the students in this country. I wish to 
pledge my efforts to them in creating a long term bursary and 
student loan program which currently is not addressed in 
government policy.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	As a proud father of three wonderful daughters I am and will 
continue to be sensitive to women's issues relative to 
employment, health and equity.
<P>
	As a former educator I still get involved in school visitations. 
I was at Virden Collegiate on January 6 and met with a 
wonderful grade nine class. I subsequently received a letter 
from a student of that class, Leslie Bunn. It somewhat shows 
how I feel about being an MP and working for the betterment of 
students:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Mr. McKinnon:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When you came and spoke to my class last Thursday you answered a lot of my 
questions I had concerning your position as MP. You made me realize some 
important facts about your position.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I realize that being an MP isn't all that easy. You are away from your family 
and travelling lots. You are in early meetings and it isn't easy to keep it up. It 
made me think that if I ever did become involved in politics, it would be a rough 
road to hold.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You told us the amount of money you make and I thought it was a lot. Then as 
you explained the sacrifices you make and will have to make I realized it still 
may be a lot of money, but it didn't seem quite as bad as before. This also made 
me think that if I became a politician I would be well paid but it would not be too 
much out of reason.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I think it wouldn't be so bad living close to Ottawa, but it would be horrible 
living somewhere in British Columbia where I would be doing nothing but 
flying back and forth.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Even after all the sacrifices I heard you have to make, I don't think I would 
mind being an MP.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Leslie Bunn, Virden, Manitoba.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the constituents of 
Brandon-Souris and to work toward bringing about dignity to 
rural Canada. My constituents have sent me, the first Liberal in 
42 years, to represent Brandon-Souris in the House of 
Commons, to be part of the Liberal team, to help solve the 
problems caused by eight years of failed economic policy.
<P>
	My constituents want to be part of the new vision of Canada, a 
vision which includes all of the wide and diverse mosaic which 
is Canada today, a vision which includes jobs for Canadians, a 
vision of equitable regional development, a vision of renewed 
integrity in government, a vision of economic renewal and 
social security and finally, a vision of a safe Canada. In short, it 
is a Liberal vision of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
for Brandon-Souris, in Manitoba, focused on the infrastructure 
program. I would like to ask him the following: Does he not 
think that it would be a bit cumbersome if the federal, provincial 
and municipal governments all sat down to set priorities for an 
infrastructure project, for roads, sewers and small bridges for 
example? Does he not think it would make management a bit too 
cumbersome if civil servants from Ottawa were to meet with 
their provincial and municipal colleagues to make decisions on 
such a project? To me, that seems to go against management 
efficiency.
<P>
	We all know that our country is faced with an enormous debt, 
which exceeds the 500-billion mark, and we all realize that if 
the federal government gets involved in such a project, it will 
become more difficult to manage and a high percentage of the 
expenditures will go for management, or should I say 
mismanagement.
<P>
	I would like to know, just like Quebec wants to know, how the 
federal government will manage to hand the money over to the 
provinces, who consider the municipalities a bit like their equals 
and work with them to review various projects and set priorities, 
and refrain from interfering, making the management of the 
infrastructure project more complicated and boosting cost of the 
management.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for asking 
the question regarding infrastructure. In my preamble I left out 
my personal involvement. I did serve as mayor of a community 
of a town of 3,000. I have had some background in that area.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	I would say to my worthy colleague that in many respects in 
my experience the ability of a municipality to go it alone on 
some of the projects would be very difficult to start with. If we 
can get other financial assistance from more senior levels of 
government, it will make many projects extremely viable.
<P>
	Second, in terms of administration, those costs are certainly 
going to be there no matter who does it. I would suggest that 
there is not the perceived advantaged of simply handing the 
money to the lower levels of government and allowing them to 
run with the ball. I think we are best served as a country when we 
have some standardization in terms of the administration and the 
allocation of projects.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="479"> 479 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, first my 
congratulations to the member for Brandon-Souris for his first 
remarks in the House. It was an excellent speech.
<P>
	My question concerns the summation of his speech where he 
told us about his Liberal vision for Canada which included 
equality, regional development and various other things.
<P>
	One of the things that he omitted-I hope he forgot-was to 
include the fact that Canada is a nation of small business people 
and that the engine of growth is from small entrepreneurs and 
medium sized businesses in this country. We have a history of 
entrepreneurial spirit and capitalism in this country which has 
brought this country to the stage it is at today. We must 
recognize that small business and entrepreneurs in larger 
businesses are the engines of growth. That is where the jobs are 
going to come from rather than just more programs such as 
infrastructure programs.
<P>
	I would ask the member for Brandon-Souris whether he is 
willing to recognize that capitalism and the entrepreneurial 
spirit are the job creation factors in this country rather than 
Liberal policies such as infrastructure programs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. friend for his 
question. I would suggest that yes I do recognize and yes I do see 
a strong assistance to our nation if government and small 
business work together on projects. I agree wholeheartedly that 
small business is the engine.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> I want to 
congratulate this speaker, along with all my other colleagues 
who have done this for the last few days, on his appointment. I 
want to congratulate the Speaker on his election. I know he will 
serve us extremely well.
<P>
	At this juncture as well in Parliament it is very appropriate for 
me to acknowledge the political forces that returned me to 
Parliament as the member for Scarborough-Rouge River. I 
want to acknowledge all those who participated in the process. I 
thank certainly those who worked selflessly for me in our 
campaign, but I also want to acknowledge all the other 
candidates and their workers in a way that reflects my pride in a 
political system that really works.
<P>
	A throne speech is an attempt by a government in Parliament 
to articulate its legislative goals and its policy goals and it 
hopefully does it in a way that reflects what the electorate wants.
<P>
	In this particular case as we open up Parliament, of course the 
agenda of the throne speech has no excuse in the world for not 
reflecting what the electorate wants. My leader, our Prime 
Minister, and all of our members are only days and weeks away 
from the front doors and meeting places of Canadians. We have 
absolutely no excuse for not knowing what they want. I suppose 
it is fair to say that my government has no excuse for not having 
a reasonable game plan in addressing that.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Today I would like to make an attempt at relating my 
government's throne speech to the issues and matters that were 
put to me in the campaign by my constituents. I am happy to say 
that the throne speech does address almost all of those issues and 
matters. I would like to take some time to elucidate on that just a 
bit.
<P>
	First, the biggest issue that my constituents put to me was the 
issue of jobs and the economy. That is clearly the thrust of this 
government's throne speech and, as it will unfold in the weeks to 
come, its legislative and policy agenda.
<P>
	Our economy was hit very badly by a recession in and about 
the year 1990. In addition to that, we had a free trade adjustment 
which took a toll. We knew it would take a toll. Perhaps it took a 
greater toll on the economy than we thought but we adjusted. I 
think we have been through the bulk of that. There may be more 
to come but I think we have seen the worst of it.
<P>
	Second, monetary policy overshoot, as it has been called, 
describes the zero inflation target that the Bank of Canada had 
for a period of time under the previous government. It did not 
meet its zero per cent. It never really had a hope of meeting its 
zero per cent.
<P>
	Chasing that goal has slowed down our economy even more 
than it would otherwise have done. Canadians everywhere have 
paid a significant price for that.
<P>
	In 1994 there has been a change. The economic fundamentals 
are much improved. We have low inflation. We have low interest 
rates. The worst of the free trade adjustment I hope is over. 
Balancing that we have the new trade opportunities provided by 
the free trade agreement and the North American Free Trade 
Agreement.
<P>
	My constituents are very much waiting for the new jobs that 
this recovery will bring. While no government really runs the 
economy out of its hip pocket no government can hope to do that 
because the economy is driven by many forces in the private 
sector.
<P>
	It is clear that my constituents will judge this government on 
how well it fosters the economic growth for Canada in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="480"> 480 </A></B>
<P>
months to come. They are watching and waiting. I believe that 
my government can do the right thing. It along with the 
economic forces at play, will deliver.
<P>
	My government has already discussed and put into motion an 
infrastructure program, the residential rehabilitation assistance 
Program. We have yet to begin work on the youth service corps. 
That will happen shortly.
<P>
	In the longer run we will focus on fostering the small and 
medium sized business area. We want to see improved access to 
capital. I was pleased to see a modest response by the banks and 
the newspapers over the last couple of days.
<P>
	Our Liberal caucus in opposition met with the banks last May. 
I think they know the writing is on the wall. They will either 
have to serve small and medium sized business, as they have 
tried to do for a century, but they have to do it better. If they fail 
to do it without stating anything specific-I am merely a humble 
backbencher here-Canadians and this government will have to 
do what must be done to ensure that small and medium sized 
business have the financial tools they need to grow.
<P>
	We want to improve the access of small business to 
technology and to increase their participation in research and 
development. We also want to reduce the regulatory burden. In 
all of these objectives I know we can make substantial progress 
and have some success.
<P>
	The second major issue was the deficit and taxation. I cannot 
do the issue justice. Every person in this House knows exactly 
what we are talking about. It is a debt in the vicinity of $500 
billion and a deficit way over $40 billion.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	My government and our finance minister is committed to 
taking hold of it. It is not like there were not other ministers who 
tried in the past. I just think Canadians believe now and we 
believe that we cannot afford to fail now. We cannot fail to grab 
hold of that.
<P>
	We must reduce spending in a strategic fashion. We must 
increase revenues without building in new taxes. We can only 
increase our revenues by having growth in the economy. The two 
are very much tied together.
<P>
	There is also room for some modest growth in revenues by 
reducing what are called tax expenditures. Those are the field of 
deductions available under the Income Tax Act. We are 
committed to those goals.
<P>
	The third issue of major significance was crime and public 
safety. I would note, and I am sure other members have noted, 
the relatively few number of references in the throne speech to 
this significant Canadian issue. It is mostly urban in context but 
the references are clearly there. My government is committed to 
introducing measures to enhance community safety and crime 
prevention.
<P>
	There is a lot more to that issue than that one sentence. We 
must reduce the incidence of crime. We must reduce the fear of 
crime. We must also admit that crime is like a penalty tax levied 
on our society for our  failure to effectively manage our human 
resource and we have plans to address these issues.
<P>
	The last question was one dealing with immigration levels. 
This is a question that will have to be debated in this Parliament. 
I do not know when the debate will begin but I assure you, Mr. 
Speaker, that other colleagues and I will want to debate that in 
Parliament.
<P>
	I am proud to serve my constituents in this place. I look 
forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the House 
to achieve these and the many other goals that Canadians have 
placed with us in trust for this 35th Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to acknowledge the presentation by the hon. member today. 
I listened with a little bit of concern about the lack of specifics 
that he brought to the issue of crime.
<P>
	I know that when I ran during the election we had a very 
specific platform for dealing with issues of crime such as the 
criminal justice system and the parole board. Just in the last 
couple of days we have seen some very serious issues on this 
very subject.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to please, if he could, clearly 
specify for me some of the areas of change that his government 
intends to bring forth in this 35th Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
question. What she is looking for quite reasonably is a list of 
particulars, a good solid list of specific initiatives that can be 
brought to bear to address the issue of public safety and crime.
<P>
	She has already noted some of the generic hot buttons, if I 
could put it that way. Let me acknowledge right away that the 
references in the throne speech are purely generic and in fact I 
read one sentence that perhaps covers a couple of pages of 
particulars. It is not possible to put into a throne speech all of the 
particulars that one might want.
<P>
	However, I note that the whole area of sentencing is yet to be 
dealt with by a federal statute. There has never been a 
codification of sentencing in this country. That is still to be 
done. There was a bill in the last Parliament. It was consensually 
not proceeded with because members from both sides believed it 
was not a good and effective bill.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	I would look for a sentencing bill relatively soon. I would look 
for a bill to modify elements of the Young Offenders Act. All of 
the areas have been discussed publicly. What the justice 
minister will bring forward remains to be seen. I hope the hon. 
member will create her own list and send it immediately to the 
justice minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="481"> 481 </A></B>
<P>
	There needs to be changes in the Parole Act, the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act. We need to pass very specific 
amendments to the area involved. Most of it involves 
accountability.
<P>
	A very interesting and useful meeting was held during the last 
Parliament between the outgoing chairman of the National 
Parole Board and members of the justice committee. The 
chairman had to get the permission of the minister to appear 
before the committee to tell us personally what he believed 
should be done for the parole board to better perform its job. He 
spoke to us very frankly at that meeting which was held in 
camera but all of what he said was duly noted.
<P>
	We have covered the Young Offenders Act, the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act. There are elements of the Criminal 
Code that need to be refined. We are just beginning to deal with 
long run strategic crime prevention. Regrettably it requires a bit 
of money to get into this area but it is a long running investment 
on a long running basis to make everybody in society a 
stakeholder and reduce the tendencies to break the law.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the throne speech raises the employment issue in a very 
vague way. The government also tells us that it does not want to 
discuss the constitutional issue and will certainly not propose 
possible solutions. Our party, on the contrary, constantly raises 
this issue in the House of Commons. We do so because it is at the 
root of all the debates on every other issue.
<P>
	We cannot seriously discuss the problem of employment 
without asking who has the power to act and who controls the 
political and economic levers necessary to tackle 
unemployment. Unemployment is the major problem, not only 
in my riding, but also for the whole region of Montreal.
<P>
	The Liberals tell us that the constitutional issue must be set 
aside if we want Montreal to develop and get a new start. 
However, the municipal authorities of Montreal came to the 
following conclusion during the hearings of the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission, and I quote: ``Not only is the 
constitutional status quo obsolete, but it has disqualified itself, 
not only for Quebec, but for the rest of Canada.'' The municipal 
authorities in Montreal came to that conclusion because, as they 
said, and I quote again: ``In the current political context, 
Montreal finds it difficult to have access to the levers which 
would enable it to contribute the way it could to the development 
of Quebec and of Canada.''
<P>
	Thus the city of Montreal proposed the adoption of a national 
policy for Quebec, a policy which demands the patriation of just 
about every jurisdiction for Quebec. Two solutions were 
possible: either a sweeping reform of federalism or a sovereign 
Quebec. It has now been demonstrated that Canadian federalism 
cannot be renewed. As for the status quo, we agree with the 
municipal authorities that it is harmful to Montreal. And,  Mr. 
Speaker, uncertainty and the refusal to decide are the worst 
possible things for investors and for the economy in general. 
The brief submitted by the city specified that the choices made 
by Quebec would be endorsed by Montreal. Quebec has only one 
option left, sovereignty, and the future of Montreal is contingent 
upon that choice.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	We must talk about the future and we must change the present 
situation. Let us not forget that Montreal was once the 
metropolis of Canada, as well as the industrial, financial and 
banking centre of the country.
<P>
	Today, Montreal is the poverty capital of Canada. Thirty per 
cent of Montreal families live below the poverty level, and that 
is simply unacceptable. But does this mean that until Quebecers 
can democratically decide to have their own country, there is 
nothing to do? We, Bloc Quebecois members, do not think so, 
but it seems that the government does.
<P>
	Yet, when the Liberals were in the Opposition, there were 
quite vocal when it came to defend the interests of the citizens of 
Montreal. One need only recall their fight against Bill C-113 on 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	The Liberal members from Montreal were telling us then, and 
rightly so, that the combined effects of the unemployment 
insurance reform of 1990 and that of 1993 would cost, over five 
years, close to $490 million to UI claimants in the Montreal 
region, adding that those figures did not take into account the 
impact of past and future employee contribution increases.
<P>
	And what have the Liberals done now that they form the 
government? They were quick to increase those contributions 
without cancelling the anti-social measures of the previous 
government. The two governments are like two peas in a pod. 
And let us not forget also that those $490 million which are not 
being distributed to claimants is also money which is not being 
poured back into the Montreal economy.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development told us that 
all social programs will be reviewed in the next two years. The 
men and women who live in poverty in Montreal cannot wait two 
years. They need help now and they demand it immediately. 
There are solutions to the problem and the Liberals know those 
solutions.
<P>
	For example, there is the Program for Older Worker 
Adjustment or POWA, which is a program for older workers who 
have been laid off in large numbers following plant closures. To 
be eligible for that program, the workers in Montreal must have 
worked for companies employing more than 100 people. Why 
should it not be 20 employees as is the case in the vast majority 
of regions? After all, this is what the Liberals demanded when 
they formed the Opposition.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="482"> 482 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberals now form the government but they are simply 
pursuing the policy of the Conservatives. No, the appropriate 
solutions are not to be found in the throne speech. Rather, those 
solutions were put forward by the Liberals when they were in the 
Opposition.
<P>
	Let us take social housing. How many times have I heard the 
Liberal members from the Montreal region criticize the decision 
made by the Conservatives to eliminate all forms of subsidies in 
the social housing sector? Yet, no corrective measures are 
proposed in the throne speech. The lack of such measures means 
that all the social housing projects for the city of Montreal are in 
jeopardy.
<P>
	I also think of those grants in lieu of taxes, which the federal 
government froze last year. The Montreal urban community 
criticized that decision, just like the Liberals did when they 
formed the Opposition, because it translates into a shortfall of 
close to $10 million for the taxpayers of the Montreal urban 
community. What are the Liberals proposing now that they form 
the government? Nothing. Is this not a very bad example to give 
to taxpayers in general? How can a government which is a bad 
risk demand of taxpayers that they behave like good citizens? 
Should that not be an easy decision to make? And this is not a 
measure that would not require any constitutional reform, I 
assume.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Does this government realize that, to quote the Minister of 
Finance and member for LaSalle-Émard, a Montreal riding, 
Montreal as the economic heartland and major engine for 
development must be put back on track, because otherwise, its 
economic decline will signal that of Quebec.
<P>
	Is remaining silent on the high-speed train project going to 
help Montreal? This project was an opportunity for Quebec and 
Canada to get a head start in this new technology. We must not 
forget that the North American market for this type of train is 
said to be worth more than $200 billion over the next 20 years. 
This means spin-offs totalling an estimated 120,000 
person-years in strategic industrial sectors. It would be a smart 
way to fight unemployment, because these are durable jobs 
involving advanced technology. The project also means tax 
revenues in the range of $1.8 billion during the construction 
period alone. Would reducing the deficit by increasing tax 
revenues not be better than taking money away from the neediest 
in our society? There would also be indirect economic spin-offs 
for the Quebec-Windsor corridor, in services, trade and, of 
course, tourism. In fact, this kind of transportation is available 
at rates that are cheaper than the conventional air fare, and it is 
also environmentally friendly.
<P>
	Do we need more consultation on top of the many studies that 
have already been done and which all agree the project is viable? 
This government seems to be suffering from acute 
``consultationitis'', a disease that was already endemic among 
the Tories. After striking the  Conservatives, the Spicer 
syndrome is now spreading among the Liberals. Nevertheless, 
the high-speed train project meets all the criteria for genuine 
economic renewal aimed at the future.
<P>
	The same applies to the conversion of our military industry. 
We all agree that the international situation has changed. The 
cold war is over. The role of Canada's armed forces must be 
reviewed. The Bloc Quebecois proposed a 25 per cent cut in the 
budget of the Department of National Defence. However, such a 
decision must be accompanied by a policy for conversion of the 
military industrial complex, as was done by President Clinton in 
the United States, and by France and Great Britain. The issue of 
converting our defence industry directly concerns Montreal as a 
major centre for the production of defence equipment. And 
Montreal has also become increasingly dependent on contracts 
from the Department of National Defence.
<P>
	However, we must not forget that Quebec never received its 
fair share of government spending on the equipment 
procurement, defence payrolls and maintenance of military 
bases. The government certainly did the right thing when it 
cancelled the helicopter contract. It is no good wasting money, 
in Quebec or anywhere else. However, the Bloc Quebecois asked 
and is still asking the government to compensate for the 
cancellation of this contract by injecting the same amount of 
money in military conversion and advanced technology 
projects; two sectors that create durable jobs. Montreal cannot 
afford to lose the jobs of the future because the military 
industrial complex is shrinking. The government must table an 
industrial conversion plan, as it promised during the last 
election campaign.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	I would like to give you another example of the harmful effect 
of the Canadian federal system on the development of Montreal: 
the environmental co-operation commission under NAFTA. 
Montreal, must we point it out, has acquired through its 
academic institutions significant know-how in the field of 
environment. Let us not forget the agreement on the ozone layer 
or the role played by the mayor of Montreal at the Rio Summit. 
Yet, the Minister of the Environment hesitates, pussyfoots, 
strikes a committee-one more, Mr. Speaker-instead of 
making the right decision and setting up this centre in Montreal. 
Are we going to see a remake, a repetition of the stupid decision 
to establish the head office of the Canadian Network of 
Toxicology Centres in Guelph, Ontario, when the critical mass 
of knowledge in that area is in Montreal. The same kind of 
decision was made about the banking centre. The Montreal 
business community had expected an international banking 
centre to be established in Montreal, but the federal government 
decided that there should also be one in Toronto and another in 
Vancouver. In the end, there was to be one centre and three 
peripheral centres. This a somewhat geometric expression  of 
the Canadian federal system. Imagine that, one centre with three 
peripheral centres. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="483"> 483 </A></B>
<P>
banking centres are not working effectively, not in Vancouver, 
not in Toronto and not in Montreal.
<P>
	Basically, nothing in this throne speech meets the needs of 
Montreal, except maybe for the infrastructure program, 
provided that-and this is important-the Government of 
Quebec reaches an agreement with Ottawa on the major issue of 
project management. But an agreement has yet to be reached by 
Quebec and Ottawa, while many are being signed with the 
provincial capitals outside Quebec. At any rate, this program 
alone cannot give Montreal the thrust required to escape the 
horrendous cycle of unemployment. More needs to be done, and 
better. But it cannot be done if we do not find a way to change 
Quebec society on the one hand, and Canadian society on the 
other.
<P>
	I will conclude on this common finding made in 1992, a rarity, 
as it is, in Canadian politics. The Liberals, the Reformists, the 
Bloc members as well as two parties that were official parties at 
the time, the NDP and the Conservative Party, all agreed on the 
eve of Charlottetown that Canada was unable to face the 
challenges of the new global economy with its present political 
structures. Everyone agreed on that, but responses varied. 
Charlottetown demonstrated that our responses were totally at 
variance. Canada rejected the Accord because it gave Quebec 
too much, while Quebec rejected it for the opposite reason, 
because there was too little for Quebec in it. The finding still 
holds and we still have the same structures. The constitutional 
status quo has been maintained and we are no better equipped 
today than we were in 1992 to face modern-day economic 
challenges. And that is what we will be emphasizing during this 
entire session.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Laurier-Sainte Marie makes a comment about 
international banking centres and somehow believes that the 
designation of other cities in this country has contributed to 
problems in Montreal in the financial services sector.
<P>
	I would like to point out that Toronto is not an international 
business centre, so whatever the cause of the member's concerns 
about that it is not because the federal government designated 
Toronto as an IBC. It did not.
<P>
	Second, I cannot fail but detect in listening to the historical 
litany described an internal inconsistency. On one hand there is 
a great concern for an economic decline in Montreal which all of 
us who represent major cities lament. Cities are very much the 
economic engine of this country. We all lament the economic 
decline of our cities.
<P>
	There is an internal inconsistency in the logic in the hon. 
member's comments if he believes that continued constitutional 
wrangling, reopening discussions, indeed the very election of 
the Bloc, does anything other than contribute to a continued lack 
of investor confidence in this country.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, it can only be one of two things: 
either the Liberals held an untenable position before the 1992 
draft agreement because your leader, your party was saying: 
``Canada's political structures do not enable us to meet the 
current economic challenge.''
<P>
	Today they tell us that there is no need to change our 
structures to meet this challenge. Either you were telling the 
truth in 1992 and you are lying today, or you were lying in 1992 
and you are telling the truth today. It is one or the other but it 
cannot be both. That is obvious.
<P>
	We see two great trends in the world: one where peoples and 
nations become countries that co-operate. That is what is now 
preventing Canada and Quebec from functioning. Canadians 
want a strong central state with national standards, a stronger 
regional presence in the central state. That is the triple-E Senate 
demand. Canada needs it, but Quebec does not feel comfortable 
with it, will never be able to work with it, will never accept it. 
That is one demand that will never be met as long as we are here.
<P>
	We are preventing you from functioning just as you are 
preventing us from functioning. We should be thinking about 
agreements similar to Maastricht; must I remind you of it?
<P>
	I favour the European Economic Community model but I 
would like to hear the Prime Minister go to Westminster and say 
to the British people that Canadian-style federalism is the way 
of the future and that Great Britain will no longer be a sovereign 
country in ten years or so. I would like to hear him deliver the 
same speech in the French National Assembly or go to the 
Bundestag and tell them that Germany will no longer be a 
sovereign country ten years from now. Just you try!
<P>
	I am telling you that agreements such as Maastricht are the 
way of the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie for his 
speech. I met him over two years ago, after his first election, and 
so far we have had a good experience, I think, working together 
on the Board of Internal Economy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The member is an important person in his party and he made a 
couple of references in his speech similar to things that were 
said by his leader.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="484"> 484 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to ask him on behalf of his party to clarify for me 
a couple of questions. I wish I could put them to his leader but 
the rules of the House do not make that terribly easy.
<P>
	First, the member as well as his leader has stated that the 
federal system does not work and of course this Parliament is 
part of the federal system. Although he may believe the federal 
system does not work, does he and his party see it see it as their 
obligation in their role as members of this Parliament to do their 
best to make this Parliament work and by implication to make 
the federal system work as long as they play this role?
<P>
	Second, I would like to ask him about his position in the future 
constitutional debate that may take place in Quebec. He has 
categorized that debate as between independence and the status 
quo as represented by the current constitutional arrangements.
<P>
	If a referendum like that was rejected by the people of 
Quebec, would he follow through on the consistency of that 
argument and see that rejection as an acceptance of Quebec's 
role in Canada and of the 1982 constitutional arrangements?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I too have learned to work 
together with the hon. member and, yes, I think that we can 
co-operate on many things.
<P>
	We want to make this Parliament work as well as possible. We 
have made suggestions for this purpose and I think that with this 
election, we have just created a real dialogue for the first time in 
the history of this country, because, you know, a dialogue cannot 
be based on anything but the truth.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	I am not saying that all Quebecers are for sovereignty, but I do 
say that pro-sovereignty feeling exists. For the first time we can 
debate it here. I think that it is something new for Canadians to 
hear it discussed here. It puts the debate in its proper place, so 
that it can be done right. In that sense, such a contribution, with 
Parliament working better, would ultimately lead to a better 
attitude to the political problems we face. It does not mean that 
federalism would work better because, as I said, I do not believe 
that federalism in itself is bad, but the federal arrangement in the 
present political context cannot be reconciled with the needs of 
Canadian people and Quebecers.
<P>
	We must move towards a political and economic framework 
involving both national sovereignty and common markets, as we 
see in Europe and will see, I am sure, with NAFTA, which will 
grow and not be limited to Mexico and the United States but 
within fifteen or twenty years will include all the countries of 
Central and Latin America. We must move in that direction.
<P>
	On the other question, what will we do if the referendum is 
defeated? I answer you: what will you do if the referendum 
passes?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the remarks of 
the hon. member and share his view that he has some legitimate 
grievances with the way the political structure is operating right 
now. The people in my community who are without work and 
children who are without nourishment are no different in their 
feelings than those in his community. I am sure he shares that 
view.
<P>
	But if we address in a constructive way some of the issues 
which he is talking about, and if we develop national standards 
in health care, education and training so that all Quebecers 
benefit as all other Canadians benefit, is it still his position that 
in spite of that correction he still wants to give up on Canada?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, when you talk about national 
standards, to really understand what Quebec feels about Canada, 
I must tell you right away that our society, the country that we 
want, will in no way be superior or inferior to Canada, just 
different.
<P>
	To properly understand how we react to national standards, 
ask yourself why you have national standards that are different 
from the Americans'. You will answer, ``Because we are 
Canadians, because our national sovereignty is important to us, 
because we have different values, not better or worse than the 
Americans, just plain different.'' It is the same for Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the remarks of the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie regarding a 25 per cent reduction in the 
defence budget.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member is aware that over the past 20 years 
Canada has been second only to Luxembourg in per capita 
commitment to defence. In fact, we have been recognized in 
NATO and other agencies as being very much remiss in our 
contribution to defence.
<P>
	Over the next four years we are scheduled to see a $6 billion 
reduction in the defence budget already announced. I would ask 
the hon. member if it is realistic and reasonable to suggest a 25 
per cent reduction in a budget for a force that we do not really 
know yet what we are going to ask it to do? Would it not be more 
appropriate to await the outcome of the defence review before 
we establish a budget to operate that force?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="485"> 485 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Of course, we want to review the whole role of 
the Canadian armed forces before making these 25 per cent cuts.
<P>
	It is not simply an accounting exercise. Of course, we must 
think before we act. Nevertheless, I tell you that we will come to 
a conclusion. We must set a target of a 25 per cent cut; 
otherwise, more and more defence-related jobs will be lost, 
because the arms market throughout the world is shaky. That is 
exactly what Bill Clinton did in the United States. He made 
incredible cuts in the defence department, but set up an 
industrial conversion fund of some $29 billion. France and 
Great Britain are doing the same. Remember that 50 per cent and 
more of the weapons made here and exported went to the 
American market. Since they cut their spending, and given state 
secrecy surrounding national defence, they will buy at home and 
that is quite normal. We cannot blame them. Now we have 
unemployment here. If we do not cut, we will have more 
unemployment, and that is exactly the opposite of what my hon. 
colleague wants.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being two o'clock p.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to statements by

	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Mr. Speaker, a

that the presiding judge was one Mr. Justice John Webber who 
closed the court and sealed the trial records at the request of the 
accused who felt that public knowledge of the case would have 
endangered his family. That is all we know.
<P>
	Consider what the public does not know. Canadians do not 
know the name of the accused, the charge against him, or the 
sentence he got. As the <I>Globe and Mail</I> observed, we do not 
know what evidence was presented and what testimony was 
given. We do not know the nature of the accused's appeal for 
secrecy, the nature of the arguments against it, or the quality of 
the judge's decision in granting it.
<P>
	This is going too far. Gag orders under the Criminal Code 
prohibiting publication of some evidence may have their place, 
but a whole trial entirely in secret? That is unacceptable. It

to offer my sympathy to Mr. Jacques Parizeau, leader of the Parti 
Quebecois and MNA for L'Assomption, in my riding, as well as 
to his family, following the passing of his father, Mr. Gérard 
Parizeau.
<P>
	The late Mr. Parizeau had a full and meaningful career. His

Besides working in the insurance business, he taught at the

also wrote several books on French-Canadian society.
<P>
	For his dedication to society, he was made a member of the 
Royal Society of Canada, dubbed Knight of the Legion of

<P>
	Even before the imposition of the GST, over 60 per cent of 
small business owners in Canada spent up to 10 hours a week 
complying with government regulations and red tape. This time 
is better spent marketing their products and doing business. This 
situation has become much worse with the GST.
<P>
	This government promised to review the impact of 
regulations and paperwork on small businesses and their ability 
to comply. Government and the public service must live up to 
their names. They must serve Canadians by removing 
unnecessary and duplicate regulations.

	Like many of my constituents and many Canadians, I support

best possible choices.

<P>
	Currently, 96 per cent of our fractionated blood products, 
which are used by 300,000 Canadians, are purchased abroad. 
This situation makes us uniquely vulnerable to foreign safety 
standards, international shortages, export restrictions and 
fluctuations in international prices.
<P>
	This facility will ensure that all Canadians derive, first and 
foremost, important health benefits. It will provide safer and 
less expensive products and will generate savings of up to $575 
million in the next decade to the Canadian health care system.
<P>
	Moreover, the economic benefits of this facility are of 
importance to Nova Scotia. It will produce $11 billion in 
economic spinoffs for the Atlantic region in the next decade and 
create over 400 jobs in the high-tech sector.
<P>
	This plant represents a significant step toward the goal of 
self-sufficiency in blood products, which has been deemed 
essential by the World Health Organization.

As a non-smoker, I am generally in favour of high taxes on 
tobacco to help discourage young people from smoking.
<P>
	However, the reality in Canada today is completely different. 
Because of the smuggling problem in our country, almost any 
young Canadian can buy cigarettes cheaply, even illegally. 
Moreover, those same young people can participate in and profit 
from this illegal activity controlled by the undesirable elements 
in our society. We have no choice, Mr. Speaker. We must put an 
end to this illegal activity by reducing, however temporarily, 
taxes on tobacco. We have to work together to enforce the laws

<P>
	I have always said, and I will say it again today, as the only 
independent elected member of the Parliament of Canada, that 
tax reductions are the answer to the smuggling problem. Greedy 
governments have led people to become smugglers, criminals

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the absence of the Prime Minister, my question is 
directed to the Minister of Indian Affairs. A year ago, images of 
six young Innu sniffing gas vapours horrified public opinion, as 
we became aware of the terrible living conditions of the native 
population in Davis Inlet. A year later, nothing has changed. 
Drugs and suicide are still a serious problem, as shown in a 
report televised last night on Radio-Canada's <I>Le Point</I>. On the 
same program, we also saw that conditions were similar in a 
native community, in Quebec, at Lac Simon.
<P>
	My question is this: Does the minister agree that if the 
government is serious about its fiduciary responsibility for 
these people, it must develop a joint strategy for putting an end 
to the obscene poverty in Canada's native communities, 
including Davis Inlet and Lac Simon?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I quite agree. The hon. Leader of 
the Official Opposition was once a member of another 
government which spent $1.7 million to send these children to 
Poundmaker. Of the 17 families who went there, 16 of the kids 
are back in trouble. So that did not work.
<P>
	We are back in there again working with the leadership. As I 
said last week, three of our people have been working actively. 
Hopefully we can have a package some time in March that 
addresses these things.
<P>
	I do not think there are quick solutions and I do not think the 
hon. member thinks so either. I think we have the responsibility 
to be there to do whatever we can as far as healing, health, 
housing, and trying to solve the situation in a pragmatic 
step-by-step process.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a supplementary for the Minister of Indian 
Affairs. This week in response to a question from the hon. 
member from Saint-Jean, the minister said that he was about to 
make a proposal to the people of Davis Inlet that would deal with 
issues of justice and health care, a proposal that he felt was 
acceptable. Does the minister realize that the problem is 
escalating, since RCMP officers are being denied access to 
Davis Inlet to investigate cases of sexual assault and violence 
against women and children?

	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> After the initial incident when I was down in the 
area the leadership took another position. They invited the 
RCMP in. They came and collected the prisoners and then left. I 
think the situation is much better at Davis Inlet now than it was 
when I was there. The leadership wants to work with the RCMP, 
wants to work with the government in Newfoundland, and wants 
to work with us. I think together we can find solutions.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister should have watched the television 
program last night. He should ask his staff to show it to him 
because it is really terrible to see. You cannot watch this 
program and report without feeling sad about the situation of 
those people in Canada.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister if he is prepared to agree to the 
request of the Innu in Davis Inlet who want to leave the island to 
go back to the Labrador mainland to recover their ancestral 
hunting grounds?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have heard some crazy figures 
like $80 million. I am at present getting hard figures on it. I am 
very sympathetic to that move but I want to make sure it can be 
done within our budget. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition 
realizes we have budget constraints and I have to work within 
that budget.
<P>
	In my heart I want to make that move. I hope we can do it 
within the constraints of government these days with the heavy 
deficit.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
deals with the incidents which occurred last Friday in 
Kanesatake, and about which the Minister of National Defence 
is constantly changing his version of the facts. He first talked 
about the Sûreté du Québec, which proved incorrect. Then he 
said that he had been informed that the Sûreté du Québec was 
investigating, which also proved incorrect. Finally, yesterday, 
he said he did not have time to ask the Sûreté du Québec to 
investigate.
<P>
	Could the minister tell us whether anyone is investigating the 
events in Kanesatake? If so, will the minister give us the 
assurance that he will table the report once the investigation is 
completed?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps the hon. member is unaware that the chief of the band 
involved at Oka, Chief Peltier, gave a press conference a short 
time ago. In that press conference he said, first, that he was 
completely satisfied with the explanations given by the 
Department of National Defence.
<P>
	Second, as far as he is concerned the matter is closed. Third, 
bearing in mind what I said the other day about members on the 
other side inflaming the situation, he has accused the members 
of the Bloc Quebecois of deliberately inflaming the situation for 
their own political ends in Quebec. That is a shame. The member 
should be ashamed of that action.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
does not seem to understand that his first obligation is to answer 
questions in this House where he sits as an elected 
representative, rather than satisfy some people, people who 
might be involved in that affair.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> The truth hurts on the other side.
<P>
	Could the minister tell us whether the mysterious signal 
received by the Canadian Forces could have come from a plane 
used for cigarette or arms smuggling? Can the minister give us 
any information on that?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
first obligation is to answer legitimate questions posed in the 
House and to expose the truth. The chief of the band made the 
statement that I referred to a few moments ago.
<P>
	I find it rather ironic that a couple of days ago the hon. 
member was posing as an advocate of natives at Oka. Now he is 
attacking them. Please be consistent.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Finance. Last week the 
Reform Party proposed a spending cap that would have reduced 
federal spending next year by a modest 6 per cent. Yesterday the 
minister described this proposal as savagery.
<P>
	This weekend the minister is attending a pre-budget 
conference in Calgary where resource companies have had to 
downsize 10, 15 and 20 per cent in order to remain competitive.

<B><A NAME="490"> 490 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	Will the minister tell the House how he intends to explain to 
workers and investors in those companies why the federal 
government cannot cut its spending by even a modest 6 per cent 
and prefers instead to expand the tax base?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the reference I made yesterday to 
savagery was to not only the motion made in this House but to 
the program put forward by members of the Reform Party during 
the election. They put forward a series of recommendations 
concerning old age pensions which they said would affect 
families above $54,000 but in fact affected families below 
$35,000, going down.
<P>
	It is certainly not the case that we are reluctant to cut 
spending. We are very desirous of cutting spending and in fact 
we intend to do so. But it is precisely because we are not 
prepared to ignore the cause and the plight of laid-off workers 
that we are not going to cut spending the way the Reform Party 
would want us to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
supplementary question for the Minister of Finance that relates 
to the helping of workers.
<P>
	A recent publication by the minister's department entitled 
Canada's Economic Challenges shows that Canada's total public 
debt as a percentage of GDP is higher than that of our major 
trading partners.
<P>
	This weekend the minister will be told that the higher taxes 
paid by Canadian exporters to service that debt are already a 
competitive disadvantage, killing jobs in the export sector. Does 
the finance minister agree that this is so, and if so will he explain 
how further expanding the tax base can possibly stimulate job 
creation in the export sector?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, broadening the tax base and filling in 
the tax loopholes will simply remove inequities in the tax 
system and make it a great deal fairer. Then Canadians will be 
far more prepared to support it. That is what we are dealing with.
<P>
	In terms of export sales we stated unequivocally in the red 
book that the ultimate aim of any government, certainly this 
one, must be to reduce taxes. But this party, as the Reform Party 
certainly claims to be, is also worried about the financial 
condition of the public finances of this country. We also know 
that unless we attack the deficit we are not going to get interest 
rates down. Unless we get interest rates down we are not going 
to have a competitive economy. If the member would like a 
lesson on the deficit I would be prepared to give it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
one further supplementary question for the finance minister so 
that we are clear on his position.
<P>
	The airline industry in Canada pays about 20 per cent of its 
gross revenues in direct charges and taxes to governments 
compared to about 10 per cent paid by the American carriers to 
their government. Will the finance minister acknowledge that 
the high levels of these charges and taxes are already killing jobs 
in the airline industry and again explain how expanding the tax 
base can possibly improve the job situation in that industry or 
any other industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are talking about equity, making 
sure that one group of Canadians does not benefit more from the 
system and the services that this country provides than other 
groups of Canadians. We are trying to build fairness into the 
system. That is crucial.
<P>
	I fail to understand the objection of the party opposite to that 
kind of fairness. However we are going to continue to do it 
despite the objectives of the party opposite.
<P>
	In terms of the competitiveness of our system there is no 
doubt that our airlines, our farmers, the inputs to fertilizers, the 
interest rates that this country has had to bear over the last five 
years; there has been a great deal of unfairness in this country 
and that is why we were elected, to try and make that right.

enough evidence to take action, and I quote: ``-when it has

show it live on our TV screens, while the RCMP, with the tools at 
its disposal, is unable to gather evidence of this kind, and go

	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the </B><B>House

on the basis of which after a trial where the burden of proof is on 
the Crown there will be convictions.

	Over the last four years the government paid a housing

	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I understand correctly, the 
minister is in favour of maintaining the tax. Therefore, since she 
does not agree with her government, what would she 
recommend to stop the increasing number of young people who 
smoke contraband cigarettes?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are very concerned with the problems of contraband and 
cigarette smuggling.
<P>
	The government and I as Minister of Health are extremely 
concerned with smoking and the effect it has on the health of 
Canadians. Not only do young children start smoking every day, 
but those who purchase cigarettes on the black market do not pay 
the taxes which help us fund the health care system. And, 
believe me, we are very much in need of as many dollars as 
possible to fight the kinds of problems that are caused by 
smoking.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	On January 25 the minister told the House that he is seeking 
further clarification on the discrepancy between the accounting 
principles of his department and those of the Auditor General. 
Also on January 25, when the minister was asked about civil 
servant accountability in his department, the minister stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I do not think that is a question that should be addressed to me. That is a 
question for government, and I do not know who can answer that.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister says that he is not responsible for the actions 
taken by the civil servants in his department. On this basis, 
could the minister explain to this House his concept of 
ministerial accountability?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member will realize that the way the supplementary 
question was asked by his colleague left some in doubt as to 
what he was actually trying to get at. No one disputes the fact 
that public servants report to their political masters as elected 
and members of the government.
<P>
	With respect to the actual question on costing, which is 
serious, I know the hon. member would like to get to the bottom 
of the differences which we feel exist between DND accounting 
and the Auditor General. If the House will give leave early next 
week I will make our report public and table the document here 
in the House so all can see the Department of National Defence's 
reasoning. We have nothing to hide.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
supplemental for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	It was only yesterday the Prime Minister explained to this 
House that sometimes the figures of the Auditor General are 
misleading.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	Does the minister believe that in this case the Auditor General 
has again misled the House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister was referring to the same discrepancy between 
what we feel are accurate costing figures. I think he did a very 
good job at explaining in graphic terms the difference between 
our concept of how these costs should be arrived at and that of 
the Auditor General.
<P>

legitimate disputes with whomever about accounting methods.

for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	The inquiry by professor James Hathaway of Toronto on the 
Immigration and Refugee Board, commissioned by his own 
department, concluded this week that the minister is failing in 
his duty, that the board is disregarding the most elementary rules 
of fairness toward refugee claimants, and that incompetent 
commissioners have made dubious decisions based on 
questionable grounds.
<P>
	When is the minister going to reform the board to restore its 
credibility? What does he intend to do about decisions already 
made by these incompetent commissioners?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question the hon. 
member raises.
<P>
	Late last year we had an opportunity to make our first 
appointments to the Immigration Refugee Board. We wanted to 
assure ourselves that the government meant what it said when 
we were going to bring back integrity and competence, not only 
to government but to the appointments of boards and 
commissions under the government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

	With respect to the Immigration Refugee Board we made 33 
appointments which were heralded across the country with very

government was on the right track and improved the 
Immigration Refugee Board.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, the media 
were saying today that the board is a privileged haunt of 
patronage appointees and incompetents. Could the minister 
commit himself, today, to changing the rules of appointment, so 
they are based on qualification rather than on political 
affiliation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just finished saying that the hon. 
member actually applauded the first appointments that we 
made, as did the Reform Party of Canada.
<P>
	What we have laid down is an unprecedented consultation 
process with respect to the Immigration Refugee Board. We 
consulted with NGOs across the country. We consulted with 
lawyers across the country. We consulted with advocates across 
the country.
<P>
	Even before the Hathaway report was tabled this week, I 
suggested as minister we should elaborate that system of 
consultation with the view of setting up committees of 
interested Canadians from a variety of disciplines to begin to vet 
a number of names that come through the system and to 
recommend individuals who would be capable of discharging 
the responsibilities and the important mandate of the 
Immigration Refugee Board.
<P>
	The hon. member should also distinguish what took place in 
December from what took place for nine years under the 
Conservative Government of Canada.

	Could the minister tell us whether the government plans to

pursued to complement the tremendous contributions of 
Canadian forces and the humanitarian aid that we are bringing to

	With regard to the suggestion to bring a number of prominent 
Canadians to advise and assist us, I want to remind the House 
that there will not only be a parliamentary committee struck to 
review our foreign policy in which parliamentarians in a

keeping with our promises in the red book we will hold a

President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for 
Infrastructure. To date, Canada has signed agreements with six 
provincial governments: Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba, New-Brunswick and, more recently, Ontario. Since 
Quebec has already received a first contribution from the federal 
government, as confirmed by the announced construction of a 
new Convention Centre in Quebec City, one can only wonder 
why there is no formal agreement between the federal 
government and Quebec.
<P>
	My question is this: Is it possible that the agreement everyone 
is waiting for in Quebec has been postponed because the federal 
government refuses to give Quebec full leadership in that case 
and absolutely wants to keep an eye on the selection of projects?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when the provincial premiers were here at the first ministers' 
conference on December 21 they all agreed in principle to the 
program, so Quebec is indeed a part of the program.
<P>
	What we are attempting to do at this point in time is to dot the 
<I>i</I>'s and cross the <I>t</I>'s on the framework agreement. As soon as we 
have that done we will be signing the agreement.
<P>
	Everything is going well in that connection. In fact I note in

	The January 24 issue of <I>Maclean's</I> magazine reports that the 
Prime Minister ``has hired Toronto lawyer Robert Wright, his 
chief fund raiser for the 1984 Liberal leadership campaign, to 
negotiate the cancellation of the contract to privatize two 
terminals at Pearson International Airport''.
<P>
	Will the minister explain to the House why the Prime Minister 
has appointed one of his Liberal fundraisers to dismantle a deal 
he vilified during the election campaign because it involved a 
Tory fundraiser?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am astounded the hon. member would not understand that the 
cancellation of Pearson airport and the negotiations that have 
been undertaken to deal with the compensation would be led by 
such an experienced lawyer as the one I as Minister of Transport 
appointed.
<P>
	Mr. Wright is a former chairman of the Ontario Securities 
Commission and an outstanding legal mind. I am sure the entire 
question of compensation arising from the cancellation of 
Pearson will be addressed in his usual professional, very 
thorough and competent manner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I admit that I am new to Ottawa and fundraiser politics, 
but could the minister please explain to me what ethical criteria 
distinguished the appointment of Liberal fundraisers from Tory 
fundraisers?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I think we are getting into little different areas 
here. I will permit the minister to answer the question if he so 
desires.

	However I would encourage hon. members not to impugn 
anything, if they possibly could, along the way. The hon. 
minister, if he would like to answer.

	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in view of the comments of the hon. member alleging, as I

question the ethics of Robert Wright is totally unacceptable to

the Ontario-Quebec rapid train task force agreed it would be 
appropriate to establish a rapid train service in the 
Quebec-Windsor corridor. The task force did a very thorough 
preliminary feasibility study, listing the many economic 
spin-offs connected with the project.
<P>
	The present Prime Minister's chief of staff, former Quebec 
City mayor Jean Pelletier, was the co-signer of this report. The 
task force also held wide ranging public consultations, in the 
course of which intervenors stressed that cities in the corridor 
would have to become more efficient if they were to succeed in a 
competitive market.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. Could 
she tell me what she would prefer: spend taxpayers money to 
proceed with the abandonment of railway lines or spend it on an 
innovative project that would create jobs, jobs, jobs and 
increase our exports of technology to the United States?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

it reminds me of that statement by Mr. Bouchard's friend. I think 
the Liberal Party made it clear that we are going to work with the 
private sector, as suggested in the study to which the hon. 
member referred. We want to improve public transit to promote 
the use of advanced technology in Canada for Canadians, but 
also to maintain an infrastructure that will give our economy a 
chance to expand. We are working on a number of measures, 
including the proposal put forward by the bipartite committee. I 
am sure that when we have a chance to discuss our budget 
priorities, the Bloc Quebecois will indicate whether this is their 
priority for the budget.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond

was said by the Minister of Transport, who said last week that 
establishing a rapid train service was not one of his priorities.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environnement):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Government of 
Canada is anxious to work together with the private sector on all 
modes of transportation that can be helpful as part of the 
infrastructure and provide applications for advanced 
technology. It is true that we are experiencing a budget crisis, as 
the hon. member's friend, the member for Saint-Jean, said in 
this House. Next month, when the Minister of Finance 
announces his budget priorities, the hon. member will see 
whether we are able to create jobs and at the same time meet our 
budgetary responsibilities. It is a difficult balancing act, but we

the economies of both Quebec and Canada.

Hicks was found guilty of manslaughter in the killing of Caren 
Rainey and Laurie Wood.
<P>
	The charge was reduced from second degree murder to 
manslaughter. The reason given for this reduction was that 
Hicks had not shown an intention to kill the two women but 
merely to assault them. Their brutal deaths, with one being 
stabbed 17 times, was blamed on the cocaine that Hicks had 
taken rather than on Hicks himself.

withhold comment on it specifically until I have an opportunity 
to investigate it further. If the hon. member wishes to have me 
comment on that specific case, I will be happy to do so after I 
have had an opportunity to examine it in detail.
<P>
	As to her broader question, the issue of whether substance 
abuse can be taken into account in determining the degree of 
culpability or the nature of the charge, may I simply say that the 
Criminal Code at present, and defences that are available to 
those accused of criminal acts, provide and have provided 
throughout the history of our justice system that all 
circumstances be taken into account, including the question of 
whether the individual accused was acting under the influence 
of an agent.

	I do not purport to be another Robert Winters, but I can 
promise the people of the South Shore that I will represent each 
and every one of them to the best of my ability. I will fulfil my 
commitments to them as they were stated over the long and very 
arduous nomination process and election campaign.
<P>
	The riding of South Shore is one of the great coastal ridings of 
Canada. It is presently the home of the largest fishing 
constituency in all of Canada. In 1992 there were approximately 
5,000 active fishermen and 126 licensed processing plants in my 
riding alone. The value of the annual catch is close to $200 
million per year, for a market value of approximately $375 
million.
<P>
	In my constituency there are three counties, all of which have 
resource based economies. Shelburne County is the fishing 
capital of Canada. Queens County is known as the forestry 
capital of Canada, and Lunenburg County is known as the 
Christmas tree capital of Canada. One could say that the South 
Shore is the capital capital of Canada with all those capitals.
<P>
	My riding extends from the community of Hubbards in the 
east to Charlesville 150 miles to the west. It extends 50 miles 
inland from the Atlantic Ocean to the communities of New Ross 
and New Germany in Lunenburg County, Caledonia and 
Greenfield in Queens County, and to Upper Ohio in Shelburne 
County. Its bays contain thousands of islands from East 
Ironbound and Tancook in the east to Seal Island and Cape Sable 
Island in the west.
<P>
	The historic towns of Lunenburg, Mahone Bay, Bridgewater, 
Liverpool, Shelburne, Lockeport and Clark's Harbour are all 
located on the South Shore, as are many quaint and beautiful 
villages such as my home of Chester and other communities 
such as Blandford, New Ross, Riverport, Port Mouton, East 
Green Harbour and Barrington Passage. I could go on and on. I 
would like to name them all but I understand I am limited in 
time.
<P>
	I still remember the Friday morning 10 days before the past 
election when the Prime Minister visited historic Lunenburg, 
home of the Bluenose, the Bounty and the Fisheries Museum of 
the Atlantic. This was a proud occasion for the people of the 
South Shore, one which I am sure left many people touched by 
his honesty and humanity.
<P>
	It goes without saying, as we hear the names of these historic 
towns and villages, that tourism plays a major part in the lives of 
my constituents. We must continue to promote tourism as it is 
serving to revitalize communities devastated by the downturn in 
the fishery. It generates more than $100 million annually and 
provides employment for thousands of people on the South 
Shore. It is an industry that can and will play a leading role in the 
economic recovery we are all anticipating.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	As I said earlier, the economy of my riding is primarily 
resource based. My constituents are affected by and concerned 
with the downturn in the fishery, the challenges in the forestry 
sector, particularly those of the pulp and paper industry, and the 
difficulties and uncertainty being experienced in the 
agricultural sector.
<P>
	I for one believe the fishery can be prosperous once again if 
we properly manage the change. I have faith, and I know that 
faith is not misplaced, in the present minister of fisheries. I 
applaud his willingness to listen and his courage to act. Once we 
set aside special interests in favour of community interests 
practical solutions will be found.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="498"> 498 </A></B>
<P>
	One of the first steps we must take is to curtail foreign 
overfishing on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks. I must say I 
was encouraged by the comments of Reformers earlier today 
when they said that they would be supporting the Liberal Party 
on that initiative.
<P>
	With regard to the forestry sector I have every faith in the 
Minister of Natural Resources with whom I, along with my 
constituent, Mr. Rick Lord, president of the Canadian Christmas 
Tree Growers' Association, and the Prime Minister, presented a 
Christmas tree to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario.
<P>
	The minister is aware of the size and scope of forestry in my 
riding. There are 270 established companies within our forestry 
sector which employ directly or indirectly upwards of 5,000 
people. The annual value of all forest exports from my riding 
alone is in excess of $150 million. The minister is no doubt 
aware of how important the extension of the federal-provincial 
forestry agreements are to the future viability and management 
of this resource.
<P>
	Not everybody in the riding has resource based employment. 
There are many who are looking forward to the benefits that can 
be realized from the Canada infrastructure works program 
implemented recently by the Minister responsible for 
Infrastructure. The introduction of this program was well 
accepted by all 12 municipal units in my riding. Not only is this 
initiative necessary but its premise that all levels of government 
in Canada can work together toward a common and beneficial 
end is sound. I sincerely hope that this is a positive indication of 
things to come.
<P>
	There are many issues and concerns to be discussed. 
Thankfully we have four years in which to deal with them. 
However there is one further concern I would like to bring 
forward. It is one that I addressed continually throughout my 
nomination and election campaign. My concern is for the future 
of the youth in this country.
<P>
	In addition to my responsibilities to my family and my 
business, over the years I have focused some of my energies on 
the young people in the communities of the South Shore. I have 
enjoyed working with young people and I have been repaid 
many times over through my experiences with them.
<P>
	It saddens me to see so many worried and troubled young men 
and women in our society today. They have become alienated as 
their concerns were overshadowed by those of our generation. 
Their lives are difficult, their futures insecure. We should all be 
aware of the fact that the changing times, the state of the 
economy and the seemingly bleak prospects for their future are 
taking their toll.
<P>
	Their hours are not always easy to fill. There are few of the 
simplistic pastimes that most of us remember from our youth. I 
know I never had to compete with the televised or computer 
generated games that assail the youth of today. None of my 
distractions came from drugs, alcohol or idleness.
<P>
	Today the need for continued education is greater than in the 
past. Jobs are fewer and costs are higher. It is not easy for them 
even to begin to compete in the global marketplace.
<P>
	Where do they find hope? They find hope in our faith in them. 
The Liberal Party demonstrated its belief in the young people of 
Canada during the election campaign by introducing the concept 
of the Canadian youth corps and the Canadian apprenticeship 
program. I was pleased to hear a reconfirmation of that former 
initiative in the speech from the throne.
<P>
	The youth corps program will afford our youth the 
opportunity to make a positive contribution to the country while 
building self- esteem, developing skills and gaining experience. 
The apprenticeship program will give young people the skills 
needed to succeed in growing economic sectors, will forge 
strong schools to work linkages and will result in making 
apprenticeship a valid career option.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to note that I am fully committed to 
the program outlined in ``Creating Opportunities''. The 
government of which I am proud to be a part was elected to 
implement this program and the speech from the throne reflects 
its intention to do so.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the member for South Shore. First of all I congratulate him 
on his maiden speech.
<P>
	With respect to the resource industry of which the hon. 
member said his riding has a cross-section, specifically in 
forestry, he said there were over 270 companies employing 
5,000 people. When these companies strip the trees, are they 
forced to replace them at intermittent stages during their 
contract? Or, is it like some other companies in Canada that are 
allowed to wait until the last days of their contract and walk 
away from that commitment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wells:</B> Mr. Speaker, a lot of reforestation is taking place 
in my province and in my riding. As we discuss this matter with 
different people in the forest industry there is a difference of 
opinion sometimes as to whether or not we should let natural 
forces come into play. If the cutting is done properly and we 
leave enough, nature will run its course and natural regeneration 
will occur.
<P>
	The supply of wood and wood fibre is sufficient. It is perhaps 
sufficient for another major industry. Certainly at this point in 
time our forests are relatively well managed. There is no major 
concern with wood supply or wood fibre at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for South Shore. Indeed it is a pleasure 
to have him as a colleague from Nova Scotia in the House of 
Commons. I have known the member for many years. The area 
has made a very wise choice in sending him here to be its 
representative in the House of Commons. On a personal note, I 
am very pleased 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="499"> 499 </A></B>
<P>
that a  friend of mine has pursued this noble occupation of being 
a member of Parliament from South Shore.
<P>
	The member comes from one of the most beautiful parts of 
Canada. Perhaps he can let people who are watching this debate 
and people who are in the House know about some of the 
beautiful spots and tourism events in his riding. Tourism is a 
major industry in the riding of South Shore. Perhaps he could 
elucidate for us some events that take place there so that some of 
the people in the House and the people watching can take him up 
on an offer and maybe we will see them there in the summer.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I do not doubt that the 
member's riding is as described by the hon. member for 
Dartmouth. I would be very surprised if the member for South 
Shore, in the short time left of approximately one minute, could 
do justice to the beauty of his riding, as any other member would 
find almost impossible to do. I am sure we will get a valiant 
effort from the member for South Shore in the little time he has 
left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wells:</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess the greatest risk when we try 
to do answer a question in one minute is to be concerned about 
what we might leave out.
<P>
	When we run summer election campaigns we learn that in my 
riding which is 150 miles long and 50 miles wide there are many 
exhibitions from the big exhibition in Bridgewater, to the 
fisheries exhibition in Lunenburg, to the exhibitions in 
Barrington and Shelburne, to the folk festival in Lunenburg, to 
Chester Race Week. Again, with the limited time, I have left 
many out.
<P>
	During the summer I will not say South Shore is the tourism 
capital of Nova Scotia because I notice other members here who 
may take objection to that. Certainly tourism and all the events 
that take place are big draws and more and more are being 
developed all the time.
<P>
	I thank the member for the question. I hope over time I can 
expand more fully on some of the major events that place in my 
riding.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
people of Central Nova have authorized me to represent their 
many diverse and urgent interests in the House of Commons; to 
speak on their behalf with courage, determination and integrity; 
to ensure that their families are protected and safeguarded; to 
ensure that their right to work with pride and dignity is restored; 
and to ensure that our country remains united, independent and 
free.
<P>
	My people in Central Nova, by electing me as their member of 
Parliament, have bestowed the highest honour upon me and have 
placed me in a position of trust. I pray that God will grant me the 
wisdom, knowledge and understanding to fulfil my duties in this 
office with justice, integrity and equity.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	The people of Central Nova must not be underestimated. They 
know the issues. They see the problems. They feel the heartache, 
pain and anxiety. They have experienced firsthand the 
devastating social and economic effects of government policies 
and decisions. Many are unemployed. Others are what I refer to 
as the working poor.
<P>
	The speech from the throne and the initiatives and programs 
outlined therein offers hope to the people of Central Nova. 
Already initiatives are being implemented in my riding, such as 
the municipal infrastructure program. Hope has been offered for 
employment and hope for new opportunity. This is as a result of 
the speech from the throne and the initiatives set out in the red 
book, Creating Opportunity.
<P>
	Let us look at the unemployment situation. Every day jobs are 
lost or being threatened. Unemployment, job security and job 
creation must be and will be the priority issues for this 
government. Unemployment is the scourge of mankind. It robs 
the person of his or her dignity. It has a crippling effect on the 
entire community and our nation as a whole.
<P>
	The causal effects of unemployment can lead to the 
breakdown of the family unit, leads to family violence, suicide, 
alcohol and drug dependency, increased crime, theft, 
insurmountable financial and emotional problems, and 
dependency on social assistance. The effects are unlimited. The 
price society and the taxpayer pays in the cost of support 
services for family breakdown is also immeasurable. The price 
the family pays is immeasurable.
<P>
	I am proud to represent Central Nova. Central Nova is known 
as the industrial heartland of Nova Scotia and rightly so because 
the industrial revolution in Canada began in my home town of 
Stellarton. It came about with the advent of steam power and the 
usage of the 40-foot thick Foord seam of coal in Stellarton. The 
steam power was applied to industry in Central Nova including 
shipbuilding, steel making, sawmills and railroads.
<P>
	The first steel railroad ever built in Canada was built in 
Stellarton and is still in existence today.
<P>
	New Glasgow, a town in Central Nova, built the first iron 
sailing ship ever made in Canada.
<P>
	The development of the Pictou coal deposit created an 
industrial complex in the town of New Glasgow which in 1883 
broadened into the opening of the first steel making plant in 
Canada. Today we have Maritime Steel and our New Glasgow 
foundry.
<P>
	The first steel ever successfully made in Canada was 
produced in the town of Trenton. Since then, the town of Trenton 
in Central Nova has been referred to as the birthplace of steel in 
Canada. It was known as Trenton Works at one time and 
manufactured railway rolling stock. The plant is still in 
existence today but it is known as Lavalin.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="500"> 500 </A></B>
<P>
	Westville, a coal mining town, was incorporated September 
1884 and became known as the friendly town. Coal mining 
began in 1865. As the town of Westville celebrates its centennial 
of incorporation this very year, once again it will look to its coal 
mines for another resource; that of geothermal energy extracted 
from the warm waters of flooded, abandoned mine workings.
<P>
	The town of Pictou is an historic town in Central Nova that 
overlooks the best harbour in northern Nova Scotia. The 
Scottish immigration to Pictou began in July 1773 and the early 
economic base centred around the sea. Shipbuilding was and 
still is a very prominent part of Pictou's economy with our 
Pictou Industries.
<P>
	The municipality of Pictou consists of geographically Pictou 
east and Pictou west. Located therein is the north shore which 
has a multi-purpose fishing industry and agriculture.
<P>
	We have the eastern shore fishing industry in the county of 
Halifax. The eastern shore is an unscathed environment with a 
beautiful coastline and the most wonderful people you would 
ever want to meet.
<P>
	Central Nova is now facing a fishing industry crisis that has 
devastating effects on our people and their livelihood both on 
the north shore and eastern shore of Central Nova.
<P>
	We have the First Nation Micmac community of Pictou 
Landing with a population of approximately 420 band members 
living on about 250 acres of land. Although the area around 
Pictou has been settled by the Micmac for thousands of years, 
official status of reserve land has only been granted for a little 
more than 100 years. Education and high unemployment are 
issues of concern and our Micmac nation is open to the concept 
of self-government.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	It is interesting to note that Central Nova, the birthplace of the 
industrial revolution of Nova Scotia, must now prepare for the 
technical revolution. It is imperative that we be strong in science 
and technology. To survive this technological revolution our 
people must be educated, for part of the oppression of our people 
lies in the failure to provide quality education and literacy skills 
for our youth and labour force.
<P>
	Although education is a matter of provincial jurisdiction, I 
wish to remind the federal government that I feel that it has a 
major role to play in initiating the necessary changes to provide 
quality education for the common good of our country.
<P>
	Our youth are without jobs. Our youth are without hope. The 
youth apprenticeship training program and youth services corps 
are two government programs that will provide hope.
<P>
	In my 17 years of practice as a litigation lawyer, I have 
experienced first-hand the oppression, manipulation and abuse 
of many people arising from the abuse of power, abuse of 
authority and abuse of the process within the systems of 
government.
<P>
	The system of government is not working as it should. The 
three branches of government, namely the legislative, the 
executive and the judicial, require reform to ensure justice and 
equity to all Canadians.
<P>
	With respect to the legislative branch of government, it is 
time that we as legislators put responsibility and morality back 
into the law. Justice, law and morality go hand in hand. They are 
inseparable.
<P>
	With respect to the executive branch of government that 
administers the law, it is time to diminish the authority, power 
and discretion of the bureaucracy and make it more accountable 
for its decisions and attitudes that affect our individual 
Canadians.
<P>
	With respect to the judicial branch of government that 
interprets and enforces the law, it is time that perhaps 
consideration be given to electing our judiciary. The people 
must live with the decisions of the courts and therefore it is time 
that the people elect the decision makers.
<P>
	In conclusion, the greatest investment we can make as a 
nation is in our own people. Our people are the human resource 
required to make it all work. The family unit is the basic 
institution of life and the solid foundation upon which our 
forefathers built this great nation. The protection of families, 
family life and family values must be a priority with this 
government. The family is where life begins. Life begins from 
the moment of conception and continues until natural death. The 
family is where our purpose to live, to work and to prosper is 
nurtured.
<P>
	The conventional terms of debate in matters of political, 
economic and legal issues tend to focus on individual rights and 
the state, not the family. This is unfortunate and must change, 
for the family is the most important reality in our lives.
<P>
	Remember, Canada was made for families. Families were not 
made for Canada. When families prosper so too will Canada 
prosper. When families are strong so too will our country 
Canada be strong.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I wish to congratulate the hon. member from Central Nova for 
her excellent speech which I found particularly touching and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="501"> 501 </A></B>
<P>
humane. It is not often that we see in this House such a humane 
approach. But I would like to ask the hon. member a question 
since she is from a resource based area, the riding of Central 
Nova. Given the way she talked about her riding, it seems that its  
economic activity is mainly dominated by fisheries and 
agriculture.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to explain how she can feel 
comfortable in a party like the Liberal Party of Canada, a party 
that during the GATT multilateral negotiations abandoned one 
of the pillars of Canadian agriculture, especially the dairy sector 
so important in the riding of Central Nova. How can she feel 
comfortable in a party that has sacrificed a good part of the 
safety net, at least for the Canadian dairy industry, and which is 
also known for its negligence and its inability to deal with 
Atlantic fisheries?
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Skoke:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to assure the hon. 
member that I feel very at ease and very much at home with the 
Liberal Party. I think the principles and the philosophy of the 
Liberal Party certainly augurs very well with respect to our 
principles of justice, fairness and equity for all Canadians. I 
chose the Liberal Party for those reasons.
<P>
	With respect to the issues of agriculture and fisheries, I am 
very confident that our party will do what is best, within its 
powers and within the limits it has available, to ensure that the 
dairy farmers, and particularly our fisheries, will be taken care 
of.
<P>
	I am also pleased to have the opportunity to work with the 
hon. ministers in ensuring that my constituents, with respect to 
those issues, will be taken care of.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
would like to congratulate the hon. member for Central Nova. 
Having been raised in Nova Scotia myself, I have travelled the 
areas that she was elected in many, many times. It is indeed 
beautiful.
<P>
	The member has spoken very earnestly and sincerely about 
unemployment in her area, but unemployment has been a 
problem in the maritimes and in her area for decades. I believe 
that the infrastructure program is once again more 
taxes-federally, provincially and municipally-on the 
constituents in that area. The infrastructure alone will not cure 
the problem of unemployment in that area and training in itself 
will not help the situation either, or at least will not cure it.
<P>
	I am wondering if the member would perhaps suggest a new 
industry that could perhaps turn the tide in that area. Other than 
infrastructure and training, what new changes would help the 
people in Central Nova?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Skoke:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	Throughout my speech I talked about the oppression of our 
people. It is correct for the member to say that the people in the 
maritimes and the Atlantic provinces have been unemployed 
more so than in other parts of the country. In my opinion there 
has been a form of oppression.
<P>
	I think the answer to unemployment is quality education. 
Although I know education is a matter of provincial jurisdiction, 
I feel that the federal government has a responsibility under 
industry, science, technology and trade, and certainly for the 
common good of all Canadians, to intervene with respect to the 
issue of education.
<P>
	Perhaps our youth and those people in the labour force, be it 
the fishery or whatever, who may have to look for new 
employment, are not properly educated in the basics of reading, 
writing and literacy skills.
<P>
	One way to oppress people is to ensure that they cannot read 
or write. Then they cannot understand what is going on or that 
they are going to continue being manipulated and deceived by 
hidden agendas.
<P>
	I feel that the answer and what this government should be 
looking at is education. It does not cost extra money to educate 
your people. What it takes is ingenuity and the basics. I think it 
is time we go back to the basics in our education system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
today to stand as the member for Kootenay East constituency.
<P>
	In the October 25 election the constituents expressed their 
confidence in the agenda that I and the Reform Party were to 
bring to the Parliament of Canada. The topic of my speech today 
is really directed to my constituents. My topic would be entitled 
demand less.
<P>
	It is critical in my constituency, indeed in Canada, that 
citizens give clear direction to their politicians at all levels of 
government.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	Political decisions are not made in a vacuum. Decisions to 
spend money and deliver services and social entitlements to 
citizens are made as ordinary citizens make their demands 
known to the politicians. Any politician who wants to get 
elected or re-elected must respond to those demands and so I say 
to my constituents we must demand less.
<P>
	Following my election I made two immediate activities my 
priority. One was to open lines of communication and 
accessibility to my constituents. The second was to grapple with 
the issues surrounding mining-especially coal mining-and 
how it relates to my constituents in the Elk Valley.
<P>
	The Elk Valley which is east of Cranbrook is a magnificent 
area of my constituency with beautiful mountains, the Snow 
Valley ski area in Fernie and the districts of Sparwood and 
Elkford. There is no area in Canada which has been more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="502"> 502 </A></B>
<P>
adversely affected by ill  advised taxation, blatant tax revenue 
grabs and overregulation than the Elk Valley.
<P>
	The area suffers with a 30 per cent unemployment rate. In the 
last couple of years there have been significant mine failures 
with as a many as 2,000 people out of work severely depressing 
the commercial community.
<P>
	It was interesting that in a recent news article in the 
Kimberley <I>Bulletin</I> a headline read: ``Cominco irked at city tax 
rate''. The complaint of the mining company was that the major 
industrial tax rate in Kimberley is 69 per cent higher than the tax 
rate in Cranbrook. In justifying the position of the city, the 
mayor of Kimberley agreed that Cominco taxes are high but said 
the tax rate is justified. He said the mining company has had it 
easy on taxes because it did not start paying taxes until 1968 
when Cominco was incorporated into the city limits. The mayor 
said: ``That is when Cominco started shutting down plants and 
laying off people''.
<P>
	I am not criticizing the mayor of Kimberley for his comments. 
I simply cite that quotation as an accurate representation of what 
happens when an industry is taxed. The fact is that when taxes go 
up then jobs and an industry decrease.
<P>
	Capital for mining is fleeing Canada. The country of Chile is 
one of the greatest beneficiaries of this flight. It has an effective 
tax rate of 15 per cent. The countries of Mexico and Papua New 
Guinea have a mining tax rate of 35 per cent. The Philippines 
and even the United States has a tax rate on mining companies of 
38 per cent whereas the mining companies in the province of 
British Columbia suffer under a mining income tax rate of 50 per 
cent. That is hard rock mining.
<P>
	In coal mining, although it is hard to believe, in four years 
between 1987 and 1991 the B.C. coal industry paid $454 million 
dollars, almost half a billion dollars, in direct taxes while net 
returns to the industry believe it or not were only $8 million.
<P>
	Citizens must demand less from the federal government, 
provincial government, regional district, cities, towns and even 
the school boards because I say that taxes kill jobs.
<P>
	For example property tax rates charged on coal mines are 
three times higher than residential rates. These taxes pay for 
municipal services. The ministry of environment of the province 
of B.C. has made a decision to require the East Kootenay region 
to implement a solid waste disposal program. To put solid waste 
disposal into normal terms, it is simply people's garbage.
<P>
	The annual cost of this program is $3.2 million. The share of 
the costs of Sparwood and Elkford combined would be about 
$940,000 annually. The coal mines in these municipalities 
would pay $717,000 of that $900,000.
<P>
	Yesterday Fording Coal announced that following a 4 per cent 
decrease in the selling price of their top grade of coal in Japan in 
1993, they are suffering a further 8 per cent decrease in their 
selling price in 1994. This solid waste management program as 
desirable as it may be will remove an additional $700,000 from 
coal producers' cash flow while prices in the world market are 
dropping.
<P>
	Citizens must demand less or we will continue to see 
bankruptcies, job losses and potentially the total disintegration 
of B.C.'s export coal industry.
<P>
	The problem is not confined to the East Kootenay area. The 
coal must move from the mines in my constituency to port.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	We have a world class facility with our transportation services 
to the coast. The coal car repair shop in Golden is state of the art. 
The railway company and its workers just as with the workers in 
the coal mining producing plants are going flat out to be 
efficient. However, we are going to tax them out of existence at 
every level of taxation.
<P>
	In 1981 the selling price of coal was around $67 a tonne. In 
1991 it had dropped to $60 a tonne. However, in real dollars, that 
is converting 1981 dollars into 1991 dollars, the $67 a tonne 
revenue in 1981 became $35 a tonne revenue in 1991.
<P>
	The companies responded and the workers and the companies 
have driven their operating expense from $41 a tonne to $22 a 
tonne or, again in real costs, to $13 a tonne.
<P>
	In other words operating costs have been reduced through 
diligence and hard work and significant capital investment 
driven down by 70 per cent since 1981. The workers in the coal 
industry and transportation have shown extreme dedication in 
this quest to reduce costs while at the same time demands for 
additional services and social entitlements by Canadians has 
pushed politicians to increase taxes and outright revenue grabs 
at an alarming rate.
<P>
	As weird as it may seem some of the bridges on the rail line 
over the canyons and through the mountains between the Elk 
Valley and Roberts Bank attract tax levels of tens of thousands 
of dollars each. One bridge classified as an improvement costs 
the railway over $100,000 annually in taxes simply because the 
canyon exists and we want to get the coal over the canyon.
<P>
	At the federal level fuel taxes on diesel use by the railway 
stand in the way of our coal producers in British Columbia being 
able to ship clean burning coal from B.C. to Ontario. The fuel 
taxes on the diesel used by the railway locomotives are for the 
purpose of building highways. This is totally unrealistic and 
unfair in the application of taxes. It is taxing one method of 
transportation to subsidize another.
<P>

	On the coast at the Roberts Bank terminal, charges to put coal 
into the ships for export have tripled over the last ten years and 
the Vancouver port authority, a part of the federal government, 
has direct responsibility for the fees which are continuing to rise 
at a rate of 10 per cent a year. This is at a time when coal prices 
are crashing.
<P>
	Yet I read in the newspaper yesterday a headline which said: 
``Our finance minister says Canada can stand more tax''. Canada 
cannot stand more tax. Taxes kill jobs.
<P>
	If the Liberals wonder why western Canadians are uptight 
about the potential imposition of a carbon tax they need only 
look at the results of the national energy plan which was only a 
thinly disguised revenue grab from western Canada to central 
Canada. We still suffer from the residue.
<P>
	Coal mines are subject to higher mineral taxes than hard rock 
mines in British Columbia. It is unclear but it appears as though 
this is simply a leftover from the bad old days of the era of the 
national energy plan that was imposed by the former Liberal 
government.
<P>
	The fact is that our coal mines supply world markets and the 
Japanese steel industry will lose $3 billion U.S. in the current 
fiscal year. There is a continued oversupply of coking coal in the 
world market. That is world reality. We Canadians have to face 
reality and so again I say to my constituents that we Canadians 
must demand less service and entitlements from our politicians 
or we will tax our jobs out of existence.
<P>
	I say to the trustees of the schools boards, the mayors and 
councillors of our towns and cities, the regional district 
directors, the MLAs Corky Evans and Jim Doyle and the hon. 
minister of mines Ann Edwards that we must be prepared to lead 
cutting government costs so that we will not tax our jobs out of 
existence.
<P>
	I challenge members of the House of Commons to follow the 
example shown by the Reform Party members and take a 10 per 
cent cut in their pay not because they are not earning it but 
clearly to show leadership by example. It is only by demanding 
less that we will have more jobs, more security and more future 
for ourselves and for our children.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I thank my hon. colleague from the Reform Party for his 
excellent speech, which contained views on taxation that I do 
not share but respect nonetheless. In fact, I would have a 
comment to make about the tax system and I would also like to 
ask a question.
<P>
	From the moment the election campaign began and from the 
moment this House resumed sitting, I have been hearing 
members of the Reform Party refer to uniform cuts of 10, 12 or 
15 per cent depending on the speaker, because it would seem to 
me that there is no party line where this matter is concerned. I 
wonder what the rationale is for requesting such drastic cuts 
across the  board. I would like to know if the Reform Party could 
not suggest some other alternative like broadening the tax base 
to make the Canadian tax system fair again.
<P>
	Let me explain. In 1991, the very rich, some of whom 
probably live in my hon. colleague's riding, were said to have 
paid tax at an actual rate of about 18 per cent, while the basic tax 
rate was 29 per cent. Other statistics show a flight of capital 
from very large Canadian corporations, which means that 
Canadian businesses-very large businesses, not the small and 
medium-sized or the very small ones, but the very large ones 
that turn a profit year in year out-are transferring their profits 
to some tax haven without paying a nickel in taxes in Canada. 
Yet, the same businesses transfer to Canada the losses they post 
abroad because they can get a tax deduction for those. I wonder 
if we could not recover billions in lost tax simply by broadening 
the tax base. I think that we are starting to get a clearer picture of 
where we are going in terms of the budget. There might be a way 
to get these businesses and these very rich taxpayers to pay their 
fair share, thus achieving the very objectives you have been 
talking about since this House resumed its business.
<P>
	Clearly, Mr. Speaker, and I will end my comment on that, 
there is a need for effective spending control. The Auditor 
General of Canada did mention a certain laxness about the 
budget when he tabled his last report. But to suggest such drastic 
cuts, across the board, do you not think that this could affect the 
poorer taxpayers or the middle-income earners who are already 
overburdened by a tax system that has become unbearable, 
especially since 1984? I put the question to the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question because it 
gives me an opportunity to speak to some of the confusion that 
the member refers to.
<P>
	There seems to be a lack of ability of being able to get hold of 
our documents from the election campaign. I would be very 
happy to provide them to any member in the House. We are not 
talking about uniform cuts of 10, 12 or 15 per cent. We are not 
talking about lateral cuts.
<P>
	We are talking about selectively making sure that we have the 
ability to be able to fund exactly the people at the end of the 
member's question to which he was referring. They are the most 
disadvantaged within our society.
<P>
	If we do not have the resources or the funds, truly it will be 
those who cannot take care of themselves who will be 
disadvantaged. Therefore we have a very specific program that I 
would be very happy to share.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the overall principle that has been very 
clearly put out by other members of the Reform Party in this 
debate. It is that 25 cents out of every dollar put out by the 
government goes out as an interest payment for overspending 
we have already done. That money is gone. There is no way of 
recovering that money.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="504"> 504 </A></B>
<P>
	Even if we were to take all of the cost of running the 
government, fire every member of Parliament, let every civil 
servant go and shut down the entire government we would still 
not be able to balance the overspending by the government.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	With respect to the members of the BQ, when the party is 
talking about protecting social programs, I suggest that they 
also give consideration to how they are going to protect the 
social programs unless they are going to be prepared to 
selectively make sure that people who have the most needs are 
protected.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Mr. Speaker, a former member once told 
me that I would probably be making my maiden speech to an 
almost empty House. I did not believe him. This must be what it 
feels like to address an NDP election rally.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I wish to begin by congratulating you on your 
appointment. I would also like to congratulate all hon. members 
for their election to this House. It is my earnest hope that in spite 
of the philosophical gulf that separates some of us that we will 
be able to sit down and reason together to address the problems, 
the almost overwhelming problems, that are facing us.
<P>
	I want to sincerely thank the people who sent me here, the 
electors of Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia. I made 
only two election promises to them: to faithfully represent them 
and their views in this place; and to work with every means at 
my disposal toward the restoration of fiscal sanity in this 
country.
<P>
	Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia is a western rural 
constituency. The majority of my constituents are people who 
take their living from the land: farmers, ranchers, coal miners 
and people who work in the oil patch, the sort of people who 
political, cultural and media elitists sometimes dismiss as 
rednecks. I have been called a redneck myself and it is a label I 
wear with considerable pride.
<P>
	What is a redneck? A redneck is someone who does not belong 
to all the right clubs and who does not subscribe to trendy social 
and political doctrines. We rednecks strongly believe in the 
concept of public service, that governments, civil servants, 
politicians and political parties exist to serve the people and not 
the other way around. We believe that individual rights are 
sacred, that they supersede group rights, and moreover that you 
cannot protect and enhance the rights of some groups at the 
expense of other groups. Rights are indivisible.
<P>
	We believe in the virtues of hard work and personal 
enterprise. We strongly believe that the producers of real wealth 
are entitled to keep a reasonable share of the fruits of their 
labours, that their standard of living should not be lower than 
that enjoyed by the multitudes of non-producers who the 
taxman requires them to carry on their backs.
<P>
	Taxation in this country is so high that working people are 
beginning to have difficulty differentiating between taxmen and 
highwaymen.
<P>
	We believe in the spirit of community service. It made our 
communities liveable long before the tentacles of central 
government began to strangle us a couple of generations ago. 
Neighbours helping neighbours.
<P>
	We tend to speak the Queen's English without embellishment. 
Among my friends and neighbours even in this day and age it is 
not at all uncommon to hear such phrases as: ``It's a deal,'' or: 
``That is none of your business''.
<P>
	I have staked out my philosophical position. I believe that it 
fairly represents the views of the people who sent me here. 
However, there are a few people, a very few, in Swift 
Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia who are as politically 
correct as any hon. member might wish and I shall never forget 
that it is my duty to represent them, too.
<P>
	The future of our country appears more bleak now than at any 
time since the second world war. The former government has 
left us a legacy of debt, deficit and national disunity for which 
the Progressive Conservative Party has been consigned to 
well-deserved oblivion. However, we must never forget nor 
allow the government to forget that seeds of these problems 
were sown by Liberal governments in the 1970s. The PCs 
watered and fertilized these weeds but they did not plant them.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Therefore when I realized that we face 177 Liberal members 
my heart sunk a little but then I remembered that more than half 
of them are like me. They are new to this place and they bear no 
responsibility for the disastrous Trudeau years. I optimistically 
hope and expect that many of them will have fresh new ideas. 
They did not write the speech from the throne which is 
remarkably short on new ideas and contains no serious 
initiatives to control the deficit. Perhaps that shortcoming will 
be rectified when the government presents its first budget.
<P>
	If the government does make a serious effort to kill the deficit 
monster, I pray that the weapon of choice will be a knife to cut 
costs and not a gun to extract more taxes from the people.
<P>
	In Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia with our farm 
economy flat on its back we are very dependent on fuel 
production for our economic survival. We have several small oil 
fields, some natural gas and one of the biggest coal mines in the 
country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="505"> 505 </A></B>
<P>
	For more than three years federal politicians, including some 
members of the present government, have been musing about 
the imposition of a carbon tax, a tax on fossil fuels which would 
be cleverly disguised as an environmental levy.
<P>
	An independent study commissioned by the government last 
year indicated that a carbon tax high enough to effectively 
inhibit the use of fossil fuels would adversely affect almost 
every measure of economic activity, including the gross 
domestic product, the level of industrial investment, consumer 
price index and the unemployment rate.
<P>
	All we need in Saskatchewan is another fuel tax for our 
hard-pressed farmers. Thanks to taxes, including a 12 cent per 
litre federal tax, fuel produced and refined in Regina can already 
be purchased in Montana 50 miles from my home for two-thirds 
of what I pay.
<P>
	I mentioned our coal mine. Its entire annual output of 3.6 
million tonnes is sold to one customer, the Poplar River Power 
Station at Coronach. A tax on that coal would increase the 
consumer cost of electricity not only in Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia but throughout Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Meanwhile electricity costs in Quebec with mostly 
hydroelectric generation and in Ontario with its massive nuclear 
stations would be scarcely affected. It is the national energy 
policy all over again but wrapped in the fuzzy green blanket of 
environmentalism.
<P>
	I am not day-dreaming. I may be having a nightmare, but I am 
not day-dreaming. The rumours of an impending carbon tax are 
persistent and they are consistent with statements made by the 
hon. Minister of Finance when he sat on this side of the House.
<P>
	The second energy industry nightmare, and this one applies 
more to Alberta than to my constituency, is that government will 
move to restrict natural gas exports, thus strangling the most 
vibrant sector of the Canadian economy but creating a market 
surplus and forcing down prices in Ontario and Quebec where 
the votes are.
<P>
	In closing I wish to reiterate my party's position that the path 
to effective deficit reduction is through spending cuts, not 
through tax increases. During the election campaign Reform 
made two dozen deficit reduction proposals. No doubt many of 
them would be ideologically unacceptable to the government 
but surely not all of them.
<P>
	Last October 25 the people of Canada clearly demanded a 
change of direction. The government has a clear mandate. It has 
an obligation to take action. If it follows the course of least 
resistance the bumbling course of the last 20 years and this 
country with all of its enormous promise and potential finally 
gurgles down the drain, this government will never be forgiven-never.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
quite enjoyed the hon member's remarks. They help me indeed 
in understanding a lot of things. I must say also though that I am 
one of those new Liberal MPs the hon. member mentioned in his 
remarks. There are some things I do not quite understand and I 
hope the hon. member can clarify them for me.
<P>
	I have heard consistently through the day from other hon. 
members of the Reform Party that the Reform Party appears to 
be universally against higher taxes. Indeed the proposal, as the 
hon. member has said, is to lower taxes. Juxtaposed against this 
consistent theme is the idea that MPs should take a 10 per cent 
salary cut. I am quite interested by this juxtaposition.
<P>
	My question therefore for the hon. member is when we put 
these two things together, am I to understand that the hon. 
member and the party of which he is a member would support a 
10 per cent tax surcharge on all those earning $60,000 or more?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. The answer to the question is no, of course not. We do 
not advocate or agree with the increase of taxes of any kind on 
anybody.
<P>
	When I talk about members of this House taking a 10 per cent, 
and I am one of them, we are doing this as a gesture to set an 
example to this government to cut spending. This is what I have 
been saying over and over again. Cut spending.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Tell the truth, not all of you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> To my knowledge, all of us, but you are 
talking-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> I just want you to tell the truth. You stand there 
so sanctimonious-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I know there is a 
tremendous amount of interest in today's debate and some 
strong views on either side, but I would remind hon. members to 
direct their comments to the Chair, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe that it is the custom of 
this House that one does not accuse other members of not telling 
the truth. Is this not correct?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> I said tell the truth.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Yes, there is a tradition in 
this House that we regard each other of course as we are, 
honourable members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member would wish 
to come over and audit my books he will find that I have indeed 
taken this cut-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> I did not suggest you did not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> As to any other members of my caucus, I have 
not audited their books, but to my knowledge they have taken it. 
That is all I know. If the hon. member has other knowledge, then 
I think he should present it to me.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="506"> 506 </A></B>
<P>
	Was there a question attached to this or was it just a heckle? 
Apparently there was no question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The question or the 
comment came originally from the member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth.
<P>
	There are a few minutes left in questions and comments. The 
hon. member for Durham.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Mr. Speaker, I liked the 
presentation from the member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia.
<P>
	I note he mentions in his dissertation the debt structure of 
Canada. I note the provincial debt of Saskatchewan is one of the 
highest per capita in this country. It seems to me that did not 
occur with the auspices of any Liberal support.
<P>
	Also, I am very concerned about the aspect of cutting 
expenditures. I think everyone in this country wants to do that. I 
note one of the biggest expenditures that we have currently is 
subsidies to grain farmers. I would like to know what the hon. 
member's orientation is to that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. The Reform Party is on record as wanting to phase 
out all subsidies to all sectors of the economy, including grain 
farmers, but only in a step-by-step program with everyone else. 
There is hardly anyone in this country, probably including me, if 
I look back far enough, who is not getting a subsidy. I would 
suspect almost every member in this House if they have private 
business interests is getting a subsidy of some sort. We are 
opposed to that.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Speak for yourself.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Check it out carefully, sir. I think the hon. 
member will find that we are all on the take, not because we want 
to be but because this is the way the system has grown. This 
monster has been created.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rideout:</B> Ask him to withdraw. That is shameful.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I regret I did not hear the 
comments of the member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia. I would ask for the co-operation of all 
members that if they want to seek the floor they do so on a point 
of order.
<P>
	The time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am honoured that I have been asked today to rise in 
this House on behalf of my constituents in 
Cumberland-Colchester.
<P>
	The roots of my constituents run deep into the history of 
Canada. Cumberland-Colchester contributed two Fathers of 
Confederation, Sir Charles Tupper and Sir Adams George 
Archibald. Sir Charles served Canada briefly as Prime Minister. 
My home town of Truro is the birthplace of that outstanding 
Canadian, Robert Stanfield.
<P>
	Cumberland-Colchester contributed many of its young men 
in service and in many cases ultimate sacrifice for Canada in two 
world wars. Many veterans of the North Nova Highlanders were 
in that historic assault that began the liberation of western 
Europe a half century ago. Fort Cumberland, the first historic 
site one sees as one crosses into Nova Scotia from New 
Brunswick, has witnessed clashed between many nations. The 
early struggles were between the Micmac nation and British 
settlers. The treaty of 1752 finally brought peace and one of 
Nova Scotia's principal Micmac communities, Millbrook, is 
adjacent to Truro today.
<P>
	In 1755, the Acadians, Cumberland-Colchester's first 
European settlers were forced into exile because they would not 
swear allegiance to the British crown during the seven years war 
with France. Some of the Acadian families through great 
diligence ultimately did return. Many of their present day 
descendants farm along the Minas basin in the communities of 
Joggins and Minudie. The famous dykes the 17th century 
ancestors built to reclaim salt marshland are still in place today, 
protecting farmland from incursions of the sea. Just over 20 
years later, we had more civil unrest at Fort Cumberland when 
Colonel Jonathan Eddy of the continental army tried to foment 
an uprising on behalf of the American revolution among the 
New England settlers who replaced the French Acadians. If 
Eddy had succeeded, and he might very well have, Canada today 
would not have an Atlantic coast.
<P>
	As well, Cumberland-Colchester has many black citizens 
with a long, rich history. Some of their ancestors helped build 
the Halifax Citadel as freed men from Jamaica. History knows 
them as the Maroons. Others came back later as black loyalists 
and still others came on the underground railway as fugitive 
slaves. Since Truro became an important railway junction many 
blacks settled in the town as railway workers.
<P>
	As I travel through my constituency from the coastal 
communities of Pugwash, Wallace, Parrsboro and Advocate to 
the larger centres of Springhill, Truro and Amherst, the land is 
as diverse as its people. Its rich history is exhibited in the culture 
of its people and the beauty of the landscape. It is this land and 
these people that I love so much. I have a heartfelt thank you for 
each one of them for the honour and privilege of representing 
them in this magnificent House.
<P>
	For many of my constituents the last 10 years have been the 
cruelest decade. They have witnessed a continuous erosion of 
government services that are basic needs to our rural lifestyle. 
Small communities across  Canada, battered by economic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="507"> 507 </A></B>
<P>
hardships, are struggling to retain their post offices, banks, rail 
lines and bus services.
<P>
	We must remember that when our rural communities fail, 
these people end up in cities, many of them in homeless, pathetic 
situations. All statistics indicate that in the long run it is less 
expensive to live in rural communities. What this government 
needs to offer is a certain minimum level of service to ensure the 
survival of rural Canada.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	For rural Canadians the community post office is probably the 
only federal presence in their lives. If you remove their local 
post office, as Canada Post has done in over 1,400 small 
communities, including seven in my riding, you virtually say to 
them: ``You do not matter''.
<P>
	I was struck by the Governor General's remarks last week that 
public trust in the institution of government is essential to the 
attainment of the government's agenda for Canada. I am pleased 
that my government is committed to maintaining rural postal 
service as I have fought to save the Truro post office and restore 
dignity to rural Canada.
<P>
	My constituents in Cumberland-Colchester are very 
sensitive to anything that threatens their standards and values. 
Until very recently they lived in communities where doors could 
be left unlocked and where vandalism, theft, murder, assault and 
robbery were very rare. Unfortunately that is no longer true.
<P>
	Their concern about crime centres on the Young Offenders 
Act. Many believe that the Young Offenders Act is not working, 
that it does not deter nor does it reform young criminals. Above 
all else, they believe the Young Offenders Act must be changed 
to give the victims real justice.
<P>
	In 1989 the family and friends of Andrea Rogers founded the 
Truro branch of Citizens United for Safety and Justice. Their 
main objective is to ensure that the safety of children and all 
innocent citizens of Canada takes precedence over the rights of 
criminals.
<P>
	A hit and run driver in North Vancouver killed Andrea Rogers. 
Subsequently caught and convicted the driver, a young offender, 
received a suspended sentence of 100 hours of community 
service, one year's probation and lost his drivers licence for two 
years.
<P>
	I would like to thank the parents of Andrea Rogers, Citizens 
United for Safety and Justice and the Truro branch of the 
Canadian Federation of University Women for their 
recommended changes to the Young Offenders Act. I wish to 
assure them that I have presented their recommendations to the 
justice minister and will defend them vigorously in this House.
<P>
	I want us to meet our campaign commitment to bring 
meaningful gun control to Canada. We must closely consult with 
the provinces and respected shooting sporting groups so that we 
can disarm the criminal and the irresponsible without undue 
hardship on responsible, law-abiding gun owners.
<P>
	I therefore welcome the government's stated intent to restore 
the Law Reform Commission. I trust it will also have the 
promised mandate to consult widely with the public on 
sentencing, parole and other criminal justice issues.
<P>
	We Atlantic Canadians are perceived to have a deep-seated 
economic problems despite the fact that we have thousands of 
successful small businesses as well as some outstanding 
corporate successes such as the Sobeys, McCains and Irvings. 
Our problem is not a lack of enterprise, it is the lack of a 
sufficient capital pool.
<P>
	Ironically, Atlantic Canadians do generate considerable 
capital through their savings, pension contributions and 
investments. Unfortunately this capital flows into funds that 
leave the region. That is why I welcome the government's 
pledge to work with our national financial institutions to 
improve access to capital for small business and long term job 
creation.
<P>
	I applaud the throne speech proposal to foster technology 
partnerships between our universities, research institutions and 
the private sector. In my riding the Nova Scotia Agricultural 
College has been doing this for some time. Not only has this 
college provided expertise to Atlantic Canada farmers and food 
processors, but to developing countries and the eastern 
European nations as well.
<P>
	The Nova Scotia Agricultural College bachelor of science 
degree in agriculture is widely respected and now the college 
proposes a new bachelor of science degree in aquaculture. I 
applaud the staff for the foresight in recognizing that as the 
marine fishery continues its decline, there is a considerable 
opportunity for Atlantic Canada to get its share of the world's 
aquaculture production, which by the year 2000 is expected to 
provide 25 per cent of the total fish harvest. I also salute the staff

	Coming from a business background I always equate 
government to business. Just as business must stay close to its 
customers, so must this government stay close to the people we 
serve. Just as a business must have high quality employees, so 
must this government have members of integrity. And just as 
employee trust is essential to a company's success, so is the 
electorate's trust vital to our government's success.
<P>
	This is a very exciting time to be a member of Parliament. I 
have the highest praise for our Prime Minister for scheduling 
all-party debates on major issues before and not after a decision 
is made. We saw this open process this week when debate was 
held on cruise missile testing and peacekeeping, and I look 
forward to the pre-budget debates next week. If we stick to the 
philosophy whereby economic policy must sustain 
environmental policy, must sustain social policy, then with 
continued open debate and responsible public spending we will 
succeed, we will win the trust of the electorate.

	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate my hon. colleague for speaking about rural 
Canada. She seems to be very fond of small communities. She 
also spoke about post offices and it is true that the post office in a 
small community is a vitally important institution.
<P>
	In my riding we have the <I>Ralliement populaire</I>. Before that we 
had <I>Opération dignité</I> the goal of which was to save small 
communities, because if small communities are allowed to die 
out, surely the same fate will befall small towns.
<P>
	Therefore I share my hon. colleague's sentiments and she can 
rest assured that she has an ally in me.
<P>
	Now, regarding the question of post offices, one of my 
constituents called to tell me that new postal outlets were still 
opening up. And while there have been no further post office 
closures per se since a moratorium has or will be imposed, I 
would like the hon. member to tell me if in fact it is true that new 
postal outlets are opening up?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> I thank the member for his question. Across 
the country people are concerned with closures of rural post 
offices. It was a mandate of our government to cease closing 
post offices. As he will recall, shortly after this government was 
elected the Minister of Public Works stopped the closing of post 
offices. A freeze was put on the closure of post offices. It is our 
mandate to ensure that freeze stays on post office closures until 
we have a complete look at restoring rural services across 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like as 
well to congratulate the hon. member for what I thought was a 
wonderful speech. She can rest assured that she has much 
support for what she said in the Reform Party caucus.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	It goes to show what I have believed for some time. It is that 
the reform that is sweeping across the country certainly goes 
beyond the borders of the Reform Party of Canada.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member if she would be prepared 
to elaborate her thoughts, time permitting, on two areas that she 
touched on, the Young Offenders Act and the gun control bill. 
Would she be willing to share with us her thoughts about the 
amendment to these two bills?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his thoughts that rural post offices transcend party 
lines and that all parties have the common thread in this House 
for us to seek to serve the people of Canada in rural areas 
because they are the backbone of this country.
<P>
	Thinking of the Young Offenders Act and gun control, many 
constituents in my riding have brought forward their own 
thoughts. I spoke of the young teenage girl whose parents live in 
my riding. She was going to university in Vancouver and was 
struck and killed by a young offender. As I said in my speech 
there were very small reprisals for that offence.
<P>
	They have brought forward numerous recommendations on 
the Young Offenders Act and on gun control and I believe 
without going into great depth that I am presenting them to the 
Minister of Justice and I will debate them in this House when 
those debates come forward. The whole purpose is to assure 
justice and some consideration for the victim and to ensure that 
we rehabilitate the young offender and not incarcerate him for a 
long period for a life of crime. He must receive proper 
punishment to suit the crime.
<P>
	In terms of gun control we would like to not have a blanket 
obliteration of the use of firearms but let us be more severe in 
punishing those who offend rather than renege on all firearms 
across the board.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
unfortunately the throne speech was silent on two particularly 
important issues. But, before addressing these issues, I would 
like to thank my constituents for their majority support of the 
sovereignty option in Quebec.
<P>
	Saint-Hubert voters have unequivocally sanctioned my 
decision to join the Bloc Quebecois on August 12, 1991. My 
decision was endorsed by 56,6 percent of the electorate, or 
15,000 more votes than my Liberal opponent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	The riding of Saint-Hubert is a high-tech aeronautical 
engineering and airport centre. Located on Montreal's south 
shore with an 84 per cent francophone majority, it includes the 
cities of Saint-Hubert and Lemoyne and part of Longueuil, as 
well as the city of Greenfield Park with its large and dynamic 
anglophone population.
<P>
	I want to speak for every one of my constituents in my 
response to the throne speech. This speech is a universal 
disappointment because the economic solutions it proposes are 
unsatisfactory and because it lacks a clear message for the 
unemployed and for low-income Canadians.
<P>
	In his speech, the Opposition leader denounced the lack of 
vision of this government, which is unable to give Canadians 
hope for a real economic recovery.
<P>
	Others before me have already listed the wide gaps left in the 
throne speech with regard to taxation, public finances and the 
economy.
<P>
	I want to deal with two questions raised by the national 
conscience, on which this government does not seem to have a 
position. Although we are concerned about the economy, social 
issues are equally pressing.
<P>
	While Canadians and Quebecers are impatiently calling for 
vigorous state intervention on crime, the throne speech bitterly 
disappoints us by not addressing the urgent need to control 
firearms. Existing legislation, even laws that were recently 
improved, must be amended in order to meet objectives.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	The throne speech was full of good intentions. However, 
where are the promised positive, concrete measures aimed at 
increasing public safety and crime prevention, as mentioned in 
the throne speech? Why have they not been identified?
<P>
	The number of family incidents involving shotguns, pistols 
and revolvers is increasing. Women continue to be the most 
common victims of deadly assaults with prohibited or restricted 
weapons. Handguns are still the preferred weapon for 
committing suicide. There is a general consensus that the 
amendments brought about by Bill C-17 on gun control were a 
step in the right direction, but Canadians and Quebecers are 
telling us that we have not gone far enough.
<P>
	Despite the new regulations calling for improved screening 
with respect to firearms acquisition, it is disturbing that 
civilians are still allowed to own semi-automatic weapons. 
Most of the firearms in circulation are not registered and all a 
person needs to acquire a pistol or a revolver is a certificate 
which can be obtained free of charge.
<P>
	An Angus Reid poll conducted on September 15 and 16, 1993, 
revealed broad public support for the registration of all 
firearms. Such a move is supported by 86 per cent of all 
Canadians, including 91 per cent of all Quebecers, while 70 per 
cent of Canadians, and 79 per cent of Quebecers want an outright 
ban on assault weapons and handguns.
<P>
	Where in the throne speech can we find any indication of a 
willingness on the part of the government to address these 
urgent expectations and to ease the concerns of citizens across 
the country? As we all know, the legislative priorities of this 
House are economic in nature given the serious hardships 
experienced by Canadians and Quebecers. However, fighting 
crime should top the list of the government's major concerns, 
particularly because of the social tensions and personal dramas 
stemming from the state of the economy.
<P>
	Even with the recent amendments to the Criminal Code, it is 
still a simple matter to acquire a firearm and the cost involved is 
merely symbolic. This House should take courageous steps, 
setting aside partisanship, and give Canadians the protection 
they want. It is estimated that more than six million handguns 
are currently in circulation in Canada. This is indeed a 
frightening statistic.
<P>
	What we need is a universal registration system for all types 
of firearms. The sale, trade and resale of weapons needs to be 
regulated. A genuine policy should be formulated for training 
dealers, who should be required to pay licensing fees to finance 
control programs. Restrictions should be placed on the 
acquisition of restricted weapons and users of these types of 
weapons should be required to obtain an annual permit.
<P>
	A permit should also be required to purchase ammunition. All 
citizens should have the opportunity to oppose all applications 
for permits to acquire or carry weapons. A notice of application 
should be published in advance in the newspapers, as happens in 
the case of several kinds of licenses, including liquor licenses.
<P>
	All automatic and semi-automatic weapons should be 
banned. Strict minimum sentences should be imposed on 
persons convicted of possession of illegal weapons. Local 
registrars should be given mandatory investigative powers. 
Finally, and most importantly, the cost of permits should be 
increased to give the provinces more money with which to 
enforce these controls, because without them, even the best of 
laws will remain nothing more than wishful thinking.
<P>
	Had all of these measures been in place, I am confident that 
the Auditor General would not have made the comments he did 
in his report about weapons smuggling.

	It can never be said often enough: in two years, firearms have 
killed more Americans than the entire Vietnam war.
<P>
	In the U.S., the dramatic figure of 24,000 murders committed 
with handguns every year has impelled the Clinton 
administration to pass new regulations to control the sale of 
weapons. In Canada, murders and deaths due to firearms have 
not reached the magnitude of the American slaughter, but every 
year 1,400 Canadians are shot dead.
<P>
	Even with its flagrant flaws, our firearm control system, as 
opposed to the free movement of weapons American-style, 
makes all the difference when we measure the quality of life in 
Canadian cities and helps more than other factors to strengthen 
the fabric of Canadian life. And even if a single life is spared 
because an irresponsible or desperate violent individual was 
unable to acquire a firearm, we will have achieved our goal. As 
additional evidence, a July 1992 report by the Research and 
Statistics Directorate of the Department of Justice establishes a 
close correlation between the number of firearms in circulation 
and the suicide rate per 100,000 Canadians.
<P>
	According to the authors of the report, since the adoption, in 
1977, of legislative and regulatory measures to control firearms, 
the suicide rate has dropped substantially. We have here 
numerous briefs and reports establishing a direct link between 
owning a firearm and using it for illegal purposes resulting in 
loss of life. The Department of Justice has all these reports.
<P>
	We must now go beyond these reports unanimously repeating 
the need for tighter controls. We must legislate to protect 
democracy. We must protect our democracy, which is not based 
on the force of arms but on the people's will allowing us to 
assemble in this House to express our differences in a civilized 
fashion.
<P>
	The report published, a few days after the election, by the 
Baird Royal Commission unexpectedly set up by the previous 
government raised another social issue that is less current but 
equally relevant. How can this government totally ignore the 
widespread public criticism levelled at the Baird Report tabled 
by the Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies?
<P>
	We have all seen that this Commission's mandate only led to a 
report that was outdated the day it came out and whose 
conclusions were widely criticized. We would have liked the 
government to tell us whether budget restrictions are still at the 
top of its priorities, to give us a policy statement on the futility 
of allocating public funds to such royal commissions.
<P>
	The throne speech announces prenatal nutrition programs for 
low-income pregnant women. But did we hear any reference to a 
global policy on fertility that could be based on or move away 
from the report's conclusions?
<P>
	On the positive side, this Commission, which tabled its report 
two years late, drew our attention to recent developments and 
warned us against abuse by big business and dangerous practices 
calling for immediate action. Its report also proposes measures 
encroaching on provincial jurisdiction in the health-care sector. 
The establishment of a federal agency to deal with the whole 
issue of regulating reproductive technologies would be akin to 
the proverbial fly in the constitutional ointment.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	We think that this flawed report, produced at a prohibitive 
cost of $28 million in these tough economic times, is already 
outdated by new scientific facts.
<P>
	This government has not yet denounced the Baird Report. 
There is every reason to believe that it will act like previous 
governments, preferring to leave it to a royal commission to deal 
with urgent questions raised by new social situations.
<P>
	Infertility is a big issue for many women and the couples it 
affects. It is lived differently from one province to another and 
from one social milieu to another. It is a current issue which the 
industry and its powerful lobbies are trying to use for purposes 
completely unrelated to people's legitimate aspiration to 
reproduce in dignity and with respect for the person.
<P>
	We believe that the government must act quickly to avoid 
legislating later when faced with a <I>fait accompli</I>. On these issues 
and all other social, economic and political concerns of 
Canadians, we were waiting for signs, messages and evidence of 
a real intention to act from the government. But with all due 
respect for all members of this Parliament, I would ask you to 
note my deep dissatisfaction with the governing party's 
abdication of its social responsibilities, its premature fatigue 
when faced with the government financial crisis and its obvious 
lack of perspective on all the expectations of Canadians and the 
regions.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the hon. member about her firearms registration 
proposal. While I agree there must be changes to the gun 
legislation, does the member realize what she is asking the 
government to do? Does the hon. member not realize that such 
actions have been taken by other jurisdictions? I refer to New 
Zealand where it resulted in a total breakdown of the registration 
process costing the taxpayers millions of dollars and a logistical 
problem that was insurmountable.
<P>
	Would the member please advise this House which study she 
is referring to that would back up her position to register all 
firearms. Realistically that is an impossible task. In effect would 
it not violate the right to own property?

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that you yourself were on 
the firearms committee when we discussed firearms 
registration. The gun lobby kept coming and saying that we 
could not register all firearms because it would cost too much. 
However, I have firearms at home, so I can tell you how I bought 
them. With my firearms acquisition certificate, of course, I went 
to a gun dealer to buy the weapon I wanted. He immediately 
entered my firearms acquisition certificate number in a register, 
as well as a description of the weapon. Why could he not then 
simply record it on an electronic network connecting all of 
Canada, or just a provincial system, because it could also be 
done provincially, or, if you prefer, a duplicate could be made 
and sent to a central firearms registry. It is not expensive. The 
argument that an electronic system would cost too much does 
not stand up; it is completely wrong to begin with.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
with respect to the comments of the hon. member, I come from 
the province of Saskatchewan where people cherish their 
independence very much and certainly do not appreciate the 
interference of government at most stages, including taxation, 
but I will not get into that.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	Since most deaths occur in Canada on highways and not from 
the use of firearms, and many injuries in this country result not 
from the use of firearms but from the use of knives, are we not 
placing the wrong emphasis on further trying to control 
firearms? Are there not diminishing returns where further 
legislation will not result in further reduction of crime by the use 
of firearms?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> At the beginning of his speech, the hon. member 
said no new taxes were to be expected. I was not talking about 
taxes. I was talking about permits, the purchase of permits and 
the fact that we always seem to be in favour of user fees. 
Currently, we simply allow people to buy guns. Right now, all 
you have to do is get a $50 firearm certificate valid for five years 
and you can buy an unlimited number of firearms. It is a little 
much to ask of those who eventually have to pay for the people 
who want to buy firearms.
<P>
	All those permits, the permits to carry a gun or to own a gun, 
all of those firearm permits are free, except for the restricted 
firearm certificate. All the others are free.
<P>
	Why could firearm owners not pay for those permits, and I 
mean pay a fair price for them, not just a token amount of $50 for 
five years? That is totally ridiculous.
<P>
	The hon. member voiced another reservation concerning the 
fact that more people die of injuries caused by knives or cutting 
and stabbing weapons that by guns and firearms. I would like to 
see the statistics on that, because that is not what we heard in 
committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was interested in the 
comment of the hon. member for Saint-Hubert on the ease with 
which an FAC can be obtained under the new legislation.
<P>
	The problem I have to deal with the most in my constituency 
and the greatest single source of complaints I am getting is in the 
difficulty and the delay in getting FACs under this new act. I get 
more on that than I do on UIC, on income tax, on just about 
everything else put together. It is taking, believe it or not, up to 
five months to get an FAC which is supposed to be available in 
28 days. When these people phone the authorities concerned, 
they simply say that there is a backlog and they cannot do it.
<P>
	The other problem which is going to arise very soon is this 
question of the tests that have to be taken to determine whether 
or not one is suitable to have an FAC.
<P>
	Most people in my part of the country own firearms, or have 
owned firearms from the time they were about 12 years old and 
they are quite expert and experienced in their handling and use. 
Yet anyone of those people will now have to go to some 
bureaucrat who probably knows less about firearms than they do 
and take a government sponsored course which will cost them a 
few hundred dollars before they will be able to get a new FAC. 
This is absurd.
<P>
	When anyone tells me that this new law is working well, I 
have to from my experience take a lot of issue with that.
<P>
	The other thing I would like to mention perhaps is more 
philosophical. The hon. member does have a certain mindset 
which is very common in this country, particularly in urban 
areas, with respect to the restriction of owning firearms by 
common citizens.
<P>
	I spent many years of my life in Third World countries. This is 
basically the way it is done in the Third World. The only people 
who own firearms or who can easily get permission to own 
firearms are criminals and agents of the state and it sometimes is 
difficult to distinguish between them, but that is the way it is.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I would rather live in freedom in a country in which we do not 
have big brother looking over our shoulders at every respect 
than to live in one of those peaceful paradises that I have in 
which the ordinary citizen really does not have the right to that 
most basic of all human rights: to own arms to defend himself 
and his family.

about the famous 28-day waiting period.
<P>
	In Quebec now, applications are mostly processed on time. 
Since the hon. member is from Saskatchewan, I think he should 
put pressure in that area. In my province, anyway, it is going 
very well.
<P>
	As for the firearms handling certificate, in Quebec, we have a 
hunter's certificate. To go hunting, you need that certificate, 
which is good for two years. So that is a difference between 
Saskatchewan and our province, because it seems to me that 
they do not need a hunting certificate, since as he said, people 
have gone hunting for years without ever taking a course on 
handling firearms. In our province, you must take a course on 
handling firearms to obtain the certificate.
<P>
	In closing, I wanted to say that there may be big differences 
between his province and ours in the way the laws are applied, 
unfortunately.

	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
allow me to echo the sentiments of my colleagues who have 
risen before me in this House and congratulate you on your 
appointment.
<P>
	This new government faces a great number of daunting tasks, 
not the least of which is how to give Canadians a reason to 
believe in the dedication, perseverance and sound ethical 
judgment of their elected leaders.
<P>
	Each of us was sent to this House because our constituents 
believe that we are the men and women most firmly committed 
to their concerns, their needs and their demands. However, we 
are more than our individual selves and we are more than our 
collective individual voices. We were elected to represent in this 
Parliament the collective voice of our constituents reconciling 
their competing and at times conflicting visions with the others.
<P>
	The aim of Canada's House of Commons is not to serve the 
selfish and parochial interests of any one person or province to 
the detriment of others. It is to advance the well-being and 
prosperity of the whole country and therefore of all Canadians.
<P>
	We were elected on this side of the House to fulfil the Liberal 
vision which was clearly articulated in our election platform, 
the red book ``Creating Opportunity''.
<P>
	Everyday in my riding of Winnipeg North I talk with honest, 
hard working people eager to put their faith in hard working and 
honest politicians. For five solid years, from 1988 when I was 
first elected until last fall's election, I had fear.
<P>
	I had a fear that 1.6 million Canadians, the unemployed in this 
country would remain jobless. I had a fear that the poor, 
particularly children, would continue to depend on social 
assistance. I had a fear that the sick, the elderly and all 
Canadians for that matter would continue to face the 
consequence of a threatened medicare system and the 
uncertainty that goes with it. I had a fear that the minorities, be it 
due to race, colour or creed and the disabled would continue to 
face unfair treatment and discrimination in the workplace.
<P>
	I had a fear that the infrastructure of cities and municipalities 
would continue to decay without help from the federal 
government. I had a fear that the safety and security of persons 
and property would continue to be in peril. I had a fear that 
honesty and integrity in government would never be restored. I 
had a fear that Canada would close its doors to immigrants.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Last but not least I had a fear that Canada my adopted country 
and home to some 27 million Canadians was on the brink of 
national collapse. However, I had always hoped that my fears 
would not come to pass.
<P>
	Now I am certain that there is much hope for this great nation. 
I have hope because this government has already taken 
significant strides to enhance its integrity by rejecting many of 
the unessential privileges parliamentarians had exercised for so 
many years during their tenures as public servants.
<P>
	I have hope because each political party represented in this 
House has already voiced its commitment to seeking 
consultation from the public on a wide range of issues of great 
national importance.
<P>
	I have hope because the finance minister has already made 
good on this commitment by talking to people across the country 
in an effort to formulate a federal budget that is both sensible 
and sensitive. I am confident that the minister will continue in 
the short number of days remaining before budget day to consult 
with all Canadians from all walks of life.
<P>
	We must never let ourselves forget that each time we make 
fiscal decisions here in Ottawa we may be affecting the wallets 
and pocketbooks and the day to day budgets of individual 
citizens in ridings like yours and mine.
<P>
	I have hope because this government promptly cancelled the 
questionable deal that was to lead to the privatization of portions 
of Toronto's Pearson airport.

allowing its leader to jet around in a $53 million VIP aircraft or a

meet.

recovery are our plans for the immediate future. It is our 
policies, ideals and blueprints for the years to come.
<P>
	I am assured because we are committed to helping and 
supporting small and medium sized businesses that will create 
long term jobs in the country. I am assured because our plan to 
get youth working again will be realistic because we will be 
creating the youth corps service and national apprenticeship 
program. I am assured because this is a government that 
understands the importance of investing in people.
<P>
	All Canadians use their work to varying degrees to define who 
they are. When they are not working their self esteem suffers, 
their relationships suffer and their dignity suffers.
<P>
	I am assured that our health care system is now to remain as 
universal and free for all. I am assured because the speech from 
the throne reaffirmed our commitment and the plan to have a 
national forum on health care is underway. In fact, the plan to 
establish a centre of excellence for women's health and a 
prenatal program across the country is underway.
<P>
	It was not long ago that in a moment of great anger I stood up 
in this House on behalf of one of my constituents and questioned 
whether the previous government had any heart at all. Today I 
am proud to stand before you. I am assured that this is a 
government with plenty of heart.
<P>
	We are speaking for the first time in a long time the language 
of those we represent. In short our ideals are backed by plausible 
and realistic means of implementation.
<P>
	We are also keenly aware that it is self-defeating to focus only 
on any one issue before us. The issue of the economy, social 
policies and the environment and many more are all interrelated 
and interdependent.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I know you share with me the desire to see this 
Parliament mark a turning point in our great nation's history. I 
began by indicating the daunting task we all know the 
government has to face.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	I mentioned the fears that plagued me during my first five 
years as a member of this House. Given those fears how is it 
possible for me to feel the hope and assurance I now feel after 
just a short period of time in government?
<P>
	I have seen what we have accomplished so far. I know that we 
will follow through on our promises and thereby resolve the 
fears of Canadians. Give them jobs, reform and stabilize our 
institutions and in the end control the deficit.
<P>
	Citizens will continue to demonstrate the kind of support that 
sent 177 Liberals to this House in October 1993. I hope that the 
people of Winnipeg North and Canadians everywhere sense that 
great changes are afoot.
<P>
	The next four years will reveal a new kind of government, a 
new kind of leadership and a new Canada that is united, strong 
and prosperous and working for all Canadians today and 
preparing Canada for the 21st century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is my first 
opportunity to speak in this House. I represent the riding of 
Chambly which, for those of you who do not know, is located on 
Montreal's south shore, between Mont Saint-Bruno and Mont 
Beloeil, along the Richelieu River, which flows from Lake 
Champlain into the St. Lawrence River.
<P>
	I was listening to my colleague from Winnipeg North and, of 
course, his speech was in the best tradition of his party. I also 
realize that my hon. colleague was, it seems, almost traumatized 
by the previous Parliament in which he had the pleasure of 
serving as a member of the opposition.
<P>
	When the hon. member for Winnipeg North talks about a new 
Canada, as a Quebecer I would like to ask him to clarify for me 
certain paragraph in the speech from the throne, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Government will work vigorously to fulfil its responsibilities to ensure 
that federalism meets the needs of Canadians, recognizing that all Canadians 
share in the responsibility for making Canada work. It will be the policy of the 
Government to seek to clarify the federal government's responsibilities in 
relation to those of other orders of government, to eliminate overlap and 
duplication, and to find better ways to provide services so that they represent the 
best value for taxpayers' dollars and respond to the real needs of people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If this paragraph had been read to me outside this House, I 
could have easily believed, and with good reason, that it was 
written by the leader of my party. But since it comes from the 
government party, it is obviously a summary of their red book. 
My question to the hon. member is this: How can he reconcile 
his vision of Canada which he described earlier with his party's 
vision of a renewed Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to respond to the 
hon. member's questions for which I thank the hon. member.
<P>
	Certainly my vision of Canada that I just articulated is the 
very vision that we as Liberals have developed as we travelled 
around the country. We would like a Canada that exists for all 
Canadians irrespective of geography, race, colour or origin. 
Whether Canadians have been born in this country or whether 
they come from across the seas or across the oceans, we are all 
equal and ought to receive the benefits of our nation and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="514"> 514 </A></B>
<P>
federalism  would respond to the needs of Canadians. For that 
we must have federal institutions.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Institutions do not mean only buildings. Institutions refer to 
programs that we have in this country. Let me mention national 
medicare. That is the type of institution I see and the Liberals 
see that will continue to respond to all Canadians irrespective of 
geography and with no user fees to make it very specific.
<P>
	There is the question of how we can avoid overlapping. This 
government has already announced its plan to eliminate trade 
barriers that in a sense also allow for duplication. We have plans 
to eliminate duplication so that small and medium sized 
businesses can thrive and thrive prosperously.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I begin by adding my 
voice to those of many others who have spoken to congratulate 
you upon your appointment as Speaker. May I observe that in the 
few days you have presided it is already evident through your 
leadership in the House that members will better achieve the 
objective we all share which is a forum of civility and decorum 
acting in the public interest.
<P>
	I feel enormously proud to take my place in this Chamber as 
the representative of Etobicoke Centre. The riding I represent is 
a diverse and a vital one whose needs and strengths reflect to a 
great degree those of Canada in these challenging times. During 
the election campaign, as was the case with so many of my 
colleagues, I had the opportunity to visit over 30,000 doorways 
in Etobicoke Centre and among other things I learned first hand 
the extent to which Canadians everywhere feel strongly about 
the important justice issues of our day. For me it is a great 
privilege to be in this Chamber not only as the member of 
Parliament for my constituents but also as their representative in 
cabinet dealing with justice issues.
<P>
	It has been said that justice is the first of the social virtues. In 
its absence all else seems contrived. When the scales are in 
balance the way is open for the best in our nature to emerge.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As Minister of Justice of Canada, I am fully aware of my duty 
to initiate the development of policies and proposals to 
strengthen our justice system, which without the shadow of a 
doubt is one of the best, most flexible and fairest in the world.
<P>
	Canadians have a system of justice that is bilingual and drawn 
from two different legal systems; the international community 
considers it to be a model of tolerance, integrity and openness. 
Although two distinct legal systems are developing, at the same 
time, they serve to advance a single idea in Canada, the primacy 
of law.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	During these past 10 weeks I have worked with members of 
the department of justice and my colleagues to identify the 
immediate priorities for this portfolio at this time.
<P>
	I wish to take this opportunity to outline for the House at least 
in general terms the priorities which we see as the most urgent.
<P>
	In recent weeks I have had the opportunity to meet with 
members of the parties opposite, or at least some of them, to 
discuss their perspectives with respect to justice matters. I have 
found that they have valuable perspectives, that I look forward 
to working with them and that we have really common 
objectives in the public service so far as justice issues are 
concerned. That will ensure that Canada has the best and most 
effective system of justice possible. I respect their perspectives 
and, as I say, I look forward to working with them.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	The justice agenda I will describe today falls generally into 
three categories: first, measures to deal with violence and 
initiatives to prevent crime; second, proposals to ensure the law 
promotes equality in the diversity of today's Canada and 
provides for equal access to justice; and third, steps to 
modernize our laws so they reflect current values and meet the 
challenge of changing times.
<P>
	Let me acknowledge at the outset that which must be evident. 
It will be impossible for us to achieve meaningful progress on 
any justice issues without collaboration with our provincial and 
territorial counterparts. So much that is on our agenda involves 
shared jurisdictions. It needs co-operative collaboration. We 
cannot succeed alone and I acknowledge that at the outset. I will 
work with my provincial counterparts in addressing the 
objectives which I will describe today.
<P>
	Let me first deal with measures dealing with violence and 
initiatives to prevent crime. The speech from the throne 
contained a commitment to enhance community safety and 
crime prevention. Canadians are determined to preserve the 
peaceful, orderly and safe communities that reflect our society's 
values. One of Canada's defining characteristics is our deep 
sense of order and civility. Yet in a society that abhors crime and 
violence, there is increasing concern for the safe and peaceful 
communities we feel are being threatened by crime, and 
particularly violent crime.
<P>
	The time has come for us to send the message loud and clear 
that violence in any form will not be tolerated. We shall not 
stand for it from any individual, from any group, of any age. Yet 
our response to the problems of crime and violence must also 
reflect the very values that we seek to preserve. We must not 
simply become harsh, although stern measures will sometimes 
be required. We must recognize and address the causes of crime 
and put appropriate emphasis on rehabilitation, on treatment 
where that is required.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="515"> 515 </A></B>
<P>
	Several recent and comprehensive studies have urged in the 
strongest terms that Canada develop a coherent national strategy 
for crime prevention.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Last year, the Standing Committee on Justice and the Solicitor 
General asked the federal government to take the lead and 
recommended that together with the provinces, territories and 
municipalities, it develop a national crime prevention strategy.
<P>
	The special advisory committee on a Canadian strategy for 
community safety and crime prevention made the same 
recommendation. Crime prevention must take into account the 
fundamental causes of crime: poverty, sexual exploitation of 
children, family dysfunction, racial inequality and inefficient or 
underfunded social services.
<P>
	Our government is determined to develop an integrated crime 
prevention strategy. Together with the other levels of 
government, the police, victims' groups and community 
organizations, we will make a priority of looking at the 
fundamental causes of criminal behaviour and eliminating 
them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We will create a national crime prevention council and 
convene it at the earliest possible date to start preparing a 
comprehensive crime prevention strategy, and within that 
strategy, specific community based tactics to prevent crime. We 
will consult broadly on its mandate. We will ensure that it is not 
simply window dressing. We will make it meaningful. And we 
will need and we will appreciate the views of the members of all 
parties in this House as we put it together.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Turning now to another aspect of our response to violent 
crime, this government is determined to address squarely and 
openly the widespread concerns about the Young Offenders Act 
as it relates to violent crime among young people.
<P>
	We will soon introduce legislation reflecting the 
commitments made during the election campaign to make 
specific changes to the statute: increased sentences for specific 
violent crime, the greater sharing of information about young 
offenders with those who need to know for reasons of safety, the 
creation of the category of dangerous youth offender for certain 
violent repeat offenders, adjustments to the provisions 
respecting transfers from youth to adult court and steps to 
ensure that treatment will be available for those young offenders 
who need it most.
<P>
	At the same time, I intend also to initiate a thorough public 
review of the Young Offenders Act to ensure that it continues to 
serve the interests of justice in Canada. Canadians must be 
satisfied that the Young Offenders Act strikes the proper balance 
between, on the one hand, the protection of society, and on the 
other, recognition of the special needs of young persons in 
contact with the criminal justice system.
<P>
	We will involve Parliament in this exercise of review in 
keeping with our commitments toward a consultative process 
contained in our election platform. As part of our review of the 
statute as a whole, we will have regard to the many helpful 
submissions that my department has received during the past 
few months as part of the public consultation process.
<P>
	In addition, we shall demonstrate that Canada will not tolerate 
the manipulation and exploitation of young people by adults for 
criminal purposes. We will do this by encouraging law 
enforcement officials to make greater use of existing provisions 
of the Criminal Code which make it an offence to induce others 
to commit crime.
<P>
	Still addressing the question of violent crime, I can tell the 
House that in the present session we will take steps to address 
concerns about the release of high-risk offenders into society at 
the end of their custodial terms.
<P>
	Taking into account the imperatives of the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms, we shall find ways by which society can protect 
itself from individuals who may be unfit for release. In many 
cases this issue will arise at the intersection of the criminal 
justice system and the health care system. For that reason it will 
be essential for us to develop these responses in concert once 
again with our provincial counterparts and we will consult for 
that purpose with those officials.
<P>
	The government will address the serious problem of violence 
against women and children, including domestic violence, not 
as a women's issue, but as a justice issue. We acknowledge that 
violence against women is linked to their lack of economic 
equality. I will work with others, among them the Secretary of 
State for the Status of Women, to develop and introduce 
measures to promote equality and safety for women, both in 
their homes and in public places.
<P>
	In support of this commitment and as Minister of Justice, I 
will work with federal, provincial and territorial colleagues to 
introduce appropriate justice reforms. We shall sponsor public 
education programs to increase understanding of violence 
against women. We will increase levels of funding for transition 
houses that provide refuge for victims of domestic abuse. We 
shall introduce changes to the nature and effect of peace bonds 
and more effectively protect spouses from abusive partners. We 
shall work in collaboration with colleagues in the department of 
human resources to ensure that court ordered child support 
payments are made.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	It makes little sense for a government that is having to come 
to grips with massive deficits to pay out annually extraordinary 
sums to single parents, mostly mothers, when they are the 
beneficiaries of court orders that are not being respected. We are 
determined to find a way to make those responsible for making 
payments under court orders comply with those obligations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="516"> 516 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally in this category, the government will take steps to 
reflect the widespread public expectation that there will be 
stricter gun control in Canada. We shall act on our campaign 
commitments in that regard.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In co-operation with other departments, we will tackle the 
problem of illegal arms smuggling. We will see to it that better 
statistics are compiled on the criminal use of firearms. We will 
scrutinize the list of prohibited weapons to see if it should be 
added to. We will strengthen the current legislation which 
provides for a separate offense if a weapon is used for criminal 
purposes. But we will not however disregard the views of 
legitimate firearm owners who now have to meet certain 
requirements before purchasing such weapons.
<P>
	We will review the types of weapons sold in Canada and we 
will consider measures to ensure that no weapon falls into the 
hands of criminals or unfit individuals.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The second broad category to which I wish to refer has to do 
with equality before the law. Equal access to justice and equal 
treatment in the justice system are fundamental principles in 
Canadian society, a society that is increasingly diverse. There is, 
however, mounting evidence that our justice system is falling 
far short of the high standards that Canadians expect.
<P>
	A number of recent and authoritative studies have established 
there is a significant degree of gender inequality in Canada's 
justice system. The present government is committed to 
addressing gender issues both in the justice system and in 
society generally.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Department of Justice acted on the recommendations 
made by the working group chaired by Madam Justice Bertha 
Wilson. As a matter of fact, the department has already received 
an internal report which lists in detail steps aimed at eliminating 
the systemic inequalities prevalent in its own organization.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am sure all members of this House will agree with me that a 
strong and independent judiciary is a fundamental element of a 
free society. Canadians are justly proud of the high quality of 
our judges. For my part, I shall bring forward to cabinet 
recommendations for judicial appointments that reflect 
competence and merit in order to maintain the present high level 
of confidence that Canadians feel in the judiciary that serves 
justice in Canada.
<P>
	Another important element of our approach to equality before 
the law in a diverse Canada is the search for better ways of 
ensuring that the justice needs of aboriginal peoples are 
recognized and acted upon. Canadians generally tell us that our 
system of justice, despite its strengths, could work better. They 
are right.
<P>
	Aboriginal people, among others, say the law has become a 
system more about process than about justice and to some extent 
they are right. In many aboriginal communities there is now a 
remarkable will to actually try to do something about this 
challenge. It is a will to carve out new relationships with the 
justice system. The process of change will be gradual and 
difficult but we have an obligation to aggressively pursue this 
opportunity for change. We shall work closely in these efforts 
with our provincial and territorial colleagues and with the 
aboriginal leadership, with the communities and with aboriginal 
individuals, who are prepared to improve the administration of 
justice.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	A further aspect of equality before the law in Canada has to do 
with the Canadian Human Rights Act. In the throne speech the 
Prime Minister's commitment made during the election 
campaign was renewed. We shall introduce amendments to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act. These amendments, among other 
things, will include sexual orientation as a ground upon which 
discrimination is prohibited.
<P>
	The House has been committed to that principle for many 
years, and successive governments have expressed the intention 
to introduce the amendment. This government shall do so, not 
just to fulfil a commitment but as a matter of fundamental 
justice.
<P>
	May I mention briefly steps we intend to take in connection 
with hate motivated crime. We shall make it clear that such 
crimes will not be tolerated. We shall introduce legislation that 
will expressly provide that hate motivation must be regarded as 
an aggravating factor in determining the sentence to be imposed 
for any specific criminal act.
<P>
	Let me say also that we shall introduce changes in the 
criminal justice system that will help persons with disabilities 
participate fully on an equal basis.
<P>
	May I turn now to the third and last broad category on the 
agenda for justice in the year ahead, modernizing the law.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We will soon table a bill re-establishing the Law Reform 
Commission. We are fortunate to be able to revive this 
commission which will serve a useful purpose as an independent 
body drawing attention to needed amendments to Canadian 
legislation. We will give it a new mandate and a new structure.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="517"> 517 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Last year a subcommittee of the standing committee on 
justice released a report on a recodification of the Criminal 
Code. We will be considering those recommendations, and we 
will undertake an assessment of the question of whether the 
present code is serving the interests of criminal justice in the 
modern age.
<P>
	We shall also introduce legislation to deal with the sentencing 
aspect of criminal law. The legislation will clearly set forth the 
purposes of sentencing, provide for a full range of alternative 
sentences, focus on the desirability of non-custodial sentences 
for non-violent crime, and provide for a range of intermediate 
sanctions where they are appropriate.
<P>
	The agenda I have described very briefly this afternoon is a 
broad and a challenging one. Nonetheless it is equally clear that 
the issues we seek to address are urgent and important. May I say 
that I look forward to working with my colleagues in 
government, my colleagues throughout the House of Commons, 
in meeting the challenges this agenda presents. In doing so, may 
we recommit ourselves to what must be our ultimate objective in 
justice: to furnish, provide and maintain the fairest and most 
effective system of justice for Canada and Canadians.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I was just taking notice 
that many members are seeking the floor. I would remind all 
members that we will begin a 10-minute period of questions and 
answers. As short as the questions are is as many of you who will 
participate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Justice. Naturally, it will 
be brief.
<P>
	The Minister just announced in his speech the creation of a 
national crime prevention council. As everyone knows, councils 
such as this are often made of up of experts who are slow to 
report, so much so that when they do finally get around to 
releasing their report, all one can do is comment on the findings.
<P>
	My question is this: Who will be appointed to this 
high-profile council?
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	Does the minister intend to take into account in the 
appointment process certain new elements which may not have 
been considered in the case of past councils. I am referring here 
for example to appointing certain individuals who through their 
work are familiar with criminals, indeed with hardened 
criminals. While it is natural that the council would include 
people whom we have come to expect to serve on such bodies, 
people such as lawyers and professionals who provide services 
to individuals in the corrections field, maybe it should also be 
made up of people who work with criminals every day. I am 
thinking about correctional services officers  who in the course 
of their day-to-day jobs deal with those who have committed 
crimes and are serving time.
<P>
	I know from experience that those who work inside 
correctional facilities are somewhat bound by professional 
secrecy. Understandably it is quite natural for them not to 
disclose everything that goes on. Some of what goes on is not 
very pretty and there is no need for everyone to know the details. 
The people who work inside these institutions and see firsthand 
how people in need of assistance live are, we have to admit, 
often overlooked initially, when in fact they may be in the best 
position to make a contribution to this high-profile council and 
to propose more pragmatic solutions.
<P>
	Therefore, I will repeat my question to the minister. Has he 
given any thought to the make-up of this body? Who will be 
appointed to serve on the council?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question the hon. member has 
raised strikes really at the heart of this council. If it is going to 
be effective, if it is going to achieve the objectives I have 
described, it cannot be academic or remote. It cannot be slow to 
report. It cannot simply research and write. It has to be 
community based. It has to be pragmatic, and it has to be 
government supporting communities to get action under way.
<P>
	I am sensitive to the dangers he has identified. We cannot 
burden the council with a mandate that will result in it going on 
forever and achieving nothing.
<P>
	Let me tell my hon. friend that my department will be mailing 
out during the next week or so to dozens of individuals and 
organizations throughout the country a discussion paper raising 
many of the questions he has touched upon. My hon. friend 
talked about the structure and composition of the council and the 
mandate of the council itself.
<P>
	We will be seeking the views of police forces, community 
groups, other levels of government and individuals with the kind 
of practical experience to which my hon. friend referred in 
coming to grips with the design and creation of this council. We 
will also be grateful for his suggestions. I will be sending the 
discussion paper to my colleagues in the House as well. We will 
look forward to having the benefit of his views as we put it 
together.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the minister for the consideration he has shown me 
when we first met and had a short exchange of ideas. I would 
also thank the minister for keeping the door open for 
submissions on the Young Offenders Act. I believe Canadians 
certainly do want input into this particular piece of legislation.
<P>
	The question I have for the minister is in relation to his crime 
prevention program. I am aware of the document of which he 
speaks and the direction in which the crime prevention program 
is going. Was it not supported by all parties last year?
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="518"> 518 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	There appears to be one matter though that the report does not 
thoroughly address. I believe it is on the minds of many 
Canadians. Certainly thousands of my constituents and 
hundreds of thousands of other Canadians want to see a 
punishment that fits the crime outlined. I would suggest they 
want to see it reintroduced into the system.
<P>
	Would the minister please satisfy the Canadian people in their 
desire to see such a stand taken by the government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the question put by the 
hon. member for Calgary Northeast, with reference to the 
recommendation last year it was the Horner committee, an 
all-party committee of the House, that conducted extensive 
research and had lengthy hearings on the whole question of 
crime prevention. That committee unanimously recommended, 
among other things, that a national strategy including a national 
council be created for this purpose. We are really acting upon 
and giving life to recommendations that emanate from an 
all-party committee, as well as from other sources as I 
mentioned in my remarks.
<P>
	In terms of sentencing obviously it must be the very purpose 
of the criminal justice system to ensure the sentence fits the 
crime. That is often, however, in the eye of the beholder. There 
can be controversy about whether a given sentence on a 
particular day in answer to a specific crime is the right one.
<P>
	If I may be permitted to say so at this time, I recently reread a 
study done by Anthony Dube, a noted criminologist, who 
undertook as a research project to examine public reactions to 
sentences meted out to specific crimes first from the newspaper 
story and then after acquainting members of the public with all 
the facts of the case that went before the judge who passed 
sentence.
<P>
	In his research Mr. Dube made the observation that when the 
citizens read of the sentence in the newspaper a given 
percentage thought it seemed like a very light sentence for such 
a crime. However when the same persons were given all the facts 
before the judge who actually passed the sentence, the 
percentage of those who agreed that the sentence was 
appropriate increased dramatically until it became almost 
unanimous.
<P>
	The lesson we learned is that it is often misleading and 
sometimes dangerous to assess the appropriateness of a sentence 
from a brief newspaper report or a television report. Surely the 
justice system we want is one in which competent judges, on the 
basis of all the facts in the adversarial system, assess the 
appropriate sentence in keeping with appropriate principles in 
the courtroom where the case has been tried.
<P>
	I do not wish to sidestep the question put by the hon. member 
for Calgary Northeast. Let me deal with it squarely by saying 
that I have already indicated we propose to introduce legislation 
on the subject of sentencing. I will be happy to have his reaction 
to it. In the process of committee hearings on that bill I am 
certain he will have an opportunity to develop his point further.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to start my maiden speech by taking a moment to 
thank the constituents of Fraser Valley East for the trust they 
have placed in me. I will be doing my utmost to earn their 
continued confidence in the months and the years ahead.
<P>
	I also thank my own family for their ongoing sacrifice and 
support. If, as many people say, a nation is only as strong as its 
families then in this International Year of the Family we must 
emphasize the importance of the nuclear family in our own 
country. My own family, Deb and Karina, Mark, Loni and Kyla, 
can rest assured that for me every year is the year of the family.
<P>
	Listening to the speeches in the House during the throne 
speech debate has been very enlightening. Each member 
describes their riding as the most beautiful one in all of Canada, 
representing the best that Canada has to offer. Each of these 
speeches comes from the heart. They bode well for the future of 
our country if the members of Parliament will emphasize the 
positive themes that make us distinctively Canadian.
<P>
	As a proud Canadian representing a proud area of Canada, I 
will fulfil my mandate as a positive, constructive opposition 
member in the 35th Parliament.

<P>
	I come from a constituency that has given much and yet has 
even more to offer to the Canadian way of life. We can all take 
pride in the 1 Combat Engineer Regiment from Canadian Forces 
Base Chilliwack, a regiment that has represented us so well in 
Croatia. Often during Tuesday's debate on our peacekeeping 
role my thoughts were with the soldiers of 1 CER and their 
families as they prepare to go back into that very dangerous 
arena. We salute them all.
<P>
	I could talk for a long time about my riding. Our forest 
industry has provided jobs for a century and continues to offer 
exciting opportunities for the future. From farms to flowers, 
high mountains and hot springs, our area is so colourful that we 
call it rainbow country. Tourism, fishing, golfing, unmatched 
scenery and warm weather year round make Fraser Valley East 
one of the finest places in Canada to live, to work and to play. All 
members are invited to B.C. to see for themselves.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="519"> 519 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to bring the attention of the House to a matter of great 
concern for the people who live in B.C.'s beautiful Fraser 
Valley.
<P>
	Most Canadians can take satisfaction in the successful 
conclusion of the recent GATT agreement. The Reform Party 
believes that much of Canada's future prosperity is dependent 
upon the security of our export markets. To the extent that the 
Liberal government has secured this access we commend it. 
Consumers and western grain producers will benefit. Lowering 
import barriers will allow in turn our high quality Canadian 
products into more world markets.
<P>
	However, in any deal there are winners and losers. I want to 
express the concern of my constituents especially in the poultry 
and dairy sectors. They were the losers at the GATT table. They 
were left swinging in the shifting wind by this deal, uncertain of 
their future. Many of these hard-working people have invested 
heavily in land, buildings, equipment and livestock. Most have 
purchased the right to produce at great cost. However the value 
of their quota could now drop drastically. It depends on the 
American response to the proposed Canadian tariffs.
<P>
	What if the U.S. challenges our tariffs under the NAFTA 
agreement and wins? It is going to try. Promises that everything 
will be fine made by the agriculture minister last week in the 
House ring hollow compared with the stirring election promises 
that they will go to the wall for our producers in the GATT 
negotiations. A poet once said that a promise made is a debt 
unpaid. Many farmers are counting on the government for an 
IOU given during the election, the promise of a secure future. 
Many are concerned that a lack of foresight yesterday and 
wishful thinking today may spell disaster for their system 
tomorrow.
<P>
	It is not just a system we are talking about. In Canada, it is an 
$8 billion a year industry. It is a way of life for 100,000 families 
who stand to be stripped bare by the global market. They feel 
they have been left naked by a government spending too much 
time promoting its much ballyhooed infrastructure program and 
not enough time tending to the bread and butter businesses that 
actually generate wealth in this country.
<P>
	Does the Liberal government have a plan for agriculture? As 
of last week, we still could not find out who in the Liberal caucus 
was a member of their own agriculture committee. It is 
unsettling when a simple request for information from the 
minister a month ago not only went unanswered but 
unacknowledged. Worse, we hear that officials in the agriculture 
department admit there is no contingency plan if Canadian 
tariffs should fall under a NAFTA ruling.
<P>
	The Reform Party has had a detailed plan for over three years 
now. Let me share with this House just a few of the principles 
from our agricultural program that should guide this 
government in the months ahead.
<P>
	The first is summed up in just one word: Order. For all its 
flaws, supply management ensured a stable, orderly production 
climate and the government must now work to ensure that the 
transition from a managed to an unmanaged environment will be 
orderly. Because of the long cycles of crop yields and livestock 
renewal, predictability on the part of the government is essential 
to the farmer.
<P>
	The throne speech repeated the second important principle 
and I quote: ``The government will assist Canadian companies 
to translate improved market access into greater export sales''. 
Access to markets is the key to future prosperity and for that we 
support the successful completion of the GATT negotiations. 
What we do not need is another level of bureaucracy to grind this 
search to a halt. Let aggressive companies search out new 
markets and develop new value-added products.
<P>
	The third and final principle is the most important. Although 
the Liberal government expressed a vague intention a few 
months ago to reduce agricultural input costs, the House will 
note that Preston Manning delivered a keynote address on this 
subject over three years ago. Input costs, especially input costs 
caused by excessive taxation levels is one cost area we can 
control within Canada.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	We envisage a day when the government assists our industry 
to compete by eliminating the interprovincial trade 
barriers-recent agreements are a step in the right 
direction-and by pushing aside antiquated regulations that 
impede our producers, restrictions that our neighbours to the 
south do not suffer from, a time when the government levels up 
the north-south playing field and lets our industries score the 
goals for Canada.
<P>
	Our farmers are among the world's most efficient, but even 
the best farmers cannot overcome taxation levels and costs that 
are higher than those faced by their American counterparts. The 
elusive level playing field will never be possible until the 
government cuts federal spending resulting in a lower level of 
taxation for all Canadians, including farmers. Our producers can 
do the job but the government must supply this tool of 
competitiveness.
<P>
	Reformers were talking about this for years and marketing 
boards, farmers and small businesses throughout my riding are 
in agreement on this issue. They have repeatedly urged 
governments at all levels to reduce taxes and cut the red tape that 
impedes growth, to get out of their pockets and off their backs so 
they can do what they do best: create jobs, create exports, and 
create wealth for my riding, for all of B.C., and for all of 
Canada.
<P>
	We have talked for years about this subject but it is time to 
actually do something. The Liberals have a clear majority in the 
House but it remains to be seen if they have the will to push 
through on these reforms. I remind the minister that the 
Canadian people are reluctant to  accept talk any more. They are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="520"> 520 </A></B>
<P>
judging this government and all governments every day by their 
performance.
<P>
	Over the past two years we have repeatedly invited other party 
leaders to debate this important subject. We have repeatedly 
asked them to place their ideas on the table for discussion, to 
help our industry plan for the future. Those invitations were 
never accepted. Now we see why. The ideas just were not there. 
The opposition party of yesterday, today's governing party, did 
not take the time to develop a well-reasoned agricultural policy.
<P>
	To conclude, the Liberal red book is over 100 pages in length 
yet it has devoted a full four sentences to its agricultural agenda. 
That is all, four sentences. The throne speech did not even 
mention the word agriculture and I hope along with my riding's 
farmers that this does not reflect the priority that the 
government places on our own agriculture ministry.
<P>
	It is especially unfortunate because the essence of real 
leadership is setting broad goals with the input of all the 
stakeholders, making public a detailed agenda to meet those 
goals and then pressing ahead with the plan. Our producers can 
run with the best in the world, but they can never win on an 
undefined course.
<P>
	If GATT and NAFTA form the new rule book that farmers 
must take to the field in the next few years they will need the 
right equipment. Only stability, lower taxes, less red tape and an 
even chance in the marketplace will equip our industry, 
including the agriculture industry in Fraser Valley East, to 
proceed with confidence into the 21st century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
quite enjoyed the remarks of the hon. member for Fraser Valley 
East and I found them very edifying.
<P>
	I come from a riding that is mainly suburban-urban so I 
cannot claim to have the expertise on GATT and agriculture that 
he obviously does have. However, I do have to say that some of 
his remarks do not parallel the kind of reading I am doing on this 
issue. In my mind, he seems to confuse ice cream and yogurt 
with other dairy products.
<P>
	My understanding is that in the GATT round at Geneva what 
was at stake was a question of either sacrificing all the GATT or 
preserving marketing boards and in fact what subsequently 
occurred is that a deal was struck at GATT which is still to be 
ratified basically putting a tariff regime on most poultry and 
dairy products.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	What has happened here is that ice cream and yogurt failed at 
the GATT panel some years ago. Now the Americans have come 
forward and questioned the tariff regime that we would like to 
see on ice cream and yogurt. That is what is at question here. 
Perhaps the hon. member knows something that I do not on this 
issue. As I understand it also from everything that I have read 
GATT takes precedence over NAFTA in every category  
involving this tariffication of dairy and poultry products, with 
the exception of ice cream and yogurt.
<P>
	Given all these things, is the hon. member suggesting that the 
Reform Party's approach to agriculture policy over the last two 
months would be one where he would sacrifice, would do 
without the GATT agreement in favour of preserving marketing 
boards? That was the kind of choice we had. Is that what the 
member for Fraser Valley East would recommend?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, some of the points the hon. member 
brings forth are valid in the sense that we recognized several 
years ago the inevitability of the GATT negotiations and the 
ruling on article XI(2)(c). That was never in question in the 
Reform Party. In fact we campaigned vigorously on it and took a 
lot of flak from members of the Liberal Party at the time which 
said that would never come to pass, that article XI(2)(c) was safe 
in their bosom.
<P>
	Really that is what I am arguing about when I talk about order. 
Farmers were willing and are currently willing to live with the 
proposed tariffication rules of the GATT. However starting on 
December 29 and every week since I have asked the Minister of 
Agriculture for a legal opinion of even why he believes that the 
GATT ruling will supersede NAFTA because the Americans say 
otherwise. I have yet to receive a response to my request.
<P>
	There again, that just creates more indecision and uncertainty 
in the farming community which is really only looking for that 
stability. Farmers are willing to work under the new rules but 
they need to know what the rules are.
<P>
	Two years ago we proposed that the GATT negotiations 
should be successfully completed and that we should have 
negotiated the proper tariffication protection for our farmers at 
that time. We feel that had we proceeded then while we still had 
some bargaining chips in our hands we could have made a good 
deal for Canadian farmers that would have been negotiated 
rather than brought through the courts.
<P>
	Really I am not arguing with the completion of GATT. My 
argument stems from the fact that it should have been planned. I 
think even at this late date if we can somehow assure our farmers 
that GATT will proceed, that GATT will supersede NAFTA, then 
they will proceed with confidence and do the investing, 
exporting and so on that brings prosperity to that industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a thank you is in order. We have a new Speaker in the 
House and a new speaker team and hopefully we are entering 
into a new era in the House of Commons.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="521"> 521 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to thank the voters of 
North Island-Powell River who have given me the opportunity 
to represent them in this House. North Island-Powell River 
riding takes up the north half of Vancouver Island and half the 
mainland coast in British Columbia. The population within this 
large diverse area is evenly split between Vancouver Island and 
the adjacent mainland. It is a resource based riding.
<P>
	The population has a very strong feeling that government 
decision making is not representative and sensitive to their 
interests very often. It is my pledge to bring their concerns to the 
House of Commons regularly. I pledge also to bring to the House 
of Commons constructive thoughts from my constituents on 
how to improve life in the riding and throughout the nation.
<P>
	Within the riding we have a diversity of progressive 
aboriginal groups with a living culture. The Sechelt Indian Band 
took the initiative to negotiate unique legislation to replace the 
Indian Act for their band alone and as a result they have been 
operating under a municipal style of self-government since 
1986.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	The primary focus of my speech today is aboriginal affairs. As 
the Reform Party spokesman for aboriginal affairs, I want to 
discuss the current direction of federal policy in respect to 
Canada's indigenous peoples with a B.C. perspective.
<P>
	British Columbia is in a unique situation. We have 15 existing 
treaties including 14 on southern Vancouver Island and one in 
northeast B.C. We have a predominantly non-treaty aboriginal 
situation and a very significant portion of the nation's aboriginal 
population.
<P>
	In general there is a spirit of good will between the aboriginal 
and non-aboriginal populations. We all want aboriginal people 
to enjoy a standard of living and quality of life and opportunity 
equal to other Canadians. There is consensus that a 
self-government model is essential to create a climate of 
certainty for investors and to bring together the population at 
large.
<P>
	The federal government has a paramount mandate and 
responsibility in the area of aboriginal affairs. It is essential that 
government direction and policy unify rather than divide the 
population.
<P>
	The government has pledged to wind down the department of 
Indian affairs at a pace agreed on by First Nations. There is a 
consensus that a wind down is called for, replacing the current 
outmoded and outdated department with a system of 
accountability provided by self-government. Federally 
chartered municipal status on reserves such as the Sechelt 
arrangement is a good way to go, giving the bands autonomy to 
run their affairs.
<P>
	I believe it is time for some new points of view. Some recent 
federal initiatives have been divisive, not uniting and I would 
like to offer a new perspective.
<P>
	The aboriginal fishing strategy of the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans is one area that needs overhauling. The commercial 
fishing industry in B.C. until 1992 was a colour blind industry 
with 25 per cent aboriginal participation. There is a 
longstanding aboriginal food fishery which remains unaffected.
<P>
	The federal AFS policy implemented two years ago has 
created a separate aboriginal commercial fishery based on race. 
This is a two-year pilot project with agreements under the AFS 
umbrella expiring March 31, 1994. Implementation of these 
agreements has been very divisive within the industry and 
socially. Also it has not been conducive to conservation 
management. In 1993 several B.C. Court of Appeal decisions 
served to reject the necessity of a separate aboriginal 
commercial fishery. The promised DFO review of the AFS this 
spring must be carried out with transparency and sensitivity to 
the conflicts that the agreements have created.
<P>
	We recommend avoidance of this conflict and new direction 
for our important fishery by orienting the AFS to the 
recreational fishery and to fisheries enhancement. No new 
commercial fishing agreements should be negotiated under the 
AFS umbrella.
<P>
	There has been a great deal of recent discussion about the 
terminology ``inherent right to self-government''. According to 
my understanding the term ``inherent'' can mean that federal 
and provincial legislation would not apply to aboriginal people 
without their agreement. I also understand that it could be the 
basis for claims to international sovereignty which would signal 
aboriginal government immunity from all federal and provincial 
laws. This is unacceptable to most Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	We believe that aboriginal self-government means a mix of 
federal, provincial and aboriginal laws to be worked out through 
negotiations. Regardless of the framework, it must work within 
the structure of Canadian society as a whole.
<P>
	British Columbia residents want to resolve the issue of 
unsettled land claims so that the investment climate is improved 
and so that individuals, business, government and aboriginal 
groups can go forward with certainty. The recently formed B.C. 
Treaty Commission which is federal, provincial and First 
Nations is up and running, having already received 38 proposals 
from bands in British Columbia. The commission will be a 
positive influence on negotiations but there are major 
shortcomings. To overcome these shortcomings I have 
recommendations related to interim measures, third party 
interests and transparency.
<P>
	Recent resource related interim measures negotiated between 
the province and aboriginal groups are eroding federal aborigi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="522"> 522 </A></B>
<P>
nal jurisdiction and the urgency of the negotiating process. It is 
in the federal government's  interest to question the mandate of 
the province's negotiation of these agreements without federal 
participation.
<P>
	Third party interests are not at the negotiating table. 
Philosophical objection to having them at the table is unfounded 
as they also want to remove the current impasse. They will 
expedite rather than delay the process. The whole question of 
government mandate would be much more clear if third parties 
were represented.
<P>
	The population at large is increasingly suspicious of the entire 
negotiating process. This initiative of involving them is a bold 
step for the current players but it is an essential step in order to 
build consensus.
<P>
	Philosophically I question and a body of legal opinion 
suggests that because of the fiduciary relationship, our federal 
and provincial governments are in a conflict of interest in 
negotiations with the First Nations unless third parties are at the 
table. Litigation is the likely result.
<P>
	In conclusion, I call for new directions regarding aboriginal 
affairs. British Columbians want to end the climate of 
uncertainty, secrecy and divisiveness. This requires adoption of 
the measures I have outlined.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in this my maiden speech I would like to take this 
opportunity to congratulate the Speaker on his election to such a 
prestigious position and my personal congratulations to you for 
your appointment to an equally prestigious position.
<P>
	I wish to thank the mover and seconder of the speech from the 
throne. I also wish to thank the people of 
Perth-Wellington-Waterloo for electing me to represent them 
in the House of Commons. I want to assure them that I will 
represent them and serve them to the best of my ability.
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not also thank my wife and family 
for their wholehearted support during my campaign.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	The riding of Perth-Wellington-Waterloo is located in the 
fertile lands of southwestern Ontario. It looks like and produces 
as though it were the garden of Eden. It is the number one dairy 
and pork producing riding in Canada, and second in white bean 
and mixed farm acreage. The fact that this area is so productive 
is because of the dedication and efficiency of its farmers, and I 
congratulate them for their contribution to the wealth of our 
country.
<P>
	I have received several hundred calls from dairy, poultry and 
egg farmers in my riding since the conclusion of the GATT 
negotiations. They feared for their survival because article XI 
has been removed from the treaty. I want to assure Canadian 
farmers in these supply management sectors that the Liberal 
government in Ottawa is committed to preserving the family 
farm, the Canadian agriculture sector and the supply 
management system.
<P>
	Perth-Wellington-Waterloo's number one employer is the 
automotive related sector, with factories in Stratford, St. 
Mary's, Mitchell, Listowel and New Hamburg. The success of 
this sector depends upon a well-trained and hard-working 
labour force. This level of competence has been maintained 
through a commitment by both management and workers to 
improving their education and skill level in order to produce the 
highest quality product for consumers.
<P>
	Finally, I must recognize the most famous institution in my 
riding, the Stratford Shakespearian Festival, North America's 
most esteemed repertory theatre which performs on three world 
class stages in town, a town that is renowned for its park 
systems, shops and restaurants. I am proud to live in Stratford, 
the home of Canada's national English speaking theatre, the 
jewel of southwestern Ontario. This is a cultural success story. 
The theatre achieves the highest artistic standards while 
attracting thousands of visitors to the region every year and 
pumping millions of dollars into the local economy. On behalf 
of the theatre, I invite every member of Parliament to visit 
Stratford and attend one of its several performances as my guest 
and theirs.
<P>
	The Liberals won the federal election of October 1993 
because we provided Canadians with a vision of hope, hope for 
improved job prospects, with initiatives such as improving the 
economic climate for small and medium sized businesses. I can 
assure everyone that my constituents support the proposals 
contained in the throne speech, proposals such as encouraging 
financial institutions to improve access to capital for owners of 
small and medium sized businesses. Consultations with bank 
executives by members of the government have already started 
to bear fruit.
<P>
	The establishment of the Canada investment fund will help 
leading edge technology firms to obtain the long-term capital 
they need.
<P>
	We Liberals will create a Canadian technology network to 
assist with the spreading of information about technological 
innovations, providing further assistance to these firms. The 
government will encourage partnerships between Canadian 
universities, research institutions and the private sector to 
strengthen the research and development required by 
entrepreneurs in order to establish their own businesses. This 
partnership will help to keep small business managers abreast of 
new technologies and strategic information vital to their long 
term success.
<P>
	We Liberals recognize that the government often acts as a 
catalyst in the areas of economic growth and job creation, 
relying on the private sector to be the engine. We hope that the 
residential rehabilitation assistance program will encourage 
home owners to renovate their homes and thus stimulate what 
has been a sluggish building industry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="523"> 523 </A></B>
<P>
	We also believe there are important programs a government 
can put in place to give hope and jobs to some of our youth, such 
as the youth service corps. It will put thousands of Canada's 
enthusiastic youth into the workplace on worthy community and 
environmental projects.
<P>
	Governments in every corner of the globe recognize that the 
critical component of economic competitiveness in the global 
marketplace is a well trained workforce.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	We Liberals propose measures to improve job training and the 
transition from school to the workplace. In these days of high 
unemployment thousands of jobs go unfilled in rapidly 
expanding industries such as telecommunications, computer 
services and environmental sciences because skilled labour 
cannot be found. While thousands of our youth are unemployed 
we cannot tolerate the squandering of their energy, talent and 
education.
<P>
	We will in partnerships with the provinces and the private 
sector establish a national apprenticeship program. This 
program will establish national standards for apprenticeship 
programs and establish new programs for fast growing sectors in 
the economy. All of these programs are necessary. To simply 
stay with the status quo would be intolerable.
<P>
	Just as the goal of Liberal economic policy is to ensure 
economic growth in the nation, the goal of our social policy is to 
ensure the social well-being of its citizens. Change is a 
relentless and often disruptive force in our modern society and 
has rendered some elements of our social safety net 
cumbersome and redundant. The role of the government is to 
design legislation that is current and relevant to meet the needs 
of the citizen.
<P>
	Social planners who employ foresight in the designing of 
legislation will ensure that the revision and amendment of such 
legislation will require it to be amended in the future. We 
Liberals are committed to the carrying out of a major study in 
the social security system.
<P>
	We will also study our highly prized health care system in 
co-operation with the provincial governments and in 
consultation with Canadians. The national forum on health will 
be chaired by the Prime Minister, the Right Hon. Jean Chrétien. 
We Liberals assure the people that our government remains 
deeply committed to the principles of the Canadian Health Act 
including the rejection of user fees in any form.
<P>
	As I worked my way across the riding of 
Perth-Wellington-Waterloo last year, at the farm gates and 
the factory gates the most disheartening refrain I heard was from 
the people who had given up on government. Many others were 
just plain angry at politicians who they felt were dishonest or 
indifferent to their needs.
<P>
	There must be some good reason why Canadians are so eager 
for honesty and integrity in government and why they 
universally demand fairness and justice. I believe that for too 
many Canadians the Canadian dream had become the Canadian 
nightmare. They feared the loss of their jobs, their social safety 
nets, their cultural identity and the integrity of their natural 
environment. We Liberals have promised and we must deliver 
on our promise to return honesty and integrity to Canada's 
federal government.
<P>
	In conclusion we Liberals believe that the very essence of a 
civilized society is mutual interest, mutual forbearance and 
mutual co-operation. We believe that today Canadians are 
prepared to stand shoulder to shoulder to work together and 
make sacrifices to the benefit of each other and to Canada.
<P>
	We Liberals believe that the government's policy as outlined 
in the speech from the throne will provide the road map for both 
legislators and the citizens to follow in their common mission. It 
provides hope through its many initiatives for job creation and 
economic stimulation. It provides leadership through reforms 
that will make the operation of government more transparent 
and accountable and it provides vision through the 
establishment of structures to examine and upgrade our social 
security system. It is what Canadians and Canada need today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> A few comments, Mr. 
Speaker. The hon. member started his speech saying that the 
Liberal Party was elected because it provided Canadians with a 
vision of hope. This is partly true, I suppose, but since that 
vision does not come across very clearly in the throne speech, I 
am afraid Canadians' hopes will be dashed fairly quickly.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	There is nothing really significant in the throne speech: 
merely a string of very general projects and good intentions, 
with very little in the way of tangible proposals.
<P>
	We must not forget that until the government has decided it 
will deal with the whole issue of the deficit and the debt, any 
economic recovery will be superficial. The debt and the deficit 
are a drag on the private sector because they absorb such a large 
share of financial resources.
<P>
	The hon. member also referred to technological innovation. I 
agree this is important. It was said earlier in the House that 
Canada's contribution, participation or investment in research 
and development is well below that of other countries. We invest 
1.4 per cent of GDP, while countries like Germany, Japan and 
the United States invest twice as much in technology, and that 
creates jobs. There is practically nothing in the throne speech to 
provide any hope in this area.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="524"> 524 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member also mentioned home renovation and the 
construction industry. In Quebec, we have a major problem with 
the underground economy. It is all part of the same problem, 
which is that taxes are too high, and until the government has 
given a clear signal in this respect, it would be wishful thinking 
to expect construction and home renovation to pick up.
<P>
	And now a final comment on national standards for 
apprenticeship. It seems the Liberal Party, like the Tories, will 
not learn from past mistakes. National standards are a major 
barrier to regional development. The federal government likes 
to suggest and dictate national standards. Initially it provides 
subsidies to go along with those standards, and then it withdraws 
them, and the result, as we know, is that the provinces are left 
holding the bag of financial problems that were, in fact, created 
by the federal government. Occupational training is a provincial 
responsibility, and the federal government has no business 
regulating this area. The members of the Bloc Quebecois, 
reflecting the position of Quebecers, will demand full 
responsibility in this area.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richardson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his close attention to my speech. It helped to refresh 
in my mind what I had said.
<P>
	I would like to pick up on one or two things about hope. Every 
one of us is in great need for a dose of hope whether we are from 
the party of the hon. member or from my own party. Every 
farmer every spring has some hope.
<P>
	In the throne speech there were all kinds of seeds and those 
seeds were in the speech in the form of the things that I have 
mentioned and the things that you have reiterated. There was not 
anything tangible there but those seeds have to be scattered on 
the land. Given the right situation in the right environment they

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North):</B> Mr. Speaker, esteemed 
members of the House of Commons, it is a great privilege for me 
to speak in response to the throne speech which outlines the 
government's priorities for the first session of the 35th 
Parliament.
<P>
	I would like to start by thanking my constituents of Simcoe 
North for entrusting me with the responsibility of representing 
their interests in Ottawa. I would also like to thank my wife, 
family and hundreds of volunteers without whose help I would 
not be here today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Last October Canadians clearly told us that the policies of the 
former government and the way things are done in Ottawa had to 
change.
<P>
	I am happy to see that the throne speech reflects the promises 
of renewal included in the electoral platform of the Liberal 
Party. As a member of this House, I will be happy to support 
these policies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The 35th Parliament must do its utmost to restore confidence 
in the federal government among Canadians. Members of 
Parliament must be allowed a meaningful role in the 
development of public policy and legislation. During a recent 
election I campaigned on the slogan: ``We need Simcoe North's 
voice in Ottawa, not Ottawa's voice in Simcoe North''. I remain 
committed to that principle.
<P>
	I am pleased that the government will take measures to 
enhance the credibility of Parliament but that is not enough. I 
believe that every member of Parliament must do whatever he or 
she can to restore confidence in the electorate and encourage 
their participation in the process. That is why I am seeking to 
create community advisory committees in my riding. These 
committees will provide me with advice and support on various 
issues of importance to my constituents.
<P>
	Since the election I have met with a great number of 
individuals who represent small business, the agricultural 
sector, environmental groups, municipal councils as well as 
cultural organizations.
<P>
	Their participation in these advisory committees will be 
crucial for me in delivering my message to Parliament from a 
generally grassroots perspective.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government must address economic development and 
unemployment issues as soon as possible. By helping small and 
medium size businesses to obtain the capital they need to grow, 
by creating the youth service corps, by encouraging the 
development of a Canadian technology network and by 
rebuilding our infrastructure, Canada will be on the right track 
towards a vigorous economic recovery.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Simcoe North is the home of the Industrial Research and 
Development Institute whose physical plant will be built during 
the coming months. This organization will elevate Canada's 
technological expertise in tool, die and mould production to the 
highest standards in the world resulting in many spinoffs for the 
Canadian economy. IRDI embodies the partnership between 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="525"> 525 </A></B>
<P>
industry, academia and government called for in the speech 
from the throne.
<P>
	We must be sure to continue to support our agricultural 
industry which is the backbone of the economy in many regions 
of Canada. Lately our farmers have had much to be concerned 
about with the recent proclamation of NAFTA and the changes 
that will occur as a result of the GATT. It is very important that 
the government continues to foster our agricultural industry 
using whatever tools it has at its disposal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is easy to realize that Canadians feel that they pay far too 
many taxes and that their money is being wasted at every level of 
government. The Auditor General's Report tabled in this House 
last week did not do anything to allay these concerns.
<P>
	People hope that the new government will improve things; we 
must not let them down. They can already see that the 
government is trying to reduce overlap and duplication with the 
provinces and that we want to eliminate the GST.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	But it is not enough to make a few changes here and there. 
Canadians expect a full review of the tax system and its 
inequities. Our government must ensure that, in the future, 
corporate and individual citizens, rich and poor alike, will all 
pay their fair share of taxes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	While Canadians demand substantial changes, they are also 
saying that they will not accept any watering down of our 
important social safety net, including medicare.
<P>
	I am confident the government realizes we are facing a 
revenue crisis in this country, not a spending crisis.
<P>
	It is evident that our country's fiscal difficulties can only be 
resolved by first addressing the unacceptably high level of 
unemployment in Canada so that the victims of the recession can 
contribute to our tax base. We need more people paying taxes, 
not people paying more taxes.
<P>
	The government must also address important revenue drains 
such as capital gains exemptions, the family trust rules and tax 
loopholes associated with offshore affiliates of Canadian 
companies.
<P>
	It is obvious that we must address the deficit but it must be 
done by augmenting revenues and eliminating wasteful 
spending, not cutting our social programs.
<P>
	Canada's native population has been ignored for far too long 
and it is with a keen sense of excitement that I see the federal 
government begin its discussion on aboriginal self-government. 
The outcome of these discussions will be especially relevant to 
band members of the Chippewas of Beausoleil and the Rama 
First Nation, both of which are located in my riding.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Although most of my constituents speak English, there is a 
large francophone community whose language and culture 
continue to grow. I sincerely believe that if Quebec decides to 
leave Canada, the French language and culture outside Quebec 
could very well disappear. There are about 1 million 
francophones outside Quebec. Being one of them myself, I am 
proud to consider myself a Canadian and I am not afraid to say 
that all the regions of this country are well served by federalism. 
That is why I am asking the hon. members from the Bloc 
Quebecois not to abandon us.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians want the government to get to work to make our 
country a better place. Our work must concentrate upon job 
creation and economic growth, not constitutional wrangling. We 
must reduce the deficit and debt.
<P>
	It is true we have fewer resources with which to work but, as 
my hon. colleague from Madawaska-Victoria has said, a lean 
government does not have to be a mean government.
<P>
	In conclusion, I pledge to represent my constituents and to 
work co-operatively with all members of the House to provide 
accountable and responsible government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker. I would like to thank my colleague from Simcoe North, 
whom I know very well, for what he said. I found it very 
interesting. However, I picked up something he said in his 
speech, that Quebec's separation would mean the end of French 
outside Quebec. He knows very well that French is not at all 
strong outside Quebec. The city he lives in is a perfect example 
of what happens to francophones outside Quebec, in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	Rights are not respected. The schools which francophones 
were promised are not given them. They do not manage their 
own school system. Francophones outside Quebec do not have 
many things. The hon. member surely knows all that.
<P>
	So I would like to end with this comment. I think the main 
reason that Quebec needs to become sovereign is to ensure the 
survival of French culture in North America.
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I expected such a question from 
the hon. member for Québec-Est. Personally, I cannot say that 
francophones outside Quebec have no problem getting their 
rights respected now, but in Penetanguishene, in the riding of 
Simcoe North, we have a French school for which we fought, 
and we finally had our French school. I believe that we can have 
our rights respected if we really want to.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to add a few comments to this debate being someone 
who comes from southern Ontario, very much an anglophone 
region.
<P>
	Ultimately, my question is: Is it a matter of language or is it a 
matter of other things that we might have in common? I would 
like to very briefly tell an anecdote for the benefit of the hon. 
members of the Bloc.
<P>
	Some 15 years ago I was a journalist at a newspaper in 
southern Ontario when an event occurred in Quebec that some of 
the Bloc Quebecois members will remember. It was called the 
Saint-Jean-Vianney landslide that occurred in the region of 
Lac-Saint-Jean.
<P>
	I, as the only reporter at my newspaper with only my school 
French, and very poor French I have to say, was sent to that area 
on the anniversary of the landslide to do a story on a year's 
aftermath. I had a great deal of difficulty, with my poor school 
French, to communicate with the people in the area because the 
accent was very different than the accent I had been taught in 
school.
<P>
	However, I have to say that the people were very nice. They 
took me to their local club, an Odd Fellows hall, in which I must 
say I felt very much at home. I was able to communicate with the 
people through a person I had met in the club from northern 
Ontario. He was able to translate my bad French into the 
Quebeçois French-and possibly my very bad English as 
well-which was very useful for me.
<P>
	What was so striking about this event was that even with the 
language problem I felt very much at home when I sat in this 
little Odd Fellows hall. We then went across to the beverage 
room, as we would say in English Canada in those days. I 
suppose Le bar is what they say in the Lac-Saint-Jean region.
<P>
	As a journalist in those days, I very much favoured drinking 
Scotch. Journalists in those days drank scotch in order to show 
that they really were newspapermen. At the bar I asked if I could 
have a scotch. I was told that they did not have scotch, only rye, 
but I still felt very much at home. We really share a Canadian 
thing in that.
<P>
	What I finally found out during my investigation of the 
landslide was that when the catastrophe occurred the majority of 
the people in Saint-Jean-Vianney were watching hockey. I felt 
very much at home.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a great honour for me, as I start my maiden speech here in the 
House of Commons, to speak on the subject of agriculture. Since 
I have the privilege of being the official agriculture and 
agri-food critic, and I am delighted because I know that 
agriculture is a very important sector. As the hon. member for 
Simcoe North said earlier, and I must say I agree, agriculture is 
the backbone of a number of regions in this country. Agriculture 
is a wonderful industry and an important  one. Unfortunately, 
Canadians do not realize how important agriculture is.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	There are approximately 200,000 producers in Canada with a 
gross income of about $23 billion, which is quite substantial. 
There are almost 2 million jobs, both directly and indirectly, in 
the agricultural sector in Canada. If I had more time, I could say 
a lot about the job creation potential of this sector. I will not 
have a chance to do so this evening, but there is considerable 
potential for job creation in the agricultural industry.
<P>
	Agriculture is so important in Canada that if we include farm 
production and the entire agri-food chain in this country, 
agriculture is our most important industry. It is more important 
than the automobile industry, being worth another $8 billion. 
When I say the whole agri-food chain, I am referring to 
everyone involved, the distributors and manufacturers and 
everything in the agri-food sector in this country. This 
represents $838 billion per year as part of our GDP. In Quebec, 
agriculture is worth $4 billion more than the pulp and paper 
industry.
<P>
	Agriculture is therefore a very important and a very 
significant industry. That is probably why we have a full House 
this evening, to listen to my speech on agriculture. It is also one 
of Canada's leading edge industries. We must not forget that. 
Going back in history, one could say that agriculture is probably 
one of the industries that form the basis of Confederation. It also 
contributed to Canada's image as the bread basket of the world. 
However, today, in 1994, it has also become a very modern and 
very progressive industry. In some sectors, such as Western 
grain and red meat, we rank number one in the world. Dairy 
production especially is very important. We have a highly 
developed industry in which advances in technology have been 
considerable. On the international scene, exports of genetic 
material are worth about $85 million, and this may include 
Holstein cows, for instance, for reproduction purposes.
<P>
	Without getting into too much detail, I want to say that 
agriculture is a very important industry in terms of the economy 
and also in terms of the advanced technology that is being used. 
We rank among the first in the world.
<P>
	The problem is that unfortunately, people underestimate 
agriculture. It is not fashionable. Agriculture may be 
misunderstood. To many people, agriculture is folklore. 
Farmers are still seen as potato producers. People do not realize 
how complicated a farmer's life is today. It takes a lot of 
technology and a lot of knowledge. He has to know about 
machinery; he has to know about herbicides and pesticides and 
fertilizer; he has know his animals, construction and whole lot 
of other things. He has to be an expert and a jack-of-all-trades.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="527"> 527 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	The problem also is that farmers, although they account for a 
great deal of our country's total production and expertise, make 
up only about 3 per cent of the Canadian population, a very small 
proportion indeed. This only creates another problem, the fact 
that governments neglect agriculture.
<P>
	I have the impression that consumers generally take food for 
granted in Canada. They do not take the time to appreciate how 
important this industry is to the country. My hon. colleague 
from Essex-Windsor said a few days ago that a country that 
cannot feed itself soon will not be a country. Self-sufficiency is 
an important, even fundamental, consideration.
<P>
	The other problem is once again that the media in Canada are 
not very interested in agriculture, again because it is not 
fashionable. The media are more concerned about urban 
problems than they are about rural problems. Agriculture is 
therefore much neglected. And consequently, governments 
neglect this industry as well. That is obvious. My God, is it 
obvious!
<P>
	The throne speech makes no mention whatsoever of 
agriculture. It is an obvious oversight. Fifteen years ago, I 
worked for Eugene Whelan when he was the Minister of 
Agriculture in the Trudeau Cabinet. I never learned so much 
about agriculture as I did then. Mr. Whelan was a great minister, 
maybe even the most important Minister of Agriculture in the 
history of Canada, and even he had a very hard time convincing 
his colleagues of the importance of this industry. Moreover, the 
Trudeau government was doing nothing, zilch, to help 
agriculture. Well, maybe it was doing something, but only the 
bare minimum.
<P>
	I feel that nothing much has changed in the intervening years, 
even if we have changed governments. We had a Conservative 
government in power and now we have a Liberal government, 
with a Prime Minister who was a member of that very same 
Cabinet years ago.
<P>
	Mr. Trudeau himself displayed open contempt for farmers. I 
remember very clearly one time when we were in Winnipeg 
where farmers had gathered to confront him about the grain 
export crisis in the West. The grain was not moving and they 
wanted to know what the Prime Minister was going to do to help 
them. I remember what Mr. Trudeau said to them: ``Sell your 
own goddam grain''!
<P>
	Which only goes to show that Prime Minister Trudeau had no 
patience when it came to agricultural issues. I think that the 
current Prime Minister also has a tendency to neglect, and dare I 
say it, to misunderstand, this industry. The recent GATT talks 
will have a major impact on the entire agricultural sector in 
Quebec and Ontario, including the supply management system. 
The dairy and farming sectors work with quotas and the GATT 
talks jeopardized the value of these quotas.
<P>
	Quotas, by the way, account for approximately two thirds of 
the value of a farm. The Prime Minister of Canada was asked if 
the farmers who stood to lose as a result of the fallout from the 
GATT negotiations would be compensated. The Prime 
Minister's answer was no, because they had not paid for their 
quotas. His exact answer was: ``There will be no compensation 
for farmers because they did not buy their quotas.''
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	This is the statement made in French by the Prime Minister in 
an interview published by <I>Le Droit</I>, and I might add that this 
statement was not mentioned by the English Canadian press. I 
mention this minor detail, because it is nevertheless an 
important one: I am telling you that the Prime Minister's 
statement was only reported in French. Obviously, the Prime 
Minister was wrong about the quotas, because we know for a 
fact that farmers paid for their quotas and they paid dearly. In 
fact, this is the very basis of the borrowings they make. It is the 
basis of their credit. It is the basis of many very important things 
for farmers.
<P>
	All these factors, which I mention very briefly, illustrate that 
in fact this government has no constructive and positive policies 
for the agricultural sector. This government does not have a 
vision for agriculture. In fact, Canada has never had a 
constructive vision for that sector. The truth is that our 
agricultural policy is nothing but a stopgap measure which has 
always been influenced by the Americans and the international 
community.
<P>
	No initiatives are taken by Canada; we only react. The recent 
developments with GATT, the current situation and the 
agreements which are being negotiated with the Americans are 
blatant illustrations of this lack of vision for the agricultural 
sector in Canada. The facts prove that we only react. Right now, 
the situation is complex and worrisome for farmers, not only in 
the East but also in the West. Wheat production in the Prairies is 
second to none. We have a lot of durum wheat and other grain in 
the West, and Americans want to restrict exports to their 
country. It is true that exports have increased considerably since 
last year and the years before that. Wheat is very important for 
Western farmers, and Americans want to restrict that export.
<P>
	When you think of it, Americans have no reason to do that. We 
signed a free trade agreement with them. The very basis of that 
agreement is to promote trade with Americans, including wheat, 
and now they want to be bad sports. They want to force Canada 
to restrict its exports. Once again, Canada is on its knees. It 
seems that we cannot, through the Minister of Agriculture, 
defend our rights and protect what is ours. Western farmers 
should be allowed to export as much wheat as they want to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="528"> 528 </A></B>
<P>
United States under NAFTA, and under the Free Trade 
Agreement signed with that country.
<P>
	Another illustration of a government which is on its knees, 
which is always giving in, which is not able to protect us against 
Americans or foreign interests and events, is how we have lost 
under the GATT, an opportunity to develop agriculture. We have 
lost control over a system which may have been one of the best 
in the world. During the GATT negotiations, we wanted to 
strengthen Article XI, because Canada's supply management 
system-and I know you all agree with me-was the best one in 
the world. There are no two ways about it, it was the best in the 
world. With that system, there was no overproduction, no 
dumping; everything was controlled and, in fact, that system 
was a model for the rest of the world.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	To please other countries, we have had to sacrifice that great 
system that we had devoted so much time and energy to 
building. Had Canada really wanted to protect itself properly, it 
could have had Article XI reinforced. The fact is, and the hon. 
member will acknowledge it, that many countries and the 
Americans themselves managed to get all kinds of exemptions 
under the GATT. So, Canada could have had the provisions of 
Article XI strengthened, but did not. Canada backed off, it caved 
in, making people believe it had been isolated. In the end, we 
were left without a leg to stand on when in fact the Canadian 
government could have better protected supply management if it 
had really wanted to. Basically, it was not interested, and not 
having Article XI reinforced caused us another worse problem 
in agriculture.
<P>
	This other problem generated by Canada's lack of resolve at 
the GATT talks is that it is more difficult now to maintain, in 
order to protect our supply management system with regard to 
areas where quotas are applied, the tariff rates that are supposed 
to protect supply management. Because of our failure at the 
GATT, the least we can do to allow the system to exist for a few 
more years to protect the farmers and give them time to adjust to 
the new global market environment, is to maintain a tariff 
barrier high enough to give our farmers a chance to adjust. It is 
only normal. Agriculture is not like a toy factory. You cannot 
just shut down overnight when you are dealing with livestock. 
You have to plan over a number of years.
<P>
	So, the problem is that this tariff barrier which is supposed to 
protect supply management for at least a few years has already 
started to crumble. So soon! The ink is not even dry on the 
agreement that the government is backing off, reneging on the 
promises made to the farmers. The Minister of Agriculture has 
repeatedly promised Canadian farmers that he would do his 
utmost to protect Article XI. He did not. Then, the Minister of 
Agriculture said: ``I will do everything in my power to make the 
tariff barrier high enough to maintain the supply management 
system in Canada.'' That was just five weeks ago, but 
discussions are already under way  with the Americans to 
eliminate the tariff on agricultural products such as ice cream 
and yogurt.
<P>
	I could have gone on for another 20 minutes, but let me at least 
conclude my remarks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In spite of the fact that the minister of agriculture for Canada 
is a very kind and well spoken lawyer and not a farmer, I am 
beginning to think we have a rather wishy-washy minister of 
agriculture, because in the great tradition of ministers of 
agriculture for Canada he is unable to say no to Americans. He is 
unable to stand and defend the rights and privileges we have won 
in negotiations with the United States and other countries. We 
have a minister who unfortunately because of this weakness puts 
into question a lot of the strengths of Canadian agriculture. It is 
most regrettable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think that there are many good things to say about 
agriculture, but I will have to wait for another day.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask a question of my colleague. He no 
doubt realizes that almost everyone wants him to explain his 
statement and most Canadians who were watching their 
television set will understand why. His message was, to say the 
least, a bit confused; it was as clear as mud.
<P>
	At the beginning of his speech, he spoke about the rights of 
the francophones outside Quebec, like me. He then talked about 
agriculture.
<P>
	I would like to ask him a question about the francophones 
outside Quebec since I am one of the 500 000 francophones 
living in Ontario. If I am not mistaken, the Bloc Quebecois 
position as it was explained to us twenty minutes ago is more or 
less as follows: Quebec should split from the rest of Canada 
because the rights of francophones in Ontario have not been 
properly respected. I must say I have a hard time understanding 
that statement.
<P>
	If Quebec were sovereign, how would that improve the 
respect shown for the rights of francophones in Ontario? How 
would that improve the situation of Franco-Ontarians?
<P>
	After that, maybe the member could explain- no. I will stop 
here and let my colleagues ask other questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague is accusing 
me of being confused. He is the one who is confused since I did 
not mention the rights of Franco-Ontarians. In my speech, I 
talked about agriculture and, frankly, I am rather hurt that he did 
not ask any question on this very interesting topic.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="529"> 529 </A></B>
<P>
	However, I have a lot to say on the issue of Franco-Ontarians. 
It is true that I was born in Ontario and it is true also that I 
believe that if we are to preserve the French language in North 
America, Quebec must become sovereign. There is no doubt in 
my mind on that issue.
<P>
	It is not because Quebec wants to reject francophones outside 
Quebec, that is for sure. Quebec does not want to do that. It is 
simply because, in the end, and the hon. member certainly 
experienced it, in English Canada, Canadian history is the story 
of the assimilation of francophones.
<P>
	From the beginning, from Lord Durham on, Canadian history 
boils down to an attempt to assimilate francophones.
<P>
	In the West, at the beginning of the century, they passed all 
kinds of laws to eliminate French. In my own province of 
Ontario, French was banned for 40 years. Today, there are 
anglophone provinces where, in spite of rulings by the Supreme 
Court of Canada, the established rights of francophones are 
being ignored.
<P>
	There have been several rulings by the Supreme Court of 
Canada stating that Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba were 
wrong in not enforcing the francophones' acquired rights. Even 
now, this ruling is being ignored.
<P>
	I want to say to my hon. colleague that if the constitutional 
rights of the English minority had not been respected by Quebec, 
there would have been a general outcry the very next day. 
However, in the rest of Canada, ignoring francophones' rights 
goes unnoticed.
<P>
	The assimilation of francophones is a huge problem and I do 
believe that Quebec's sovereignty will solve it, at least for 
francophones in Quebec. This will ensure the survival of the 
French language in North America. I truly believe that it will 
give a sense of renewed hope to francophones outside Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
leave the French language question to the hon. member.
<P>
	I want to ask him a question regarding agriculture because I 
was surprised by some of the comments he was making 
regarding the minister of agriculture and what we in the Liberal 
Party did with regard to supply management.
<P>
	The hon. member must be aware that when his leader was on 
this side of the House representing the Conservative Party, it 
was his party and his leader at that time who told Canadian 
farmers they would be protected, that they were going to protect 
them under the NAFTA and they were going to protect them at 
the GATT. In fact he was being a little less than honest with 
Canadian farmers as was the previous government in terms of 
what they were doing at the GATT. Also, what they were  saying 
internationally was a different story from what they were telling 
Canadian farmers at home.
<P>
	I am somewhat surprised. I take it the hon. member is the 
agriculture critic. I am surprised during this debate when we 
were making representations internationally that in fact we 
heard nothing from the Bloc. In fact during the first week in 
Question Period there was no question directed toward the 
Minister of Agriculture from that whole side regarding this very 
important issue, an issue of great concern to Canadian farmers 
which is the issue of ice cream and yogurt.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member who is an agricultural 
representative from the Bloc why it is that when his leader was 
on this side of the House he was telling Canadian farmers 
something different from what he is now saying on that side of 
the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member was probably 
absent from the House on Monday because there was a question 
on that very subject.

	We asked a question last Monday on agriculture and ice cream 
and yogurt. Maybe the hon. member was not there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> I was there. That was a week later.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> A week later than what?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Than when the House opened.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I remind the hon. 
members that they must address their comments through the 
Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. That could be 
attributed to inexperience.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The only reason the question was asked last Monday was 
mainly because negotiations are ongoing and we wanted to have 
it in good time.
<P>
	Also, I think criticisms about the Conservatives and how the 
Conservatives did not do their job are cheap shots. It is so easy to 
say it is the fault of the Conservatives, that they did not do their 
job. Those are just cheap shots.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member has made reference to certain quotations of 
former Prime Minister Trudeau indicating to the effect that he 
would not sell our goddamn grain.
<P>
	The statement that he has attributed to the former Prime 
Minister is not accurate. The statement that was made by the 
former Prime Minister was: ``Why should I sell your wheat?'' 
He then proceeded to answer the question and told the western 
Canadian farmer as to why he would sell the wheat for the 
western Canadian farmer. I know this because I was there.

	The hon. member commented about the agriculture minister 
being a lawyer but not a farmer. I am a lawyer too. I am also from 
a farm and I also own land. The agriculture minister, the hon. 
member for Regina-Wascana, is also from a farm. He 
understands Saskatchewan farm practices. He understands the 
agriculture industry in Canada.
<P>
	The hon. member has also made comments about why sales of 
grain cannot now be made just across the border because of 
NAFTA and GATT, primarily NAFTA. Just sell grain across the 
border, sell all the grain we want into the United States. The 
United States is an exporter of grain except for one specialized 
commodity which is durum. Other than that they export. One 
state in the United States produces more wheat than the whole of 
Canada.

<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am honoured to stand in this place today to speak for 
the first time on behalf of the constituents of Windsor-St. 
Clair.
<P>
	I congratulate you, Sir, upon your appointment to the Chair 
and congratulate all hon. members on their election victories. 
First I want to thank my supporters who worked for me and the 
electors of Windsor-St. Clair who have placed their confidence 
in me. I am grateful for the opportunity to represent them here.
<P>
	Windsor-St. Clair is located in southern Ontario along the 
shores of the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair. Lake St. Clair is 
the smallest of our Canadian Great Lakes. Windsor-St. Clair is 
comprised of three communities: parts of the east end of 
Windsor; all of the town of Tecumseh; and all of the village of 
St. Clair Beach.
<P>
	Our riding is an urban constituency but our location makes us 
one of the great water sports centres of the world. There are 
more pleasure boats per capita in our part of the Great Lakes 
than anywhere else and the pickerel fishing is hard to beat.
<P>
	The commodore of the Windsor Yacht Club tells me that this 
summer the great Canada's Cup yachting race will be held on 
Lake St. Clair. The Canadian entry to that race and its crew will 
be hosted by the Windsor Yacht Club as they compete to return 
that cup to Canada.
<P>
	The Tecumseh Corn Festival is held at the end of August every 
year. It is a tremendous event that brings close to a quarter of a 
million people into Tecumseh for a great weekend of food, fun 
and enjoyment. Tecumseh itself is a spirited historical town with 
a tremendous sense of community.
<P>
	St. Clair Beach is a picturesque village at the far eastern edge 
of the riding. It is the home of that great Canadian athlete, Chris 
Lori, who is the captain of our National Olympic Bobsledding 
Team. St. Clair Beach will be watching closely as Chris Lori and 
his teammates represent Canada at Lillehammer next month. I 
suspect that we will be seeing Olympic gold in St. Clair Beach 
before very long.
<P>
	Windsor-St. Clair is also an industrial riding. Many 
manufacturing endeavours make their home in Windsor which is 
known as Canada's motor city. Among them of course we have 
the big three auto makers: Chrysler, Ford and General Motors. 
Other industries exist there as well.
<P>
	Any mention of Windsor-St. Clair industries must include 
one of our oldest manufacturers, the Hiram Walker distillery 
located in the Walkerville section of Windsor. Hiram Walker's 
of course is the home of the world famous Canadian Club 
whiskey.
<P>
	Windsor-St. Clair was also the home of a very famous 
Canadian who once stood in this place. It is humbling to know 
that in coming here I am a successor to that great Canadian 
statesman, the late Hon. Paul Martin, Senior or ``Oom Paul'' as 
he was known at home, the architect of many aspects of our 
present day social safety net. He sat here as the Liberal member 
for what was formerly Essex East, in later years was 
Windsor-Walkerville and today is Windsor-St. Clair.
<P>
	Paul and Nell Martin contributed unstintingly to the life of 
our constituency and to the country as a whole. It is quite a 
legacy and these are indeed some great shoes that I seek to fill.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if you or other hon. members visit my riding of 
Windsor-St. Clair, you will undoubtedly travel along 
Riverside Drive through all three of our municipalities. As you 
do, you will be able to look not very far away casting an eye to 
the north to our great national neighbour, the United States of 
America. It is a unique geographic fact that Detroit, Michigan 
and its eastern suburbs are actually located north of Windsor.
<P>
	It is also a unique geographical fact that we live in 
Windsor-St. Clair very clearly in the shadow of that great 
country which is so close that going to the States for lunch is a 
matter of course for some of my constituents. This is at once part 
of the charm and the advantage of our area. It also at times can 
be a great disadvantage.
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	Over the last nine years of Tory rule we in Windsor-St. Clair 
have often felt that Canada in the eyes of the former government 
stopped somewhere east of us on highway 401. However, that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="531"> 531 </A></B>
<P>
has not stopped us or prevented us from remaining fiercely 
Canadian and fiercely proud of our heritage.
<P>
	Under the former government's policies we suffered at home 
but we fought back. We fought back against fiscal policies that 
fostered the closing of our manufacturing plants. We fought 
back against taxation policies that encouraged the phenomenon 
of cross-border shopping and we fought back against cultural 
policies that resulted in events such as the closing of our only 
television station, CBC station CBET on channel 9.
<P>
	Canadians discovered Windsor in December 1990 when 
10,000 of our citizens crowded onto the river front to fight back 
against those cuts. They fought back again in 1993 when they 
voted overwhelmingly Liberal.
<P>
	They voted Liberal because they read the red book and they 
recognized in it a plan that was practical and yet hopeful. They 
know that the Prime Minister is a man of his word and that his 
government, our government, is going to deliver for them. They 
also know that they can count on us to watch out for their 
interests.
<P>
	In the near future the city of Windsor is about to embark on a 
great adventure as it becomes the home of the first Ontario 
casino. The last federal government refused to recognize that it 
had a role to play in ensuring that the casino project was a 
success in our community, but our government has moved 
quickly to make certain that we anticipate the needs of that 
community and that we can continue to meet them and that we 
can move quickly to do so.
<P>
	The municipalities in our riding have appreciated the 
infrastructure program which is moving forward at a rapid pace. 
Windsor-St. Clair is poised to take advantage of these new jobs 
and this infusion of cash into our communities so that we can 
make them even better places in which to live and in which to 
make a living.
<P>
	Windsor-St. Clair wants the kind of government that this 
side of the House has to offer. It wants a government that 
understands the need for economic growth as a tool for deficit 
control. It wants a government that cares about the quality of life 
of its citizens and that governs fairly, practically and with 
compassion.
<P>
	These are the qualities that those in Windsor-St. Clair want 
and these are the qualities that this government has displayed in 
the throne speech last week. That is why I urge this House and 
these hon. members to vote in favour of the motion by the hon. 
member for Bruce-Grey and seconded by the hon. member for 
Madawaska-Victoria.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John):</B> Mr. speaker, the hon. 
member just mentioned in her speech that the Liberal 
government is worried about our people, it wants to do what is 
right for our people and it wants to have programs that are going 
to help our people. I would just ask the hon. member one 
question.
<P>
	The RRSP homebuyers plan has helped more than 200,000 
Canadians buy a home. These are people who could never buy a 
home before. This has helped to create many jobs not only on the 
construction sites but in areas like forestry, home furnishings 
and appliances. I know  that we understand that spinoff effect. It 
has been done with no cost to the treasury.
<P>
	Here is my question to you, dear. I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, it is 
my question to the member. Will the hon. member commit that 
she will try to get her government to extend this plan beyond its 
March 1 expiry date?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the terms of 
endearment from 50 per cent of the Conservative caucus. This is 
an incredible feat I think for a Liberal backbencher.
<P>
	In any event I want to point out that question more 
appropriately might be put to the Minister of Finance but in his 
absence I am happy to answer it.
<P>
	I can tell you that this government is very concerned about the 
tax program and taxation in this country. We have seen, over the 
past nine years, taxes become more and more unfair. It would be 
imposed more and more on the backs of the very people the 
member just referred to the middle class, the working class and 
homeowners in our country. This taxation has caused so many 
problems in my riding in terms of the loss of jobs and other 
results of their inherent unfairness.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	The RRSP program and other programs I am sure are being 
looked at by the Minister of Finance and his people now. 
Certainly he is consulting widely in this area. I would suggest to 
my friend that any steps the Minister of Finance takes to make 
the former Conservative taxation system more fair in this 
country will result in more jobs for Windsor-St. Clair, more 
jobs for Saint John and more jobs for Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, part of the 
statement by the member for Windsor-St. Clair dealing with 
the importance of the automobile industry in her riding gives me 
an opportunity to recall that the auto industry in Ontario has an 
extremely important position compared to the auto industry in 
Quebec. Quebec makes only 7 or 8 per cent of all the 
automobiles assembled in Canada.
<P>
	That part of the country surely had tremendous economic 
development due to the auto industry, among other things. In the 
last recession, the riding of Windsor found out what less 
well-off cities go through and what tough economic times are 
like. That does not please me, on the contrary. Perhaps since that 
part of the country, that part of Ontario, had such difficulties, 
Ontario may be a little more sensitive to the realities of other 
Canadian provinces.
<P>
	I close with a question. It is widely agreed that the 
Conservative government's monetary policy was partly 
responsible for the economic difficulties that we are still in. I 
have trouble understanding, however, with regard to the 
Windsor-St. Clair region, which suffered a little from this 
monetary policy-why the Liberal government finally chose the 
previous governor's deputy to be the  Governor of the Bank of 
Canada. I have trouble with that because it seems to me that their 
problems may recur, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="532"> 532 </A></B>
<P>
since the same people or the same mentality will direct Canada's 
monetary policy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am again happy to stand in and 
answer questions that might more appropriately be addressed to 
the Minister of Finance. However, I can say to this House in 
response to the comments by the hon. member that 
Windsor-St. Clair did indeed suffer during the recession as a 
result of the policies of the former Conservative government. 
However, Windsor-St. Clair and the entire region managed to 
survive in spite of those policies. That survival was in part 
because of the vision of our community leaders and because of 
the vision of our local people who realized the importance of 
diversifying the economy and moving into other areas.
<P>
	The appointment of a new governor at the Bank of Canada will 
not, I do not think, significantly change the progress that is 
being felt at the present time in our community. However, the 
attitude of the new government will change that and will assist 
in growth that I believe will be unprecedented in the history of 
my community.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Mr. Speaker, this being my 
first speech in the House, I want to at this time congratulate the 
Speaker on his appointment to the chair and also congratulate 
the other Speakers so appointed.
<P>
<B>(1915 ) </B>
<P>
	Your job, Mr. Speaker, is a very important one and I think 
especially so in this 35th session of Parliament because this 
country really is at a crossroads. Given the mix of parties and 
given the mood of the public, the Speaker's position I think will 
be very important in terms of balancing the debates and keeping 
order.
<P>
	I must admit that I am somewhat awed to speak in this House, 
and to be quite honest that surprises me. I will explain why. This 
is a place where I did not expect to be especially on this side of 
the rail because as little as 15 months ago I was completely 
disillusioned with the House of Commons, with the government 
of the day and with the bureaucracies that serve the various 
ministries.
<P>
	I was completely disillusioned with the process and the House 
of Commons and the government because I had spent the last 
nine years going before committees to give our organization's 
point of view and felt that it had been a waste of time and I had 
not been heard. As experienced parliamentarians like to call it 
``this place'', I felt this place had lost touch with the people that 
it was supposed to serve. The election of so many new members 
this time and of a Liberal government with a plan of direction 
via the red book signifies that.
<P>
	However, through the course of this Parliament we must 
ensure that ``this place'' becomes ``our place'' from the 
perspective of Canadians. I think all of us on both sides of the 
House have a responsibility in seeing that this place becomes 
``our place'' from the perspective of Canadians, whether it is 
from what we like to call the emerald isle of Prince Edward 
Island, the province of Quebec or Saskatchewan. This place 
must be where the voice of Canada and Canadians is heard.
<P>
	As I mentioned a moment ago that certainly did not happen 
during the last nine years. The throne speech speaks of 
providing members of Parliament greater opportunity to 
contribute to the development of public policy and legislation. 
That is perhaps one of the most important things that we can do. 
We can change the direction from the past and give people the 
opportunity to speak and be heard. It is a very important 
direction and a direction in which ordinary MPs can be given the 
opportunity to have some power in the House of Commons to 
speak on behalf of their constituents and their country.
<P>
	Certainly in that context, giving ordinary MPs some power, 
there are differences. There is debate. We have seen that in the 
House already. That is what a democracy is all about. It is about 
the thrust and pros and cons of debate and out of that debate 
coming up with the best solution possible.
<P>
	I want to take a moment to very sincerely thank the people of 
Malpeque for giving me this opportunity to work with and for 
them. My riding really stretches from Summerside, Prince 
Edward Island, bypasses Charlottetown and goes to the 
community of Marshfield. In my riding farming, fishing and 
tourism are the major industries and agriculture is certainly the 
big one. We have many small industries and two large potato 
processing plants, but as an island we are very dependent in 
terms of exports, be it potatoes or other products from the 
island.
<P>
	I think one thing that is significant about Prince Edward 
Island is that it is basically a community of communities and we 
believe strongly in community spirit and helping one another in 
times of difficulty. I think we have to relate that to Canada as 
well.
<P>
	I come from kind of a unique experience in that I have 
travelled this country during the last 20 years, the last 10 as 
president of the National Farmers' Union. I just wish that every 
Canadian could have that kind of experience. We are great at 
criticizing our own country. I have lived about half the time in 
Saskatchewan, but I have travelled across the country and have 
seen its potential: how great a country it can be if it remains 
united. When foreign countries look at Canada they wonder why 
we are fighting among ourselves and think that with our 
tremendous resource base, land base and people base we should 
be using them to good advantage in building a nation.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	The speech from the throne starts to build on some of our 
opportunities. Indeed there are many challenges before us as 
well. In the three months since the election the government has 
to a great extent been keeping its commitments. Last week in my 
province there was the announcement of a $36 million 
infrastructure program. It will develop critical infrastructure 
work and create direct and indirect jobs. Also the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans has indicated that he will be providing 
assistance to fishermen who are having great difficulty as a 
result of the cod crisis.
<P>
	I recognize that we do, though, face enormous challenges that 
have been left with us as a result of the last nine years. I 
recognize the government has entered into NAFTA and GATT. I 
share the concerns of many Canadians about both these 
agreements. I worry that in these agreements there is a 
considerable loss of sovereignty. Will we really have the right to 
govern or will we just be administrators of the various trade 
agreements? The Prime Minister has spoken to this somewhat. 
He has given his commitment and the commitment of the 
Canadian government to ensure that these trade agreements 
work in the interests of Canadians. That is our objective and that 
is our commitment.
<P>
	I take exception to the comment of a Bloc Quebecois member 
who spoke two speakers ago. I repeat what he said. He said that 
the minister of agriculture was negotiating to eliminate the 
tariffs. That statement is wrong. The minister of agriculture is 
negotiating in the interests of our dairy farmers to keep the tariff 
levels high so that we can enhance and protect the supply 
management system. The government is committed to 
agriculture. It is committed to the supply management system. It 
is committed to the Canadian Wheat Board. This government 
offers hope for the future.
<P>
	In conclusion, we are faced with a challenge to take charge in 
these difficult times and institute our agenda as outlined in the 
red book. The throne speech and the progress made to date are 
good starts. I emphasize again the point that by giving power to 
MPs, as we have indicated in the throne speech, we bring 
democracy back to the country, give everyone their input and 
certainly work in the interests of people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Essex-Kent):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to direct a question to my colleague who just finished a very 
excellent presentation. Certainly he tried to clarify the major 
concerns we hear about the GATT negotiations the minister has 
successfully worked on for the Canadian farm community.
<P>
	What are my colleague's thoughts with regard to the difficult 
job the minister inherited coming into the GATT discussions, 
putting in tariff barriers and making sure that much of the 
agriculture production under supply management has a fair 
amount of protection?  Does he feel that our supply management 
system will be pretty stable and in a very positive direction?
<P>
	That is a question many people in agriculture have asked. 
Certainly the minister has responded in favourable ways. What 
are my colleague's thoughts in that area?
<P>
<B>(1925 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly in terms of the GATT 
negotiations the retaining and the strenghthening of article 
XI(ii)(c) was the preferred direction of the government. It ended 
up that it was not in the cards. What we tried to achieve at that 
time was the tariffication approach and to establish very high 
tariffs to protect our supply management industry.
<P>
	The agreement does not come into place until July or August 
1995. That gives us some time in order to meet with the supply 
management groups and other groups and to set up the system in 
such a way that we can have a growing and prosperous industry 
in the future. The supply management system in Canada, I 
believe and we believe as a government, is a model for the 
world. It provides a high quality product at reasonable prices to 
consumers and is a great food security policy.
<P>
	The minister of agriculture is very committed in his 
discussions with the secretary of agriculture of the United States 
to trying to achieve the objectives we set out during the election 
of protecting and enhancing the supply management system.
<P>
	It is a difficult job. We were left with negotiations when so 
much had been given away by the previous administration. It is a 
very difficult negotiation, but I believe the minister of 
agriculture will prevail and the supply management system will 
indeed survive.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, just a brief 
comment, because I did not understand. The member referred to 
Mr. Marchand saying the Minister of Agriculture was 
negotiating the abolition of tariffs. I do not think the member for 
Québec-Est, critic for the Official Opposition, said that. 
According to me, what he said was the Minister of Agriculture is 
now negotiating with the United States and the negotiations deal 
with the abolition of tariffs. If one country is trying to do away 
with tariffs, it is certainly not Canada, it is the United States. 
Still, Canada has to face that first problem, merely five weeks 
after the signing of the GATT agreements.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with the last part of the 
questioner's comments. The record certainly will show what 
was said. What I copied down was that the minister was being 
accused of negotiations to eliminate the tariffs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="534"> 534 </A></B>
<P>
	That is the opposite of what the Minister of Agriculture is 
trying to do. I want to emphasize that fact. The minister is very 
much in negotiations with the secretary of agriculture for the 
United States and is very definitely trying to negotiate an 
agreement to keeps tariffs high, which is our right and should be 
our right under the GATT. That is exactly what he is trying to do. 
He is trying to have them high enough to keep our supply 
managed system in place, in tact and secure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is the first opportunity I have had to speak in the House of 
Commons. I wish to commence by congratulating you, Sir, on 
your appointment and congratulating all newly elected members 
on their first venture to the House of Commons. It is quite an 
exciting place to be.
<P>
	I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the former 
member for Regina-Lumsden, Mr. Les Benjamin. Les 
Benjamin served his constituents and his country for 25 years. 
He was a very strong voice on behalf of the people of 
Saskatchewan and the people of Canada. In particular he was an 
ardent defender of issues such as the wheat board, the Crow rate 
and rail transportation. It is with some sadness that I report to 
the House that he is now in the hospital and is very ill. I 
understand he is doing well in spirit. On behalf of the 
constituents of Regina-Lumsden I pay tribute to his service to 
the country.
<P>
	I represent a district which has the capital city of 
Saskatchewan, Regina. It is an urban area with some rural parts 
to it, including the farms and towns of Lumsden, Regina Beach, 
Grand Coulee and Pense. There is also a major steel and pipe 
producer in our riding by the name of IPSCO. It employs a 
substantial number of people and is a significant contributor to 
the economy of both Regina and Saskatchewan.
<P>
<B>(1930) </B>
<P>
	I thank very much the families and the voters of 
Regina-Lumsden who have given me their support and their 
confidence during the last number of months, and in particular 
during the election campaign. I am honoured to be their 
representative. I am proud to speak in the House on their behalf. 
My commitment to them is to work as hard as I can on their 
behalf to ensure they have a voice in Parliament and that they 
have someone who will speak about their priorities.
<P>
	Their priorities are the priorities of the majority of Canadians. 
They want a government that is open, honest and accountable for 
its actions. They want a government that does all in its power to 
ensure that more Canadians are working and that we have a 
strong economy. These people in my district-and I think it is 
throughout Canada-want more fairness in taxation policies. 
They want social programs which meet the needs of our people. I 
will work as hard as I can to ensure that the priorities of the 
people of Regina-Lumsden are the priorities of the 
government and of Parliament.
<P>
	The throne speech was one of the shortest throne speeches 
ever. It is 17 minutes short if it is read very slowly. It leaves 
Canadians to wonder if this means the government does not want 
to tell us what it is going to do or that it does not know what is 
going to happen next. What concerns me is that it is probably the 
problem.
<P>
	This new Parliament is faced with a job crisis in Canada. Over 
two million people are out of work. Unemployment is at record 
levels, even worse than during the great depression of the 1930s. 
Underemployment is widespread and much of the blame has to 
rest on the shoulders of the previous government. The previous 
Conservative government chose to deregulate industries 
causing lost jobs. It chose to have a high interest rate policy. It 
cancelled the manufacturers' federal sales tax. It brought in the 
GST and implemented other monetary policies which drove jobs 
away from Canada.
<P>
	As well the previous government chose to sign the 
U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement and the North American 
Free Trade Agreement, both opposed by the Liberals in 
opposition but endorsed and embraced by that same party while 
in government. The FTA and NAFTA have not only cost 
Canadians hundreds of thousands of lost jobs but have reduced 
our ability as government to make sovereign decisions which 
affect our lives.
<P>
	As we go through some of the policies of the previous 
government one concludes they were all meant to serve the 
corporate agenda that allows the powerful corporations the 
ability to make their own economic decisions unfettered without 
contributing their fair share to the economy. This Conservative 
agenda has increased corporate profits, created high 
unemployment, driven up government deficits and debt, and 
jeopardized our ability to provide the population with jobs and 
decent social programs.
<P>
	What is the answer to the serious problems in our country? By 
reading the speech from the throne the Liberal government's 
answer appears to be that it does not know. Canadians had better 
brace themselves because it looks like the job crisis and the 
corporate agenda will continue. What the government must do is 
put people first in its agenda rather than the wealthy 
corporations and the wealthy families.
<P>
	It seems to me the government has already shown its lack of 
concern for jobs by backing down on NAFTA and by 
flip-flopping on the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement which 
weakened our economic well being and our manufacturing 
sector in particular.
<P>
	In their throne speech the Liberals have backed down on their 
promise of jobs, jobs, jobs by not announcing the apprenticeship 
program. An apprenticeship program is desperately needed 
across the country by 400,000 jobless young Canadians. Does 
this mean the Liberal promise of jobs training for these young 
people has been forgotten?  It may be forgotten by the Liberals 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="535"> 535 </A></B>
<P>
but not by New Democrats or by 400,000 jobless young 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1935 ) </B>
<P>
	There was no mention of creating jobs in agriculture. In fact, 
there not even a reference to agriculture in the speech from the 
throne. This was an incredible omission considering the recent 
GATT decisions in Paris and since the Minister of Agriculture, 
the member for Regina-Wascana, has worked so earnestly in 
cabinet on behalf of farmers throughout Canada. It is 
unbelievable there would be no reference to agriculture after all 
his work.
<P>
	No reference was made to the natural resources sector. This is 
a sector that built this country. It was totally ignored in the 
speech. It is clear that not only western Canada was ignored in 
the throne speech but that unemployed and overtaxed Canadians 
everywhere were left wanting as well.
<P>
	This speech made comments about major overhauls to the 
social security system but gave no details about one of the latest 
acts of Parliament, Bill C-91, which extended the patent on 
some prescription drugs for up to 20 years and guaranteed drug 
manufacturers monopoly prices and substantial profits at 
Canadians' expense.
<P>
	Prescription drugs in Canada are the most expensive in the 
world as a result of this bill. Yet the Liberal government has 
taken no steps to repeal it. Repealing Bill C-91 would reduce the 
financial burden on health care consumers in need of 
prescription drugs and on provincial government drug plans 
which are under great stress as we speak here today.
<P>
	Repealing this devastating law would also stimulate the 
creation of new jobs in the Canadian generic drug 
manufacturing sector. As long as this act remains law, 
Canadians will continue to suffer life-threatening hardship.
<P>
	Since this bill was given royal assent, the cost of prescription 
drugs has dramatically increased. People using prescription 
drugs are being forced to decide between buying life sustaining 
drugs or buying life sustaining food, in particular those people 
on fixed or low incomes in my riding.
<P>
	We cannot allow this unfair monopolistic law which allows 
international drug companies to charge whatever they want 
without competition to continue to hurt those people who 
through no fault of their own need help the most. Bill C-91 must 
be repealed and must be repealed immediately.
<P>
	We in the New Democratic Party applaud the recognition by 
the government in the throne speech that in some countries 
today: ``Democracy is under stress, its future uncertain''. 
Canada is under stress too, particularly those Canadians who are 
jobless or who are worried about losing their jobs. Canadians are 
also anxious and under stress because of their concern for the  
possible loss of their social programs which provide a sense of 
security to them and their families.
<P>
	Historically the New Democratic Party has strongly 
supported initiatives that build and strengthen democratic 
governments and promote peace. We in the New Democratic 
Party are Canadian nationalists. We do not believe in a regional 
nationalism or an ethnic nationalism. We believe both these 
manifestations of nationalism are destructive to our Canadian 
unity. We believe strongly that the government should balance 
the economic powers in the country to ensure that there is 
fairness in the programs for our people.
<P>
	We have always believed in a strong central government but it 
has to reflect the changing realities of our times. We believe 
government works best when people are working. If people are 
not working, democracy is under stress.
<P>
	It is hard to talk to people about national unity when they are 
unemployed or under employed. When people cannot afford to 
have things which they need to live, democracy will always be 
under stress.
<P>
	I am putting this government under notice that the NDP will 
not permit the Canadian agenda to be set until the jobless are 
working. These are important issues to us and to all Canadians.
<P>
	I hope the government will follow the quote I have taken from 
somebody who said this before with respect to organizing the 
government and putting together a program to rebuild our 
country. Somebody once said the true test of our democratic 
society is not whether we add to the abundance of those who 
have much but whether we provide enough for those who have 
too little.

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully 
to the speech by the hon. member from the New Democratic 
Party. His statement about regionalism caught my attention. He 
also said that he favoured a strong central government.
<P>
	I just want to tell the other members that the only NDP 
member ever elected in a by-election in Quebec did not run 
again in the last election because of his party's insensitivity. I 
think it is worth underlining that aspect to show the insensitivity 
of a so-called democratic party towards people from across the 
country and particularly towards Quebec. In the end, I think that 
the population judged them on that.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would ask the hon. 
member for Lévis to briefly repeat his comment and question so 
that the hon. member for Regina-Lumsden can respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Thank you for giving me more time. I basically 
said that only once in Quebec's history was an NDP member, the 
former hon. member for Chambly, elected in a by-election. 
Despite his potential, this devoted and dynamic person decided 
not to run again in the last general election and, in our opinion, 
his decision was due to his party's insensitivity towards what 
was happening in Quebec.
<P>
	Does his party, having noted the results of the democratic vote 
held last October 25, want to review its position regarding a 
strong central federal government?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member has put a very 
important question. The New Democratic Party believes in 
democracy. We went through an election campaign and ran 
candidates in every constituency in this country on the basis of a 
jobs plan that we felt would work. I thought the jobs plan was 
very attractive and popular with many people. As a matter of 
fact it was so popular that the Liberal Party basically took it and 
put a red cover on it and sold it as their own. Unfortunately it had 
a little more success in marketing its program, which was based 
on ours, than we did.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member that I am not very well versed in 
all of the dynamics in Quebec. However we as a party really 
believe that government does work. Liberals and Conservatives 
fight campaigns on the basis that governments do not work, 
elect us and we will prove it.
<P>
	We believe that government does work. New Democrats have 
been in government in Saskatchewan for 36 of the last 50 years 
and nationally we have adopted many of their programs, one 
being medicare. If we were of the view that government did not 
work we probably would not let our names stand to try to 
become the government. We want to ensure that government 
serves the people from which it derives its power.
<P>
	I very much believe in the public service. I believe that all of 
us in this Parliament have come here with honourable 
intentions. I believe that truly. I think all of us want to see 
something better for our country after four years in this 
Parliament than when we first got here.
<P>
	I still believe that government has to have certain authority 
and certain influence and certain economic instruments to use in 
tough economic times. When the economy is very difficult and 
there is a lack of jobs, it is extremely important that government 
take the initiative and use whatever economic instruments it has 
as a  central government to create jobs. I still believe very much 
in a strong central government. Perhaps it is not understood 
across the country as much as we would like, and that is one of 
the reasons I made reference to it tonight. I thank the member 
very much for the question.
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your 
appointment to the chair. I would also like to take this 
opportunity to congratulate my fellow MPs on their election or 
re-election. I would especially like to express my appreciation 
to my constituents in Lisgar-Marquette who have put their 
trust in me to represent them in this 35th Parliament and to my 
good wife, Fran, who has been my constant support and friend 
for the last 32 years.
<P>
	The constituency of Lisgar-Marquette is a very diversified 
area. Agriculture is the prominent industry and we grow 
everything from vegetables such as commercial potatoes, 
onions, carrots, to fruits such as apples and blueberries. We also 
grow all coarse grains plus special crops such as lentils, sugar 
beets, yellow mustard and oil seeds like canola, sunflower and 
flax. We also have beef, dairy, egg and poultry producers.
<P>
	In manufacturing we produce everything from small line 
machinery and grain trailers to recreational vehicles.
<P>
	Beautiful scenery abounds in Lisgar-Marquette. We are 
blessed with the Pembina Valley which offers an abundance of 
recreational activities. From the fertile land of the Red River 
Valley to the beautiful and unique desert in Spruce Woods Park 
at Glenboro, Lisgar-Marquette is truly a rare and exceptional 
place to live.
<P>
	The voters of Lisgar-Marquette sent me to the House of 
Commons with one strong message: that the House of Commons 
again become the voice of the people and that politicians and 
bureaucrats become accountable to the Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	The people of Lisgar-Marquette have become very disturbed 
about the moral, financial and political state of our country. 
What took our forefathers 100 years to build has been 
mismanaged to the point of bankruptcy by Liberal and 
Conservative governments in the last two decades. The ordinary 
working people of this country have continually increased 
production so that our country has not had a manufacturing trade 
deficit for the last two decades. During one of the most 
productive times in our history the elite of our country have not 
only mismanaged our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="537"> 537 </A></B>
<P>
economy but have mortgaged the future of our children and 
grandchildren.
<P>
	It is very sad and unacceptable to see two million Canadians 
depending on food banks during this past Christmas season as a 
direct result of a quarter of a century of political malaise.
<P>
	In Manitoba a recent survey stated that 20 per cent of the 
school children go to school hungry. A United Nations 
children's fund report notes that Canada has one of the highest 
child poverty rates among the wealthy industrialized nations. In 
1989 this House passed a resolution pledging to eliminate child 
poverty by the year 2000; in fact, more than 1.2 million 
Canadian children were living in poverty in 1991, a 30 per cent 
increase in two years in the number of people under 18 whose 
families can scarcely afford the essentials of life.
<P>
	Given that 1991 and 1992 were recession years, it can be 
safely assumed that the rate is now even higher. Teachers see it. 
Police see it. The courts see it. We all see it, if we dare, the result 
of governments' economic mismanagement. Poverty that leaves 
our children disadvantaged, apathetic and often hopeless; 
poverty that brings Canadian families to turmoil. The cost to our 
country is beyond value.
<P>
	While we in the Reform Party have been given a mandate by 
the electorate to streamline government spending and slash the 
deficit, an even more important impetus comes from the single 
most important future resource, our children. It is on behalf of 
these future generations that the Reform Party has accepted the 
task of changing some of the policies that have denied Canada 
the prosperity it deserves and has cast doubt on the promising 
futures that our children deserve.
<P>
<B>(1950) </B>
<P>
	Only through an influx of new attitudes can we build this new 
Canada for future generations. Imagine a fiscal reform initiative 
where public funds are regarded by governments as funds held 
in trust instead of assets that must be spent too often unwisely.
<P>
	Simply put and speaking as a farmer, it does not seem right 
that a banker can tell farmers they will have to pay higher 
interest rates because their products are being sold for a bargain 
basement price, a price which they have no control over.
<P>
	At the same time, because of the bank's bad investments in 
foreign countries for projects like Canary Wharf, they will again 
pay higher service charges and interest to cover the bank's 
financial mismanagement of the country's wealth. Where is the 
justice in this type of reasoning? How can our youth translate 
this type of logic into a promising future?
<P>
	I heard the Prime Minister say the other day that MPs' salaries 
were still far below that of professional hockey players. Well 
hockey players are paid for their performance. How should we 
rate the performance of MPs over the last two decades? They 
have stick-handled their way through the taxpayers' 
pocket-book resulting in taxes that are eating up half of their 
pay cheques. Any farmer or businessman who continually puts 
his or her  operation into debt year after year for a quarter of a 
century would have long ago been bankrupt and not rewarded 
with a gold plated pension.
<P>
	I have never gone to sow a field in spring from which I have 
not expected a bumper crop. As a new politician I also expect a 
bumper crop of positive changes in this 35th Parliament. If these 
changes do not happen in this Parliament there are 52 very 
capable Reform MPs determined to make those changes in the 
36th Parliament from the other side of the House.
<P>
	The Reform spirit was born at Beaver River, has spread into 
Ontario and will not be deterred until it reaches the east coast of 
Newfoundland. It is only through political, financial and 
judicial reform that there will be a future for this great nation of 
ours, a future that our children will be anxious to embrace.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the 
hon. member for his concern for young people. In my party I am 
the critic for youth, and I would say that the problem is the large 
number, more than two million, of young people living in 
poverty. I think it is extremely important not to forget this fact.
<P>
	However, a little further in his speech he says that the way to 
improve the situation is to lower taxes. He does not even 
mention any program that could help people, especially young 
people, get out of poverty. Could he comment on that?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member sure has my 
feelings along the line of child poverty.
<P>
	During my years of farming I saw hundreds or thousands of 
farmers go bankrupt because of interest rates as high as 24 per 
cent. Today, these farmers are either taking away jobs from 
people who are living in the cities or supplementing their farm 
income if they have been able to hang on to their land. When one 
reads the statistics that over 50 per cent of net farm income 
today is received from off farm jobs, we can see why there is 
such a problem of destitution among young families, small and 
large.
<P>
<B>(1955) </B>
<P>
	I think it is very important that we correct this situation or 
there will be no future for this country even if we do clear up the 
deficit or whatever we do.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask the 
hon. member for Lisgar-Marquette if he and his party, the 
Reform Party, have reviewed the throne speech to see how much 
of it was ongoing items and initiatives that had been 
recommended or adopted by the previous government?
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="538"> 538 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know if there have been 
too many adopted. There is an old saying on the farm that kind 
words and good intentions do not feed any critters. That is pretty 
well all I have heard in this Parliament during the first few 
weeks I have been here. I think that is all the farmers and the 
unemployed heard in the last Parliament.
<P>
	I think it needs action, not just words and good intentions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> 
Congratulations, Mr. Speaker, on your election and 
appointment. I also wish to congratulate the Prime Minister and 
each of the members elected to this House.
<P>
	I pledge to support the positive reforms the government 
introduces and condemn any and all policies and legislation 
which does not have the support of the majority of Canadians or 
my constituents.
<P>
	I have lived in a number of countries in the world and I always 
keep coming home to Yorkton-Melville, the heart of Canada's 
parkland area.
<P>
	An issue which has been raised in the House more than any 
other is which riding is the most beautiful riding in Canada. I 
suggest, when the more pressing issues are behind us, that this 
matter could be resolved once and for all in a special day-long 
debate.
<P>
	The voters of Yorkton-Melville deserve a special thank you 
for their participation in the democratic process and for electing 
me as their servant. I pledge to faithfully represent my 
constituents' views in Ottawa regardless of the party or 
candidate they supported. I am their spokesperson. Through me 
their voices will be heard in this Chamber.
<P>
	I saved my most important thank you for the last, that being to 
my wife Lydia, my family and friends. Without their support I 
would not be here.
<P>
	The throne speech mentions a lot about the need for reform of 
the social security system. Unfortunately our so-called safety 
nets have been catching more people than the fish nets in 
Newfoundland have been catching cod in the last few years. In 
fact, in addition to the 1.6 million unemployed there are another 
869,000 workers who are so discouraged that they have given up 
looking for work. If this is not discouraging enough, the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I> reported last week that almost a third of Canada's work 
force is locked into insecure jobs. The end result: 
unemployment insurance now costs employers, workers and 
taxpayers almost $20 billion a year.
<P>
	Between 1972 and 1992 the number of welfare recipients has 
more than doubled to over 2.7 million people. In 1992-93 it cost 
the federal government $7.3 billion. Taxpayers get hit again and 
again as the provincial and municipal governments have to pay 
their share as well. These statistics are clear evidence of a 
failing economy.
<P>
	In Newfoundland it seems that the only nets that are full are 
the safety nets. The system, not the people, is to blame.
<P>
	The replacement of both unemployment insurance and social 
assistance with an income supplement plan which would direct 
over 85 per cent of the money currently spent on these programs 
to the people in Newfoundland who are most in need was 
recommended by the Economic Recovery Commission report 
recently published.
<P>
	The report is a condemnation of the existing social security 
system. Page 6 of this report states: ``On the whole, the current 
system has induced an unconscionable degree of dependency 
which is unfair to contributors to the unemployment insurance 
fund and, in light of recent fiscal restraints, is not sustainable''.
<P>
<B>(2000) </B>
<P>
	In Saskatchewan our safety nets are also full and overflowing. 
In the last 20 years the amount of money spent on social 
assistance programs has increased seven times. In 1991-92 the 
case-load was over 28,000 people, 47 per cent were considered 
fully employable. The taxpayers would not feel so bad if they 
saw that the money we were spending was actually solving the 
problem. But it is not.
<P>
	It does not matter whether you live in Cornerbrook, 
Newfoundland or Yorkton, Saskatchewan, the system is sick and 
getting sicker.
<P>
	I would like to commend the government for the commitment 
to announce an action plan for a major reform of the social 
security system within the next two years and for its 
commitment to involve Canadians in the consultative process.
<P>
	I also wish to commend the provincial governments that are 
leading the way on income security reform in this country, 
particularly the provinces of New Brunswick, Newfoundland 
and Alberta. The time for protecting each other's turf is long 
past. The time for true innovation and common sense solutions 
is at hand. Canadians not only expect this of us, they deserve it.
<P>
	While we are encouraged by the government's commitment to 
undertake a consultative process for the next two years, we are 
surprised by the lack of detail about what direction 
modernization and restructuring might take. Yes, Canadians 
want to be directly involved in the process of change, but they 
expect some leadership when we are embarking on what appears 
to be a complete overhaul of our income security system.
<P>
	If the government's action plan is to succeed it will have to 
pass several tests. First of all, will our social programs be 
financially sustainable or will we keep mortgaging our 
children's future?
<P>
	Second, will unemployment insurance be returned to the 
principles of a true insurance plan?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="539"> 539 </A></B>
<P>
	The third test is will the government's restructuring address 
the weaknesses identified by the Newfoundland Economic 
Recovery Commission?
<P>
	The fourth test is, considering our forty-five billion dollar 
deficit this year and our half trillion dollar debt, why is it 
necessary for this process to take two years when so much data, 
analysis and public input already exists on the subject?
<P>
	The Reform Party's blue book provides some leadership, 
direction and grassroots input. Principle 10 of the Reform Party 
Constitution states: ``We believe that Canadians have a personal 
and collective responsibility to care and provide the basic needs 
of people who are unable to care and provide for themselves''. 
Our blue book goes on to state that government should first, 
develop a family or household oriented, comprehensive social 
security system administered through the income tax system. 
Basically, one system would replace all others.
<P>
	Second, explore all the options including a guaranteed annual 
income, security investment fund and a negative income tax, to 
name a few.
<P>
	Third, design several programs that would encourage 
families, communities, non-governmental agencies and the 
private sector to resume their responsibilities in the social 
service areas.
<P>
	Fourth, target social service benefits to those who need the 
help the most.
<P>
	Last, ensure that our social programs are financially 
sustainable in the long term.
<P>
	In closing, I would ask all members and parties to co-operate 
and collaborate as we reform our social safety nets. A net can 
have two uses. Nets can stop a person from getting hurt when he 
or she falls, but a net can also trap its victims so they cannot get 
out. Let us help release many of the people who are trapped in 
our safety nets.
<P>
	In 1989 a report issued by the Economic Council of Canada 
said: ``We need to turn our safety nets into trampolines. People 
want and need work not welfare. People want and need to be 
trained and retrained to survive in this global economy''.
<P>
	Judith Maxwell, former head of the Economic Council of 
Canada, was quoted last week saying: ``Measures to encourage 
skills training and mobility could create ladders to help people 
climb out of low paying, insecure jobs. Canadian workers need 
to know how to hitchhike down the new information highway''.
<P>
<B>(2005) </B>
<P>
	I also believe Canadians have a right to live anywhere they 
want in this great country, but they do not have a right to become 
permanent wards of the state. We need to create incentives in the 
new system that make people independent of government, not 
dependent on it.
<P>
	Let us help people help themselves. Let us eliminate the 
duplication of effort by federal and provincial bureaucracies. 
Let us provide help to the people who need it most. Let us make 
sure our social spending is an investment in the future. Most of 
all, let us show the voters of this country that their tax dollars are 
being well spent.
<P>
	I appeal to the House to support freer votes so that all 
members have the freedom to vote as their constituents wish and 
I appeal to all members to support any and all motions before 
this House that reduce the tax burden on all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to comment on what the hon. member for 
Yorkton-Melville said. Granted, certain aspects of Canada's 
social programs and health programs could be reviewed. But to 
do so at the expense of UI and welfare recipients is akin to 
blaming the present economic situation and government finance 
problems on the have-nots of our society, when we know full 
well that this is not the case. The system is allowing abuse to 
continue. Just this week, more cases were identified. Reference 
was made to tax shelters being commonplace and family trusts 
being tax exempt. We could also question the $12 billion Canada 
invested in national defence. Another very concrete example 
was given this week when the leader of the Reform Party asked 
why it was that the Governor General did not pay taxes when he 
is earning something in the neighbourhood of $97,000. It looks 
good to ask a question like that, but the same people are 
denouncing social programs as the cause of our current 
economic problems. That makes no sense. I think that Canadians 
should be made aware of the need to show compassion for the 
less fortunate. I am not saying that there is no abuse. There 
probably is. But, goodness gracious, let us not sacrifice what 
makes Canada the envy of other nations.
<P>
	Just this week, we were told that the health care system in 
Canada represented 7 or 8 per cent of the GDP, while in the US, it 
was 12 to 15 per cent. It is simply not true that our system is 
expensive. What is true, on the other hand, is that our public debt 
is costing us a lot. In fact, it is too expensive and it is the 
ultimate reason why we apparently have to go and cut social 
programs. That is the easiest area to make cuts in, because it 
affects the less fortunate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not 
exactly sure if a question was asked or whether a statement was 
merely made, but I would like to pick up on something that 
member said.
<P>
	It is precisely because we are sympathetic to the 
disadvantaged and poor, those who are less fortunate in society 
that we need to redesign these programs. That is because we 
cannot continue to run deficits and continue  to build up our debt 
to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="540"> 540 </A></B>
<P>
point where everything will collapse and we will be left with 
nothing.
<P>
	We need to redesign these programs, to streamline them so 
that they meet the needs of Canadians. This is what I am 
advocating. It is precisely because we are trying to protect that 
element in society which will remain unprotected if we do not 
try to do something.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the member for 
Yorkton-Melville on his maiden speech and say it was a 
pleasure to hear it.
<P>
	My question regards the blue book. I wish the hon. member 
would elaborate a little on the negative income tax and financial 
fiscal management in that regard.
<P>
<B>(2010) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> It would take a bit of 
time to elaborate on the negative income tax. Basically 
something like that would work in this way: If a person was 
below a certain income, instead of paying income tax he would 
receive a certain percentage. I must say at the outset that the 
purpose of this is to create an incentive for people to work and 
earn money, not that the minute they do this they are penalized 
the amount they earn by not receiving a certain amount in social 
security payments or Canada assistance or whatever it is.
<P>
	That is the purpose of a negative income tax. A level would be 
developed. If someone did not reach that level he would get a 
certain percentage. If someone went over that level of course he 
would begin to pay income tax. In that way an incentive to find 
work is built into the system and people are not penalized for 
finding work.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before and during the election campaign we in the 
Liberal Party, and several other parties as well, criticized the 
Conservative government for promoting high unemployment 
and pursuing the wrong policies for debt reduction. We said that 
the government's obsession with inflation and government 
spending was wrong. The economy went into recession, we had 
record bankruptcies, unemployment soared to 11 per cent and 
the national debt tripled.
<P>
	We said that while some expenditures had to be cut, especially 
wasteful and non-productive expenditures, the principal 
emphasis had to be on job creation and economic growth.
<P>
	Under the Tory approach, people were put out of work, tax 
revenue declined, welfare and unemployment insurance 
payments increased, and the deficit grew.
<P>
	Under the plan put forward by the Liberal Party, Canadians 
would go back to work, companies would make profits, both 
would pay taxes and there would be less unemployment 
insurance, welfare and bail-outs to certain companies, and the 
deficit would be reduced.
<P>
	In the speech from the throne the Liberal government 
committed itself to these goals, and I quote: ``The government 
attaches the highest priority to job creation and economic 
growth in the short term and the long term.''
<P>
	We have put forward our commitment for the municipal 
infrastructure program; the residential rehabilitation assistance 
program, which is a program to restore our older housing and 
thereby create jobs and leave us with a better bank of housing; 
the youth service corps, which will help young people build the 
bridge between school and the workplace; better access to 
capital for small business; the Canadian investment fund to 
develop new technology; more research and development; and 
improved training and retraining.
<P>
	These are only some of the things that have been put forward 
in the speech from the throne. During this debate the various 
ministers have come forward to explain in greater detail some of 
those programs.
<P>
	While I am a strong proponent of training, retraining, 
advanced education and lifetime learning, we cannot presume 
that this alone will solve the unemployment problem. Some 
people have suggested that a greater percentage of the 
unemployment insurance fund should be used for training. 
However, I must remind them and others that a substantial 
number of unemployed Canadians are already fully trained. 
Their problem is not training but the lack of jobs.
<P>
	Furthermore, we must assure that the training programs are 
directed to the real economic needs of the country. On the one 
hand too often we are training people for trades that no longer 
are demanded by business and the public sector and on the other 
hand we have no courses for trades that are often in demand. I 
have seen that very often in my own city of Montreal where 
people are taking training courses. They finish the courses and 
there are no jobs available. On the other hand employers and 
businesses are looking for people to train and there is no one 
being trained in those areas.
<P>
<B>(2015) </B>
<P>
	In any case I welcome the review of income support and social 
security programs such as proposed in the speech from the 
throne to be initiated by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. I believe we will be debating that proposal on 
Monday.
<P>
	I would now like to deal with some of the objections that we 
hear with respect to the government's economic program to 
create jobs and stimulate growth. First we heard during the 
election campaign, and we still hear it today, that the 
infrastructure program is simply a large scale attempt to fix 
potholes and will not create any permanent jobs.
<P>
	To begin with this program has the support of all the provinces 
in Canada and the great majority of all the municipalities. It is 
much more than fixing potholes, which is a very simplistic 
response to a very important program.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="541"> 541 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister and the Prime Minister have said that the 
interpretation of infrastructure will be a very wide one. It will 
apply to roads, highways, ports, airports, sewage systems, 
public transportation, communications systems, water 
treatment facilities, bridges, and so on. These public works will 
create direct and indirect jobs while being built. The indirect 
jobs of course are those which will be supplying the construction 
materials, all the materials that are needed in bringing about the 
renewal and building of such infrastructure projects. We also at 
the same time create a better environment for private investment 
in the renewed, better equipped cities and towns.
<P>
	This is what attracts tourists, attracts business and attracts 
economic growth. Such a restoration of our infrastructure will 
also help restore confidence which is an important ingredient in 
stimulating investment and growth.
<P>
	Another objection was raised in this House, and it was raised 
by several members of the Reform Party, but in particular by the 
leader of the Reform Party on the first day that we had a 
Question Period. I refer to a question which he asked of the 
Prime Minister. He referred to a question which had been sent to 
him by Dr. Dean Eyre of Ottawa who said, and I am quoting from 
<I>Hansard</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government proposes to spend $6 billion on infrastructure and create 
65,000 jobs. Has the government calculated how many jobs might have been 
created if that $6 billion were simply cut from the taxes of individuals, property 
owners and small businesses?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	To begin with, as I stated a few minutes ago, all our cities and 
provinces need up to date infrastructure if they are to operate 
efficiently and attract private investment. We need highways, 
we need railroads, we need canals, we need the St. Lawrence 
Seaway. Mr. Speaker, that was a great infrastructure program 
many years ago and it is very close to your constituency. We 
need airports, we need telephone and telecommunications 
systems, we need schools, we need universities, justice systems 
and police forces which are all part of what might be called in a 
broader sense our infrastructure. If we do not build and keep our 
infrastructure up to date we become a third-class nation.
<P>
	As I said earlier not only do we create direct and indirect jobs 
in building and restoring our infrastructure, but once we build a 
modern infrastructure system we attract investment for still 
further jobs.
<P>
	However there is a supposition in the question put forward by 
the leader of the Reform Party on behalf of Dr. Eyre, that if we 
return $6 billion to the taxpayers we would have even more jobs. 
There is certainly no guarantee of that. Every society has to 
guarantee that it has the essential infrastructure to operate as a 
modern state.
<P>
<B>(2020) </B>
<P>
	We are not at all what sure would happen if we simply 
returned this particular $6 billion to Canadian taxpayers. I want 
to make it clear that I believe a very good percentage of our 
incomes must be left to spend as we wish as individuals and as 
consumers. On the other hand, as a society we have to ensure 
that we have the social capital to exist as a modern state.
<P>
	Some of the people might spend a good percentage of that 
money, if we returned it to them, outside the country either as 
consumers or investors. Some might use it entirely for 
consumption, for consumer goods. Some might use it for illegal 
cigarettes or other types of illegal products, drugs and so on. 
Some might put it in their drawer or their sock. No doubt there 
would be some investment. There would be some private 
investment if that money were returned to taxpayers.
<P>
	However there would be no guarantee that it would be 
invested in jobs, while society through its government can 
ensure that it is used for basic essential infrastructure that will 
attract business and in the long run will put more money in the 
pockets of our citizens.
<P>
	We in the Liberal Party believe in a mixed economy. The 
greatest eras of prosperity in Canada, the United States and 
Europe have been accomplished under mixed economies. 
Experience shows us that the extremes of socialism or the 
extremes of free market systems do not work as well.
<P>
	That is the message in the speech from the throne. Jobs and 
economic growth are our highest priority. We believe the 
Government of Canada, along with the provinces, has an 
important role to play with business and labour in achieving 
these goals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am wondering if the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce 
remembers the early eighties when we had 24 per cent interest 
rates that were caused by his government. We also had a 
transportation policy formed by his government that did away 
with thousands of miles of railway track. It put thousands of 
farmers out of business. It closed oil drilling rigs.
<P>
	I am wondering how all of a sudden infrastructure is so dear to 
his heart. Would he please explain that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I remember well the eighties. I 
remember the seventies, the sixties and the fifties as well. To 
attribute the interest rates of the eighties entirely to the federal 
government is an extremely simplistic approach. There were 
high interest rates in many western countries at the time. It was 
immediately after the OPEC oil crisis. Many other pressures 
were brought together in the world at the time. All governments 
were struggling to deal with the high interest rates and the 
conditions that were described.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="542"> 542 </A></B>
<P>
	If the member wants to remember periods of Liberal 
government, I remember the period of Mr. Pearson in the early 
sixties when we had 2 to 3 per cent unemployment for four 
consecutive years. As a student I can remember the period under 
Mr. St. Laurent when we had five to six years of full 
employment. I can remember the period under Mr. Trudeau 
when we averaged between 5 to 7 per cent unemployment.
<P>
	I am saying that there is a role for government in our 
economy. I am not a socialist. I do not believe in a fully 
controlled socialist economy. Nor do I believe in the approach 
taken by the Reagans, the Thatchers, and the Mulroneys who 
believed they could withdraw altogether and just wish that 
things would go well.
<P>
	I believe there is a role to play by governments with labour 
and business. Under those types of governments we had the 
highest eras of prosperity in Canadian history and Canada has 
become a great nation because of that approach.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was very 
pleased to hear the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce 
remind us that, in the end, the high cost of social assistance and 
unemployment insurance is directly related to an excessive 
unemployment rate. Really, it is a lack of jobs, I do not think I 
misinterpret him when I say that. There is, indeed, a lack of jobs, 
which means that people are not necessarily unemployed 
because of a lack of skill. He was right when saying that.
<P>
<B>(2025) </B>
<P>
	Representing a riding with includes Laval University, an 
institution centuries old with over 35,000 students, I am rather 
aware of that reality.
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. Does he think that work-sharing could, 
in the future, be a way to get trained young people, full of 
enthusiasm but unable to find a job, out of unemployment and 
social assistance? If we shared better what we have, would that 
not be a solution?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, a very interesting proposal which 
is now under serious consideration in many countries of the 
world is the fact that we share our employment more equitably 
among various people. For example, several European countries 
are now discussing the shorter work week or the shorter work 
day so that they could spread employment more fairly among a 
greater number of people.
<P>
	In this modern age our production for the most part is 
achieved through technology, machines and robots, not simply 
by the sweat and blood of workers but by the use of their brains, 
their intelligence, their imagination and through high training.
<P>
	As a matter of fact that is what will happen. There will be a 
greater sharing of work and there are many means to achieve 
that. I would hope the committee on human resources which will 
be established in the House in a week or so will examine that as 
one of the possibilities in looking at a better distribution of work 
and a better approach to income support and social security.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate you on your new position in the House. I would like 
to let you know that the Speaker and his deputy speakers can 
count on my support as I have counted on your friendship over 
the past few years. As you preside over lively debates in the 
years ahead, I hope we all remember how lucky we are to live in 
a democracy in which lively debates are not only allowed but 
encouraged.
<P>
	I also welcome the 205 new members of Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the Prime Minister was saying last week, the 
unprecedented number of new members brings to the House of 
Commons a tremendous energy for renewal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Most of all I thank the voters of Hamilton Mountain for giving 
me the honour of representing them again in Parliament. I shall 
do my very best to fulfil their trust.
<P>
	Indeed the issue of trust is central in the throne speech. I 
remember well when the Prime Minister came to Hamilton 
during the election and held up his now famous red book entitled 
``Creating Opportunity: The Liberal Plan for Canada''. The 
Prime Minister promised that if elected he would make the red 
book the basis for a Liberal government. With this throne speech 
the Prime Minister has kept his word. He has honoured the trust 
of the voters.
<P>
	Frankly I am surprised to hear opposition members complain 
that the throne speech is merely a restatement of our election 
promises. They should be applauding the fact that the Prime 
Minister is going to do what he promised to do. They should 
applaud the fact that the Prime Minister is keeping faith with 
Canadians.
<P>
	From the day he was sworn in, the Prime Minister has kept his 
word. We can look at his record in the first two months. The 
Prime Minister said that he would cancel the $5.8 billion 
helicopter deal, and he did. He said that he would have the 
smallest cabinet ever, and he has. He promised to cut $10 
million from the offices of the cabinet ministers, and he made 
those cuts. The Prime Minister said he would reduce the 
expenses of Parliament, and he has already reduced those 
expenses by $5 million. The Prime Minister stopped the costly 
privatization of Pearson airport. He is stopping excessive 
spending overseas by integrating our embassies with those of 
Australia. He appointed a new Governor of the Bank of Canada. 
He is reviewing the pensions of members of Parliament. He is 
selling the prime ministerial airbus.

<P>
	In the House we have seen major changes in the first three 
weeks of the first session of the 35th Parliament. We have had 
debate in which we could all participate before a bill is 
presented by the government. We have debated peacekeeping 
and nuclear arms. Next week we will be debating social policy. 
Also for the first time we will all be able to participate in a 
pre-budget debate.
<P>
	Those are all major accomplishments but, even more 
important, the government has already made major changes to 
our country's policies for economic growth. The new economic 
approach will make a real difference for my constituency and 
my city of Hamilton.
<P>
	The government is implementing the national infrastructure 
program. We will sign agreements with every province and 
projects to put Canadians back to work will start in a matter of 
weeks.
<P>
	In the very first Question Period of this new Parliament the 
Prime Minister pointed out the support he had received for the 
infrastructure program from the mayor of Hamilton. New 
municipal projects mean new construction jobs. New 
construction jobs mean new steel jobs. That is what Canadians 
want, and that is what the government is delivering. That is what 
Hamiltonians want, and that is what the government is 
delivering to Hamilton.
<P>
	Canadians do not expect miracles from the government but 
they do expect realistic hope and realistic job policies. That is 
why the infrastructure program is so important. It provides a 
kickstart for our economy at a time when the economy most 
needs that kickstart.
<P>
	This same sound approach is at the heart of the government's 
policy with respect to trade. The Prime Minister said that he 
would only agree to implement NAFTA if he obtained an 
agreement from the United States and Mexico to negotiate on 
the issue of subsidies, dumping and countervail. This new 
government obtained those agreements.
<P>
	The new NAFTA working groups on dumping and subsidies 
are a major step forward in stopping American harassment of 
Canadian exports. The road ahead is not going to be easy, but it 
is very important to note that this government has managed to 
get the United States to agree to a two-year timeframe to deal 
with the critical issues.
<P>
	The new working groups are particularly important to the city 
of Hamilton since there have been more American trade actions 
against steel than against any other Canadian export during the 
last several years. The added benefits is that Mexico will also be 
party to these negotiations, a significant advance when we 
consider that Canadian steel is currently facing four separate 
trade actions by Mexico.
<P>
	I do not pretend that the government has solved all of 
Canada's problems in our first two months in office, but I do 
believe that the government has taken major steps and we have 
acted quickly to make good on our election promises. Job 
creation and integrity in government were the Prime Minister's 
electoral commitments and he is carrying through on those 
commitments. Of course there remains much to do.
<P>
	We need better access for small businesses to capital funding. 
We need to eliminate interprovincial trade barriers. We need to 
create the Canada investment fund to support leading edge 
technology firms. We need to reduce the regulatory burden on 
business. We need to reduce the deficit through more measures 
for long-term job creation. We need to protect and strengthen 
our health care system. We need to make our communities and 
our streets safer. We need to bring in a youth service corps. We 
certainly need to replace the GST.
<P>
<B>(2035 ) </B>
<P>
	We cannot do everything at once but we can and we must take 
those actions necessary to give every Canadian the opportunity 
to be the best that he or she can be. We can and we must treat 
every Canadian with dignity, fairness and compassion. We can 
and we must ensure that Canada is competitive, tolerant, 
independent and proud.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There is much to do in Parliament. During the last two months 
and in the speech from the throne, the Prime Minister has 
demonstrated his leadership qualities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As I said at the outset I think we are extraordinarily fortunate 
to live in a democracy where we can have lively debates. I hope 
that we remember as we have those debates that we are here to 
represent Canadians who expect us to put job creation and 
integrity first. I look forward to working with all members of 
Parliament as we pursue those goals.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
want to congratulate the hon. member and thank her for her 
speech. In fact, we have something in common. I am referring to 
a shared concern about the steel industry, which is important in 
my riding as well. We have two big steel mills, Sidbec Dosco 
and Stelco McMaster.
<P>
	I found the feverish enthusiasm with which the hon. member 
described the achievements of her government, so far, and those 
of the Prime Minister, almost moving. She mentioned several, 
starting with the cuts in the House of Commons budgelt.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="544"> 544 </A></B>
<P>
	At this point I think I should remind the hon. member that 
theoretically the House of Commons is entirely independent of 
the government and that not the government but the parties 
represented in the House made these budget cuts. Members 
themselves reduced the House budget-at the request, of course, 
of the Prime Minister, but in any case, the consent of the parties 
was essential. I may add the Bloc Quebecois did its share in this 
respect.
<P>
	The hon. member also mentioned the debates we had Tuesday 
and Wednesday on the presence of Canadian peacekeepers in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia and on cruise missile testing 
on Canadian territory.
<P>
	The hon. member will also remember that yesterday we 
protested the fact that these debates were held before the 
government announced its defence policy. What was said 
yesterday may no longer be relevant if the government decides 
to take a different stand. I think the debate itself was entirely 
appropriate but the timing was wrong.
<P>
	The hon. member also talked about all kinds of other 
so-called successes which I will not mention here. I would 
rather emphasize what this government has not done or rather 
where it has failed so far. Did the hon. member forget that the 
government failed miserably on the issue of free trade, for 
instance? During the election campaign, the Liberals said they 
would not implement the free trade agreement unless they 
obtained a certain number of guarantees on the environment and 
resources, and unless they were given a definition of the word 
subsidy. They did not obtain any of these guarantees or 
definitions before the agreement was implemented.
<P>
	Similarly, on the subject of GATT, the government caved in 
miserably and failed to protect Article XI which is so important 
for farmers. I imagine the hon. member does not have any 
farmers in her riding. I do have a few, in fact I have quite a 
number of farmers in my riding, and that is one difference. So I 
would say we are a little disappointed in the government's 
performance.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to ask the hon. member, since she 
mentioned the government's achievements, whether it will take 
very long for the government to do something about cigarette 
smuggling and then about tax equity.
<P>
	Could we have some answers on these issues which are still 
pending?
<P>
<B>(2040) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Phinney:</B> I thank the hon. member for his kind words. I 
do not think we are going to have to wait very long for very many 
decisions. The decisions and the problems that the government 
is looking at right now are going to be handled with the help of 
all Canadians.
<P>
	Most of the ministers have spoken already in the House and 
talked of the process where they are going to be opening up the 
decision making. The changes that the Canadian people have 
asked for are going to come about by their input and by all the 
people in the House of Commons participating.
<P>
	I am interested that he has a steel industry in his community 
and I hope that he will participate even further in what is going 
on in the House of Commons by joining the steel caucus.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the 
people from the riding of Drummond for their confidence in me; 
I will try to discharge my mandate to the best of my knowledge 
and with total dedication.
<P>
	What I heard last Tuesday in the Senate does not reflect in any 
way the strong program that Quebecers and Canadians had a 
right to expect to regain a feeling of hope and confidence in the 
future. That is why I want to convey to this House and to the 
government my concerns and those of my colleagues concerning 
the throne speech, and the health care system in particular.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the meagre content of the throne speech in this 
respect creates more fears than hopes. Our fellow citizens are 
expecting solutions to the problems associated with our 
deteriorating health care system, such as bed closures, crowded 
emergency wards, higher drug prices, and so on. Let us take for 
example the acute crisis prevailing in Sainte-Croix Hospital of 
Drummondville in my riding. Inadequate funding and severe 
budget cutbacks have led to obsolete equipment, a lack of 
specialists, frequent service cuts, split shifts and patient 
transfers. All this makes life harder for staff and patients alike. 
What hope does the throne speech give us that these 
unacceptable situations will be resolved? Very little, I'm afraid, 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Let us talk about federal transfer payments and established 
programs financing. We must first recognize that the finance 
minister's commitment to improve equalization payments every 
five years is certainly reassuring for all provinces.
<P>
	But we must not confuse equalization payments with transfer 
payments. In 1986, the previous government, criticized on many 
occasions by the current Prime Minister, started to reduce 
federal transfers for established programs financing. In 1987, 
the Tories announced that Canadian provinces and Quebec 
would receive $270 million less for health care and 
post-secondary education.
<P>
	Worse still, they announced in February 1991 that per capita 
transfer payments for established programs financing would be 
frozen until 1994-95. All these measures were applied 
unilaterally, without the consent of Quebec and the other 
provinces, despite the formal agreement reached by the parties 
in 1977. So, between 1978 and 1993, the federal government's 
contribution 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="545"> 545 </A></B>
<P>
to  health care and post-secondary education programs in 
Quebec fell from 47 to 34 per cent.
<P>
	As we all know, whenever transfer payments are reduced, it is 
the poorest provinces that suffer the most. What we are talking 
about is fairness for the provinces and Quebec. A freeze in 
federal transfers for established program financing is in itself a 
serious threat to the principles set forth in the Canada Health 
Act.
<P>
<B>(2045) </B>
<P>
	Therefore the Official Opposition intends to promote a review 
of the transfer payment procedures, in a way that will respect the 
financial capacity of Quebec, the provinces and Canada.
<P>
	We must also stress that as the federal government got out of 
funding this program, the provinces and Quebec faced increased 
costs for health care. This growth is due to several factors, like 
the aging population, the appearance of costly advanced medical 
technology and higher drug prices.
<P>
	The taxpayers of Quebec and Canada entrust the federal 
government with large sums of money, part of which has always 
been intended for health care under the 1977 agreement. The 
problem is that for 10 years, the federal government has not 
given the portion due back to the provinces and Quebec and thus 
diverts funds meant for health care. Instead, what it transfers to 
Quebec and the provinces is its deficit, a consequence of the 
previous government's inability to control its spending. We are 
talking about a reduction of nearly a third in transfer payments 
here. This has had major consequences on the financial health of 
Quebec and the provinces. If the present Liberal government 
just froze transfer payments, it would mean a cut equal to the 
increase in the cost of living.
<P>
	The federal government would be making the choices which 
Quebec and the provinces have to make more difficult as they try 
to cover their shortfall and reduce their tax burden. Since greater 
efficiency is unlikely in the short term, Quebec and the 
provinces would be faced with two equally unpleasant options: 
reducing the quantity or quality of services or going further into 
debt. In either case, we are not telling anyone anything new 
when we say that it is still the poorest people who will suffer the 
most.
<P>
	Let me point out to this House that neither Quebec nor the 
provinces are asking for charity here. They are only demanding 
the money which is their due under an official agreement, 
remember.
<P>
	Furthermore, we question the federal government's right and 
justification in requiring the provinces to maintain certain 
health insurance procedures, after the Conservative government 
in its nine years in power systematically went back on its 
financial commitments with respect to transfer payments.
<P>
	As a result, the provinces and Quebec have been forced, in 
spite of themselves, to propose various so-called palliative 
measures in recent years, such as user fees, service charges, 
deductibles and so on. All these alternatives have one thing in 
common: they make health care and services less accessible.
<P>
	The federal government must be sensitive and above all aware 
that by increasing the financial burden of Quebec and the 
provinces, a two-tier system will be created: on one hand, those 
who can afford access to health care and services, and on the 
other, those who for financial reasons will delay treatment or 
even do without necessary care.
<P>
	We believe in the great principles of universality, 
comprehensiveness, accessibility, portability and public 
administration. What we oppose is that these great principles are 
seriously threatened in all provinces and Quebec by the federal 
government's very inability to meet its commitments.
<P>
<B>(2050) </B>
<P>
	As my hon. colleagues realize as well as I do, in Quebec like 
elsewhere, it is always the same people who have to foot the bill. 
In terms of transfer payments, the federal government takes 
money out of the pockets of the taxpayers and transfers it to the 
provincial government. Basically, the taxpayers' money is 
taking a round trip to Ottawa.
<P>
	But this trip has a price. In Ottawa, the bureaucracy takes its 
cut. Consequently, some of the taxpayers' money does not come 
back. That part is kept here to satisfy the appetite of the federal 
administration.
<P>
	Just last week, the Minister of Finance warned us not to 
expect any gifts when transfer payment agreements expiring 
next year are renegotiated.
<P>
	Would it not make more economic sense and make the 
taxpayers feel safer if they were to pay directly to their 
provincial government the money they owe for health care, 
thereby eliminating the federal intermediary, the additional 
costs and, more importantly, the risk that the federal 
government will grab this money to reduce its deficit?
<P>
	In view of the fact that the federal government did not manage 
to make good its promises in the past, we are convinced that the 
people of Canada would be better served in terms of health care 
if each of the provinces and Quebec took things in hand and 
looked after implementing the Canada Health Act themselves.
<P>
	This way, the bureaucratic load would be significantly 
reduced and management would be exercised much closer to 
home and be much easier to adapt to the specific requirements of 
the situation, as it would be more responsive and effective in the 
short term. It would also take away the sword that hangs over the 
heads of Quebec and the other provinces with every new federal 
budget!
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="546"> 546 </A></B>
<P>
	Health also calls for prevention. As we all know, an ounce of 
prevention is better than a pound of cure, however good the care 
system is. This is to say that in terms of prevention, any budget 
cut that is not immediately compensated by an equivalent 
increase in the efficiency of the programs affected would 
translate into a cost increase higher than the expected savings.
<P>
	The best prevention with regard to health is to enhance the 
socio-economic condition of the people of Quebec and Canada. 
A large segment of the population could be negatively affected 
by the precarious state of the economy in Quebec and 
everywhere in Canada.
<P>
	From Saint John's to Victoria, women and men, young and 
old, live in socio-economic conditions that do not allow them to 
develop their full potential. We all have in our ridings families 
living under the poverty line and barely surviving.
<P>
	Pregnant women are not eating appropriately, preventing the 
foetus from developing normally. Several newborns are 
underweight and require prolonged hospital care. Others are 
born with diseases due to deficiencies in their mothers' diet and 
require treatment during several years. The prenatal nutrition 
programs announced in the throne speech will have to provide a 
real solution to this important problem.
<P>
	School children are even reported to be starving because the 
fridge is almost empty at the end of the month. These children 
often do badly in school and drop out before getting a diploma. 
We must do something for these children.
<P>
	People who cannot find decent housing are even worse off. As 
it was pointed out in the health and welfare policy issued in 1992 
by the Quebec government, living in a run-down apartment with 
poor heat and poor ventilation is particularly harmful to the 
health of young children and seniors.
<P>
<B>(2055) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, the social housing problem is extremely serious in 
every province, including Quebec. This situation cannot go on 
forever.
<P>
	One of the best ways to reduce health costs is to enable 
everybody to live in adequate and decent conditions. And it is by 
providing decent jobs that we will be able to improve the 
situation.
<P>
	Also, even though we agree with the efforts of the Department 
of Health to reduce tobacco consumption, we deeply regret the 
program implemented by the previous government to increase 
taxes on tobacco. This program, which is a disaster, has 
generated four major adverse effects.
<P>
	First, the creation of a contraband network and a black market 
which have generated uncontrollable and unnecessary illegal 
and criminal activities. Second, tobacco sales have dropped 
everywhere, resulting in a sharp drop in profits for businesses. 
Consequently, tax revenues have also been reduced drastically. 
Finally, and this is both unfortunate and ironic, the emergence of 
this black market has not only prevented the expected reduction 
in tobacco consumption, but has in fact provoked an increase in 
consumption among young people, if only because of the appeal 
of cigarettes as a contraband product.
<P>
	It is a real shame that this House is responsible for having 
provoked such a serious and unnecessary crisis when there are 
so many real problems to tackle. Therefore, we ask the new 
government to reduce drastically taxes on tobacco products.
<P>
	The throne speech states in less than two lines that a Centre 
for Excellence for women's health will be established to ensure 
that women's health issues will receive the attention they 
deserve. This project is certainly commendable, but will it be a 
true program for support, research and action for women's 
health or will it be merely a documentation centre as the Liberal 
government program seemed to suggest?
<P>
	What funds will be targeted to research on women's health? 
There are deficiencies in the research on breast cancer, 
gynaecology and obstetrics, chronic and degenerative diseases, 
mental health, violence and occupational illnesses. If it is the 
socio-economic situation of women which determines their 
health needs, what concrete measures are needed to eliminate 
these unfortunate conditions? It is urgent to act and to go to the 
roots of the problem. Women are poor and that is the reason for a 
lot of their health problems.
<P>
	Everybody has a brother, a sister, or a friend struggling with a 
drug or alcohol addiction. We urge the government to give 
special support to organizations which work for the detoxication 
and rehabilitation of those who are affected by such problems.
<P>
	The throne speech mentions a national forum on health to 
foster a dialogue on the renewal of Canada's health system. We 
can only praise the government for this initiative but, at the 
same time, we are concerned that this type of exercise might 
take too long to get under way, might cost too much and might 
end with a report which will be shelved. The Bloc Quebecois 
will strongly criticize any attitude which would lead such an 
initiative to flop.
<P>
	The Bloc will also ensure that the government does not use 
this forum to justify unilateral changes in transfer payments 
which would be to the detriment of Quebec's and the other 
provinces' interests. Indeed, the Bloc Quebecois' mandate is to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="547"> 547 </A></B>
<P>
ensure that the poor will not have to suffer from changes made 
for fiscal consolidation purposes.
<P>
	This is why, as some of my colleagues have pointed out, we 
are adamant that the government must set up a House committee 
whose mandate will be to review each budget item in order to 
eliminate unnecessary and frivolous expenses.
<P>
<B>(2100) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, in order to protect the health of 
Quebecers and Canadians, the government must guarantee to all 
the provinces that they will get their fair share of the money paid 
by taxpayers to this end, as well as the all services which 
Quebecers and Canadians desperately need.
<P>
	The Official Opposition intends to intervene in a useful way 
and, if necessary, as energetically as required, to ensure that 
each citizen of Quebec and Canada has access to the health care 
and services which they need.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Government House Leader):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must congratulate 
the hon. member for Drummond on her maiden speech to the 
House. It is obvious that she has some interesting ideas.
<P>
	First of all, I have a comment. I think she should put some 
questions about the issues raised in her speech to her leader, 
since he was a member of the former federal government and, as 
she well knows, that government was responsible for almost all 
of the cuts that were made and for causing serious hardship to 
people across Canada. Her leader often supported this 
government in the House, as did many of his colleagues. I think 
she should be putting the questions about the problems the 
country is now experiencing to him, not to this government.
<P>
	I believe the hon. member also broached the subject of the tax 
on tobacco products. What course of action does she advocate? 
Would she prefer to see the tax remain in place, along with the 
associated loss of revenues, or would she prefer that it be 
replaced with another tax? The former government tried 
something else. It imposed an export tax on cigarettes. 
Obviously there were some problems with this decision because 
the government later suspended the tax. What would the hon. 
member have the government do now? Impose a new tax, 
suspend the tax altogether or what? She was not very specific. I 
would like to hear her answer.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my hon. 
colleague on the other side for his remarks. What the Bloc 
Quebecois is calling for is the removal or elimination of federal 
taxes on cigarettes. The black market is thriving and this is the 
only way to curb the illegal activities now taking place.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to agree 
with the hon. member's comment that the social economic 
condition is extremely important to health care. The Minister of 
Human Resources Development is certainly looking at ways of 
improving the social safety net and making better use of every 
dollar spent.
<P>
	The hon. member made a comment that I am intrigued and 
curious about. It was along the lines that a return trip to Ottawa 
is at a cost, I think implying that the trips of MPs and others 
coming to Ottawa that you leave dollars here and it is a drain.
<P>
<B>(2105 ) </B>
<P>
	The perception is that Ottawa is English Canada and it is a 
drain on all the taxpayers of Canada. Now I am not a lover of the 
bureaucracy by any means, I am a critic of it and we have to 
make improvements there.
<P>
	However has the hon. member given any thought or does she 
know the economic spinoff in terms of the central government's 
efforts, Parliament and all the ministries, that go to Hull as a 
result? What would the losses be to Hull and to the province of 
Quebec if the Bloc ever got its desire to separate Quebec from 
Canada?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to tell the hon. member that 
he did not understand me at all when I referred to the return trip 
taken by taxpayers' money. As you know, health care is paid for 
by taxpayers, by the provinces, including Quebec. Taxpayers 
send money to pay the federal government for health care. The 
federal government administers and manages; the department of 
health administers and provides health care to pay for medicare. 
But the federal government does not do a favour to taxpayers. 
Taxpayers pay their share. What I am saying is that when the 
money which comes from the provinces, from the taxpayers, 
goes to the provinces who then send on here the taxes paid by 
people for these services, it costs a lot of money to administer. 
The federal government takes its share, it takes its money, and 
then gives some back to the provinces so that they can 
administer their health programs.
<P>
	And it is this administration by the federal government which 
costs a lot of money. If each province was in charge, and if 
taxpayers gave their money to the province, which would 
manage its own health care program, it would be cheaper and 
hospitals would not have a deficit such as is the case right now. 
That is what I wanted to say.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to start with a comment on the presentation made by the 
hon. member for Drummond who is to be commended for her 
excellent speech.
<P>
	First of all, I entirely approve of her proposal that the 
provinces should themselves raise, and be allowed to keep, the 
amounts they need to operate the health care system. However, 
as we know, under the present system this is unthinkable. So we 
must ensure that transfer payments to the provinces are not 
affected, so that the provinces can continue to be responsible for 
and provide health care services to their residents. I may remind 
hon. members opposite that during the election campaign, the 
Prime Minister promised that he would not tamper with transfer 
payments to the provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="548"> 548 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member also made a very careful analysis of the two 
perverse consequences of a possible reduction in transfer 
payments for health care. First of all, there would be a reduction 
in services. And, as she so astutely pointed out, the neediest 
members of our society would suffer most because they are 
unable to pay the user-fee or health tax that might be introduced 
by the province if transfer payments were cut. They would either 
postpone medical appointments or not go at all.
<P>
	Furthermore, as I pointed out myself, this might increase the 
tax burden, because if the federal government reduces transfer 
payments to the provinces, that does not necessarily mean it will 
lower its tax rates. Consequently, the provinces will have to pick 
up the slack, either by increasing their own tax revenues or by 
asking residents for a bigger contribution to the health care 
system. And this illustrates the other perverse effect I was 
mentioning previously. It is a kind of vicious circle: increased 
burden for the taxpayer on the one hand, and reduced services on 
the other. I believe, therefore, that the perverse consequences 
are too important to even consider a reduction of transfer 
payments to the provinces.
<P>
<B>(2110) </B>
<P>
	Besides, I would like to point out, Mr. Speaker, that the Prime 
Minister promised not to cut transfer payments to provinces. 
However, we will have to watch carefully to make sure that 
those payments are not frozen at their present level, since that 
would amount, in the long run, to a reduction equivalent to 
inflation. The government will have to keep the promise it made 
during the campaign and index transfer payments to provinces 
to the consumer price index.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harry Verran (South West Nova):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate you on your appointment to the Chair. Your 
guidance and leadership will be appreciated by all in this House.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to speak in this first session of the 
35th Parliament as a duly elected representative for the riding of 
South West Nova. It is a pleasure, indeed an honour to have been 
elected by the people of South West Nova to represent them and 
to bring their concerns to the government and to this House.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and this government have been given a 
clear mandate by the people of Canada to implement the 
programs as outlined in the now famous red book.
<P>
	South West Nova is a riding in the southwestern part of Nova 
Scotia. It was represented by Coline Campbell for many years. 
Coline did not seek re-election this time and I want to wish 
Coline and her husband Ron, God speed and good health in the 
future.
<P>
	South West Nova is a riding rich in history and dates back to 
Champlain's landing in 1604. The riding has a diverse cultural 
mix of native Canadians as well as English and French speaking 
people. As a matter of fact, the Acadians in South West Nova 
proudly celebrated their 225th anniversary this past year with 
festivities mainly centering in and round the University of St. 
Anne at Church Point in the district of Clare. This small degree 
granting university has the distinction of having the best 
immersion program in this country.
<P>
	I want to say that I intend to maintain a close personal 
relationship with the people of my riding and to the best of my 
ability give them personal service.
<P>
	For generations our people have made their living through the 
use of natural resources, the sea, the land and the forests. 
However, in recent years our people have found it difficult to 
make a living from those resources. The fishing industry has 
been crippled mainly because of mismanagement.
<P>
	Our ground fishermen are second to none in this country and 
have co-operated with management to help keep this fishery 
alive. The thanks these same fishermen received in return for 
their co-operation from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
was a mid-season quota cut which resulted in great monetary 
loss for bought quota and a reduction of 40 per cent in their 
catches.
<P>
	These fishermen were betrayed and lost all trust in the 
department of fisheries. Our fishermen want better management 
of these fishing industries where justice and fairness play 
leading roles. The fishermen of South West Nova want to work 
and they want to fish.
<P>
<B>(2115 ) </B>
<P>
	Recently I had the privilege of meeting with the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans to voice my concerns for those fishermen 
of South West Nova. I am pleased the minister indicated to me 
and to the deputy minister that he too wanted fairness in his 
fisheries policies so that the people in the industry could regain 
that lost trust.
<P>
	The fishermen want to co-operate but insist they must have 
some input into the decision-making process. I am pleased that 
at a meeting with the minister of fisheries just today he again 
reinforced his commitment to visit the fishermen in South West 
Nova in the very near future. I will be reminding the hon. 
minister when the near future is here.
<P>
	In the forest industry our riding is also experiencing some 
problems. Small woodlot owners have great difficulty trying to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="549"> 549 </A></B>
<P>
survive. Years ago when a small woodlot owner ran into 
difficulty and when things were tough and hard, he was allowed 
o go into the woods and  cut a few cords of wood and sell it to the 
local people. Under the present regulations a man cannot even 
do that in order to bring bread to the table for his family. It is 
time to realize that this is also a problem. We have to work to 
rectify it.
<P>
	The only mining activity in our riding was centred around the 
tin mine in Yarmouth County. This mine is closed because of 
falling world tin prices. The result is 400 more people out of 
work. This, together with the closing of the textile mill in 
Yarmouth has left the town and area with over 600 more people 
unemployed. The people of Yarmouth, Argile and Clare are 
working together in an effort to bring new business and industry 
to the area and are in great need of this government's assistance.
<P>
	In Bridgetown, the friendly town, one of the two main 
industries has closed with the loss of many jobs. The people of 
Bridgetown will not give up as they continue to try to attract new 
business.
<P>
	Farming in the constituency continues to survive reasonably 
well even though the traditional family farm is slowly 
disappearing and with it the opportunity for young men and 
women to live and work at home. Because of this we need to find 
alternative ways to keep our children employed, one of which 
could be the expansion of small business.
<P>
	Small business in South West Nova has provided employment 
for many of our citizens but has depended largely on the success 
of our natural resources. The decline of these natural resources 
automatically means the decline of others and this is a situation 
we are currently facing.
<P>
	Our government must look closely at the rural areas and small 
towns of our country and encourage small businesses. We must 
provide the economic climate necessary for people to risk their 
time and capital.
<P>
	Last but certainly not least is the issue of CFB Cornwallis, an 
issue that is very near and dear to my heart. As a young sailor I 
served at CFB Cornwallis and it has always brought back fond 
memories for me. South West Nova has been the home of this 
base for over 50 years. Since 1949 it has served as the only 
English speaking recruit training centre for Canada.
<P>
	In December I had the opportunity to meet with the Minister 
of National Defence with regard to this issue. I explained to the 
minister the history of CFB Cornwallis as a recruit training base 
and I spoke to him about a recently developed peacekeeping 
training plan. I explained to the minister that this peacekeeping 
plan was developed entirely in South West Nova by the people in 
and around Cornwallis.
<P>
	I explained to him the work, the time, the research and the 
money spent by the community on this plan. I informed the 
minister that this was our plan and we would be upset if the 
military tried to steal that plan and implement it in any other part 
of this country.
<P>
<B>(2120 ) </B>
<P>
	I explained to the minister the necessity of blending the 
advice of military officials with the concerns of the people of 
Cornwallis and the surrounding area.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence has heard from me exactly 
how the people of South West Nova stand on the issue of 
Cornwallis. I hope that the minister will seriously consider the 
input of the local people when the final decisions are made.
<P>
	Before concluding, I want to say that the most important 
resource we have in this country today is that of our youth. As a 
father of seven children and the grandfather of 25, I have great 
concern. I am pleased to hear that our government is working to 
implement the youth training corps to begin putting young 
Canadians back to work.
<P>
	In conclusion, before coming to this House I made a 
commitment to the people of my riding that I would fight as hard 
as I could to ensure that their interests were represented. To the 
people of my riding, I pledge accessibility and accountability.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the hon. member for South West Nova. I have 
confidence in his description of the problems in his riding 
caused by the introduction of fishing quotas, the difficulties 
experienced by the mining and textile industries, the decline of 
farming, the small and medium sized businesses that are also 
struggling.
<P>
	He talked about problems but his speech did not suggest any 
solutions to these problems. What he described could apply to 
several regions or sub-regions across Canada; this problem, in 
my opinion, is due in part to the distance separating these 
regions from the central government.
<P>
	Since I am the critic for Youth and he spoke about the Youth 
Service Corps, I would like to draw his attention to the concerns 
expressed so far during the consultations held with the 
organizations responsible and ask him whether he thinks, for 
example, that $61 a week for young people could be a solution 
for his region from an economic standpoint?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Verran:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
his question.
<P>
	Yes, we probably do have similar rural areas in our 
constituencies in the provinces of Nova Scotia and Quebec. 
There is no doubt I feel certain parts of the government are too 
centralized. They should be partly relocated to the areas where 
they generally would fit into the activities of that area.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="550"> 550 </A></B>
<P>
	As for the youth of the country, the hon. member heard me say 
that I am deeply concerned about youth as a person with so many 
grandchildren of my own. At the same time, I realize that the 
minister has made a great effort and is putting the youth training 
plan into place.
<P>
	To a large degree, it would be a real benefit compared to what 
we have had in the past. It may not be everything at the start of 
the program but it will certainly be a start that was not there. I 
am sure it will grow and prosper. Our young people will prosper 
by it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Essex-Kent):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want 
to congratulate you on your appointment to the chair.
<P>
	I know the citizens of Stormont-Dundas, which you 
represent, are very proud of the effort you have put forth to help 
them solve their problems throughout the time you have been 
here. I know that will continue but they can be equally proud for 
the leadership that you will show in this House. I congratulate 
you for that. Some comments have been made jokingly about 
what is the most beautiful riding in this country. To me there is 
no question that the most beautiful riding in this country is 
where the heart is and my heart is in my home riding of 
Essex-Kent. Essex-Kent is the most southerly riding in this 
country, southwestern Ontario, and very much a rural, 
agricultural riding, one that has a smattering of small towns like 
those throughout rural Canada.
<P>
<B>(2125) </B>
<P>
	There is a great deal of concern in rural Canada about 
agriculture and agricultural problems. It is really one of the only 
industries that is so controlled by the weather, by outside forces 
that governments or others do not control. As a result sometimes 
they run through very difficult times, although they use the very 
best technology available to them. Although they are excellent 
producers they do run into rough times.
<P>
	Just this past week we had severely cold weather in our riding 
and much of the soft fruit industry production is in jeopardy 
because of that hard freeze. That is the reality that agriculture 
faces. It is not protected from the elements many times and so 
the economy of much of rural Canada has to be looked at very 
critically and very carefully by governments.
<P>
	Certainly Essex-Kent is an area where the people are 
vibrant. They work hard. They are well educated. They do the 
very best they can to make sure that their opportunities are 
fulfilled. There are times when government must be there with 
support. I feel that it is a concern in rural Canada today and we 
should make sure that their voices are heard and they are 
represented well.
<P>
	I believe this Liberal government will address those concerns 
as well as all of the other concerns that I heard over the time that 
we were campaigning for election.
<P>
	The red book has been mentioned a million times if it has been 
mentioned once. That red book was not just something that was 
grabbed out of the air at election time. Three years of 
consultation, hard work, round table discussions and efforts to 
develop policy went into that red book and the statements it 
contained.
<P>
	The red book tried to address as best it could in 125 pages the 
concerns and many of the solutions that Canadians would see a 
Liberal government follow. Quite frankly, there is no question 
as the Canadian people became more aware of that red book they 
were quite happy with the solutions the Liberal Party put 
forward. That is why there are 176 members of the Liberal 
caucus here in government today.
<P>
	I believe that the speech from the throne was a very strong 
reflection of the document that was put in place during the 
election. There is no question that the document was the 
blueprint of the direction we shall go. The speech from the 
throne was not a big political paper of 50 or 60 or 80 pages. It 
was as reasonably short, concise document that reflected the red 
book very carefully and brought forward the concerns this 
Liberal government has. It is important that governments go 
ahead.
<P>
	The number one issue that I heard in my riding and as well 
colleagues across the country whom I have talked to heard was 
jobs. Certainly we feel that there is a definite direction to fulfil 
those jobs. A national infrastructure program was put in place so 
that each community across this country could see some 
immediate support from the federal government, the provincial 
governments and municipal governments to make certain that 
new jobs are brought into their areas.
<P>
	Every member of this Parliament will see programs in their 
riding which will reflect this new job development. I have no 
doubt that when the list came out in my riding just two days ago 
of the number of dollars that were available for communities to 
motivate and start up new job creation programs, moneys that 
will eventually build into longer range job creations, they were 
very content and very happy. The communication that I received 
back just two days ago was extremely positive throughout my 
riding.
<P>
<B>(2130) </B>
<P>
	The national apprenticeship program, which is a program to 
help those who are unemployed retrain and redevelop, is there. 
It is certainly strategic to bring the skills of Canadians up to the 
levels required by business. It is very important that business, 
government and the labour force of this country work together 
as a unit in order to bring about job creation and job training 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="551"> 551 </A></B>
<P>
which will benefit those businesses, benefit the workforce and 
benefit our country in general.
<P>
	That is the type of program that comes forth in national 
apprenticeship programs.
<P>
	A youth service corps is contemplated in order to get young 
people into the labour force. Young people who are now 
presently at 19 per cent unemployment need to find a beginning, 
need to build resumes of work established. They have that 
opportunity through this youth corps. It is wonderful when I stop 
and think of the opportunity they will be provided with. We look 
at the high unemployment rate and know the government is 
taking a positive step to make certain the youth corps does 
develop.
<P>
	Business has always had major problems in accessing capital 
when times were very tough. That is one of the complaints I have 
heard from business and one of the areas where this government 
will do its very best to make certain that there is capital 
accessible to them for development, for improvement and for 
dally functioning.
<P>
	It is also important to realize that one of the major complaints 
of business is the huge amount of paperwork they have to do. 
The paper trails are getting greater and greater and greater. By 
putting programs in place to reduce this paperwork is the 
direction this government intends to go and a direction that will 
be welcomed by the business community throughout this 
country.
<P>
	Last of all it is important to mention the Canada Investment 
Fund to support the leading edge of technology. We know that 
jobs of the future are going to be created if we do support that 
leading technological edge and move forward as the new 
horizons develop.
<P>
	The debt and deficit have been a major concern across this 
country. The Reform Party has been talking very much about the 
debt and deficit. I believe the Prime Minister has not only talked 
about the debt and deficit, but he has actually taken very strong 
and major steps within his own operations.
<P>
	I believe that the Prime Minister riding in a Chevrolet rather 
than a limousine is a true message to Canadians. I believe when 
he cut his support staff in the Prime Minister's office, sold the 
air bus, created a smaller cabinet, started on public 
consultations about the budget with the finance minister, is now 
talking about restructuring some of the tax issues that are there, 
eliminating overlaps in government services, cancelling the 
helicopters were all actions of which we can be very proud. They 
are actions which are going to bring us into a better financial 
situation. They are also actions that give the Canadian people 
something to believe in, something to say yes, this government 
is ready to move in a positive direction.
<P>
	Integrity was very strong concern voiced by the people in my 
riding. I believe that we need a tremendous amount of 
parliamentary reform in order to bring about a better image of 
this Canadian Parliament. You do not change your image by 
promising things, you change your image by taking action. I 
believe that the appointment of  an ethics counsellor to stop the 
open lobbying, or at least bring out in public the lobbying that is 
going on, is of major importance.
<P>
	We also know that opening up debates here in this House, 
allowing MPs more input before the legislation is passed or 
presented in the House, gives MPs a much better say in what is 
going on.
<P>
<B>(2135 ) </B>
<P>
	We saw it in the peacekeeping debate and the cruise missile 
debate and in the future we are going to see a pre-budget debate 
giving MPs their opportunity to have their say before the issue is 
placed in a motion so that one does not have any opportunity to 
change it.
<P>
	Committee structural change is also very important to this 
place. As I look upon things that have been brought about not 
only in the financial area but in the area of government 
operations and I look upon the challenges that this government 
faces in the future, just to wrap things up, I believe we are 
looking for consultation with the public, better opportunities for 
MPs to put their concerns forward and a much better 
representative government for the people of this country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
very interested in what the hon. member had to say especially in 
the final remarks of his comments.
<P>
	Through you, Mr. Speaker, to the hon. member, I congratulate 
him on his presentation. I think he spoke very much from his 
heart. There was much eloquence in what he said. It is wonderful 
to be able to stand up here and speak without lots of notes. I have 
not quite reached that point yet but I certainly do acknowledge 
that.
<P>
	The hon. member did say something that I would like to 
clarify in my own mind. When he talked about changing his 
image he said: ``You change your image by taking action''.
<P>
	I would very much like the hon. member to tell me his opinion 
of the mechanism of recall as we have suggested in our caucus 
and how he thinks we can move forward to implement a 
mechanism such as this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pickard:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a very important point to 
make at this place and at this time.
<P>
	We have had government that has not projected a very 
positive, open image to the Canadian public. We have certainly 
not supported the policies that have come down year after year 
in this place. Canadians have felt left out. They felt that they 
were opposed to many ideas and yet those thoughts were never 
listened to as carefully as they should have been.
<P>
	The difference between a Liberal government and the 
previous government that we had was that we consulted with 
people for three years. We asked them what their concerns were. 
We tried to formalize round table discussions and openness with 
the public. That is the reason why we came up with a very 
concise, consolidated red book.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="552"> 552 </A></B>
<P>
	It is important at this point in time to realize that this 
government now is opening up debate in the House of Commons 
to allow members of Parliament to bring forth every concern 
they have from their ridings before the legislation is formulated 
and put in front of us. It is a total change of direction to allow 
members to represent the people in their ridings in this place and 
have some input ahead of time.
<P>
	I am not into the Reform policy directions. I am not buying 
into its directions. I do believe our directions are those of 
openness, consultation and acceptance of ideas before we take 
action. That is extremely important. It gives the members of 
Parliament more power in this place and it gives the people they 
represent a way for their voice to be heard before the legislation 
comes down.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege for me to rise before this House for the 
first time and give my maiden speech.
<P>
	I would like to also express my gratitude to the constituents of 
New Westminster-Burnaby for choosing me on October 25, 
1993 to represent them in the House of Commons. Mr. McVey, a 
grade school teacher of mine, must be smiling today.
<P>
<B>(2140) </B>
<P>
	New Westminster was the former capital of British Columbia. 
In fact it was given its name specifically by the Queen. It is now 
proudly referred to as the royal city. The city of Burnaby is a 
large urban community and residential area lying between 
Vancouver and New Westminster.
<P>
	Situated on the banks of the Fraser River, New Westminster 
has seen history pass its shore. There was the gold rush of 1858 
and the massive town fire that unfortunately destroyed its 
downtown core. In more recent years it has been a centre for the 
processing of forestry products. With the prospect of urban 
sprawl New Westminster's geographical significance was 
eclipsed and now the revitalization of the waterfront and sky 
train connections brings a tremendous amount of growth to the 
city.
<P>
	New Westminster is a city of proud history from the early 
days of the province to its re-emergence as a prominent place in 
British Columbia. Burnaby has seen a tremendous amount of 
growth in recent years primarily with the emergence of 
Metrotown along with a pleasant mix of parks, recreation 
centres and libraries.
<P>
	I am pleased to say that while there is snow and freezing 
temperatures in Ottawa today, in my riding the lawns are green. 
The flowers are starting to come up. Although we have not seen 
snow in my riding this year let it be known that it does not rain 
every day in New Westminster-Burnaby.
<P>
	Like other communities the issue of safer streets and the 
equitable performance of the justice system to properly balance 
the issues of the victims as opposed to that of offenders 
continues to fester.
<P>
	To focus my remarks I wanted to comment on a paragraph in 
the throne speech referring to community safety and crime 
prevention. Listening to the throne speech my reaction was one 
of stunned disbelief for misplaced priorities. Across Canada one 
particular issue has been the Young Offenders Act, yet it did not 
rate a mention in the speech from the throne.
<P>
	There was no outcry in New Westminster-Burnaby for 
changes to the human rights act or demands for the court 
challenges program to be restored. It took questioning of the 
minister from our side to hear any comment to do with the Young 
Offenders Act. I heard that in just the last few hours the justice 
minister did hint at a direction but not very precisely.
<P>
	Let me say clearly that in my riding the folk are upset about 
deficits and the conspicuous consumption by government and 
the lack of fiscal leadership by example. However, if one wants 
to identify one particular statute that is in disrepute then it is the 
Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	As a criminal justice professional I participated in the 
national consultations leading up to the act being passed in the 
late days of the previous Liberal administration. I recall that in 
1984 the government of the day was quite verbose in promoting 
the efficacy of the compromise achieved with the provinces. 
However, I also recall other voices predicting that it was a 
flawed piece of legislation.
<P>
	The verdict of my community is in. There is little community 
support. In fact I have never met one policeman who supports 
this legislation. We have now had about ten years of 
implementation and during that time the act has acquired very 
few defenders.
<P>
	The flawed act was subject to a number of court appeals for 
clarification. It was also amended several times by the 
Conservatives. However, the Young Offenders Act remains 
today the single piece of legislation that is most vilified by the 
public.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act has a title which implies its 
application. I say to the government as a professional who has 
been left in the community to administer this act, let the Young 
Offenders Act truly deal with young offenders and not youthful 
adults.
<P>
	If the justice minister does nothing else about this act and all 
its tangled provisions, it can do one thing to change the mood of 
this country concerning young offenders. Consider specifically 
section 2(1) under definitions of a ``young person''. What if we 
change the number 12 to 10 and the number 18 to 16? It is just 
two numbers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="553"> 553 </A></B>
<P>
	The government needs to change just two numbers in the 
beginning of this statute and that would then fundamentally 
change the administration of justice across this nation. 
However, I doubt that the government has the courage. The 
throne speech indicates misplaced priorities. The answers of the 
minister so far outline a plan perhaps to tinker only with the 
internal technical points of the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	However, the thrust of this act has never achieved acceptance 
in my community. I am also getting calls on what the 
government really means by its throne speech reference to this: 
``Amendments will be proposed to the Canadian Human Rights 
Act''. There are a few newspaper articles but not much else.
<P>
<B>(2145) </B>
<P>
	Where is the political mandate for that? I do not believe there 
is any specific reference to it in the infamous Liberal red book. 
Where does this come from, left field? Where is the political 
mandate to perhaps fundamentally alter how Canadians define 
themselves? If there is a sleeper time bomb in this throne speech 
then this is it.
<P>
	I ask the government to be open now and test the marketplace 
for ideas on this one. The implications of this measure to 
policies, to Revenue Canada, the social safety net, insurance 
companies, pension plans and union contracts is sweeping.
<P>
	If the government is hiding the intent until the last moment I 
challenge to issue intent now and if there is national-wide 
protests then so be it. It just seems that pursuing this agenda is a 
misplaced priority from what my community wants. It begs the 
question what special interest group has the ear of the 
government?
<P>
	In our let the people speak phase of the election it was clear 
that my community wanted fiscal reform. Specifically in justice 
issues it was the Young Offenders Act that was of concern, not 
the human rights act and definitely not the court challenges 
program.
<P>
	I remind the government to pay attention to what the people 
want rather than what it thinks the people need or should want. 
Specifically in the field of criminal justice, reform bring 
forward legislation on the Young Offenders Act first, especially 
in line with what I have mentioned rather than window dressing.
<P>
	I also want to commend this government for permitting open 
debates on peacekeeping and on cruise missile testing. I am sure 
the varied moods of the communities were reflected by the 
members, much to the confusion of members of the media who 
all seemed to want the old style of being handed a set paragraph 
policy statement that is the formula set position of the day.
<P>
	Now fiscal reform has been and is being dealt with at least at 
the talking level, albeit some ministers have not yet got the 
message with their use of government aircraft. There are 
indications that the Criminal Code matters will be heard.
<P>
	That leaves parliamentary reform. I am encouraged as I have 
said about the open debates so far but I ask if the Prime Minister 
could go just one bit further and say to this House that the 
government will not consider the defeat of a government motion 
including a spending measure to constitute an expression of 
non-confidence in the government unless it is immediately 
followed by the passage of a formal non-confidence vote.
<P>
	The genie is out of the bottle concerning the public's 
expectation to be heard on issues that fundamentally alter the 
way Canadians define themselves. The referendum was the 
watershed for that, but criminal law is part of it.
<P>
	But more than appreciating the 199 new members of 
Parliament who have never been here before the fresh air that is 
needed is an attitude change by just one man, the Prime 
Minister, who can gather the courage to usher us into a new age 
of democracy. The Prime Minister is looking to make his mark 
in Canadian history. I believe that this is where he can do it.
<P>
	It is not a strategic question of caucus support or insider 
concerns, all of which were the same arguments used by the 
British Prime Minister many years ago in his reluctance to 
abolish slavery. The main thrust, the change was right. Then as 
now the national mood was right but a consideration for a united 
caucus and parliamentary manoeuvring delayed too long what 
that nation wanted. I think the nation wants this measure from 
the Prime Minister to free us from the slavery of caucus 
solidarity. This one step could open the House to a new meaning 
in relevance to those who have sent us here.
<P>
	In closing I pledge my co-operation and constructive advice 
on legislation. I will minimize my personal philosophies and 
emphasize what my constituents desire as I will attempt to 
represent the broadest of political views. For this House does 
not belong to parliamentarians. It is not our private club. It 
belongs to the people. I pledge to conduct myself accordingly 
for in the long run I trust that if the people are given the truth and 
the whole story more often than not consensus will emerge that 
is wiser than any technocrat can devise.
<P>
	Finally, as the government brings forth its legislative program 
let the people speak and we will have fulfilled our duty. May the 
government hear what has been tested in the marketplace of 
ideas and it will not go wrong. Lead by example and sacrifice 
and the nation will support it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would like to ask the 
House to consider the following. We will be adjourning shortly 
at 10 p.m. The hon. member for Elk Island has been seeking the 
floor. If there was consent to forgo the five minute question or 
<P>

<B><A NAME="554"> 554 </A></B>
<P>
comment period to the last intervention from the member for 
New Westminister-Burnaby I could immediately recognize  
the member for Elk Island before we adjourn this evening. 
Would there be consent?
<P>
<B>(2150) </B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will begin in the 
traditional manner by congratulating you on your position and 
assuring you of my respect and co-operation. I consider it a 
great privilege to have been chosen by the electors of Elk Island 
to serve them as their member of Parliament.
<P>
	As most other speakers have done I will also express thanks to 
the many people who voted and worked to give me this honour. 
Especially I am grateful to my wife Betty and my family for 
their sacrifice, support and trust.
<P>
	The Elk Island constituency lies immediately east of 
Edmonton in Alberta and is noted for the fact that it contains Elk 
Island Park, a national park operated by Parks Canada.
<P>
	The constituency has approximately 85,000 residents. Many 
live on acreages and farms. Our people earn their living by 
working in our industrial and chemical plants, by farming, by 
operating numerous small businesses and by many other forms 
of endeavour which add to the economy and well being of the 
community and the country. In addition many work in the city of 
Edmonton.
<P>
	I am very proud and thankful to be a Canadian. I remember as 
a youth hearing my immigrant parents, grandparents and their 
friends talk of the hardships and the lack of freedoms which 
caused them to look to this land for hope.
<P>
	More recently our son Brent has been working as a volunteer 
in a relief agency in the countries of Sudan, Kenya, Somalia, 
Bosnia and Croatia where he was helping to give aid to the 
tremendously disadvantaged because of war. We have been 
deeply touched by his first-hand accounts of children, young 
people, women and men who are starving or suffering intensely 
because of the inhumanity of selfish aggressive people. I am 
very grateful that in this country we govern ourselves with 
ballots and not with bullets.
<P>
	It is in this context that I give my address today. While we 
have it so good, I am committed to doing my part to ensure that 
we do not lose our freedoms and privileges. I hope also that we 
will be able to continue to share our abundance and our help with 
many other unfortunate people in our hurting world.
<P>
	It might sound as though I am complaining when I draw 
attention to the shortcomings of our past governments. I am very 
concerned that we run the risk of losing it all here in our 
wonderful Canada because of the mismanagement of 
government over the last 30 years.
<P>
	It seems so obvious to me that the policies of the Liberals and 
the Conservatives of the past have taken us into the slavery of 
debt. I hope against hope that this new government will be able 
and will have the political will to begin to turn this around.
<P>
	Just think there is no country in this world as blessed as ours. 
We have a wonderfully rich heritage of natural resources from 
fish to forest, from bounteous grain fields to plentiful energy in 
oil, gas and water, from beautiful scenery attracting tourists 
from all around the world to our wonderful land from 
Newfoundland to British Columbia to the far north.
<P>
	I could go on and on. Add to that the enormous wealth we have 
in our people. We are all immigrants, even those who we proudly 
call our natives. Our first nations originally came here from a 
different part of the world. We have of course the French and the 
English, but we also have many others including the 
Scandinavians and the Orientals, the Europeans and the 
Africans. The list is endless. Over the years we have lived 
together in harmony and co-operation.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you do not know how it hurts me to hear some 
who are working toward tearing up this country. If there is not 
room for all of us here in Canada, how can we expect the other 
nations of the world to stop warring with each other on this 
planet?
<P>
	I would like to say to my friends sitting next to me how we 
wish they would change their minds about leaving Canada. How 
we wish that they would give it one more try. How we wish that 
they would stop saying Canada and Quebec and would start 
saying Quebec and the other provinces of Canada.
<P>
<B>(2155 ) </B>
<P>
	Will they consider doing what we have done in the west? For 
years and years we have paid much more into Confederation 
than we have received in dollars. For those same years we have 
been practising what many of us learned in Sunday school, that 
is to share and not be selfish, to give and not always to expect 
returns.
<P>
	At the same time I must be honest. The patience of our 
position has on occasion been tested. We are looking forward 
seriously to the day when all the provinces will be able to better 
make it on their own and to decrease their dependence on others. 
It is very encouraging to see the generosity and benevolence of 
others too. We desire deeply that all Canadians and all provinces 
live together in peace and harmony as equal partners in 
Confederation.
<P>
	That little diversion from the topic of debt was intentional. I 
thought that it would be a good idea to highlight our wonderful 
advantages, but let me now return to the topic of our burgeoning 
debt. How can it be that with this vast legacy of natural and 
human wealth our governments of the past have managed to dig 
us so deeply into debt? Is there any hope for the future?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="555"> 555 </A></B>
<P>
	The government is proposing in the throne speech to borrow 
more money in order to produce jobs. It will say it is not 
borrowing more, just spending money that it saved on the 
helicopters or other areas, but the fact is that there is still a huge 
deficit predicted for the next fiscal year. That means that we are 
doing what we are doing with borrowed money.
<P>
	It is clear that the collective wisdom of the citizens of this 
great country is moving more and more toward a demand to live 
within our means. I wish I knew of a way to communicate this 
forcibly and convincingly to the point where the majority 
government opposite would actually change its fiscal policies to 
reflect this reality.
<P>
	I was elected largely on the merit of the Reform Party's deficit 
and debt reduction commitment. In my constituency there were 
five voters who voted for Reform's plan of fiscal restraint for 
every two voters who chose the Liberal's plan of borrow more, 
spend more. Even in Ontario where the government received a 
rather overwhelming number of seats, almost one million 
individuals expressed themselves in their vote for fiscal 
restraint.
<P>
	I would have been so pleased if we would have had at least a 
commitment from the government to set some realistic written 
goals and to cap spending. It is very doubtful if we will ever 
achieve a goal if we are not even willing to state it.
<P>
	During the campaign a simple fact struck me forcibly. We 
have no mechanism actually to control spending. We have no 
means of ensuring that the wishes of our constituents, the 
taxpayers, are expressed and enforced in the workings of 
government. I appreciate the new openness of the government. 
It is breaking with precedent in actually having pre-decision 
debates on various issues including the budget.
<P>
	However, we will not have true freedom of expression on 
behalf of the people we represent until we have true, free votes, 
even on the budget. This can only happen if we can agree that the 
defeat of a bill, even the budget, does not automatically mean 
the defeat of the government. There is no choice if we can only 
vote yes, even when we disagree.
<P>
	I respectfully and forcefully request that the government 
allow all members on both sides of the House, the democratic 
representatives of the people who elected us, the freedom to 
send the budget back to the bureaucrats if it is not good enough. 
Let them fix it and not bring it back until the unencumbered 
majority of members of the House agree that we have reached a 
satisfactory decision.
<P>
	I end my speech with a pledge not only to this House but to the 
people in Elk Island who elected me, the people of Canada who 
are looking to Parliament for leadership. I will do all I can to 
participate in bringing fiscal reality and responsibility to this 
place. I will exert all the influence I can in changing the way 
Parliament works so that it can become a better and more 
democratic place.
<P>
	In the end I believe we will be a better country. We will not 
only have increased prosperity and well-being for ourselves, 
but we will also have the freedom and ability to do more for 
others.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being ten o'clock p.m., 
pursuant to the order made earlier this day, this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at ten o'clock a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 10 p.m.)
