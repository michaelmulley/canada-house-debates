West and CDCI East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more than 600 petitioners are concerned about the manner in

alternative to kidney dialysis and kidney transplant for 
treatment of those with end stage kidney disease.

citizens of the Peterborough area.

following questions will be answered today: Nos. 20 and 23. 
.[Text] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 20—<B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the government provide: (<I>a</I>) the amount in the 
transitional jobs fund that was not utilized in the fiscal year 
2000-01 and was redirected on June 22, 2000, toward the Economic 
Development Agency of Canada for the regions of Quebec; and (<I>b</I>) 
a list of all amounts paid out in grants since June 22, 2000, by 
the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the regions of 
Quebec through the Canada jobs fund, indicating the date each 
such grant was made? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> I am informed as 
follows: (a) The transitional jobs fund, TJF, ended March 31, 
1999. Therefore no funds from TJF were redirected toward the 
Economic Development Agency of Canada for the regions of Quebec 
for fiscal year 2000-01. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>TJF was replaced by the Canada jobs fund, CJF, which came into 
effect on April 1, 1999. On June 22, 2000, the Government of 
Canada announced that CJF would be closed down and that, in order 
to more strategically and effectively meet the unique needs of 
those regions where unemployment remained high, the CJF funds 
would be transferred to the regional development agencies. This 
would include the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Western 
Economic Diversification Canada, the federal economic development 
initiative in northern Ontario, the Economic Development Agency 
of Canada for the regions of Quebec and the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada also advised that all project proposals 
received in HRDC offices on or before June 22, 2000, would be 
assessed and all existing financial commitments would be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No funds were transferred to the regional economic development 
agencies in fiscal year 2000-01. At the time of the announcement 
of the close down of CJF, there were close to 500 CJF proposals 
under review at either the local, regional or national level. 
From June 22, 2000, to the present, just over 130 CJF projects 
have been approved, including 52 from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) The moneys allocated to the CJF have not yet been 
transferred from HRDC to the various regional economic 
development agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A portion of these funds will be transferred to Canada economic 
development at the beginning of the 2001-02 fiscal year.

calculate the value of the tax incentives available to all new

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House calls upon the 
government to respect the spirit of the evidence given by 
the Minister of International Trade before the Foreign 
Affairs Committee, who stated “I can assure you that we are 
not seeking an investor-state provision in the WTO or 
anywhere else”, by refusing to sign any trade agreement, 
such as the FTAA or the GATS, that includes a NAFTA Chapter 
11-style investor-state clause. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Madam Speaker, let me indicate at the outset that I 
will be sharing my time with the member for Burnaby—Douglas. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two images come to the mind of Canadians on the subject of 
Quebec City: the wall, this reinforced concrete fence all around 
the old capital to prevent people from getting in and another 
wall, a wall of tear gas, or 5,000 tear gas grenades thrown 
everywhere, blinding everyone, demonstrators and residents. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who could imagine more potent symbols for the squalid secrecy 
that surrounded international trade talks than that ugly wall and 
that haze of gas? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Liberal government trumpets its success at advancing 
the corporate driven globalization agenda, millions of Canadian 
now get the picture:  fortress walls and noxious gases for 
ordinary citizens, privileged access and security passes for the 
corporate elite, rights and rewards for the rich, rhetoric for 
the rest of us.  For the Liberals apparently that is what 
democracy looks like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec was the high water mark for irony and for hypocrisy.  The 
official line was that the FTAA was about spreading democracy, 
but the chain link fences, the tear gas, the water cannons, the 
plastic bullets and mass arrests that prevented citizens from 
getting anywhere near the summit made the case more effectively 
than anything else could that democracy is threatened by the 
corporate model of globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Behind the wall around old Quebec the threat to democracy became 
more ominous as information leaked out that the NAFTA drafters 
had every intention of extending the most anti-democratic 
provision of NAFTA, chapter 11's investor state clause, to the 
rest of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year Canadians dared to hope that their objections to 
corporate globalization were getting through to the government. 
The Minister for International Trade once called NAFTA 
“primarily an exercise in the economic disarmament of federal 
governments”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the international affairs committee in April, just a year 
ago, the minister declared his opposition to any form of investor 
state mechanism, such as the one enshrined in NAFTA being 
included in any future trade agreements.  He assured parliament 
that his officials were working with Washington to have NAFTA 
chapter 11 reconsidered. 
“Take the good news and run with it”, he told the foreign 
affairs and international trade committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December the trade minister reiterated his concerns.  He 
stated starkly that he would not sign any deal that contained the 
offensive clauses, period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the Quebec summit the Prime Minister was calling 
chapter 11 of NAFTA a good clause.  “It is one that works 
reasonably well”, said the Prime Minister.  His trade minister 
has been faithfully parroting the line ever since. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To concerned people throughout America, however, chapter 11 is 
not a good thing.  It is the Trojan horse of so-called free trade 
in the style of big business.  Chapter 11 is the clause that 
ends the debate over whether globalization threatens the 
sovereignty of countries. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under NAFTA, chapter 11 established a new system which enables 
foreign investors to bring injury claims against democratically 
elected governments.  It allows multinational corporations to 
usurp the sovereign powers of government and the democratic 
rights of citizens and communities.  Foreign capital investing in 
Canada, Mexico and the U.S. may demand compensation if profit 
making potential of their ventures is injured by government 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign based companies are given rights greater than domestic 
businesses operating in their home country.  Canada's baptism of 
fire began with the Ethyl Corporation's challenge to Canada's 
right to control the use of MMT in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MMT is a gasoline additive, a neurotoxin which interferes with 
automobile exhaust systems banned in several U.S. states, but 
under NAFTA's investor state provisions Ethyl took the Canadian 
government to court and sued for lost profits.  To avoid an 
arbitration panel the Canadian government settled out of court, 
withdrew its legislation and paid $19.6 million in damages to 
Ethyl.  To satisfy Ethyl's commercial interests, Canadian parents 
today have less control over the quality of air their children 
breathe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date at least 15 chapter 11 suits have been launched.  No one 
really knows for sure.  Apparently it is not really the public's 
business.  There is no requirement to inform the public, even 
though public laws are under attack and taxpayer money will pay 
the fines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike other trade agreements, chapter 11 gives global 
corporations freedom to litigate on their own without having to 
ask national governments to act on their behalf.  With status to 
challenge other governments as legal equals, this clause allows 
NAFTA to end run governments and even constitutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 11 of NAFTA has become the defining issue for FTAA 
negotiations.  In Mexico a U.S. waste disposal company, 
Metalclad, was awarded $16.7 million in damages when a state 
government took steps to protect its water supply.  Metalclad's 
victory established that NAFTA's dispute mechanism reaches to 
subnational governments, including municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is Sun Belt Water of California.  Who knows what is 
next?  Who would have guessed that UPS would launch a lawsuit to 
challenge the operation of Canada Post?  Who would have believed 
that the Canadian government would have left us so vulnerable or 
that, even in the face of this challenge to Canada's right to 
deliver its own mail and the right to keep public services in the 
public domain, the Canadian government would decide chapter 11 is 
a good clause that is working reasonably well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As chapter 11 damage awards accumulate, more and more Canadians 
are starting to press more serious questions about exactly what 
is at stake under the new world order.  Who voted to destroy 
national sovereignty?  Who gave corporations the right to decide 
public values? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why elect governments that hand their powers over to big 
business? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I implore the government once again to find the 
courage to oppose chapter 11 and refuse to sign any international 
agreement that contains this pernicious provision.  The very 
foundations of our democracy are at stake.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am very proud today that the leader of our party has chosen this 
topic to use for our opposition day.  At least this party is 
standing up for the rights of Canadians as we seek to defend our 
interests in the face of these global trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She made reference to some of the brokers that are negotiating 
these deals and their attitude about the preservation of public 
services.  Would she comment on the opinions of one such key 
figure, the former head of the WTO, when he said that there was a 
surplus of democracy in the world today that was interfering with 
the free movement of investment and capital? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would she comment on what kind of a mindset could lead someone 
to say that kind of thing in an era where we value democracy 
above all else?  In an era where our parents went to war to fight 
for democracy there are actually people out there negotiating 
deals on our behalf who believe there is a surplus of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think all Canadians 
and in fact many people around the world know that democracy was 
the galvanizing force behind some 50,000 to 60,000 Canadians and 
others throughout the Americas gathering in Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard a lot of talk from the government in the run up to the 
FTAA negotiations at Quebec City about how this was to strengthen 
democracy, but before the Quebec City summit took place people had begun to 
familiarize themselves with what exactly the FTAA was, with how 
it fit into the new world order as visualized by the World Trade 
Organization, and with the fact that governments were willing to 
weaken democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague has raised a question about an astounding ominous 
quote from a former WTO official who said there was a surplus of 
democracy in the world and that democracy was interfering with 
the free flow of capital and investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we ask Canadians what they care about, when we ask free 
people around the world what they care about, what they care 
about more than anything else is governments that can act in the 
public interest, governments that will respond to their needs and 
concerns about health care, basic public services, education and 
a safe, clean environment.  The health of their children is the 
future of the planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 50,000 to 60,000 peaceful demonstrators in Quebec marched 
with the slogan “This is what democracy looks like”.  People 
were speaking to and through their governments to insist that 
they retain the right to act in the public interest and not 
forfeit the right to do that to multinational corporations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London—Fanshawe, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I heard the estimate of the number of people in attendance.  It 
seems to grow every time I hear the number quoted by the NDP. The 
leader of the NDP said that there was nothing for peaceful 
demonstrators.  I should like to ask her a couple of questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is she unaware of government funding to help the parallel summit 
take place?  Is she totally and completely unaware of the 
extensive consultations that took place for several months by the 
government or of the hearings that took place by the standing 
committee before the election and after? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She talks about ordinary citizens having tear gas.  Are they the 
ordinary citizens who were throwing chunks of cement and cans, 
which I stepped over, at the police?  Are they the same ordinary 
citizens that she is speaking about?  Does she fail to 
acknowledge that there was a minority of irresponsible violent 
people there and the police showed tremendous restraint? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly we have had a lot of rhetoric from the leader.  I 
should just ask her another question, very pointedly.  I 
challenge her to tell me one trade negotiation that Canada has 
ever been involved in that has been more open and transparent 
than this one.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her trade critic and repeated witnesses have failed to ever 
answer that question.  Maybe the leader could tell us just one 
trade negotiation that has been as transparent, let alone more 
transparent, than this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member opposite 
asked a lot of questions.  I doubt I will be given the opportunity 
to answer them all.  However let me say this right up front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I am absolutely aware.  I will quote directly what the 
member when he said that there was a minority of violent 
protesters in Quebec City.  Indeed there was.  We have been 
absolutely unequivocal in saying that violence was not 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask the member this.  Does he think it is responsible to 
keep painting a picture of some 50,000 to 60,000 peaceful 
protesters as being somehow in favour of the violence of that 
tiny minority? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is grotesquely irresponsible for the government to keep 
characterizing democracy seeking Canadians in such a vile way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I am absolutely aware of the people— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I am sorry but the 
hon. member's time is up.  I did allow some flexibility over the 
time limit.  The hon. members have ample time during questions 
and comments to put the questions to the other hon. members.  I 
would like some order please in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is an honour to participate in this debate and to 
follow the leader of my party on this very fundamental question 
about democracy itself, about corporate power and the power of 
people in the country and in the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will respond briefly, because unfortunately the time is 
limited, to the comments made by the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister for International Trade when he trumpeted the great 
transparency and democracy surrounding the FTAA process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the hon. member recognizes that this is completely 
ludicrous.  Instead what the government has clearly demonstrated 
is total contempt for democracy in this process.  I can give many 
examples of that.  The fact is that today on May 1 we still, as 
parliamentarians and as peoples of the Americas, are not entitled 
to view the text that is being negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said we would see the text and that it was tough to 
translate.  Frankly there is something absurd about a debate 
taking place on a document that still has not been made public. 
The government has refused to make public its own negotiating 
position on some very fundamental issues such as investment, 
intellectual property, services and dispute settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even worse we see a continual erosion of the minister's original 
position with respect to the most undemocratic provision of the 
existing NAFTA agreement, and that is the investor state 
provision in chapter 11.  This is the thrust of our motion today 
because it illustrates so clearly and transparently how 
profoundly undemocratic the process is, as well as how 
undemocratic the substance is of the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a little over a year ago, in response to my colleague 
from Winnipeg—Transcona in the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade, that the Minister for 
International Trade was clear and unequivocal.  He said “I can 
assure you that we are not seeking an investor state provision in 
the WTO or anywhere else in other agreements”.  My colleague 
pursued.  He asked “Not at the FTAA?”  The minister responded 
“No, no, no.  Not on FTAA either”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was in April of last year.  Seen since then we have seen 
backtracking, reversal and betrayal of the government's 
fundamental commitment that it would not allow this destructive 
and undemocratic provision to be a part of any broader trade deal 
throughout the hemisphere.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a little over a month ago, in response to my question in 
the same committee, the minister said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—we would of course not sign another agreement that would have 
the kind of clauses that we are seeking to clarify right now...we 
will not go to the sort of thing that we are seeking to clarify 
in chapter 11... 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, in the wake of the summit of the Americas, the Prime 
Minister said to forget all that and that chapter 11 was working 
reasonably well.  The minister himself said after the summit of 
the Americas that things were fine, that there was no problem and 
that everything was working just fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the position of the Government of Canada?  According to 
the minister's spokesperson, its position on chapter 11, 
investment provisions, is set out in the government's website. 
If we go to the government's website, here is what it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, Canada has made no submissions to the Negotiating Group 
on Services.  Any submission made by Canada will be made 
available on the website. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we asked the minister's spokesperson what was Canada's 
position on this fundamental issue of investor state, the 
minister's chief assistant said “We have not made our position 
known yet because we do not have one”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government may shamefully not have a position on investor 
state on chapter 11, but more and more the people of this 
hemisphere do because they have witnessed already the destructive 
impact of chapter 11 on the environment and on the fundamental 
rights of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no coincidence that today is May Day, a day when we pay 
tribute to and honour the contribution of working men and women 
throughout the hemisphere and throughout the world.  It is just a 
couple of days after the Day of Mourning for workers who were 
killed and injured on the job.  More and more we have witnessed 
under NAFTA, under this regulation of growing corporate power, 
deregulation and privatization, an erosion in the rights of 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended, along with my colleagues, the people's summit.  One 
of the most powerful and moving forums was the forum of women. It 
talked about the impact of the existing trade deals on women. I 
will never forget hearing a speech by a Mexican woman who worked 
in the maquiladoras.  She spoke of the dramatically increased 
level of violence directed against women and yes, also violence 
at the workplace.  That is what is being entrenched in this new 
FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still do not know if there was a leak on the proposed 
investment provisions in the FTAA with respect to chapter 11. 
However we already know all too clearly what this means for us 
under NAFTA.  On a number of occasions my leader has referred to 
a study which was just published by Professor Howard Mann, a 
respected director of the International Institute for Sustainable 
Development, who documented clearly and eloquently the problems 
with chapter 11 of NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study points out that the current interpretations of NAFTA's 
chapter 11 can have a significant and determinative negative 
impact on government decision making in relation to public 
interest.  In fact they already have.  The list goes on too long. 
A small community in Mexico, Guadalcázar, was told that it had no 
right to protect its citizens from the impact of a toxic waste 
dump.  The company, which wanted to exercise its corporate rights 
under NAFTA, was awarded some $20 million because the citizens of 
that community said no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more we see that local governments in Canada are 
recognizing the potential impact of chapter 11.  Cities like 
Vancouver, Halifax and others adopted unanimously a motion 
condemning the investor state provisions and called on the 
Government of Canada not to sign any trade deal that would 
prevent them from making these decisions.  As New Democrats, we 
stand in solidarity with those citizens and with citizens 
throughout the hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the MMT case as well in which the Canadian government was 
forced to abjectly apologize to Ethyl Corporation for having made 
a decision to ban this destructive gasoline additive. 
Even the Liberal member of parliament for Lac-Saint-Louis said in 
the wake of that decision  “I can't believe that a foreign 
corporation can almost dictate its terms and we as a sovereign 
nation are completely powerless to do anything about it”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is astounding that the onus is on us as a country to prove 
MMT is not harmful.  We saw it with Metalclad and Ethyl 
Corporation MMT decisions.  We are certainly witnessing it now 
with the challenge by UPS to the Canada Post Corporation. This is 
a shocking challenge to the power of government to ensure that 
the public sector can operate in an effective way on behalf of 
the citizens in that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to note that the Council of Canadians and the 
Canadian Union of Postal Workers have launched a constitutional 
challenge to these sweeping and unprecedented powers given to 
secret tribunals to take away the right of government to make 
decisions in the best interests of its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my time is limited and I hope I will have an 
opportunity in the question and comment period to talk a little 
bit about some of our positive alternatives to these proposals 
because the Hemispheric Social Alliance and the people's summit 
of the Americas came out with a strong, positive and eloquent 
statement of alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental issue before the House is the issue of democracy 
as opposed to corporate power.  I appeal to all members of the 
House to support the motion because it simply reaffirms the 
principles the government indicated it was committed to, which 
was that the investor state provision had no place in this 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I move: 
<A NAME="LINK48">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by inserting after the words 
“Committee” the words on “April 5, 2000”.

the United States and Mexico.  Why is the New Democratic Party so 
excited about possibly having a free trade agreement of the 
Americas with these other countries, which are all virtually 
asking for this trade agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the New Democratic Party not talk about the plan of 
action which deals with all of the issues which I thought were 
important to it such as:  transparency and good governance; 
electoral processes; fight against corruption; strengthening 
human rights; human rights of children and adolescents; freedom 
of opinion and expression; rule of law; the drug problem; 
preventing violence; communications; and education? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does it only want to talk about chapter 11?  Could it be 
that the NDP knows that the people of Canada and the 800 million 
people who live in this hemisphere are also concerned about all 
these other things?  Could it be that it does not want to talk 
about the fact that the World Bank and the Inter-American 
Development Bank are agreeing to finance this plan of action?

chapter 11, that they think Canadians might support them on and 
have ignored all the other good things about the summit, which 
was probably the most important event ever to take place on 
Canadian soil? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B>  Madam Speaker, it could be but it 
clearly is not.  The reality is that one of the reasons we are 
focusing on the investor state provision, which gives sweeping 
powers to corporations at the expense of elected governments and 
citizens, is the fact that there is no protection whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about a declaration that referred to 
human rights, sustainability and the environment.  He referred in 
glowing terms to the provisions of the summit and a final 
agreement on workers' rights.  If the government and the member 
are serious about the importance of respect for fundamental human 
rights, workers' rights, as set out in ILO conventions, and the 
environment, why is it that there are no tough, enforceable 
provisions on those particular sections in the trade deal that 
the government is pushing?  Why only corporate rights?  Why is 
that the Holy Grail? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were serious about these things, it would 
recognize those provisions, as the peoples' summit recognized 
them in its closing statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not opposed to globalization that puts the environment 
and human needs front and centre.  However, the corporate driven 
globalization which is exemplified and has as its heart the 
investor state provision, is what we reject.  That is why we are 
focusing on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by quoting from one of the largest industrial 
groups in the world.  Percy Barnevick, the president of the ABB 
Industrial Group, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would define globalization as the freedom for my group of 
companies to invest where it wants when it wants, to produce what 
it wants, to buy and sell where it wants, and support the fewest 
restrictions possible coming from labour laws and social 
conventions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the corporate and Liberal model of globalization. That 
is the heart of an investor state and that is why the New 
Democrats say no to that model.

many people at the summit.  Could the member for Burnaby—Douglas 
elaborate on the alternatives that were offered at the summit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B>  Madam Speaker, there was a 
declaration at the peoples' summit that talked about another 
possibility.  It set out a clear alternative that would focus on 
an assurance that human rights, the rights of the environment and 
the rights of indigenous peoples would be put front and centre, 
ahead of corporate rights.  I would be pleased to share it with

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very same question was put to the trade critic for the NDP 
by the Minister for International Trade not long ago in 
committee. The member for Burnaby—Douglas also ducked the 
question. Members of the NDP are very good at ducking questions 
that they do not have answers for when they relate to trade or 
anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trade critic for the NDP who spoke before me made the point 
that we have not yet made our position known on investment 
because we do not have a position.  The reality is that the 
Liberal Party and the government believe in consulting with 
Canadians on important issues before we announce our position. 
Unlike the NDP we are not tied to a rigid straitjacket of left 
wing ideology, which is the reason we see so few of them in the 
House of Commons following the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome during questions and comments somebody in the NDP 
telling us when there has been a more open and transparent trade 
negotiation.  I rather doubt anyone could.  The trade critic and 
the leader could not do it.  I would like their whole caucus to 
reflect on it.  Maybe those members could come up with something 
other than utter silence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to speak about a subject which is often 
overlooked in the debate that refers directly to the motion.  It 
is the vital role investment plays in the Canadian economy. There 
is no doubt that foreign direct investment in Canada and Canadian 
direct investment abroad have joined international trade in goods 
and services to become our principal engines of growth and job 
creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign direct investment helps ensure that Canadian firms have 
the capital they need to succeed and grow in the highly 
competitive global economy.  We know that investment creates 
jobs, spurs innovation and provides Canadians with access to the 
capital and expertise that make our country stronger.  Canadian 
direct investment abroad is equally important.  It helps Canadian 
firms establish a presence in key foreign markets, to share 
Canadian expertise and values, and to export goods and services 
to key markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to share some recent statistics that help to paint 
a clear picture of the situation.  In 2000 the stock of foreign 
direct investment in Canada reached a record $291 billion. At the 
same time Canadian direct investment abroad increased to an all 
time high of $301 billion in 2000 and exceeded foreign direct 
investment in Canada for the fifth year in a row. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally Canada has been viewed as a net recipient of 
foreign direct investment.  Many people do not realize that 
Canada is a strong and vital net exporter of foreign direct 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign investment in Canada has over the years been an 
important source for jobs, especially high skilled and high value 
added jobs.  Foreign investment in Canada has brought with it 
advantages in research and development, technology and talented 
people, which have all made real and lasting contributions to our 
economic and social well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An economic forecast prepared by Industry Canada and the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade estimates 
that each $1 billion increase in new inward investment to Canada 
could generated up to 45,000 jobs and $4.5 billion in GDP over a 
five year period.  The study also postulates that one job in ten 
and approximately 50% of Canada's total exports are derived from 
foreign direct investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted further that a large proportion of profits 
from new investments is reinvested in Canada, contributing to a 
higher growth rate and a rise in Canadian living standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has an affluent domestic market, a highly skilled and 
well educated labour force, efficient transportation systems and 
a telecommunications infrastructure which is the envy of the 
world.  The Canadian private sector is competitive and knowledge 
intensive, whether in telecommunications, biotechnology or 
computer software.  In encryption capabilities, medical devices, 
pharmaceuticals and ocean technologies Canadian firms lead the 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our excellent health care and education systems are cornerstones 
to our high quality of life.  Canada remains an attractive 
location for foreign investment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These Canadian advantages have not been gained by compromising 
our overriding economic and social values.  Foreign investors in 
Canada are subject to the same laws and regulations as our 
Canadian investors, including those aimed at protecting the 
environment and those ensuring the highest labour, health, 
building and safety standards.  We should not forget that 
creating prosperity and wealth in Canada is a necessary first 
step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have progressive social policies to utilize that wealth to 
create a healthy and educated society.  This is an element that 
the NDP leaves out.  It wants to redistribute wealth but does not 
want to focus on wealth creation as a precondition.  Hence the 
ideological straitjacket that I mentioned at the start of my 
remarks which is shared by few Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investment is not a one way street.  One of the most significant 
features of Canada's recent economic history has been the rapid 
growth of Canadian investment abroad.  The value of this 
investment has increased by fivefold between 1985 and 2000 from 
$57.2 billion to $301 billion.  In 2000 and for the fifth 
consecutive year direct investment abroad by Canadians overtook 
foreign investment in Canada.  That is an outstanding 
performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Direct investment abroad by Canadian industry is part of its 
strategic effort to increase market share and stay competitive in 
foreign markets.  Firms are increasingly using outward investment 
to strengthen their operations, penetrate new markets and acquire 
new technologies, resources and skills.  Evidence suggests that 
this type of investment does not precipitate an export of jobs 
but rather results in increased sales and production from home 
facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent study by the OECD found that on average every $1 of 
investment is followed by $2 of exports.  It all adds up to jobs 
and opportunities for Canadians.  The growth of Canadian foreign 
direct investment abroad has led to an increase in exports.  This 
has directly affected Canada's economic health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These investments create opportunities for Canadians by giving 
Canadian firms new markets to extend their businesses through 
exports and through local sales.  Canadian direct investment 
abroad often secures new customers and creates sales in new 
markets.  In addition, it provides much needed capital infusion 
in growing economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians invest abroad we also bring our values together 
with the products we export.  Additional research has shown that 
the growth of productivity and profits of Canadian firms involved 
in global markets has been superior to the performance of 
domestically oriented firms.  We have also seen that income from 
Canada's outward foreign direct investments increase during 
recent years helping to improve our standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is not founded on fact.  The Minister for 
International Trade has been repeatedly very clear in the House 
of Commons, in committee and in the media that the Government of 
Canada does not seek to scrap or reopen chapter 11 of NAFTA but 
seeks to clarify it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seeks to have adjudicating bodies more accurately respect the 
intentions of the NAFTA partners when they signed this clause. 
Points of clarification are very important. The minister has made 
that clear.  However he has repeatedly said that there is no need 
or interest in scrapping or reopening such a clause because there 
has to be balance and sensible protection for investment in 
Canada and for Canadian investment abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is devious in that it seeks to contrast the NDP's 
interpretation of what the minister said with what the Prime 
Minister said.  That will not hold water or bear scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that chapter 11 of NAFTA is working reasonably 
well when put in the context of the enormous volume of trade that 
we do with our NAFTA partners, especially the United States with 
whom we have a two way trade daily of $1.3 billion.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context the clause is working relatively well.  However 
we would like to see further clarification and tightening up of 
the clause in how it has been interpreted by adjudicating panels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to listen to the rhetoric of NDP members. They 
love to use the word rhetoric but do not like it applied to 
themselves.  I eagerly await an answer to the question they have 
continually ducked about a more transparent trade negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was fascinating to sit in the House a few short weeks ago and 
watch NDP members grind their teeth as the labour prime minister 
of the United Kingdom, Tony Blair, said very bluntly that no 
matter how well intentioned critics of freer trade may be they 
cannot be allowed to stand in the way of logic.  He said the best 
thing we could do for our own nations and for poorer nations was 
to globalize and liberalize trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NDP members dismiss Tony Blair as a labour leader who is out of 
touch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  A neo-Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Yes, a neo-Liberal labour leader who is 
out of touch.  I wonder which labour party is out of touch.  It 
might just be the NDP, and that might be reflected in the size of 
its caucus and the incredible soul searching it is very rightly 
going through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP dismissed Tony Blair very blithely.  However we can 
refer to statements like those of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
who said the best thing we could do for less developed and poorer 
nations was to globalize and liberalize trade.  He even 
quantified that.  He said liberalized trade would result in a 
direct infusion of capital to poorer nations of somewhere between 
$100 billion to $150 billion.  That is much more than the 
combined foreign aid or overseas development assistance given by 
all the nations of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I raised the issue with a labour leader in my city of 
London, Ontario, I got a pathetic response.  I was told Kofi 
Annan was a handpicked puppet of the Americans.  What ideological 
garbage coming from the NDP and its spokespeople across the 
country.  They are so ideologically tied down to their own little 
interpretation of reality that they dismiss one of the best prime 
ministers the U.K. has had in recent times and an outstanding 
leader of the United Nations because they do not agree with NDP 
ideology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the NDP spoke about public opinion.  I do not know 
what public opinion poll she has been reading but I do know one 
thing.  The reality, and I mean reality and not the NDP version 
of it, is that a cross section of public opinion polls shows that 
Canadians overwhelmingly endorse the pursuit of globalized trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between two-thirds and 70% of Canadians have repeatedly 
expressed support for it.  One labour council poll came up with 
different numbers.  We were not surprised at that. However a 
cross section of the polls shows that Canadians overwhelmingly 
support the globalization of trade.  They understand its value 
and know that it has created 2.1 million new jobs in Canada since 
1993.  Close to 90% of those jobs are directly related to our 
exports of goods and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know where these interpretations of public opinion come 
from, but they certainly do not reflect the public opinion I read 
and hear about all the time in my city of London, Ontario, and in 
my riding of London—Fanshawe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian investors benefit from a rules based system at the 
World Trade Organization, regional arrangements such as the 
NAFTA, and bilateral agreements such as the Canada-Israel and 
Canada-Chile free trade agreements to which my colleague, the 
secretary of state, referred earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investment rules provide for transparent, predictable and fair 
rules for Canadian investors, large and small.  The NAFTA 
investment rules play an important role in protecting and 
facilitating foreign investment activities of Canadian firms in 
the United States and Mexico. 
Trade and investment rules give a relatively small economy like 
ours more leverage against the political pressure sometimes 
exerted by larger economies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a trading nation in the world that needs these rules 
it is Canada.  Only the NDP fails to understand that.  Its 
members do not understand that Canadian jobs are dependent on 
freer trade.  They champion themselves as spokespeople for the 
labour movement, but they are now questioning that and rightly 
so. The labour movement does not reciprocate when it goes to the 
polls, and with very good reason.  It knows who is in touch with 
reality and who is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investment rules also attract foreign investment into Canada 
because they strengthen Canada's reputation as a secure base for 
establishing global enterprises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We come to the matter of disputes.  There have always been 
disputes between governments and companies and there always will 
be.  NAFTA did not create such disputes.  Chapter 11 did not 
create such disputes.  Companies have always been unhappy with 
governments for various things and have taken a variety of 
actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Disputes stand out for the simple reason that they are rare, 
although some are admittedly dramatic.  In the context of our 
full trading relationship we have not had many trade disputes, 
and Canada has done very well in some of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Disputes affect a small portion of the billions of dollars in 
investment that Canada attracts, with over $93 billion last year 
alone.  Disputes affect a very small portion of the billions that 
Canadian firms invest abroad, with some $62 billion in 2000. 
Moreover we have means to address such disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It boggles my mind that people suggest we do not need to protect 
either investment in Canada or Canadian investment overseas.  It 
is incredible.  I do not know if the motion is serious.  It is 
not accurately worded.  It does not reflect the repeated 
statements of the Minister for International Trade that we must 
clarify, not scrap or reopen, chapter 11 of NAFTA.  He has said 
that repeatedly and it has been published in <I>Hansard</I> on 
many occasions.  In answering questions in the House in the 
minister's absence I have made the same point because it is 
consistent with what he has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, foreign direct investment in Canada and Canadian 
investment abroad are both vital to Canada's growth and 
prosperity.  Investment brings knowledge, technology and new 
opportunities for Canadians.  It enriches the range of 
possibilities to which Canadians can aspire while helping build 
the knowledge economy and prepare Canada to compete confidently 
on the global stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons the government believes policies which protect 
Canadian investment abroad and promote Canada as a location of 
choice for investment are critical to our economic and social 
well-being.  We will therefore not support measures that limit 
the government's ability to protect Canadian investments abroad. 
We will not support measures that blatantly threaten jobs, jobs 
which are badly needed and which have been created in significant 
numbers since 1993 because of our success in trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today I had the honour to table the latest story on 
overseas trade for Canada in the year 2000.  It was a tremendous 
success story and it was an honour to table it.  Most Canadians 
and all political parties in the House seem to understand that, 
with the sole exception of the NDP.  That is its problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not nearly as much beer and skittles as the member for 
London—Fanshawe would have us believe.  Speakers such as the

concerns they have as small, poor countries in Latin America and 
the Caribbean that are trying to compete with the giant to the 
south of us and to the north of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A great deal has been said today, both by the member who just 
spoke and the hon. member from Edmonton, on the matter of 
democracy.  Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, in the closed door

if people were denied land and power was concentrated in the

democracy.  Would the member for London—Fanshawe care to 
comment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Madam Speaker, the reality is that the 
leaders of the Americas overwhelmingly support the FTAA, as my 
colleague the secretary of state noted earlier.  Why?  It is 
because they understand the truth of the comments of Kofi Annan. 
They understand that globalized and liberalized trade is the best 
thing that could happen for their countries, their economies and 
their people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Not Hugo Chavez. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member asked me a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I did say earlier 
that we have plenty of time for questions and comments and I 
think we should show respect to each other in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is the NDP way to 
holler down things it does not want to hear.  However the reality 
is, and I was coming to the member's question— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Respect will go both 
ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am coming to the 
member's question.  I think that is showing respect.  However 
hollering will not get an answer.  The member wanted to holler 
and I ask your indulgence to allow me to answer the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Annan's point is very clear.  If we are to tackle the 
problems the hon. member addressed in his question, real problems 
of poverty and inequity in many countries of the Americas, the 
government must have the economic wherewithal to do so.  That is 
achieved through globalized, liberalized trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member can shake his head.  However I will listen more 
carefully to the views of Mr. Blair and Mr. Annan because 
frankly, and with all due respect, they are more in touch with 
reality than the hon. member. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
want to pursue two things.  The member suggested that Tony Blair, 
the prime minister of Great Britain, is an uncritical embracer of 
free trade no matter what it looks like.  That is simply dead 
wrong.  Tony Blair knows that the European model for freer trade 
is different in substance and process from the FTAA and is based 
on exactly the opposite set of principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely true that Tony Blair is in favour of 
liberalizing trade.  It is also true that the New Democratic 
Party is in favour of opening up trade opportunities for the 
Americas.  The countries of the Americas want and deserve freer 
trade.  However the hon. member conveniently ignores that the 
European form of liberalized trade is based on a democratic and 
parliamentary process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no parliament of the Americas.  There is, however, a 
European parliament which sets out explicit standards for working 
conditions, human rights, environmental protection and cultural 
diversity.  It enforces its standards and makes conformity to 
them a condition of membership in the European Union.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The FTAA model is based on exactly the opposite.  There is no 
democratic process at an international, hemispheric wide level. 
Behind closed doors we have those kinds of discussions going on 
and we have the preferential access of the big corporations, with 
500 of the major CEOs of those mega corporations having access to 
the text, which the people of Canada and the people of the other 
Americas still do not have access to.  In process it is 
fundamentally different.  As my colleague from Burnaby—Douglas 
has pointed out again today, in substance it is absolutely the 
case that there is nothing enforceable about the side agreements 
on labour and the environment.  The record absolutely shows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing I would like to say is that if the hon. member 
had been in attendance at some of the forums that made up the 
people's summit, he would have understood that people from 
countries such as Ecuador, Peru and Colombia are absolutely 
terrified of any agreement that would give even more power to the 
multinational corporations than they already have over those 
people's lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member could have heard about the working conditions 
they are suffering, he would surely think twice before he would 
support NAFTA chapter 11, which will give those developing 
countries even fewer democratic instruments with which to raise 
their standard of living and protect their environment, their 
cultures and their working rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Madam Speaker, here we go again.  There 
is other consultation possible than just that in Quebec City, 
whether it was inside the summit or at the people's summit.  The 
leader does not need to lecture me on that.  I very recently met 
with a group of aboriginal people from Colombia in my office on 
Parliament Hill.  They expressed some of their concerns.  We are 
consulting very widely.  Unlike the NDP, we do not just consult 
with those who agree with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader said that I had mentioned that Mr. Blair was in 
favour of free trade no matter what it looks like.  That is 
exactly what the leader attributed to me.  That is absolutely and 
completely inaccurate.  I said no such thing.  I challenge her to 
find that in <I>Hansard</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply said that Mr. Blair indicated that the critics of free 
trade, including the leader of the NDP, however well intentioned, 
cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the economic reality 
that globalized, liberalized free trade is very important.  Small 
countries such as those of the Americas need investments.  Their 
leaders get that if the NDP leader does not.  Firms need rules in 
order to invest.  Everybody understands that but the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former Ontario premier, NDP premier Bob Rae, said it comes 
to this:  the critics of globalized trade want to abolish 
capitalism.  They have lost that argument.  Those are arguments 
on the scrap heap of history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would ask the hon. 
member this point blank.  Does it concern him at all that the 
model of free trade that is being pursued is being pursued under 
the banner of the notion that there is a surplus of democracy in 
the world, of democracy interfering with capital investment? Does 
that concern the hon. member? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Madam Speaker, yes it does, because I do 
not agree that there is a surplus of democracy.  This whole 
process has been about democratizing the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the leader of the NDP not remember that prior to 
liberalized, globalized free trade there was a dictator in Mexico 
and that about 20 of those countries had dictators?  Does she not 
get it that this is a move toward democracy?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure for me to rise on behalf of the constituents of 
Calgary East to speak on the supply day motion put forward by the 
NDP.  At this time I have to make up my mind which way I should 
go after what the government and the NDP have said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start by telling the House why the Alliance will not be 
supporting the motion put forward by the NDP.  The NDP's 
criticism of chapter 11 or globalization, as it has embraced the 
anti-globalization protest movement, is on only one theme.  The 
theme is that it is multinationals against the others.  All the 
NDP keeps saying is that it is multinationals against the others, 
but I can tell them that the issue is not multinationals.  The 
issue is small and medium sized businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the globalization regime that has taken place opportunity 
has now been given for the first time to small businesses and 
medium sized businesses to take advantage of and participate in 
trade.  This means for both sides, not only for Canadians.  It 
means that other countries can also take advantage of 
globalization.  Their business people can take advantage of it 
and bring prosperity to their countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that prosperity comes through a good economic plan. 
If a country does not have a good economic plan and the 
businesses are not there, no matter what we say at the end of the 
day people cannot take advantage of it.  People will not have 
jobs.  Where will prosperity come from?  I can tell members that 
the government cannot supply the needs of the people.  The 
government is only supposed to regulate.  The government does not 
have the resources to invest in and try to uplift the standard of 
living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very strange to listen to the NDP.  Any time the NDP is in 
a position of power, it quickly changes its views.  The 
parliamentary secretary spoke about the former premier of Ontario 
changing his view and saying globalization and free trade are 
good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also remind the NDP that only three days ago its former 
member of parliament, who has suddenly changed and is now in the 
government, is saying that the NDP is on the wrong track in 
regard to this issue of anti-globalization.  I am talking about 
the hon. Chris Axworthy, who is now a minister in the government 
of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can see what happens.  Every time an NDP member gets 
into the government his or her views suddenly change because the 
importance of free trade is realized.  NDP members go around 
saying they are anti-globalization, saying free trade is bad, and 
they focus all the blame on multinationals.  Multinationals are 
not the issue.  The issue is small business, medium sized 
businesses, farmers and everyone whose livelihoods depend on 
trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our farmers' livelihoods depend on trade.  We can all see what a 
devastating impact not having a rules based system in agriculture 
has had on the farming communities in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, 
Alberta and all over Canada.  It is extremely important that we 
have a rules based system so everyone can play a fair game and 
bigger economies cannot muscle in on smaller economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It surprises me, in that the NDP has so many members coming from 
Saskatchewan.  Perhaps I should not say so many, but there is a 
little sprinkle here and a little sprinkle there of members who 
come from Saskatchewan and Manitoba and who stand up for their 
farmers.  They should know how not having a rules based system 
can hurt ordinary farmers.  These are not multinationals we are 
talking about.  We are talking about ordinary Canadians, with 
medium sized farms, whose livelihoods are being threatened.  This 
is when the NDP should get up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go back to the motion, and to the government on chapter 11, 
the NDP motion talks about what the Minister for International 
Trade said before the foreign affairs committee.  He said “I can 
assure you that we are not seeking an investor state provision in 
WTO or anywhere else”. That 
is what the minister of trade stated.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is really surprising coming as it does from Canada's trade 
minister, a trade minister who time after time preaches the 
benefits of a rules based system of trade for Canada.  As the 
former critic for international trade, I have travelled with him 
many times and I know that his commitment to free trade is there. 
Therefore it came as a complete surprise to me when he made this 
statement, because he knows about the importance of a rules based 
system.  Chapter 11 is a rules based system that has been put in 
NAFTA to address the issue of protection of investments.  If 
there is no protection for investments they are not going to 
flow.  We have seen this happen time after time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand the minister wants rules to encourage fairness 
and predictability for investors.  That is fair ball.  On the 
other hand the minister seeks to change these rules in a secret 
backroom agreement.  He has said that he would like to try to 
reopen this chapter 11 issue again with both the U.S.A. and 
Mexico.  Both those governments have stated quite clearly that 
they are happy with chapter 11.  They do not see it as a threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What baffles everyone is the fact that when the NDP went up 
against free trade and globalization, especially at the protest 
in Quebec City, it forgot that there were 33 heads of state there 
who were elected to represent the views of their people.  There 
was the fifth party, which is not even in government, saying that 
these people were wrong.  What else is a democracy if in a 
democratic system a government elected by the people cannot 
speak? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, here we have people coming from a democratic system 
like ours saying that these people are wrong.  Here is an example 
of the type of comments that were heard.  The so-called 
anti-globalization protester, Jaggi Singh, said that the violence 
was inside when he started blaming the heads of state.  This 
makes us wonder what a democracy is.  There were people there who 
were elected to be democratic leaders and their views were being 
challenged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with one point, that is, we need a transparent system 
for these agreements so that Canadians know what it is they are 
signing.  The simplest system for that is to bring this agreement 
into parliament.  Let there be an open and honest debate in 
parliament.  Let it be ratified by parliament.  After all, 
parliamentarians are the voice of the people.  We have committees 
that go out and listen to the people.  Let the provinces have 
their say on this as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the appropriate way for a democratic institution to 
work.  If the government is committed to an open, honest, 
transparent system, then it would do that by bringing this into 
parliament and having it ratified.  I do not mean the FTAA 
evening debate the government gave us, saying it was an open, 
democratic system and we could debate.  We had until midnight to 
debate it, and the government said it also had a parliamentary 
committee going out to listen to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hold on a minute.  If this is transparency, then we have a 
serious democratic problem, because we stand up and make these 
points but no one is listening to us.  We huff and puff here in 
parliament but no one is listening to us.  We make speeches.  The 
NDP might have a point or two that we should listen to.  That is 
fine, but no one is listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went to the committee.  I have been on that parliamentary 
committee.  I have gone out there with the parliamentary 
secretary.  I have seen people come out to the committee and I 
have seen what happens.  What happens?  Nothing happens.  The way 
the parliamentary committee is set up, the way the system is set 
up, we can huff and puff but at the end of the day it is the way 
the government wants it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violent protests regarding anti-globalization mean nothing. 
People are a little concerned about globalization.  They are 
concerned with the fact that under globalization they do not know 
which way to turn.  This uneasiness is translated into protests 
because of the failure of the government to engage people in 
debate and to promote the benefits of free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know why the MAI collapsed and went down the tubes. It was 
because the government thought that it would sign the MAI and 
then sit back silently, not talking to Canadians and not letting 
them know what was happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue which concerns us the most is the transparency of the 
system and the unopenness of the government to talk about the 
international agreements that it has signed.  It was only after 
the pressure was put on the Minister for International Trade, 
when he went to Buenos Aires, that he said he would make it open. 
I commend him for doing that and for pressuring the other 
governments to do it as well.  That is one credit that I will 
give him.  However it came after the fact and only when there was 
pressure put on him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After daily questions in the House the minister decided that he 
had better do something because things were not looking good in 
Quebec City.  The minister could have done it before.  The 
problem is that the government reacts after the pressure.  It 
does not have the vision to say what it will do or how it will do 
it.  Hopefully now it will get the message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance agrees with the government that the principle of 
free trade is very important for Canada.  Free trade is also 
important for the prosperity of poorer countries as it would 
raise their standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the motion there is one point dealing with chapter 11 that 
worries us.  I do not know what the government's position is on 
chapter 11.  Maybe it could tell us because we are hearing 
contradictory statements.  The Prime Minister says chapter 11 is 
working well.  That caught the Minister for International Trade 
off guard.  The minister is running around and trying to patch it 
up by saying that he is just thinking of improving it.  Then we 
have the president of Mexico and the president of the U.S.A. 
saying that everything is fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of cases that challenge chapter 11.  There 
may be one or two cases where the rules were not followed.  There 
are more facts to the NDP story about companies that have won 
damages using chapter 11.  The fact is that the government has 
failed to follow the rules which it should have followed.  That 
is why it ended up paying.  If it had followed the rules right 
from the beginning this issue would not have arisen.  The 
parliamentary secretary knows what I am talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically chapter 11 has been working well.  If it has been 
working well and giving guarantees to investors, I do not see why 
it cannot be transferred into the FTAA and the WTO.  It should be 
transferred because it would create a rules based system.  It 
would give investors who invest money for the prosperity of 
everyone the kind of rules they need to know where to put their 
money and how their money would be protected.  Business and trade 
rely on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up in African countries and these countries are looking 
for investment to increase their prosperity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures regarding direct aid have changed.  From the 1970s 
to today direct aid was given from government to government to 
many countries to improve their living standards.  After 20 years 
we know that the living standards in continental Africa have 
fallen back.  The direct aid program has failed miserably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the figures state that private investment that is flowing 
into developing countries has tripled.  Governments are viewing 
that as a new form of investment.  It would be in the form of 
indirect aid and it would open up borders.  It would raise the 
living standards of these countries, and every democratic country 
is thinking of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the figures today, the flow of private investment 
is faster into these countries and their standards of living are 
also going up.  There is no longer direct aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this happens as a developmental process then it is necessary 
to have chapter 11 which protects investment so that those who 
are investing know the rules of the game.  We do not want a 
system where governments can nationalize investments making 
investors run away.  At the end of the day money would not be 
given as direct aid.  If we wish to raise the living standards of 
developing countries, it has to come from private investment, 
contrary to what members opposite are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 11 is the route to ensure that this would happen.  If 
there are one or two little bumps, it does not mean that there is 
something seriously and fundamentally wrong with it.  In the 
overall scheme of things it would help everybody.  It would help 
developing countries, and that is what we are looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say to the Minister for International Trade that 
he should be very careful.  What he was quoted as saying is now 
the basis of the motion.  He should be extremely careful not to 
fall under the pressure of the NDP and make these kinds of 
statements that in the longer term would hurt free trade.  In the 
long term it would create a crack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If investment slows down, I am sorry to say that we would be 
facing the same problem, which is a shame as more than 
three-quarters of the people on earth live in abject poverty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not surprising, because if you actually look around 
Africa you see that the countries that are the most democratic,

the world economy and the most globalized.  The countries that 
are led by dictators, are the least open and where the people

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1970s when countries became independent people chose two 
paths.  They chose either a free market economy or a closed 
economy.  Tanzania chose the socialist economy.  Many countries 
of the world chose socialist economies while others chose free 
market economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In about 20 years a marked difference took place.  Countries 
with freer markets were the ones that took part in trade.  The 
best example of globalization is Hong Kong.  Its prosperity is 
globalization.  It does not produce much because it does not have 
anything.  Yet it has one of the best standards of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were two systems in the world.  When the socialist closed 
system collapsed, countries realized that in order to raise 
living standards for their populace they had to open up their 
markets and look for private investment.  Government aid was no 
longer the point.  If they wanted to raise the standard of living 
of their people they had to have private investment and open 
trade. This was staring them in the face.  We are seeing that 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why dictatorships have collapsed.  They have collapsed 
because they could not sustain economic growth. Economic growth 
can only come through trade, sound economic policies and good 
investment policies.  That is what the governments of various 
countries are trying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are programs available in CIDA.  I agree with CIDA when it 
tries to create sound policies for economic management in foreign 
countries, particularly business rules and investment rules which 
foreign countries lack.  It may be a long process, but if it is 
done I am positive like everyone else that the economic standard 
of these countries would increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that Canada have free trade access because we 
have a small market.  Canada has only 30 million people.  We need 
foreign trade for our own prosperity.  It is a win-win situation

the motion because of how beneficial trade is for agriculture. As 
has been pointed out by previous speakers in our party, we do 
support fair trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member to tell us how agricultural trade over 
the last seven or eight years with the United States has 
benefited farmers from western Canada.  As Canada slashed 
subsidies by 60% and the Americans jacked up its subsidies, could 
he tell us how it has helped Canadian grain and oilseed producers 
in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has it helped anybody other than the multinationals, the 
Monsantos and the implement dealers?  We do not produce any 
manufacturing equipment except short line equipment.  The large

has affected agriculture over the last eight years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will never understand

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to commend my colleague for his comments and the 
hon. member opposite for the comment about the countries that 
have adopted open and transparent free trade and how it has 
created wealth in those countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is really significant that we recognize the 
differences in philosophy between the two approaches to the 
creation of wealth.  I would like to ask my hon. colleague if he 
could somehow explain more about why that works.  It seems to me 
that if businesses want to invest millions of dollars into 
another country or anywhere, they want stability.  They want to 
be able to predict what the rules will be as they invest their 
money and they want a return on that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That applies to governments too.  They do not want to simply 
spend money and then not get anything for it, although I 
sometimes wonder whether the Liberal government really cares 
about that part of it, as it just seems to throw money away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the real question for my colleague is this:  would he 
expand the stabilization aspect of a rules based trading system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to thank 
my colleague for asking this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is absolutely right.  In the long term when an investor is 
pouring his money into a situation, he needs investment 
stability.  He needs to know that an investment is made and a 
return is expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that in the past when there was an investment, 
the nationalization, the taking away of properties, the seizing 
of properties, resulted in situations where there was no 
stability.  Individual investors could not predict what was 
happening to their investments.  Nobody, even the NDP, I am sure,

ensure that investors know what to expect and to bring stability 
to that system.  At the end of the day, some questions about 
environmental and labour standards are issues that we have 
international bodies to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the United Nations we have the ILO and UNEP.  These are 
international bodies that can bring pressure on the governments 
of countries where an investment is made to ensure that they have 
rules and laws that will protect their environment and their

other labour standards and dump them on other governments.  Let 
them decide what their labour standards are.  I must say it 
bothers me that the NGOs who sit here are in the best environment 
in the world and are trying to put their views on different 
countries while not understanding what other countries want.

this House to ensure a true public debate on the ongoing

at the very core of the lessons that we should learn from the 
North American Free Trade Agreement and the Free Trade Agreement 
with the United States.

This being said, we are, based on the experience gained with the

conclusions as to what has worked well and what has not worked so 
well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion proposed by the New Democratic Party allows us to 
debate an aspect of the North American Free Trade Agreement that 
is very problematic, even in the eyes of the government. Indeed, 
both the Minister for International Trade and the Prime Minister 
have alluded to a number of issues concerning, among others, 
chapter 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The forum of parliamentarians we helped organize during the 
people's summit in Quebec City was attended by representatives 
from every country in the Americas, particularly Latin America. 
These parliamentarians told us “In Canada, in Quebec, in the 
United States and in Mexico you know what a free trade agreement 
is all about. 
We would like to share that experience with you”.  But for us to 
do that, we ourselves must take the time to digest the positive 
and sometimes less positive results of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From this angle, it appears that today's debate is extremely 
useful, not just for the House, but also for all 
parliamentarians in the Americas.  I undertake to share the 
results of today's debate with the parliamentarians present at 
the people's summit forum of parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed, no one 
had assessed the full impact of chapter 11, particularly as 
regards the dispute settlement mechanism. I have here a quotation 
from the June 23, 1999 <I>La Presse</I>. Howard Mann, who was a member 
of Canada's negotiating team and who drafted the environmental 
portion of the trade agreement, said, and his comments were 
reported in <I>La Presse</I>, as I mentioned: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a situation that nobody anticipated. It was only in 
1996, with Ethyl Corp.'s lawsuit, that we realized how far 
companies wanted to take certain provisions of the agreement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, it was not the intention of those who negotiated this 
chapter for Canada, for the United States and for Mexico, that it 
would be used as it has been for the past few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1996 and 1999, seven lawsuits, for a total of $1.5 
billion, were filed under chapter 11. All seven of these 
lawsuits, which represented half of all those filed, had to do 
with environmental legislation.  All of them challenged 
environmental standards which these companies felt were 
discriminatory or amounted to the introduction of protectionist 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, in the House, the Prime Minister seemed to feel that 
Canada's chapter 11 record was good.  I wonder how he, of all 
people, can think such a thing, with his recent boasting about 
his political longevity; if his concern for a good record in the 
case of chapter 11 matched his concern for his own personal 
record, I do not think he would still be sitting in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record shows that we struck out twice.  The case involving 
Ethyl Corporation was settled out of court, but Canada admitted 
its guilt by paying the company compensation. 
In the S.D. Myers case, we lost.  There was one victory, but it 
was an obvious one in my opinion, that of Pope & Talbot's 
challenge of the provisions of the Canada-US agreement on 
softwood lumber, under chapter 11, on the grounds that they were 
contrary to NAFTA.  There is still one case pending, UPS against 
the federal government in connection with unfair competition by 
Canada Post for delivery services.  Sun Belt Water is still 
involved with the Government of British Columbia as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is, therefore, very early to be saying that Canada 
has had good results relating to chapter 11. 
On the contrary, it seems to me that what the Minister for 
International Trade said—version one, that is, since there seems 
to have been a rather rapid change in his thinking since 
then—constituted an appropriate beginning of a position when he 
stated before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have been seeking, for some time, as we discussed at this 
committee the last time I was here, is clarification about some 
elements of chapter 11 that I believe have been given extension 
beyond the real intention of the drafters. Some are about 
expropriation, for instance. You use some clauses on 
expropriation in a way that is, in my view, excessive and not 
useful. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was last March, when the Minister for International Trade 
was before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT23"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT23"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1155

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want more transparency as well. I think chapter 11, in that 
clarification, which would be binding on the three NAFTA 
countries, would need to adopt more transparent ways of dealing 
with the investment, and particularly the investor-state, 
aspects. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So even the Minister for International Trade was, only a few 
weeks ago, questioning the dispute settlement mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was totally in keeping with his April 5, 2000 statement about 
chapter 11, reported in the motion by the NDP, when he replied: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On chapter 11—and we had a discussion a few weeks ago, and I 
understand where you're coming from—I can assure you that we are 
not seeking an investor-state provision in the WTO or anywhere 
else in other agreements. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member of the NDP asked “On the FTAA?”  The minister responded 
“No, not on the FTAA, either”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the words of the Minister for International Trade, who 
said a month ago, and a year ago, that the government did not 
intend to include a dispute resolution mechanism in the FTAA and 
the WTO accord equivalent to that found in NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it were the intention of the minister and if it were the 
intention of the government, there must be a problem with the 
mechanism.  So, let us look at the problem and resolve the causes 
of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, this was the position of the Minister 
for International Trade in the first draft.  Then, in the 
conclusions of the summit of the Americas in Quebec City, the 
Prime Minister of Canada intervened.  He felt reasonably 
satisfied with chapter 11. Afterward, here in the House the 
Minister for International Trade changed his position, and on 
April 24, we heard him say here “Mr. Speaker, the government 
believes strongly that chapter 11 is working reasonably well”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a bit troubling to see such a quick change in the 
Minister for International Trade's thinking, when, for a year, he 
considered and stated that there were problems with the 
application of chapter 11, specifically the dispute regulation 
mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the summary of Canada's position on the matter of investments 
with respect to the FTAA—because we are still waiting to hear 
Canada's position on investments—I quote what appears on the 
government's website, which we have been advised to consult 
regularly: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not advocating the replication of NAFTA investor-state 
rules in the FTAA and has not supported the proposals made so 
far by other FTAA countries to include such a type of dispute 
settlement mechanism. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is one of consistency, I think. The other parties in 
this House may think that anything on international trade that 
comes from the New Democratic Party or the Bloc Quebecois lacks 
credibility, but the NDP motion presents the position of the 
Canadian government itself, as stated on its website. I would 
find it hard to see how the government party could vote against 
its own position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, it is true that this is the summary of the 
position on investments. We still do not know the government's 
final position on investments and dispute settlement in the 
context of the negotiations on the free trade area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the government to state that position as soon as 
possible, because it is one of two elements that generate a 
great deal of distrust toward the whole process, the other one 
being the fact that last week the party in office defeated an 
amendment brought forward by the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot to the effect that any final agreement be 
voted on by this House before being ratified by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is perfectly legitimate to debate and question the validity 
of the dispute settlement mechanism, which is found in chapter 
11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement and which is, for 
some countries, perhaps the United States and perhaps Canada, an 
acceptable basis for negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is neither the position of the Bloc Quebecois nor that of 
the institutions committee of the Quebec National Assembly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following is a passage from page 68 of the report entitled 
“Le Québec et la Zone de libre-échange des Amériques: Effets 
politiques et socioéconomiques”: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a number of stakeholders are concerned that states no longer 
seem to be allowed to set their national development policies 
without having to constantly consult investors.  In addition, the 
dispute settlement mechanism is a worry because it seems to 
circumvent governments and traditional justice and concentrate 
this power in the hands of trade tribunals. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As can be seen, not only is our concern shared, but it is shared 
by parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be realized that the mechanism provided for in chapter 
11, which allows investors to sue states directly for 
contravention of this chapter, is almost unique in the world. In 
other words, Canada, Mexico and the United States have saddled 
themselves with an obligation that does not exist in any of the 
international trade agreements, whether they involve the World 
Trade Organization or are between European countries which, when 
there are international disputes, resolve them between states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the reasons that has screwed up—the right word 
for it, in my opinion—all the negotiations on the Multilateral 
Agreement on Investment, because of the belief, by the premier of 
France in particular, that state sovereignty could be shared 
between states but could not be handed over to private 
enterprise.  Such is the case, unfortunately, with chapter 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not, however, the only problem with the dispute 
resolution mechanisms contained in chapter 11 of NAFTA.  I will 
touch on some of the criticisms that can be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the interpretation of certain provisions is unclear, 
because every time a dispute panel is formed by virtue of chapter 
11, it is not bound by previous decisions.  There is therefore no 
precedent, each case being judged, I would say, on its merits by 
adjudicators who are different every time.  This creates 
uncertainty for government administration. Will what was valid 
for one case also be valid for another? There has been no 
jurisprudence created for administration of this chapter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there is a lack of transparency in the whole process. 
The decisions rendered by the dispute panels are not made public. 
This applies even to the number of court cases under way.  I 
have referred to 15, while others speak of 18. Obviously, these 
are against the governments of Canada or the provinces, or those 
of the United States or Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there is the whole matter of the mandate and the impact 
of decisions by international adjudicators relating to chapter 11 
disputes. 
These arbitrators are perhaps experts in trade, but they do not 
see all of the ins and outs leading up to the decision by one or 
other of the governments.  In this regard, public interest may 
have to take a back seat to a very sectorial private interest, 
which can be very damaging for certain segments of the 
population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fourth element I want to introduce is the fact that the 
dispute settlement mechanism benefits foreign investors over 
local ones.  Obviously, we are talking about national treatment, 
and I think everyone will agree that all investors must be 
treated the same way. But here, with chapter 11 of NAFTA, as 
concerns dispute settlement, foreign investors are being given an 
advantage, which local investors are not.  To me this seems to 
contradict the very spirit of these trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More basically, I would say that the question of the dispute 
settlement mechanism is whether the arbitrators appointed under 
chapter 11 can legitimately make decisions dictating certain 
behaviour to governments, be it the federal government, a 
provincial government or a municipal one, all of which are 
democratically elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, it seems to us that the dispute 
settlement mechanism in NAFTA causes a problem and cannot serve 
as the basis for proper negotiations on the protection of 
investments—which we agree with—in the free trade agreement of 
the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, in the NDP initiative, what is interesting is 
that it is possible to speak as I did on one aspect of chapter 
11, the settlement of disputes but I think other problems must 
be addressed as well.  I will name two of them.  There are 
others, but I will run out of time, I guess.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the definition of “investment”, which is found in 
Article 1139. That definition has broadened in a significant 
way, the definition of “investment” used in the free trade 
agreement with the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the free trade agreement with the United States, “investment” 
was defined as “an American majority interest in Canada” and 
conversely for Canadian interests in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In NAFTA, that definition also includes minority interests, 
including in portfolios. This also includes loans, real estate 
and majority or controlling interests by investors from signatory 
states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This definition creates an extravagant situation whereby, in 
theory, a bank that would have loaned money to an American 
business in Canada could potentially feel prejudiced by a 
decision of the Canadian government, even though the American 
company located in Canada might not itself feel prejudiced. This 
definition of the term “investment” is much too broad. It should 
be restricted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem with chapter 11, and the Minister for 
International Trade himself alluded to it, is the notion of 
expropriation. As members know, in international law, the concept 
of expropriation traditionally included two elements: there must 
be an act by a state and that act must lead to a transfer of 
property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how Article 1110 defines “expropriation” and it is 
extremely important to read it, because is it is the root cause 
of a major problem in that chapter of NAFTA: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No Party may directly or indirectly nationalize or expropriate 
an investment of an investor of another Party in its territory or 
take a measure tantamount to nationalization or expropriation of 
such an investment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As can be seen, this definition of indirect expropriation of a 
measure tantamount to nationalization or expropriation opens up 
a whole series of possibilities, with the result that some 
companies have extended the notion of expropriation to activities 
that they might have engaged in and to profits that they might 
have made.  In the case of Pope & Talbot, for example, the 
company's reason for suing the federal government was that it 
felt that if it had located in the Atlantic provinces rather than 
British Columbia, its sales would have been higher, its net worth 
would have been greater and its profits would have been higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The damages sought by this company had to do with this notion of 
indirect expropriation.  In a case such as Pope & Talbot, I would 
say that a Canadian company would not have had recourse against 
the federal government. Fortunately, in this case, as with the 
lottery, we won.  Unfortunately, we do not know what the 
arbitration tribunal will decide the next time around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the Bloc Quebecois is for genuine protection of 
foreign investments.  This requires regulation.  The state must 
assume its responsibility of protecting national and 
international investors but, in so doing, it must balance public 
and private interests.  Investors must have both rights and 
obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of NAFTA's chapter 11, which we do not want to see 
form the basis of negotiations for a free trade zone of the 
Americas, investors have rights, but governments have 
obligations.  This seems completely unbalanced to us.  The Bloc 
Quebecois will therefore be voting in favour of the New 
Democratic Party motion and the amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened very 
carefully to my colleague's comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the debate, and in the time I have 
been parliamentary secretary and he has been critic, I found his 
comments for the most part to be quite constructive.  However he 
cited an inconsistency in the government's position.  I will 
cite what I think the inconsistency was and ask him to comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the hon. member made the point that the Prime Minister 
said the chapter 11 clause was good.  Then a little later in his 
comments he was more accurate when he quoted the Prime Minister 
as saying he was reasonably satisfied with how the chapter 11 
clause was working, given the totality of our trade relationship 
in NAFTA and the $1.3 billion of trade done daily back and forth 
across the border with the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part was a more accurate reflection of what I recall 
the Prime Minister saying. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about the comments of the Minister for 
International Trade and that he was not interested in any kind of 
an investor clause.  That is what the motion says.  Surely the 
hon. member recalls the minister repeatedly saying inside and 
outside the House that what was needed was not to scrap the 
clause or reopen it but to clarify it, that yes, the scope of the 
original signers of the deal needed to be clarified and that 
should be a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the hon. member's position and that of his party on the 
protection of investment?  Does he feel there needs to be some 
rules to protect foreign investment in Canada and also Canadian 
investment overseas?  Does he not see that is required or 
does he subscribe to the silly notion that we should somehow 
scrap this altogether?  I would appreciate his views on those 
points. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette:</B> Madam Speaker, that gives me another 
chance to speak.  In the NDP motion, there is reference to a 
chapter 11-style investor-state clause as in NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very clear on this.  We do not want to see any possibility 
under the FTAA of companies being able to take direct proceedings 
against governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, as with the WTO and the European Union, I have no 
problem with the states having the responsibility to protect 
foreign investments and being answerable to other states within a 
multilateral treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade examined it, when the MAI was studied—and we in the House 
were extremely critical of that—it must be realized that the MAI 
was a more general application of dispute resolution mechanisms 
already contained in NAFTA's chapter 11, along with certain 
additional provisions of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, I would say that not all of NAFTA and Chapter 
11 needs to be rejected. I will not say “scrapped” because that 
is not a proper French word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me, and for the Bloc Quebecois, one thing is certain.  The 
dispute resolution mechanism needs to be corrected so that states 
can deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the concept of expropriation must be tightened up so as 
to ensure that what is protected is direct and not indirect 
expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, these are things that are accessible for the three 
governments, in my opinion.  Moreover, the Minister for 
International Trade has told us that he was working along these 
lines with the U.S. and Mexican governments in order to tighten 
up these definitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as negotiation of the FTAA is concerned, therefore, it 
seems to me that this is not the basis on which negotiation ought 
to begin. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the member for Joliette, his party's critic on 
international trade, for supporting our motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him about the role of parliamentarians, 
elected officials, in this process of negotiating the FTAA and 
about chapter 11 of NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very pleased to work with the 
hon. member for Joliette on the parliamentary forum of the 
people's summit recently.  I would like to congratulate the 
member on his work in the forum and his work within COPA as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member to speak a little about the lack 
of a significant role for parliamentarians within these 
negotiations, within the summits and within the process of 
dialogue on the free trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned at the start of my remarks, 
one of the problems we have with the whole process is growing 
public distrust, not only due to the lack of transparency but to 
the lack of a role for parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I deplore about the final statement of the 
summit of the Americas, by the 34 heads of state, is that at no 
point in the final statement is mention made of the role of 
parliamentarians, when one of the objectives set was the 
strengthening of parliamentary democracy.

one might expect—as is done in most parliaments based on the 
British tradition, be it in Great Britain or Australia—that a 
vote would be held in this House on the entire final agreement 
on the free trade area of the Americas, before the government 
ratified it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I say, our British tradition is no obstacle to this method, 
since even the parliament of Great Britain uses this method. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, we must not find ourselves at the end of the process 
faced with a fait accompli. 
This is why the mechanisms must be tightened to allow 
parliamentarians to be involved on an ongoing basis, and not 
only through the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues relating to continental trade agreements have an 
impact on agriculture, work, health and many aspects of our

in a much more continuous and articulated basis because, as I 
mentioned, it is not just an issue of trade or relations with 
other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadian and Quebec parliamentarians—and considering that the 
North American Free Trade Agreement has now been in effect for 
seven years—we have a responsibility to take stock and to share 
our findings with all the parliaments and people of the 
Americas, so that they can make a judgment on the positive 
effects, but also on the dangers of a free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated at the beginning of my speech, this was requested 
by Latin American parliamentarians. They want us to inform them 
of our conclusions on this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that sense, I hope that we will continue this type of work 
and debates on the provisions found in NAFTA, to avoid making 
the same mistakes in the negotiations on the free trade of the 
Americas. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say 
that we have learned more about this in the space of 15 minutes 
than from all the explanations given us by the government.  My 
colleague, the member for Joliette, was very clear in his 
remarks about chapter 11 on investment, which includes several 
aspects.  He was not able to cover them all, but he mentioned 
several of the most important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the government's position is unknown—and a position 
must be known when a debate as important as this is involved—I 
hope that people really took in the remarks of the Bloc 
Quebecois critic, which were very clear.  I hope that the 
government will also take note of these remarks, which are truly 
well thought out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member for Joliette to explain succinctly why 
this chapter 11 must not exist or whether it is really possible 
to improve on it.  I personally see no possibility that it can 
be improved, as the government claims.  Should this chapter 
exist or not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette:</B> In one sentence, Mr. Speaker, I would say 
that chapter 11 and all of NAFTA take a negative approach rather 
than a positive approach, because everything that is not 
excluded is included, while at the WTO, everything that is not 
included is excluded. I far prefer the WTO approach.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to this controversial issue.  We will not 
be supporting the motion simply because we believe in rules based 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need rules on issues, such as investors, and the obligations 
by investors and governments in cases like this.  It is a very 
big part of international agreements.  We believe in rules based 
agreements and in the original intent of chapter 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize there have been some contortions, distortions and 
aberrations that were never intended, but it does not mean that 
we throw out the baby with the bath water.  We believe that 
chapter 11 needs to be reworded and the problems addressed in 
future agreements but we also support rules based trade 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recently got into a great debate with the U.S. over softwood 
lumber.  Some people said that since we were in a good position 
on energy that we should trade off our energy for a softwood 
lumber agreement.  I and my party do not agree with that.  We 
have to deal on the basis of rules.  We cannot deal on the basis 
of having a little strength now on water or on energy.  We cannot 
bargain those off against softwood lumber.  We need a set of 
rules to follow, a dispute mechanism to settle differences of 
opinion and an investor clause in any future agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also take the opportunity to compliment the minister.  We in 
the PC Party think he did a good job with the summit of the 
Americas.  I know it was very trying circumstances but we think 
the 34 participants made significant headway and made a precedent 
setting direction by including the democracy clause.  Some people 
think it is not as much as it should be but to me it is a 
tremendous step forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at it as a ratchet mechanism.  I believe every country 
involved will go into the agreement at a certain level of 
democracy.  There are many levels of democracy but I believe the 
other participants will not let any country go backwards in 
democracy.  They will only be allowed to increase democracy 
through their practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally applaud the minister and even the parliamentary 
secretary for their participation in this because I think they 
made significant progress.  They should be proud of their 
efforts.  I know the wily parliamentary secretary will pass that 
on to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP members have been very consistent.  One has to admire 
them for that.  They have been against free trade, whether it was 
the free trade agreement with the United States, the NAFTA, or the 
free trade area of the Americas agreement we are dealing with 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party, however, has not always been consistent.  I 
remember standing in the House, I think, in 1988, having a great 
debate on free trade.  As I recall, it was the Liberal Party that 
was totally against free trade.  It was the Conservative Party 
that was totally in favour of free trade.  Now we have this 
little flip flop where the Liberals are in favour of it.  They 
have seen the light, the error of their ways and the benefit of 
following the Conservative role model and have now adopted a 
free trade position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Liberals do flip flop from time to time, when they 
land on our side of the argument we totally support and agree 
with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party supports free trade with the Americas, as we did with 
NAFTA and free trade with the United States.  In fact, we 
propelled Canada into the free trade debate and we are proud of 
that.  We remember very clearly fighting the Liberals tooth and 
nail during that debate.  I look at the Deputy Speaker and I seem 
to remember his face somewhere on that side of the House at the 
time, but we will not get into that. 
We believe totally in expanding the global economy and trading 
partnerships with other nations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people oppose trade agreements because they feel they will 
not help the people in the poorest countries who need help.  From 
my point of view, if a country wants to improve its social status 
or social conditions it has to improve its economy.  In the world 
we live in today, if we want to improve our economy we need to be 
part of the global economy.  That means being part of trade 
agreements, which is what we are talking about with the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of trade for all countries, but especially 
Canada, cannot be lost.  We trade $2.2 billion worth of business 
every day.  It is hard to believe.  Our exports of goods and 
services in 1999 reached $410 billion, or a whopping 43% of our 
GDP, the highest in the world.  Canada and the U.S. are each 
other's largest trading partners.  We are very much a part of 
this whole issue, which is why it is very important for us to 
have investor clauses to protect our investors and our 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we support the free trade agreement and free trade in 
general, we always have to analyze these.  We will make mistakes 
as these unfold.  I think we all know that certain aspects of 
chapter 11 are wrong and have been used in a way that was never 
intended, but that does not mean we should throw the whole thing 
out and never sign an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion today outlines that we should never sign an agreement 
with a “Chapter 11-style investor-state clause”.  It is too 
ambiguous.  It would cover any kind of investor clause.  We 
cannot agree with that at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do support the intent and spirit of chapter 11 in NAFTA.  It 
is important for everyone to know the details of how NAFTA 
countries must treat investors and the dispute settlement 
mechanism.  Unfortunately those rules have been interpreted in 
ways that we and the government never envisaged and should now be 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support several features in chapter 11, one being national 
treatment.  Signatories are to treat NAFTA investors the same way 
as they would treat their own domestic investors. We agree with 
that in principle.  If we want to invest in other countries and 
we want protection there, it would only make sense that we would 
need to provide the same protection here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another feature was the most favoured nation treatment.  This 
obligated governments to provide NAFTA investors with the best 
type of treatment they could provide any investor, whether 
domestic or foreign.  We would want the same treatment in other 
countries and we must offer that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another feature dealt with senior management.  Signatories of 
the agreement must not impede NAFTA investment.  Signatories must 
intervene as little as possible.  We all know, especially in the 
business we are in here, how bureaucracies and officials can 
interfere with any project, event or circumstance with which we 
deal.  This says that they should intervene as little as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a performance requirement.  This restricts the 
imposition of performance requirements on investment by 
signatories.  These provisions are to reduce the ability of 
government to require that businesses conform to these measures 
when investing in a party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of chapter 11 was to protect investors from excessive 
nationalization and protectionism.  We think that is appropriate. 
We think investors should be able to invest in other countries 
and not be subject to nationalization and protectionism.  We have 
seen examples of that lately in some of our trade agreements 
where protectionism has raised its ugly head.  They use a set of 
rules in a way that was never intended, such as to stop our 
potatoes, our airplanes and even our softwood lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an ongoing situation.  It is not only investor clauses. 
It is many other clauses.  We need to be ever vigilant, be on our 
toes and be a part of this great debate to ensure that these 
things do not interfere with our trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support, in principle, the measures in chapter 11.  In order 
for trade to work effectively, investors must be allowed to 
operate in a given country.  These obligations are not new.  They 
have existed before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To enforce these rights, NAFTA provided for an arbitration 
process.  This is something that was not available prior to the 
original free trade agreement but it has helped resolve many 
issues in Canada's favour, even though we are dealing with a much 
larger partner.  It has helped us much more than our other 
partner, the United States, when it comes down to disputes over 
free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we acknowledge that chapter 11 has been tarnished.  It 
has been tarnished because it has been abused, distorted and used 
in a way that was never intended.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example is the Metalclad v Mexico case.  It did not affect 
us so much but a U.S. waste management firm sued the Mexican 
government and won.  Metalclad argued that the government's 
environmental laws hurt its ability to operate a plant.  The 
plant was allegedly a hazardous waste treatment plant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada banned the export of PCB contaminated waste in 1995 but 
was forced to revoke that ban after U.S. companies said they 
would challenge the law under NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is Ethyl's $250 million lawsuit against the new 
Canadian environmental law.  A short while ago parliament banned 
the import and interprovincial transport of toxic gasoline 
additive MMT.  The Ethyl Corporation sued the Canadian government 
under NAFTA, chapter 11.  Nobody envisioned that would ever 
happen.  That is the reason we have to address it in future 
agreements.  We have to make sure we are not vulnerable in these 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of interest is UPS threatening to sue Canada Post 
for unfair competition.  We have had Canada Post for 150 years 
and all of a sudden UPS says that it cannot compete in an open 
market so it is suing under chapter 11.  We think this is another 
example where we need to fine tune this clause in the agreement 
and make sure it does not happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the 15 known lawsuits under chapter 11, 6 involve challenging 
the health and environmental measures we in Canada hold dear.  It 
is clear that chapter 11 has not gone too far, but the 
interpretations have been in such a fashion that we never 
envisaged.  We never foresaw that governments and companies in 
other lands would take advantage of them in the way they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said all that, we still do not support the motion to say 
we will never have a chapter 11 style clause again.  That rules 
out any rules or regulations with regard to investment.  It is 
far too broadly worded.  It does not hone in on the problems.  It 
hones in on the chapter, but it does not hone in on the problems 
within the chapter.  Therefore we cannot support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the intent of the chapter 11.  Chapter 11 needs to be 
clarified.  We are determined to help restore chapter 11 to the 
original intent.  That will be our focus as this unfolds and as 
it goes through committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue was raised by an hon. member.  I agree with him 
wholeheartedly that the government should bring proposed wording 
for the investor clause to parliament to ensure that everyone has 
a chance to pass an opinion on it and vote on the wording so that 
we all make sure we do not make the same mistake we made the last 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to work on chapter 11.  We need to be careful when 
drafting and signing all new agreements.  We have to avoid 
mistakes and in this case the potential for other parties to 
interpret these clauses in ways we never intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to wind up by saying we will not be supporting the 
motion.  We do think that chapter 11 needs to be fine tuned and 
adjusted to address the problems that have risen since the last 
trade agreement, but we do not think it should be thrown out and 
we believe in rules based trade agreements.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
for his kind remarks to me and to the minister.  As he knows I 
certainly will share those comments with the minister.  I think a 
lot of good and important work was done in achieving a democracy 
clause at Quebec City.  I am pleased to see he is very supportive 
of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about, and rightly so, the Liberal Party 
changing its view after the 1988 election won by his party.  We 
certainly did change our view as a party.  The facts speak for 
themselves in terms of the enormous benefits of free trade. There 
is no denying it, other than it seems the NDP is determined to 
deny those facts.  The reality is the facts speak for themselves 
on just how positive it has been for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a student and teacher of history I want to help the member 
out a little on the respective positions of our two parties.  He 
will recall that Sir John A. Macdonald was the champion of 
protectionism.  At that time the continentalist party was 
traditionally the Liberal Party.  It was only in the latter part 
of the 20th century with the Mulroney government that the 
Conservatives started to move more toward a free trade party.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect to my colleague, a reading of Canadian 
history will show the traditional economic position of our two 
parties.  The Liberal Party has been far more the continentalist 
party traditionally while his party, starting with our first 
prime minister, was a party of national policy built on 
protectionism.  High tariffs was one of the fundamental tenets of 
that protectionist national policy.  That sets the record 
straight for the many viewers out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask my colleague a question on investment.  We very much 
intend to table our position on investment, but it simply is not 
ready for that now.  Does the member not agree that it is 
important we consult widely with Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke about this point recently with the chamber of commerce 
in my riding of London—Fanshawe.  Those business people and other 
Canadians very much want to be consulted on what our policy would 
be.  Those consultations are under way now.  Does the member not 
think it is important to finish that consultation extensively 
rather than rush into the House and into a premature release of 
our position on investment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member suggested in 
his opening remarks that I might recall Sir John A. Macdonald was 
a protectionist.  Maybe he was there, but I was not at the time 
so I do not recall his position on that and I do not recall the 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question was whether I think the government should consult. 
I do think it should consult, but the key word is I think it 
should listen as well as consult.  It should ensure that the 
views of all Canadians are brought together and included in the 
chapter 11 clause.  Then I think the government has to be very 
firm and vigilant to ensure that the clause is changed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have a question for my friend in the Progressive Conservative 
Party.  Several times he made reference in his address to the 
House that chapter 11 of NAFTA is wanting in a number of respects 
and needs tinkering or altering in some form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he share with us what ways he sees that chapter 11, while 
maintaining it, could be improved to avoid the abuses that have 
occurred under it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the whole point is that 
chapter 11 is wanting.  When something new is done or a new 
position or new policy is developed, often there will be 
unforeseen interpretations.  That is what happened in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 11 has to be more than just tinkered with.  It needs 
substantial changes to protect the Canadian government against 
actions from business with respect to health concerns and 
environmental issues.  Although I still believe we need an 
investor clause included in our rules based trade agreements, 
there should be a rules based clause for investors in the same 
way there are other clauses. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad 
to be participating today and I will be sharing my time with my 
colleague from Windsor—St. Clair. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by reading the opposition motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House calls upon the government to respect the spirit 
of the evidence given by the Minister of International Trade 
before the Foreign Affairs Committee, who stated “I can assure 
you that we are not seeking an investor-state provision in the 
WTO or anywhere else”, by refusing to sign any trade agreement, 
such as the FTAA or the GATS, that includes a NAFTA Chapter 
11-style investor-state clause. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very proud of the federal New Democratic Party for being 
in Quebec City at the peoples summit, particularly our opposition 
to chapter 11 of NAFTA and our concern that chapter 11 would 
essentially find its way into the free trade area of the 
Americas. 
Our underlying concern is the loss of democratic leverage in 
favour of a purely commercial agenda.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We allege the free trade agreement, NAFTA, and now the FTAA have 
been written by and for multinational corporations and not for 
people.  The FTAA has been referred to by doubters as NAFTA on 
steroids.  A Saskatchewan farmer some 80 years old refers to the 
FTAA as standing for fleeced and trampled all over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard most recently from the Conservative member who preceded 
me about our concerns with Metalclad v Mexico.  It had tried to 
ban a toxic waste dump site but under chapter 11 Metalclad won. 
The parliamentary secretary challenges us to talk about democracy 
and point to any other trade agreement that is more democratic. 
With the investor state provision decisions are made behind 
closed doors by a tribunal.  No arguments come outside those 
doors.  I cannot think of anything less democratic than chapter 
11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other examples.  The member for Cumberland—Colchester 
talked about UPS suing Canada Post because Canada Post owns 96% 
of Purolator.  United Parcel Service is arguing that is an unfair 
trade advantage and is seeking many hundreds of millions of 
dollars in retribution from Canada Post.  We have many concerns 
with chapter 11 of NAFTA being extended into the free trade area 
of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 11 allows investors rights to challenge environmental 
laws and regulations, as in the Metalclad case, before 
international tribunals and to sue governments for compensation 
for profits lost due to government action to protect the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example which springs to mind is Ethyl Corporation and 
the MMT decision that affected Canada.  We paid out more than $10 
million in damages to Ethyl.  Never mind pristine water or a 
green environment, in our view this is mostly about greenbacks, 
especially American greenbacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was examples like Metalclad, UPS and Ethyl that have caused 
us concern with chapter 11.  As was stated earlier, we got a 
commitment from the Minister for International Trade that there 
would be no chapter 11 in the free trade area of the Americas. 
That was before Quebec City.  The Prime Minister had lunch with 
Vicente Fox and George W. Bush and now says that chapter 11 is 
not so bad, and away we go.  We appear to be not only stuck with 
it in terms of NAFTA, but I believe we will find at the end of 
the day that it is embedded in the free trade area of the 
Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Dalton Camp noted in a recent column in <I>The Hill Times</I>, 
chapter 11 was never designed for people.  It was designed for 
corporate folk who own the media, some politicians and a few 
economists.  Tens of thousands of protesters who were in Quebec 
City certainly know that chapter 11 was not designed for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our critics and the Minister for International Trade say that 
anybody who is opposed to it is living in the last century.  As I 
indicated earlier, one of the most underreported stories from the 
behind closed doors heads of state meeting in Quebec City was 
when an audio feed was inadvertently left on for part of what was 
supposed to have been a closed session.  There were several 
leaders from smaller, poorer countries who spoke in that closed 
session and challenged the idea that unbridled capitalism was the 
best way to nurture democracy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just listen to the words of Alfonso Portillo, the president of 
Guatemala, who said in that closed meeting: 
The small economies are not the same as the big economies.  Just 
to become the equals of big brothers, we will need to be treated 
accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The democracy clause was a big deal, probably the big deal, of 
the summit leaders.  It was certainly flaunted by the Prime 
Minister.  Hugo Chavez, president of Venezuela, said behind those 
closed doors that if democracy did not provide land, if it was 
concentrated in the hands of 2% of the population, they 
could not speak of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can it be democratic when ordinary people in the streets are 
out there protesting, the vast majority of them very peacefully, 
but the corporations are buying their way inside the summit gates 
to curry favour with heads of state by paying a mere $500,000 or 
so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of those elected leaders were saying what people outside 
were saying, that is, more than half of the population of the 
Americas, of which there are 800 million, live in poverty, and it 
is our contention that the free trade agreements have tended to 
widen, not narrow, the inequalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I just saw some documentation this morning.  The 
essence of it was that over five years after NAFTA in Mexico the 
average wage has fallen some 20 cents or 30 cents an hour. 
Believe me, having lived in Mexico, I know what the hourly wages 
are in that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have a great deal of concern with regard to chapter 11. 
The New Democratic Party wants fair trade.  We in the NDP say 
that there is a world of difference between fair trade and free 
trade.  We want rules that reflect the common concerns for the 
welfare of all and the sustainability of our environment.  It is 
our belief that when more people become more hungry or more 
impoverished, we are indeed all impoverished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to absolve the people who were arrested in Quebec 
City.  There is the idea that those arrested were all the bad 
actors.  We acknowledge, as I said earlier, that there were a 
few, but certainly not all who were arrested.  Many innocent 
people were picked up, arrested and detained.  I encourage people 
to look at the comments of Daniel Turp, a former esteemed member 
of the House in the last parliament, who was there watching over 
human and civil rights.  He was quoted by the public press. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just attempt to close by identifying with a statement by 
Paul Wellstone, the senator from Minnesota, that is, we are not 
against global trade but we are against greedy corporations that 
dominate that global trade.  That is the essence of our concern 
with chapter 11 of NAFTA. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first of all I would like to address the member's comments about 
the police.  I had the privilege of being in Quebec City and of 
meeting some of the delegations from the other countries as well 
as talking to some of the peaceful protesters, which I agree made 
up the vast majority of people.  However, my view of it is that 
the police showed tremendous restraint in the face of incredible 
provocation and violence by a small but determined minority. That 
seems to be the view of most objective observers of that 
particular weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member two specific questions about 
investment.  We know that teachers' pension funds, labour pension 
funds and nurses' funds are some of the very largest funds in 
Canada.  In fact, in my former life I was a teacher in Ontario, 
and the Ontario teachers' pension fund is one of the very largest 
in North America.  As well, 50% of Canadians own mutual funds as 
a portion of their retirement savings.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member share with us his view and the view of his 
party?  Should we or should we not have rules to protect Canadian 
investments abroad?  Would the NDP as a party be willing to 
rescind the rules that protect the savings of those Canadians 
such as those I just mentioned whose lifetime savings are tied up 
in these funds? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker, we should have rules, 
but I would echo the comments made by the member for 
Cumberland—Colchester who indicated that some of the decisions 
or challenges made to the way we have chosen to do business in 
Canada were not foreseen at the time chapter 11 was put into 
place and they need to be changed dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of the member's question goes to the heart of the 
debate.  Is maximizing profits what it is all about?  Is it all 
about maximizing the return on the pension funds for the teachers 
or the profits of Metalclad Corporation or UPS? Is that the kind 
of world we want to build?  The New Democratic Party thinks not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess we are making a 
little progress.  We found out that the NDP does believe in rules 
for investment.  Of course the member, in answering the question, 
went on to Metalclad and so on.  That was not the point of my 
question at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was speaking not about maximizing profits but about protecting 
the life savings of people through a proper series of investment 
rules that are very important here in Canada and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asked earlier how we can call the summit 
democratic.  Very simply, we had 34 democratically elected 
leaders who were there of their own volition to participate in 
it.  We had a parallel summit of citizens funded in large part by 
the federal government.  There were extensive consultations and 
hearings at the standing committee and by the minister.  There 
were a number of opportunities for Canadians to be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member is simply this.  How can he and 
his party ignore comments like those of UN secretary general Kofi 
Annan who has said that the best thing we can do, including the 
NDP, for the very people we all seek to help, the less fortunate 
peoples, is to globalize and liberalize trade.  How can NDP 
members ignore the comments of such an outstanding world leader? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the democratic front, 
one of the most untransparent things that has happened in 
parliament was the breathtaking news that the Minister for 
International Trade said he had great results and would make all 
of the position papers available.  Then there was a pause and he 
said that of course he would not be able to do that before the 
Quebec summit because the translation was not complete, but he 
would be doing it eventually.  Such hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of trade, we continue to say that we believe in fair 
trade.  To listen to the member for London—Fanshawe, one would 
think that there had been no trade prior to the North American 
Free Trade Agreement or the free trade agreement.  Somehow we 
have been developing trade throughout the world for many hundreds 
of years.  Some rules have been better than other rules, but the 
notion that suddenly we live in a global economy and we have 
trade is a very thin reed on which to base an argument. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to start my comments today by welcoming this opportunity. 
It is a continuation of the speech I was giving yesterday on the 
water bill and the exposure that these types of trade agreements 
have meant to Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first comment I want to make is with regard to the report 
published in the last year and a half on the negotiations that 
went on around the MAI.  The report I want to make specific 
reference to, because it seems to be very appropriate given the 
motion before the House today, was prepared by Madam Catherine 
Lalumière, who is a European member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her report she goes through some analysis of what happened 
leading up to the dismantling of the negotiations on the MAI. She 
credits a number of the non-governmental organizations that 
raised opposition to it.  Of course as we all know that 
ultimately culminated in France withdrawing from those 
negotiations and the negotiations collapsing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has prepared a report out of that and has made a number of 
recommendations that I believe are very appropriate and timely 
for the discussion today.  One of those is a blanket 
recommendation that says there should be no investor state 
claims.  She analyzed what happened with NAFTA, looked at the 
cases that have been repeatedly mentioned today and said no to 
investor state claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report goes on to say there should be no general treatment 
clause given to foreign companies so that they have an integral 
and constant protection.  There is to be none of that.  It says 
to impose limits on expropriation claims—so those are some of 
the rules the parliamentary secretary seems to be referring 
to—in order to prevent their use against all regulation or 
public legislation that reduces the economic value of economic 
foreign investment.  The report says that effectively that is 
what NAFTA did.  The report recommends just the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many more than the four recommendations I will 
mention, but one final one is a recommendation for continued 
governmental rights to establish performance requirements.  By 
that they mean public benefits from foreign investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of my own ethnic heritage I want to talk about the 
European Union model and its impact on the state of Ireland. 
Again, that model is fundamentally and philosophically different 
from the free trade agreement, from NAFTA and from the FTAA, 
should we ever, God forbid, get to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Ireland in the mid-nineties just as the effect of the 
capital transferred from the European Union was beginning to 
allow the economy in that country to develop.  I watched as it 
progressed over the last half dozen years to where it has become 
a much more vibrant economy.  However, that is an entirely 
different model.  It allowed that country to move forward.  It 
allowed it to in effect move from somewhere back in the twenties 
or thirties as far as the development of their economy was 
concerned into this millennium in a very short period of time. If 
we had applied the NAFTA rules there, none of that would have 
happened in Ireland, nor would it have happened in Portugal, 
which has had a very similar experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague has already mentioned, there was perhaps from 
the perspective of the government the unfortunate experience of 
someone leaving a button turned on.  The international trade 
minister was quoted, as we have heard in some of the comments 
from our colleagues in the Alliance, as to how the trade 
agreements are the miracle solution to poverty.  The trade 
minister was quoted as saying “It is not the market or trade per 
se that can eliminate inequality”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the international trade minister recognizes that these 
treaties and agreements are not the be-all and the end-all. Again 
as my friend has already indicated, all we have to do is look at 
the Mexican experience.  He was struggling at one point for the 
dollar figure.  Let me quote it because I do have it available. 
Remember that NAFTA came into effect in 1993.  Between 1994 and 
1999 wages dropped in Mexico.  The average hourly wage dropped 
from $2.10 an hour to $1.90 an hour.  That was the experience 
Mexico had.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of other indicators, the maquiladoras 
probably being the best example, of the type of consequences of 
those agreements where there are no protections for labour 
standards, human rights or the environment, all of which are 
protected and guaranteed in the European Union model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will spend a moment on the Auto Pact.  I have long time 
personal experience with that particular trade agreement which 
was done away with as a result of one of those rulings by those 
faceless bureaucrats who make these decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at that as a model, we are constantly being accused 
as a party and as a movement of opposing trade.  Nothing is 
further from the truth.  That agreement had the support of our 
party since its inception.  What did it do?  It allowed cities 
such as Windsor, London, Oshawa and a number of others to develop 
very vibrant economies and well-paying jobs for the labourers who 
worked in those plants.  We did not have that as a result of the 
FTA or NAFTA.  That was all there before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also constantly hear the government talk about the $1.2 
billion a day of trade that goes on.  A great deal of that 
preceded the FTA and NAFTA and was related to managed trade in 
the form of the Auto Pact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move to some comments that have come out in the last 
couple of days and which cause us great concern around the issue 
of the use of chapter 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, in the Edmonton <I>Journal</I> this morning Mr. 
Bill Turner, a businessman and interestingly the natural resource 
advisor to the governor of New Mexico, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will some day consider water a prized commodity rather 
than a natural, protected resource.  And all it will take, all it 
will take is court action to loosen Canada's grip on its envied 
supply. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we read between the lines, he is talking about a chapter 11 
application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see that come unless we do something as a government and 
as a society to stop that.  However that is what we will be faced 
with unless we do away with the chapter 11 type of protection for 
multinational corporations in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that the motion before the House is not a 
motion that opposes the liberalization of trade.  It is about a 
policy that will require this government and future governments 
to protect Canadians' rights to have an economy that is not based 
just on profit for multinational corporations, but a society that 
will allow people to develop their environmental concerns, their 
labour standards and their human rights in a safe and protected 
manner. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stephen Owen (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would be interested in knowing the hon. member's views on 
articles 14 and 15 of the North American agreement on 
environmental co-operation which provides the ability for 
organizations of civil society and NGOs to challenge the states 
in the North American Free Trade Agreement for failing to 
effectively enforce their environmental standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member aware of that opportunity and does he 
agree that in that situation it is appropriate for non-state 
actors to challenge states and foreign countries? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT37"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT37"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1305

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am aware of the 
provisions in the side agreements for both the environment and 
labour standards.  Let me make comments on both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the environmental standards, it is obvious, given 
the full eight years that NAFTA has been in place now, that they 
are grossly ineffective, particularly because there are no 
resources of a meaningful nature for an NGO or a private citizen 
to take that on.  It is just not possible.  It is not a practical 
way of dealing with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious, from the results on the labour standards side, 
especially the Mexican experience, that even when large unions 
have attempted to use those side deals nothing has happened.  In 
that case their government would not enforce the number of 
rulings that came down.  They have been few and far between 
because they do not have the resources to effectively push the 
rights forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, I listened 
carefully to my colleague's comments.  He noted that much of the 
trade that exists between Canada and the United States, and our 
number is $1.3 billion two-way trade a day across the border, 
existed before the FTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind my colleague that over the past 10 years export sales 
in goods and services, as a percentage of our GDP, has gone from 
25% to 45%.  That is a tremendous growth.  There is no other way 
to put it than much of that is attributable to the FTA and to 
NAFTA.  Some 90% of the 2.1 million jobs created in this country 
since we came to power in 1993 were directly related to our 
exports in goods and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member raised the subject of Ireland, which is pretty 
close to my heart, its subsidies and the good work they have 
done.  I saw them firsthand and there is no question that is 
true.  Canada has been a player in that, contributing significant 
money through the international fund of Ireland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However does the member not understand that we cannot fairly 
compare and draw an analogy between the FTAA, which is in its 
infancy and really has not even been struck yet as we are only 
talking about it, and the EU which has been 40 years in its 
evolutionary stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a fund for development in the Americas that has been 
recently created by the Minister for International Cooperation. 
Is the member not aware of that fund?  Is the member not aware of 
the concerns raised by President Fox and other leaders, and the 
steps that were taken in Quebec to create a fund for development 
in the Americas, exactly the same kind of ideas that he spoke 
about vis-à-vis Ireland?  They have to have time to mature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am aware of absolutely 
everything that the member for London—Fanshawe raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about that fund for a minute.  Ireland was provided 
with approximately $8 billion from the European Union for a 
population that I believe at that point was about 2.5 million 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a proposal I believe to top up the fund, which my 
colleague from the government side talked about, to $25 billion 
for what would be 500 million people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  It is just starting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is the point.  It is 
just starting.  Why is that?  Why did we follow this model?  Why 
did we not follow the European model?  That is what this 
government needs to answer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stephen Owen (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address the issue of the value of foreign investment for 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we know that there is almost $300 billion of foreign 
investment directly into Canada each year.  This is immensely 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When companies from other countries invest in our country, they 
bring ideas as well as support jobs.  One in ten jobs in Canada 
is supported by that nearly $300 billion investment per year. 
They also bring ideas and technology to our country.  Also, in an 
increasingly cyclical way, they support 50% of our exports by 
investing in this country. 
Investment into Canada is immensely important for jobs, the GNP 
and bringing in ideas and technology. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investment outside of Canada by Canadians is even larger.  It is 
more than $300 billion a year.  This provides great opportunities 
for us to deal with other countries but it must be protected. 
Canadian companies and individuals investing abroad deserve 
protection.  However investors in Canada also need the protection 
of rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade and investment inside and outside of Canada is immensely 
important to our country.  We also have important domestic 
responsibilities.  Those are to protect very strategic parts of 
our public services and our governance models.  Our health care, 
education, social services and water absolutely need to be 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has not put out its negotiating position yet in terms of 
the investment provisions in the FTAA because they are being 
developed.  There is a great deal of consultation going on and 
more will continue.  Those will be made public when they have 
been properly consulted on and prepared.  The government has 
consistently said that it will protect and will not sign any 
agreement that does not protect those important strategic policy 
issues in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However our interests are not just domestic.  Our interests and 
our social responsibilities are global.  The democracy clause in 
the FTAA framework is a major first step toward this.  We must 
ensure that other global issues of social importance, whether 
they be environmental, human rights, the rule of law or the 
promotion of democracy, are protected and linked in some 
effective way to our trade agreements.  The advance that we have 
made in the FTAA discussions in Quebec City demonstrates that 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned that he was aware of the North 
American agreement both on environmental co-operation and labour 
co-operation.  He felt that they had not been perhaps as 
effective in allowing NGOs to challenge governments.  However he 
did not answer the question whether those could be improved, just 
as chapter 11 rules, interpretation and processes need to be and 
will be in future agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If those could be improved should NGOs be able to effectively 
challenge governments?  I challenge hon. members to consider 
carefully the reality of new governance in a modern society where 
the market and civil society have a powerful and important role 
to play with governments.  If NGOs should be able to challenge 
governments and other non-state actors, why not corporations as 
long as those rules are fair, transparent and they meet other 
social responsibilities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about this concept of new governance a little 
further.  NGOs will come up to the governance table as they are 
invited to do more and more effectively.  We saw that opportunity 
in the FTAA lead-up consultations across the country and the 
people's summit and the civil society committee taking part in 
the negotiations of the free trade of the Americas.  However, if 
civil society is going to step up to the governance table, it has 
to demonstrate its democratic nature and its representative 
nature, just as corporations must prove their social 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most powerful forces to exact social responsibility 
from corporations trading abroad is the democracy of the market. 
If a company such as Levi thinks it is going to get 10 year old 
kids in India or Bangladesh to stitch its jeans, then the North 
American, European and increasingly other markets are simply not 
going to buy its product.  We had a striking example of market 
democracy in my province of British Columbia where not only were 
civil society and the market involved in looking at land use 
planning and forestry practices on the mid coast, but they were 
making decisions without government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have powerful forces that need to be brought to bear.  We not 
only need linkages between free and fair trade but also social 
responsibilities, environmental, democratic, rule of law and 
labour practices.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, chapter 11 of NAFTA needs to be clarified.  There are 
problems which have been properly pointed out.  However that does 
not mean corporations should not have the opportunity, under a 
proper set of rules and processes, to challenge governments in 
courts as they do domestically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign investment helps developing countries.  Globally, 
however, there is not sufficient public money or public interest 
to provide the investment necessary for countries to pull 
themselves out of poverty.  Direct or indirect foreign investment 
through private companies is an effective way of supplementing 
the public money available for that purpose. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first allow me to talk a 
bit about NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the success of NAFTA is usually linked to the opening up 
of markets to goods and services, its capacity to attract 
foreign investment in the regions could end up being the most 
powerful and durable impact of the agreement.  As the Prime 
Minister said, NAFTA works quite well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote some figures.  The total direct foreign investment 
in NAFTA countries was $1.97 billion in 1999, more than double 
the figure of 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>American investments in Canada has doubled since 1993 and 
reached $186 billion in 2000, whereas Mexican investments in 
Canada reached $132 billion in 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian investments in NAFTA countries have also been quite 
sizeable. In 1999, direct foreign investments of Canada in the 
United States and Mexico were $134.3 billion and $2.8 billion 
respectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now say a few words about the World Trade Organization. 
The WTO is not the multilateral agreement on investment, 
commonly called the MAI.  These are two different things.  The 
WTO has more than 130 member states, most of which are 
developing countries.  The multilateral agreement on investment 
was meant for an elite group of developed countries, the OECD 
countries. 
Each member of the WTO has its own approach to investment, and, 
for the time being, there is no consensus to proceed with an 
agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proposals on investment brought forward during the period 
leading to the ministerial meeting in Seattle were 
quite different from those in the MAI. Nobody has suggested we 
should include dispute settlement mechanisms for investor-state 
conflicts. We can expect that any new WTO agreement on 
investment will include developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the ministerial meeting in Seattle, many countries, the 
United States included, wanted our international trade minister, 
who is doing an excellent job, to chair the implementation task 
force of the Seattle meeting. He has accepted, and he has shown 
that Canada is perceived as a country that helps build bridges 
between developed and developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force was supposed to highlight the enormous 
challenge of including these countries in the round and 
determining the means to implement the agreement. The idea of a 
new round at the WTO is not dead. A ministerial meeting will 
take place in Doha, Qatar, in November this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever its position on investment, the government is 
determined to protect the rights of Canada to make regulations 
in strategic sectors such as health, education, culture, and the 
environment. That is what Canadians have always wanted, and that 
is what their government will stand for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add a few words on the free trade area of the 
Americas and the FTAA mechanisms.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the free trade area of the Americas, every country will have 
to submit a proposal to the nine negotiating groups, one of 
which will deal with investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, Canada has not yet submitted its proposal to the group 
dealing with investment. We prefer to pursue our negotiations 
and wait for the other countries to submit their proposals. We 
expect to submit our position after we have held all our 
consultations with the provinces and with the stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Canadian proposal will look at the rules applicable 
to investment in the light of its experience with trade 
negotiations and with the implementation of its rules concerning 
investment with other countries such as, obviously, NAFTA member 
countries, as well as Latin American and Caribbean countries. We 
will rely on our past experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main objective of Canada is to ensure a clear delineation of 
the obligations with respect to investment that will serve 
Canadian interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Countries of the Americas need and want capital as well as the 
opportunities associated with investment, of course. It is in 
their interest to guarantee that investment flows in a 
predictable manner in the whole area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mexican President Vicente Fox recently stated in Montreal that 
Mexico benefited from increased investment, which creates jobs, 
improves health care and raises standards of living. 
He also recognized that the middle class has made major progress 
since NAFTA. More than 10 million people are now said to be part 
of the middle class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the FTAA, Canada is not advocating a reproduction of the 
rules applying to investors and states under NAFTA, and we did 
not support any proposal made up until now by other member states 
of the FTAA to include a dispute settlement mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the FTAA, Canada is taking into account the work already 
started with its NAFTA partners on the issue of investment in 
this agreement, including the clarification of the provisions 
concerning investors and states, as the case may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to say a few words on the General Agreement on 
Trade in Services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back briefly to what I was saying on NAFTA, I would 
like to say that this agreement is extremely profitable for 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Brome—Missisquoi, which is located along the 
Vermont border, is an extraordinary one in the sense that it has 
a large, qualified workforce. It is a riding, of course, that 
wants to attract American investors on our side, so that we can 
re-export goods to the United States and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, NAFTA gives us that flexibility. In 
Brome—Missisquoi, I am in the process of building a Team 
Brome—Missisquoi, so that we can export more goods to the United 
States and that investments can be made on both sides of the 
border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now want to come back to the General Agreement on Trade in 
Services. 
The 1994 Marrakesh agreements provided for new discussions on 
agriculture and services at the World Trade Organization. The 
agreement on services is better known as the General Agreement on 
Trade in Services, the GATS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Services are not only important to the Canadian economy, they 
are the cornerstone of employment in many areas and regions, 
whether for a plant with 500 employees or a business starting up 
with only three employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made our position known to the WTO: Canada's objective 
in the GATS negotiations is to reach the best agreement possible, 
to improve Canadian service suppliers' access to foreign markets 
and to provide Canadian consumers with a larger choice of 
services at a lower cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement deals mainly with the issues of market access and 
non discriminatory treatment of service suppliers. However, the 
agreement also deals with major issues concerning service 
suppliers' right to a commercial presence, that is, where to 
invest to establish a presence in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the GATS lets us choose. All members are free to make 
commitments on this commercial presence or to choose not to do 
so. Let us be very clear. This agreement is not an agreement on 
investment under chapter 11 of NAFTA.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GATS does not include any safeguards for investors, such as 
the right to compensation in case of expropriation, or any 
provision concerning a dispute settlement between an investor 
and a state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member would withdraw her motion, I would move to 
replace the motion we are debating now by the following motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House calls upon the government to respect the words 
of the Minister for International Trade, who stated in the House 
on April 30, 2001 “Our view is that we want to clarify certain 
aspects of chapter 11 within the present mechanism of NAFTA”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Words intended to ensure a more open and transparent dispute 
settlement process, and to safeguard the interests of all 
Canadians in this and all future trade agreements signed by 
Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, I am proposing that the previous motion be withdrawn and 
replaced with the one I just read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the hon. parliamentary secretary have 
unanimous consent to move his motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I 
was the one who yelled “no” to oppose withdrawal of the NDP 
motion. I was pleased to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a simple reason for that: we cannot trust the 
government on free trade negotiations, especially since this 
government, which prides itself on being democratic, even refused 
to provide us with the texts. We, who have been elected by the 
people, cannot even have a look at the content of the agreement 
which will be negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Quebec City during the people's summit. I attended 
several meetings. I met workers from several countries who told 
us bluntly that the free trade agreement and all the resulting 
changes have definitely not improved their living conditions. We 
were told this by people who came to give evidence, people who 
have to live with these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the parliamentary secretary assert that the opposite is 
happening in Canada? Free trade was supposed to improve the 
standard of living in Mexico and other countries. The reverse is 
happening. Canada's standard of living is dropping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, there is a shortage of beds in hospitals. There 
are not enough physicians. Health care is being privatized. 
Experts and everyone else are saying that this is because of free 
trade. And then we are told that this is the best thing that ever 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the parliamentary secretary tell us about what the free 
trade agreement provides in terms of worker protection? In terms 
of unionization for their protection we need laws to protect 
workers in all these countries. Where is the balance between the 
two, apart from the fact that big corporations, which as far as 
I am concerned represent the liberals, will be the winners with 
free trade, not Canadians, not workers of the Americas? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Acadie—Bathurst 
most certainly wants to speak about job creation. So, let us 
talk about job creation, but in a positive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the free trade area of the Americas, we have a powerful 
neighbour, namely the United States, with whom we are used to 
trade. It is the country just south of ours. Since the FTAA also 
includes every South American country, we would have a market of 
800 million people. If we take away the 300 million people living 
in the U.S., we have 500 million more people with whom everyone 
in Canada can do business in a free trade context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits are clearly there. In Canada's justice system, 
common law exists alongside the civil code. Latin American 
countries usually have civil law. Common law applies in Canada 
and the U.S. We also have a culture similar to that of Latin 
American nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should stop looking at the negative side and view in a 
positive light all the jobs that can be created and the 
improvement to the quality of life that can be made throughout 
the Americas. That is what the free trade area of the Americas 
is all about.

hon. member talked about civil rights.  Coincidentally I was just 
reading a copy of a letter sent to the Prime Minister expressing 
concern about why the disturbances occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw what happened in British Columbia some time ago with the 
pepper spray incident.  We saw what happened in Quebec City. 
Forgetting about trade and what the police did, because they did 
what they needed to do, the question is:  Why did it happen?  Why 
must our leaders fence themselves away from the people?  What is 
wrong?  Where is the leadership that the Prime Minister has not 
shown? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I want to congratulate 
the Prime Minister for the tremendous work he has done and for a 
wonderful summit that brought everyone closer together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned the protests. Yes, there was a huge protest 
with 25,000 to 30,000 people walking peacefully from one end of 
Quebec City to the other in order to peacefully get their point 
across. We are open to such peaceful suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we draw the line at violence. Everyone agrees with that. 
Canadians do not tolerate violence. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we routinely hear calls from 
the left in Canada denouncing NAFTA's chapter 11, the World Trade 
Organization and free trade in general.  Unfortunately their 
pedestrian understanding of trade matters undermines the rights 
of union workers whose interests they claim to represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the NDP view prevailed during the FTA debate in 1988, auto 
workers would have been in deep trouble when the WTO struck down 
the longstanding Canada-U.S. auto pact.  That decision alone 
could have wiped out union jobs in towns like Windsor, Oakville, 
Oshawa and Sainte-Therese. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the FTA agreement, an agreement the left so strongly 
denounces, protected those jobs and established free market rules 
that allowed auto exports to the U.S. to grow by 15%.  That has 
increased the opportunities, wealth and living standards of 
thousands of Canadian auto workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of the radical left in Canada want to be taken 
seriously and not labelled hypocrites, they should adopt the same 
standards of openness, democracy and transparency they demand 
from others.  If they want open door free-for-alls when Canada 
negotiates bilateral or multilateral trade deals they should be 
willing to live by the same standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact they should lead by example.  They should demonstrate to 
Canadians how their nirvana of openness would work in practice. 
They should open up all future union-management contract 
negotiations to public scrutiny.  They should answer questions 
from citizens who are concerned about the impact of proposed 
labour deals on the environment, culture, the economy and society 
at large.  They should discuss the impact of such deals on the 
cost of labour, on post-secondary education and on the way we all 
feel about one another.  The media would of course be invited to 
these free-for-alls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately no serious economist, social scientist, commentator 
or politician believes such a system could work.  More important, 
no serious unionists or business leaders would impose such a 
regime of unreasonable checks on their own behaviour.  They 
understand that there is a place for consultation and closed door 
negotiations and then a place for the rank and file to vote on a 
final agreement.  That is the approach that the Canadian Alliance 
and I support, and that is exactly what needs to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear that the fourth party is opposed to the investor 
state provisions in NAFTA's chapter 11, I cannot help but wonder 
what they stand for and, more important, where they have been for 
the past few years.  Consider the following paragraph: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The investor affected shall have a right, under the law of the 
Contracting Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by 
a judicial or other independent authority of that Party, of its 
case and of the valuation of its investment or returns in 
accordance with the principles set out in this Article. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The text I just read is not from NAFTA's chapter 11.  It is 
article 8, paragraph 2 of the Canada-Egypt foreign investment 
protection agreement.  It is also article 8, paragraph 2 of the 
Canada-Philippines foreign investment protection agreement and 
article 8, paragraph 2 of the Canada-Venezuela foreign investment 
protection Agreement. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could also have been taken from similar foreign investment 
protection agreements, or FIPAs, that Canada is negotiating with 
a growing list of countries from Armenia to Uruguay.  It could 
just as easily have been taken from article 8, paragraph 2 of the 
Canada-Croatia foreign investment protection agreement.  That 
agreement went into effect on January 30 of this year and the NDP 
does not even appear to have noticed.  It is still fighting 
battles from 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP seems unconcerned that all these agreements have clauses 
allowing investors to submit disputes with signatory states to 
arbitration by the International Centre for the Settlement of 
Investment Disputes, an international ad hoc arbitration tribunal 
established under the United Nations Commission on International 
Trade Law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that again.  A foreign investment protection 
agreement with Croatia, which features investor state provisions 
virtually identical to NAFTA's chapter 11, went into effect on 
January 30 of this year and the far left has said nothing.  It 
seems the radical left follows trade issues about as carefully as 
New Zealanders follow hockey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used to play hockey.  If I am in a bar and people with a New 
Zealand accent tell me it is great that the Canadian team scored 
three touchdowns against Italy at the world hockey championships, 
I will thank them for their support but will likely not take 
their advice on next year's hockey pool.  So it is with the 
fourth party in the House when it comes to trade policy.  Its 
members seem to know as much about world trade as I do about 
yodelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP's principal argument against chapter 11 is that it 
limits the government's ability to protect our environment and 
sovereignty in the same way that the charter of rights initially 
compelled Canadian police forces to adapt to the country's newly 
enshrined citizens rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's international trade agreements will require governments 
to think smarter and more consistently in making public policy 
decisions.  Chapter 11 of NAFTA is based on five basic 
principles.  The first is transparency.  Investors have a right 
to know what the law is and governments cannot capriciously 
change rules midstream. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is national treatment.  We must treat investors from 
other countries the same way we treat Canadian investors, 
provided they do the same for us.  In other words, we cannot stop 
Wal-Mart from building a big box store unless we are prepared to 
apply the same rules to Zellers, Canadian Tire or Rona. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third is protection of investors.  We cannot take property 
without offering compensation, and a property owner has the right 
to ask an independent body to determine if the compensation is 
fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth is quick and fair settlement of disputes.  Parties 
should get a quick and impartial decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth is reciprocity.  Canadian companies doing business 
abroad should be treated the same way we treat foreign companies 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People may why ask they did not hear about investor state rights 
until recently.  It is likely because the five principles I just 
listed are so basic to Canada and to our major trading partners 
that there was never any need to write them down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should come as no surprise that we are not negotiating 
foreign investment protection agreements with the United Kingdom, 
Switzerland, Taiwan or Australia.  Those countries have long 
respected the five principles and thus there is no need for a 
formal agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every case in which we have included NAFTA chapter 11 type 
language has extended Canada's notion of an independent judiciary 
to less progressive states in regions like eastern Europe and 
Latin America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most lawyers will say that for foreign companies doing business 
in Canada NAFTA chapter 11 changes almost nothing.  The left 
jumps up and down hysterically about the Ethyl Corporation case 
yet fails to point out that Canada's supreme court would probably 
have reached the same decision regardless of chapter 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider point 13 from the Ethyl Corporation's statement 
of claim.  The MMT act does not prohibit the manufacture or use 
of MMT in Canada.  It merely requires that all MMT sold in 
Canadian unleaded gasoline is 100% Canadian.  A domestic 
manufacturer of MMT can manufacture and distribute MMT for use in 
unleaded gasoline entirely within a province and not violate the 
MMT act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Ethyl Corporation wanted to maintain its presence in the 
Canadian octane enhancement market it would be required to build 
an MMT manufacturing, blending and storage facility in each 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The left would have us believe that the Ethyl case proves that 
chapter 11 prevents us from protecting the environment.  That is 
not so.  If the federal government had banned outright the use of 
MMT in Canada, regardless of where it was made, the Ethyl 
Corporation would not have been able to use the discrimination 
clause which was so central to its case.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think about this.  Let us suppose the city of Ottawa 
decided that pizza contained a cancer causing ingredient and then 
used those health concerns to support a law prohibiting anyone 
from bringing pizza to Ottawa from Hull.  If the city of Ottawa 
did not force its own pizza restaurants and vendors to close, the 
supreme court would probably find discrimination and force it to 
back down, repeal the law, award compensation and find another 
mechanism for banning the dangerous food.  However it would not 
deny it the capacity to ban what is dangerous.  It is the same 
with MMT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NAFTA chapter 11 is nothing more or less than what has been the 
status quo in Canada since we adopted the British legal system 
before Confederation.  By putting such language into NAFTA and 
into foreign investment protection agreements, we are simply 
asking other countries to give our companies and investors the 
same respect we have long given companies and investors, both 
Canadian and foreign, here in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I commend my 
colleague opposite from the Alliance Party for his very cogent 
comments.  It is pleasing to hear some rational discussion, 
having had quite a bit of hyperbole and rhetoric from the far 
left earlier in the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  What is your business?  What is your 
corporation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  I have two questions for my colleague. 
As he and I recall, and as the NDP member who is hollering will 
recall, the FTAA was not an election issue at all.  It had been 
negotiated for many months.  When the election campaign was 
underway it was well known that Canada was involved in the 
discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the hon. member's leader and party fail to realize it at 
the time?  Why are they only now jumping up and down and getting 
excited?  Were they asleep at the switch?  Did they not realize 
at that time that it was an important matter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am reluctant to judge 
people's motives but they do seem suspect.  If one feels 
passionately about an issue then one has a responsibility to 
bring it to the fore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the members of the fourth party we have heard here today 
have talked about the issue at the constituency level.  The 
leader of the NDP did not bring it up in the leaders' debate.  It 
was not raised in my constituency because the NDP in British 
Columbia are free traders.  If federal NDP candidates in British 
Columbia stood and said that they were opposed to free trade, 
they would be contradicting 85% of their base supporters who put 
up lawn signs, raise money and so on.  Perhaps that answers part 
of the member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is suspect that they feel passionately about the 
issue but did not raise it.  They say the issue is central to the 
essence of what it is to be Canadian and will have a profound 
impact on our sovereignty.  They knew the issue was coming down 
the pike and yet they said nothing.  The member opposite has a 
point.  Why did they not raise the issue?  That is a good 
question.  Perhaps we will hear an answer from members of the 
fourth party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the member from the Alliance and I will put to him 
the comment made by Clayton Yeutter who was the U.S. trade 
representative when the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement was 
signed.  A few days after it was signed he was quoted as saying 
that the U.S. had signed an amazing agreement with Canada and 
that Canada did not understand what it had signed.  He also said 
that in 20 years Canada would be sucked entirely into the U.S. 
economy.  That was 13 years ago.  We have seven to go.   Would 
the hon. member care to comment on Mr. Yeutter's statement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have heard those 
predictions for centuries.  Mr. Yeutter is probably not laughing 
today, 13 years later.  Canada has an enormous trade surplus with 
the United States.  I do not think he would be laughing about 
that now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest, frankly, that when members of the fourth party want 
credibility on the subject they regurgitate quotes that are a 
little younger than 13 years old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Soon you will not even be a party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore:</B>  The member for Burnaby—Douglas is 
heckling and that is fine.  I will never forget the hon. member 
for Burnaby—Douglas at the battle in Seattle.  Some of the 
protestors there had about as much credibility as a 13 year old 
quote.

I will resist the temptation to respond to that learned diatribe

for the edification of the House, if the hon. member could 
indicate who the official spokesperson is on international trade

Saanich—Gulf Islands.  Who is it today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this speaks precisely to 
the comment I made earlier.  If this is an issue of national 
sovereignty, if the member wants to debate the issue, and if the 
member wants to talk about the impact of NAFTA's chapter 11, why 
is he asking us who our trade critic is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a whole list of speakers.  The member for Lethbridge 
has spoken.  The member for Kootenay—Columbia, with whom I am 
sharing my time, will be speaking in a minute as well.  We have

free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the member for Burnaby—Douglas that he ought to 
have his platform thoroughly ironed out with his provincial party

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a couple of minutes to talk 
about a related issue.  I will be speaking specifically to the 
NDP motion in just a second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to clarify something, because I have had this question 
asked of myself having been the chief critic for the Reform Party 
and now the Canadian Alliance.  It is the issue of the 
truthfulness of the Prime Minister's Office with respect to his 
involvement at APEC and the APEC pepper spray events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to clarify and to be very precise.  The protection 
provided by the police forces for international persons who were 
in Quebec City, as they did at APEC and as they did at every 
other event in Canada, was excellent.  There have been some 
events where they have gone over the top, but when one is in a 
riot situation there will be situations where people will go over 
the top. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My position and the position of our party with respect to APEC 
is that the riot and the pepper spraying that went on there had 
nothing to do with the actions of the police.  That will be 
something that the public complaints commission will decide under 
the leadership of the public complaints commissioner.  It had 
everything to do with whether the Prime Minister's Office was 
forthcoming about whether the Prime Minister was actually 
involved in the event.  That is an important distinction to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to use two examples to speak specifically to the 
NDP motion.  I would like to use two examples of how chapter 11 
is supposed to work and why it is there.  They are pure 
fabrications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia we have a very large multinational 
corporation from New Zealand that has a stake in our forest 
industry.  We also have, as a result of the low exchange rate the 
government constantly gives us, a major B.C. corporation which 
has been taken over by a U.S. concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These companies enter Canada with funding operations and 
capital.  Do they have the right as foreign owners to anticipate, 
given the rules with respect to logging and forestry practices 
and all of the other things that surround the rules and 
regulations, they would be treated in exactly the same way as a 
Canadian based corporation would be treated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have Canadian workers working for Weyerhaeuser Canada Ltd. 
and Fletcher Challenge.  Should those workers and corporations be 
treated any differently than the workers working for West Fraser, 
Interfor or Canfor?

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The names I am bandying around are to show that within the 
forest industry in British Columbia there is a potpourri of 
ownership.  I submit that any domestic or foreign corporation 
investing in the forest industry in British Columbia should 
anticipate that the rules and regulations of the B.C. forest 
practices code will be applied equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes no difference which corporation by virtue of its 
ownership is doing it.  It makes a big difference to the workers 
within the forest industry, which is so important to British 
Columbia.  It is equally important to the workers in every other 
industry in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go to the other extreme.  We should expect in return what 
we give.  I assume that under the FTAA there is an article 11 
type of mechanism included.  What difference would that make for 
the people who are in the mining industry in my constituency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituency happens to produce the majority of the 
metallurgical coal for export from Canada.  There are about 
12,000 people directly impacted by coal production in my 
constituency.  There is also at the tag end of its life what was 
the largest lead-zinc deposit in the entire Commonwealth in 
Kimberley and under Cominco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we want to see a chapter 11 on behalf of people 
working in the mining industry in my constituency? If Teck, 
Cominco, Canadian Pacific or any of the Canadian based 
corporations were to go with their mining expertise to Chile, 
Ecuador, Peru or Argentina, I would assume that having explored 
and having found an ore deposit the corporation would go into 
production.  It would then end up putting a quarter of a billion, 
a half a billion or perhaps a billion dollars into the 
infrastructure required to actually work the ore deposit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us assume that we do not have an article 11 in the FTAA and 
one of these nations very flippantly decides to bring in some 
special regulations against the Canadian based company.  Suddenly 
this quarter billion, half billion or billion dollar investment 
by the Canadian corporation is standing in a very cold draft 
because one of these countries decided to pay special attention 
to the Canadian company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporations must have the ability to protect themselves against 
capricious acts on the part of foreign governments.  This is not 
to impute any ill will.  It is simply to give some feeling of 
security when corporations invest funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will extend that further.  What does it mean to the workers at 
the mines in my constituency?  In this fabricated case I will 
assume that the full billion dollars invested in Chile, Ecuador, 
Peru or Argentina was suddenly at risk.  By putting the billion 
dollars invested in that ore deposit at risk, suddenly the cash 
flow of the multinational Canadian company is in jeopardy.  It is 
in peril. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would the company do?  The company may very well have to 
pull back on its operations in Sparwood, Fernie, Elkford or any 
other place in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is true of any corporation where we are talking about the 
free flow of capital around the world, of Canadian corporations 
having the opportunity to be able to invest as they see fit and 
of growing their businesses as they see fit.  Corporations want 
to know that their money will not be in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the NDP are always talking about the worker.  I agree 
that the working people in Canada are exceptionally important. 
These people would be protected by virtue of the fact that their 
employers, by virtue of chapter 11, would have more surety 
knowing what would be happening within their domain of commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only logical and reasonable that when money is to be 
invested, whether it is people coming into Canada with money or 
Canadian money going out of Canada to invest for the betterment 
of the Canadian company, those corporations would know what are 
the rules and that the foreign governments would not be able to 
act in a capricious way against them.  That is all chapter 11 is 
about.

not more prepared to work for some surety for the working people 
of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to rise 
today to speak to the NDP motion concerning chapter 11.  I do so 
as the former chair of the subcommittee on international trade, 
trade disputes and investment in the last session of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The general purpose of chapter 11 of NAFTA is to protect foreign 
investors and foreign investment from trade distorting 
discriminatory treatment.  This general purpose would protect 
Canadian investors and Canadian investment in the United States 
and Mexico and would help to create jobs, prosperity and wealth 
for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protection for the ability of Canadians to trade is very 
important to Canada's prosperity.  Exports of Canadian goods and 
services account for more than 45% of Canada's gross domestic 
product.  Canada's economic success depends on open markets, a 
stable trading environment and a rules based system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investment is also very important to Canada.  Since 1993 direct 
investment in Canada has more than doubled.  This inward 
investment helps build a knowledge economy to prepare Canada to 
compete confidently on a global stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year we attracted a record $93.2 billion in new foreign 
direct investment.  In 2000 our inward investment reached $291 
billion.  At the same time Canadian investment abroad grew from 
$98 billion in 1990 to $301 billion in 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadian companies look abroad for new opportunities they 
often invest to gain a foothold in foreign markets.  In the year 
2000 Canadians invested nearly $62 billion to expand our global 
presence abroad—

International Workers Day, I wish to stress the generous 
contribution of workers to the promotion of their rights and 
working conditions in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like them, I feel that labour laws must help in the fight 
against social injustice. However, that view is not shared by 
the Liberal government which, during the review of Part II of 
the Canada Labour Code, refused to include measures allowing for 
the preventative withdrawal of pregnant or nursing female 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why, this morning, I tabled in the House a bill to allow 
pregnant or nursing female workers to avail themselves of the 
Quebec legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will eliminate the disparities between the Quebec and 
Canadian legislation in that regard and ensure adequate 
protection for pregnant or nursing women by using the Quebec 
preventative withdrawal model.

Quebecois contributes to workers' social progress and

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the vital importance and 
significant contribution of Canada's nurses, who number in the 
tens of thousands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These professionals are on the frontlines of our health care 
system and are called upon to provide medical assistance, care 
and comfort to our most vulnerable:  children, the elderly and 
the terminally ill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad reality for nurses in Canada is low wages, a lack of 
financial assistance and an aging workforce, as well as demanding 
physical requirements, resulting in an exodus from the profession 
and out of Canada as they pursue their careers in other 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Federation of Nurses' Unions and its president, 
Kathleen Connors, are calling upon the government to address 
these dire circumstances, specifically the need for whistleblower 
protection and financial assistance, perhaps through the EI 
program, to assist nurses nationally.  Nova Scotia president 
Heather Henderson is working on behalf of nurses to address the 
growing crisis at hospitals and clinics throughout the province, 
including at St. Martha's, the Aberdeen and Sutherland Harris in 
my riding of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.

possibility.  Yet natural disasters like floods, tornados, 
technological or environmental accidents such as chemical spills 
or disruptions to power and telecommunication services can strike 
anywhere and at any time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Government of Canada through the office of 
critical infrastructure protection and emergency preparedness 
works in co-operation with other government departments, 
provincial and territorial governments, the private sector and 
non-governmental partners to promote the first full week of May 
as Emergency Preparedness Week in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theme for this year's Emergency Preparedness Week is 
“Reducing the Risk: Toward Safer Communities in the 21st 
Century”. In marking this special week from May 7 to May 13 
emergency preparedness partners throughout Canada have organized 
a wide range of activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being prepared starts with each and every one of us.  I

of neglecting Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just found out today that Canada's physicians will now

Canadians are justly proud of the quality of Health Canada's work

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also clear that there is always room to improve.  Last 
week a jury came back in an inquest in Toronto involving the

improve its surveillance of pharmaceutical drugs in the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the jury in the Vanessa Young case heard the long chronology of 
events.  It heard that as long ago as 1995 and 1996 Health Canada 
was taking out pages in the <I>Canadian Medical Association 
Journal</I> to report on reactions in relation to the drug 
Prepulsid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put aside the arguments and get to the bottom line.  The 
bottom line is the health and safety of Canadians.  We welcome 
the CMA approach.  We will look at it for our own website.

of having to say “Sorry, we were asleep at the switch but we 
will get on with it now”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly innocent Canadians like 15 year old Vanessa Young too 
often pay a terrible price for the fact that the government is 
behind the competence curve.  I ask the health minister again to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was in the process of saying that the <I>Canadian Medical 
Association Journal</I> said that the first drug in relation to 
which it would put information on its website is a drug that last 
week the FDA issued a note on in terms of adverse drug reactions. 
It so happens that last week so did Health Canada.  We acted the 
same week as the FDA in relation to that drug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that by whatever means it is important to get this 
information out to physicians and patients.  Health Canada has 
accepted all the recommendations of the jury.  We are committed 
to doing the job well.

<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I forgot when I was 
speaking before question period to say that I would be splitting 
my time.  As I said earlier, I am here to speak to the NDP motion and 
its concerns regarding chapter 11.  I started to talk about how 
important investments were for Canada and for individual 
Canadians and corporations that do business abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most significant features of Canada's recent economic 
history has been the rapid growth of Canadian investment abroad. 
Since 1996 Canada has become a net exporter of capital.  With the 
free trade of the Americas agreement so prominently in the minds 
of Canadians, it is important to remember that Canada continues 
to be a major investor in South America, particularly in the 
telecommunications and natural resource sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investments abroad create opportunities for Canadians by giving 
our firms new markets to expand their businesses through exports 
and through local sales.  Often securing new customers and making 
sales in new markets requires investments in local services, 
customer support, assembly and distribution channels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important thing we must remember is that when Canadians 
invest abroad they bring our values together with increased 
exports of goods and services.  It adds up to jobs and 
opportunities for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, chapter 11 of NAFTA deals with foreign 
investment.  Section A of chapter 11 deals with the definition 
and the treatment to be accorded within the North American free 
trade zone, and section B of chapter 11 deals with the settlement 
of disputes concerning investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main forms of treatment of foreign investment dealt with in 
chapter 11 are national treatment and most favoured nations 
treatment.  This is what is applicable to foreign investment. 
Under national treatment NAFTA countries are generally obligated 
to accord to investors and investments from another NAFTA country 
treatment no less favourable than the treatment accorded to 
domestic investors and investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to most favoured nations treatment, NAFTA countries 
are generally obligated to accord to investors and investments 
from another NAFTA country treatment no less favourable than the 
treatment accorded to investors and investments from any other 
country, be it NAFTA or non-NAFTA countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 11 restricts the ability of NAFTA countries to impose 
certain performance requirements on the investors and investments 
from other NAFTA countries such as a requirement to export a 
certain level or percentage of goods or services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally these so-called performance requirements do not 
restrict the ability of a NAFTA country to condition what is 
called an advantage to be conferred upon a foreign investor or 
investment upon compliance with a requirement to locate 
production, provide a service, train or employ workers, construct 
or expand facilities, or carry out research and development in 
its territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a minimum, NAFTA countries are required to treat foreign 
investors and investments from other NAFTA countries in a manner 
consistent with international law.  This point is very important 
and I hope that my NDP colleagues are listening.  There are a 
number of exceptions and reservations to the general 
non-discrimination obligations I have outlined.  Aside from the 
general exceptions which are contained in NAFTA, reservations are 
set out in the country schedules to annexes I, II, and III of 
NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These reservations are generally either bound or unbound 
reservations. 
A bound reservation means that a NAFTA country may maintain a 
non-conforming measure identified in the appropriate schedule and 
may amend that non-conforming measure, provided that the 
amendment does not make the measure more trade distorting.  An 
unbound reservation allows a NAFTA country to maintain an 
existing non-conforming use to make the measure even more trade 
distorting or to create new non-conforming measures in relation 
to certain broad areas or sectors.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the case of Canada certain unbound reservations 
exist in relation to aboriginal affairs, communications, 
transportation and social services.  The latter reservation 
includes income security, social security, social welfare, public 
education, public training, health and child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically under bilateral conventions to promote and protect 
investment possible disputes about the application of these 
conventions were settled between the governments concerned. 
Chapter 11 of NAFTA improves bilateral conventions to promote and 
protect foreign investment mainly by making it possible for a 
private party to challenge a disputed measure directly with a 
foreign government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Expropriation is the main subject of disputes concerning foreign 
investment.  An expropriated private party claiming that a 
government may not expropriate or has not respected the 
applicable rules in expropriating may challenge the measure under 
the dispute settlement mechanisms contained in part B of chapter 
11 of NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that the dispute settlement 
mechanism also proceeds at stages.  An investor claiming that a 
foreign government has breached its obligations may submit its 
claim to arbitration if it incurs a loss or damage as a result of 
the breach of obligation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parties to the dispute must consult with each other in an 
effort to settle the dispute.  If the dispute cannot be settled 
an investor wishing to pursue a claim must send a written notice 
of claim and of intent to submit the claim for arbitration. 
However the investor may not submit the claim to arbitration 
until 90 days after the notice of submission of the claim to 
arbitration has been sent.  Nor may a claim be submitted to 
arbitration until at least six months have elapsed since the 
events giving rise to the claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A limitation period may apply to the submission of a claim if 
more than three years have elapsed between the date the investor 
knew or should have known of the breach by the foreign government 
and the date the claim is being submitted to arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arbitration concerning investment is done before a tribunal 
composed under one of the three conventions listed in article 
1120 of NAFTA, the existing international rules.  There are also 
prerequisites for arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before a dispute concerning investment may be submitted to 
arbitration, the investor must consent to arbitration and waive 
the right to any other proceeding of any party under the law. The 
parties to the arbitration must agree to the rules and procedures 
governing the arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the greatest area of the investment chapter that is of 
concern to the government is the investment expropriation 
provisions.  In that regard the chapter includes specific 
commitments of fair treatment in the event of expropriation of an 
investment by a NAFTA country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Expropriation of an investment can only occur for a public 
purpose, on a non-discriminatory basis, in accord with due 
process of law and on the payment of compensation to the foreign 
investor.  Perhaps the concern with the expropriation provision 
of most people is that the definition of expropriation act 
includes the words tantamount to expropriation.  This broad 
language could possibly extend beyond what governments would 
normally consider to be expropriation to possibly include 
regulations or measures that significant impair or nullify 
benefits to NAFTA investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it is always possible to improve the dispute 
settlement process under all our trade agreements.  Yes, there 
have been disputes and yes, there will continue to be disputes. 
The disputes that actually reach the arbitration process are 
rare.  It should not be forgotten that Canada has greatly 
benefited from the system to date.  Any future negotiations 
should be conducted with this record firmly in mind.

Speaker, I saw my friend across the way point to our NDP 
colleagues and ask them to listen, but I can assure her that I 
was listening to the good points she made.  My colleagues on the 
other side are good friends of mine but they do have selective 
hearing.  They only want to hear what they want to hear on 
chapter 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the member would like to comment on what the minister 
and the Prime Minister said about chapter 11.  I know the 
minister very well and I know his own gut feeling is that the 
provision is needed and is appropriate to protect investments 
going out.  I am sure the member agrees with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member think that perhaps the statement was a slight 
misunderstanding or misstep by the minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking 
my colleague from the Alliance across the way for listening to 
what I had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion talks about completely throwing out chapter 11. 
Neither the minister nor the Prime Minister ever said that. 
Therefore, first and foremost, there is no inconsistency between 
the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have tried to do in my presentation is talk about chapter 
11.  Chapter 11 is composed of many things.  It is composed of 
schedule A, which talks about national treatment and most 
favoured nations treatment.  Schedule B talks about the dispute 
settlement system.  There is a long process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, what I think is very important for all Canadians to 
remember, and what we have not been hearing, are the annexes and 
schedules that talk about restrictions, exceptions, the unbound 
exemptions and the bound exemptions.  Under no circumstances does 
chapter 11 throw out the ability to ensure public education in 
our country.  Under no circumstances does chapter 11 stop us in 
any way from legislating on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the general exceptions under NAFTA, we can look 
at the exceptions in culture, but we do need to do more, which is 
what I said about our trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of trade agreements goes back to 1947 and the GATT 
when the first dispute settlement process was actually put into 
place.  We have built on that process, starting with the free 
trade agreement and then with NAFTA.  We have Chile and Canada, 
Israel and Canada and, most recently, and we should be very 
proud, we also have a Canada and Costa Rica agreement that puts 
us in the centre of Central America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are always looking to build on agreements.  If we look at the 
history, from the GATT to where we are today, there are some 
concerns.  If we need to work with a few words that does not mean 
we throw out entire sections or chapters.  The fact is that NAFTA 
has been good for Canadians.  It brings wealth.  We as a 
government have a role on all sides to ensure that wealth is 
properly distributed to all of our citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member paints a glowing picture of the triumph of 
chapter 11 but she may not be aware of the fact that the 
International Institute for Sustainable Development just released 
a very damning report on the impact of chapter 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Howard Mann said that the current interpretations of 
NAFTA's chapter 11 could have a significant and determinative 
negative impact on government decision making in relation to the 
public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They already have.  The study points out that chapter 11 has 
been used to challenge the only two major federal environmental 
laws that have been passed since NAFTA came into force in 1994. 
One of those laws subsequently was repealed and compensation was 
paid.  That was in the case of the Ethyl Corporation and MMT.  In 
the second case, the S.D. Myers case, the damages award was 
pending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member.  If chapter 11 investor 
state provisions are working so well, why is it that the 
International Institute for Sustainable Development and others 
are telling us not to duplicate them in the FTAA? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying 
that I value the opinions of Professor Howard Mann.  He is an 
extremely brilliant individual who has worked with our committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I wish, once and for all, we would tell 
Canadians the truth about the Ethyl Corporation case and how it 
arose.  It arose as a result of a challenge by the Alberta 
government that dealt with the interprovincial restriction on 
trade.  It was only when that interprovincial matter was ruled 
upon in favour of Alberta that we chose to settle before the 
matter ever reached arbitration.  This is not a case where the 
arbitration panel found against it.  It was settled before it 
ever reached arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the number of arbitration cases we see only 
three cases.  Last week we won another case, the Pope & Talbot 
case, which was the only pending case after the NAFTA five year 
review was disclosed.

<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to rise today in this House to take 
part in this third opposition motion on matters of international 
trade in as many weeks.  Obviously, matters of international 
trade interest our parliamentarians and all Canadians, and that 
makes me happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Free trade and NAFTA have been beneficial for Canadians, that is 
clear. Since NAFTA came into effect, trade, investment and jobs 
have grown spectacularly in Canada and in all countries in North 
America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, at the Quebec City summit, the 34 countries of the 
Americas, the representatives of small and large countries, the 
heads of the most developed and of developing countries and those 
representing countries whose economies are especially vulnerable 
expressed their interest in and desire to establish a free trade 
area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of these 34 countries are headed by socialist leaders. 
Others are headed by centrist leaders and others by conservative 
leaders.  Yet there was unanimity.  They all wanted free trade in 
the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must indeed be something good about this project if all 
countries, large and small, developed and less developed, and 
all leaders, socialists, conservatives and centrists alike, want 
free trade. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All 34 countries want in, whether they come from smaller or 
bigger countries, whether they come from the most vulnerable 
economies to the largest and stronger economies of our 
hemisphere.  That says a great deal about the importance of 
international trade.  It says that international free trade leads 
to development and to democracy.  The vast majority of Canadians 
and the vast majority of citizens across the Americas understand 
that very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad that the opposition today on this particular 
motion does not want to understand what even most socialist 
leaders believe.  Even labour leader Tony Blair said not too long 
ago in this House that free trade was for the poor.  Only one 
party here does not seem to understand that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A clear set of rules applicable to the conduct of international 
affairs constitutes one of the key reasons for NAFTA's success. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules applicable to trade and investment form a road map or 
navigation system, which guides and protects the flow of trade 
and investment capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being a country more oriented towards investment and 
international trade than any of its competitors, Canada has an 
interest in maintaining the vigour of this bilateral flow of 
trade and foreign investment.  Foreign investment helps to 
guarantee that Canadian businesses will have the capital they 
need to succeed and grow in the highly competitive world 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investment creates jobs and encourages innovation through the 
contribution of new ideas and new technologies to our 
businesses.  It gives Canadians access to the capital and skills 
which will strengthen our country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian investment abroad is equally important as this helps 
Canadian firms establish a presence in foreign markets and share 
Canadian expertise through exporting goods and services to those 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be further noted that a large proportion of profits 
from new investments is reinvested in Canada contributing to a 
higher growth rate and a rise in Canadian living standards. There 
is no doubt today that foreign direct investment in Canada and 
Canadian investment abroad have joined the international trade in 
goods and services to become our principal engines of growth and 
job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Direct investment abroad by Canadian business is part of its 
strategic effort to increase market share and stay competitive in 
foreign markets.  Companies are increasingly using outward 
investment to strengthen their operations, penetrate new markets 
and acquire new technologies, resources and skills.  The value of 
Canadian direct investment abroad has increased fivefold between 
1985 and 2000, that is from $57 billion to $301 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1995 the stock of direct investment abroad by Canadians 
has exceeded the stock of foreign investment in Canada.  This 
reflects the maturity and wealth of the Canadian economy.  This 
type of investment results in increased sales and production from 
home facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent study by the OECD found that on average every one 
dollar of investment is followed by two dollars of export.  It 
adds up altogether to jobs and opportunities for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also seen that income from Canada's outward foreign 
direct investments increased during recent years helping to 
improve our standard of living. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than ever, it is important for Canada to try to seek a 
fair, open and secure environment for international investment, 
both in Canada and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The part of the North American Free Trade Agreement dealing with 
investment, better known as chapter 11, guarantees investors 
fair treatment in accordance with international law. This 
chapter and especially the investor-state provision are a 
fundamental component of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point out that the benefits Canada has gained 
from investment have not jeopardized our main economic and 
social values. Foreign investment in Canada is subject to the 
same legislation and regulations as Canadian investment, 
including those protecting the environment and ensuring higher 
labour, health, construction and safety standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one compares the number of challenges under chapter 11 of 
NAFTA and the amount of the claims to the two-way trade daily of 
$1.9 billion between the United States and Mexico, one quickly 
realizes that the number of challenges these last few years has 
been minimal compared to the overall trade and investment 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, the overall investments of our NAFTA partners in 
Canada reached $186 billion. All in all, we were able to attract, 
last year, a record high of $93.2 billion in new foreign direct 
investments.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, from this important growing source of investment, and 
despite thousands of new laws and regulations passed by each 
level of government in Canada since 1993, the Government of 
Canada is facing only five challenges under chapter 11 of NAFTA 
that are currently under arbitration. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada believes that NAFTA, including chapter 
11, works well, and we are not seeking to re-open the agreement. 
As the Prime Minister has noted in the House, there are many 
thousands of investments among NAFTA partners and thousands of 
measures are taken by governments that can affect investments: 
laws, regulations and programs of all sorts and at all levels of 
government.  However, of all these investments and government 
measures, only five have resulted in complaints against Canada 
under chapter 11 of NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have noted in the House, the Government of Canada does 
want to clarify the provisions in chapter 11, which would give 
future tribunals clearer and more specific understanding of the 
obligations of chapter 11 as originally intended by the drafters. 
There are mechanisms built into NAFTA to allow for this type of 
clarification. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more important is the fact that we want the investor-state 
dispute settlement mechanism to be more open and more 
transparent so it is more effective. In fact, Canada has already 
taken measures to make this process more transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foreign affairs department's website contains all publicly 
available documents relating to chapter 11 arbitration cases 
involving the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to make all the documents public, within certain 
limitations, obviously, to protect confidential trade 
information. We would also like to open hearings to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will stop here to allow for a brief exchange with opposition 
members. But that is our government's position, its true 
position, not based on a short sentence taken here or there, but 
based on its true intention with regard to NAFTA's great 
success.

<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon. minister for the depth 
of his understanding of the problem.  The only scary part of it 
is that I found myself agreeing with almost everything he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one point I do want to raise.  I would like to ask the 
hon. minister if he would clarify for us whether indeed it is 
true that perhaps some of the fiscal policy of the government has 
indeed resulted in a net increase over and above the investment 
that foreigners direct into Canada.  Has foreign direct 
investment to Canada been exceeded by the direct investment in 
other countries by Canadian firms?  There has been a shift and 
there is a negative balance there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all very well to speak about how wonderful it is that 
people have invested in Canada.  I think he made the statement 
that this reflects the maturity of the Canadian economy.  I would 
like to suggest to the minister that he should clarify that, 
indeed, it is not the maturity of the Canadian economy here that 
has caused this negative balance.  In fact, the reason that 
people are investing more money outside of Canada than in Canada 
is due to the fiscal policy of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity 
to give an address to the National Press Club today at the 
luncheon, in which I revisited the extraordinary performance of 
the Canadian economy in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are presenting a report on the health of the Canadian 
economy, on the growth in our trade.  We now export 45% of what 
we produce in this country, of our GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year we received extraordinary foreign direct investment of 
$92.3 billion, so Canada is really a land that attracts a lot of 
foreign direct capital and it is extremely good for our economy. 
Indeed, Canadians are now in a position to invest abroad and that 
is very good, because if we want to export our goods, if we want 
to export our technology and if we want to export our services, 
we have to invest abroad.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when trade led the global economy, that is, 
first we traded with a foreign country and after having traded 
with it for some years we would then invest in it.  Instead of 
exporting to it we would start producing the goods in that 
country.  Trade led the economy and investment followed.  It is 
the other way around now, and it has been the other way around 
for the past 15 to 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to maintain our export level and trade development we 
have to invest abroad because now it is investment that leads the 
international economy rather than trade.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we just saw a glaring example of the reason 
why people do not trust governments and of the current 
government's lack of transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister mentioned the website. The website says: “Canada is 
not advocating the replication of NAFTA investor-state rules in 
the FTAA”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 13, the minister himself said that he would not sign 
an agreement if it included a chapter 11 equivalent. He said: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“That is my position.  I am very preoccupied with this”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, in a way that is absolutely extraordinary but that will 
fool no one, they have decided to do a complete about-face and to 
change their position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister not realize that, with this attitude, he is 
justifying the position of those asking that negotiations be 
done in a more transparent fashion? If the minister is able to 
change his position like this at a time when negotiations are 
not yet in full gear, we can imagine how it will be when we are 
seriously negotiating these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister explain to us this complete about-face? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say that the Minister 
for International Trade, which I have been for the past year, 
has fought for transparency throughout the Americas.  We were 
successful in Buenos Aires in gaining the consent of all 
countries to make the draft free trade agreement public.  Canada 
directed an effort of remarkable transparency, a successful 
effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need any sermons from the Bloc Quebecois member who 
always resorts to personal insult, to making accusations of flip 
flops and of lack of transparency, to laying all the blame on 
us.  This is a deplorable way of focussing on the remarkable 
efforts being made by our government and our international trade 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My position on chapter 11 is unchanged and absolutely clear: 
Chapter 11 serves the interests of our investors and our 
policies well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I called for, and what our government wants, is to clarify 
within the mechanisms set out by NAFTA certain interpretations 
that have been made by the courts so that they may be taken into 
account in future.  Obviously, we will be taking into account 
the improvements I would like to see in the free trade area of 
the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête: </B>Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  The minister 
says I insulted him personally by saying that he changed his 
mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew: </B>No. He mentioned the lack of 
transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> This government could not be any more arrogant, 
and this is unacceptable.  I ask— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> Order, please. This is not 
really a point of order, it is more a question of debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with my colleague from 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to say that the charge by the Minister for 
International Trade disappoints me.  I was fairly happy with the 
work he had done on transparency, work we had strongly 
encouraged him to do, we in the Bloc Quebecois, and all the 
participants in the civil society.  I am prepared to acknowledge 
what he has done, except when he defends, as he has just done, 
his change in position on chapter 11.  That disappoints me.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let him explain it.  Let him say that the United States would 
not listen, but let him say what he himself has always said. 
What he has just said today, unfortunately, is not supported by 
the facts, and by the repeated quotes we can show him.  This 
concerns me, and I think the public too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been told several times by various sources that the 
negotiators who worked out the NAFTA agreement and the famous 
chapter 11 never thought it would be interpreted the way it has 
been by the rather special and secret courts, which evaluate 
complaints lodged under chapter 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the negotiators did not think businesses would be so low 
minded, as some colleagues would put it, as to complain, with 
the astronomical figures they put forward, because they 
negotiated in little closed private clubs.  Had they asked 
certain union people what they thought the businesses were 
capable of doing, they would have been enlightened.  They would 
have made no mistake as to the possibility of expanding these 
texts in a direction contrary to public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that, whatever the intention of those 
negotiators, now, chapter 11, with a number of cases pending—and 
we can be sure many cases will arise in the future—is tending to 
limit the ability of governments, at all levels, to make laws 
that defend public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of fairly simple cases. 
For example, Metalclad Corporation, is a waste treatment company 
from California. It settled in Mexico and asked for a federal 
permit. The problem is that while it was building its plants, 
the public was totally opposed to such activities. The governor 
of the state had no choice but to order Metalclad to shut down 
its operations. Metalclad turned around, sued under chapter 11 
and won. The whole thing cost $16 million to Mexico, which 
decided to appeal the ruling, and the appeal was heard in 
Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ruling is disturbing in a number of ways. I am mentioning 
one, but there are several. In that example, the federal 
government of Mexico had given its authorization, but the 
municipality had the authority to legislate, just like the 
state. By using its powers, the company had the right to sue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government cannot see cases that could occur here, it is 
because it definitely does not want to see the obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are now defending chapter 11 without any reservations, when 
the Minister for International Trade himself had the common 
sense to say that he would not ratify it again, in its present 
form. The minister heard many people who also displayed common 
sense, including Pierre-Marc Johnson, the former Premier of 
Quebec, who is not a hothead and who told the committee that 
Canada should not use chapter 11 again, at the risk of 
experiencing very serious environmental problems. And we know 
how concerned people are about the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is extremely disturbing is that Canada, which has held 
various positions, just boasted about signing an agreement with 
Costa Rica. In an agreement with Costa Rica, Canada is the one 
calling the shots. This is not the United States, which is a 
strong country, with Canada trying to manage. With Costa Rica, it 
is Canada that has the upper hand.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a agreement with Costa Rica, Canada is not in a weak 
position. It is not like in a agreement with the almighty United 
States, where Canada has to find a way to manage. With Costa 
Rica, Canada has the upper hand. Yet, the provision of chapter 
11 can be found in the agreement with Costa Rica. Canada's 
position boils down to what is stipulated in chapter 11 of 
NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will soon realize that opposition members are against 
this. Before going any further, we need to reconsider what we are 
about to do. Because we are about to give more power to companies 
and foreign corporations. Foreign corporations can file suits for 
discrimination, something local companies are unable to do. But 
let us not forget that, abroad, Canadian companies are foreign 
companies, and that we promote international exports not only for 
the big corporations, but also for smaller businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, important business 
people for whom exports have no secrets told us “It is not a 
market for small companies, because you stand to lose your shirt

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious issue, and I want to thank the NDP for 
raising it, as we did previously, so that we could hold this 
debate. The important thing is for parliamentarians to be able to 
express their views before the agreement is signed. It is 
crucial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to introduce a private member's bill of which I am 
very proud, which was introduced earlier by the member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry.  This bill must become law.  I am sure 
that there are government members who share our view, but whose 
hands are tied right now and who will be able to do nothing but 
talk among themselves and look sad, hoping that things are not as 
bad as some are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really being decided right now is the future, not just 
of Quebecers and Canadians, but also, and even more so, of the 
citizens of Mexico and of Central and South America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> The Americans too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde:</B> Yes, the Americans too, but they have 
more weapons, including democratic ones, to defend themselves 
than we do.  They have much more clout, as parliamentarians, than 
do Canadian parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 11 is not the only issue that concerns us.  It is one 
that, along with others, poses the problem of the need to expand 
trade.  We are all for this, but not unconditionally and not just 
for the rich and the strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It needs to be said that while free trade has produced some good 
results, it has not been good for everyone.  This is true between 
countries and within countries.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened very 
carefully to the comments of my colleague from Mercier. It was 
refreshing to hear a member of her party recognize the 
outstanding leadership of the Minister for International Trade in 
trying to bring the greatest possible transparency to the FTAA 
process.  It was largely because of the efforts of the minister 
in Buenos Aries that we had an agreement to publish the 
negotiating text. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Mercier mentioned that there was a long list 
of cases that had been arbitrated but she only mentioned one, 
Metalclad and I know about that case.  I would submit that there 
is not a long list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kept in context, I challenge the member on the number of cases. 
My information is that there are only five cases under 
arbitration involving Canada.  That is not a large number 
considering we do $1.9 billion of trade every day with the United 
States and Mexico.  I would like to have her answer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask her one final question.  Is it the position 
of the Bloc Quebecois that we do not need to protect investors in 
Canada and that we do not need to protect Canadians when they 
invest abroad?  Surely that is not the position of her party is 
it? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, while I did recognize that 
the Minister for International Trade did good work, I did not 
talk about outstanding leadership. I said that we, as well as 
civil society, had to push him a lot. But I want to recognize 
that he did something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I take this opportunity to say that we still do not 
have the texts. I was at the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade when the sherpa, Mr. Lortie, came 
today with Mr. Carrière, the chief negotiator. We asked them 
where the texts were and how come they had not brought them 
along. They are still waiting for one of them to be translated. 
Concerning transparency, they made an effort, but we have yet to 
see the result. We have seen nothing so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the number of cases, I will tell my colleague that there 
are problems with this agreement because everything is secret. If 
he did any research, he should know that, if he speaks to certain 
groups, they will tell him that they know there are many cases 
because everything is secret. It is a horrible part of the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number given to me was 17, but it is just a start. With the 
decisions that were handed in, there will be more and more of 
these cases to scare all levels of government. Governments in 
poor or developing countries are much more vulnerable to these 
threats. That is what we have to act on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister for International Trade indicated that there had been 
great transparency.  That has not been the case.  He flip-flopped 
over whether or not Canada would go in there with a proposition 
of an investor state trade rule in chapter 11.  Now another story 
has come out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There really has been no transparency.  Had there been, we would 
not have objected.  We would have known and could have 
discussed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member comment on whether or not there has been 
transparency with the government? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde: </B>Mr. Speaker, I acknowledged that the 
minister had defended this position.  I have seen the Buenos 
Aires declaration but I am waiting for the texts.  It is true 
that it was decided at Buenos Aires that we would have the texts, 
and have them regularly.  That is a step forward, I find. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased about that, but I am really anxious to have them, 
just dying to have them.  We do not, and we did not at the time 
of the summit.  So the Buenos Aires declaration is all very well, 
but it stated “after the Quebec Summit”.  That is not what we had 
been told.  We are waiting for those texts and they had better 
hurry up and get here, or we will be even more disappointed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to the 
NDP motion. I will read it again so that our audience will have a 
proper understanding of what is going on.  It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House calls upon the government to respect the spirit 
of the evidence given by the Minister of International Trade 
before the Foreign Affairs Committee, who stated “I can assure 
you that we are not seeking an investor-state provision in the 
WTO or anywhere else”, by refusing to sign any trade agreement, 
such as the FTAA or the GATS, that includes a NAFTA Chapter 
11-style investor-state clause. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, what it says is that there is a problem in the 
government's present position in wanting to negotiate a free 
trade agreement with all of the Americas. We hope there will be a 
free trade agreement with all of the Americas, and that it will 
be an agreement with a human face. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attitude we are seeing at the moment on the part of the 
government could lead, in a pinch, to a situation in which the 
people would have to speak out against the free trade agreement 
if things that are unacceptable, such as chapter 11 of NAFTA, 
persist.  Chapter 11 leaves room for things that are 
unacceptable and strangely reminiscent of the multilateral 
agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the people watching may understand, chapter 11 concerns the 
whole issue of dispute settlement.  When there is a problem 
between a business and the interpretation of NAFTA, by which 
governments may intervene, the agreement sets out the mechanisms 
so we know how it is to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other problems, there is the fact that precedents are not 
taken into account.  There is a lack of transparency as to 
whether the decisions that will be taken will be appropriate. 
The governments themselves have realized that there was a major 
problem with the application of these articles.  It could be 
seen in a matter involving Mexico, and we can see it in matters 
involving Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This article also defines just what constitutes an investment. 
It moves from the closed concept of an investment to a concept 
open to interpretations that give short shrift to the rights of 
governments over the rights of businesses.  It is a repeat of 
the debate involving the multilateral agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement also deals with national treatment, providing that 
a foreign business should be entitled to the same benefits as a 
business from the country in which the economic activity is 
taking place.  This would eliminate many of the possibilities of 
support for local and Quebec businesses.  These are things we 
should look at closely before signing such an agreement for all 
the Americas, in addition to the whole issue of expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where things get even worse is when one realizes what is 
actually going on.  This is probably what prompted a reaction 
from the minister earlier.  When we are forced to eat our words, 
it is not easy.  A few months ago, the minister said that he 
would not sign a free trade agreement of the Americas containing 
a clause similar to the one in NAFTA.  For him, this was 
unjustifiable and unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now he tells us that maybe chapter 11 is fine after all.  On the 
one hand, there is what he said on December 13, 2000, when he 
maintained that he would not sign an agreement with anything 
resembling chapter 11.  On the other, there is his statement on 
April 24 that the government believed strongly that chapter 11 
was working reasonably well.  Something happened between these 
two statements.  Someone, somewhere, changed the minister's mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same with respect to his comments earlier on the issue 
of his having apparently obtained agreement in Buenos Aires for 
the texts to be made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be remembered that these texts were made public once the 
business council told the heads of state “If we want there to be 
less pressure so that we can get through the summit, it would 
perhaps be best to agree to publish the texts because, if we do 
not, we are going to meet with even more resistance. 
So, let us agree to make them public, which we will do later on, 
after the summit.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that things have quieted down and the summit is over, 
they are taking their time to have them translated. In this 
marvellous federal Parliament, where translation in both 
official languages should be a source of pride, we have not 
found a way to make these documents public because we had a 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what brings us back to reality. I think today's 
motion is interesting and acceptable and that we should support 
it. If we were to sign a free trade agreement with the Americas 
only to suddenly find out, the day after its implementation, that 
it contains something similar to chapter 11 and that corporations 
can tell national governments what to do, I think many of us will 
not have much to be proud of and will have to answer to their 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, we made the commitment to implement the FTAA in 2005. For 
this to happen, debates need to be held. And there could be a 
federal election riding on this issue.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have to be able to tell our fellow citizens that, yes, 
the agreement is acceptable to the people of Quebec and Canada, 
yes, such an agreement is beneficial to us and, yes, we will 
create wealth and distribute it fairly. But we must ensure that 
we do not engage in something that we will not be able to get out 
of and that we do not have to spend public funds to defend 
ourselves against businesses that want to do unacceptable things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The free trade agreement must not become some kind of operating 
code that would put states at the mercy of businesses. It is very 
important to avoid this type of situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why today's motion requires the attention as well as the 
support of the House. I intend to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not saying that the agreement should not contain any 
definition regarding the treatment of investment. That is not 
what we are saying. But we want to be sure to draw from past 
experience, from the situations we faced with NAFTA and are still 
facing now, so that the agreement takes it into account. We want 
the texts to be amended accordingly to give enough power to the 
states so that businesses cannot impose their will upon them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that the great challenge of the free trade 
area of the Americas is to ensure that the agreement does not 
only create wealth but also allows for the fair distribution of 
such wealth, so that it enables the government to continue to 
represent the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy was the key issue at the summit of the Americas. If 
democracy is to be more than a policy statement, if it is to 
eventually translate into concrete action, the chapter on 
investments in the agreement on the free trade area of the 
Americas will have to include an assurance, a guarantee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clear and specific answers are required on the whole issue of 
the dispute settlement mechanism, and the definition of 
investments, national treatment and expropriation, to ensure 
that control over development remains with the members states 
and has not been completely handed over to businesses, 
multinationals and people whose objectives are very specific, 
but do not necessarily take into account the well-being of the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I will support that motion and urge all members of 
this House, particularly the government majority, to also 
support it. Surely, there must be some Liberals who were opposed 
to free trade. We all remember that the Liberal Party was 
completely opposed to free trade a few years ago. Today, there 
must still be some watchdogs in that party to stress that, in 
the end, we must have an agreement that is acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end on that note. This agreement will not be in place for 
two or three years. This matter, including the whole issue of 
investments, will have an impact on the lives of our children 
and grandchildren. I saw it in Quebec City. I saw young people 
who were very aware of why they were going there, and this was 
the main reason why they were opposed to the free trade 
agreement of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They probably had an even keener and deeper vision than ours, 
because they had already anticipated the possibility of a 
flip-flop by the Minister for International Trade like the one we 
have witnessed today.

<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to what my colleague from the Bloc was 
saying. One of the things he said was that democracy was one of 
the most important things about the summit of the Americas in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is absolutely right in all sorts of ways.  It seems to me 
that we would never have been in the position of holding such a 
summit had all 33 or 34 countries not moved toward democracy so 
considerably.  We know a great deal of progress still has to be 
made but at least the development of the trading framework has 
encouraged those countries to move toward democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague also talked about democratization of the 
organization itself, which is very important, but he focused most 
of his remarks on chapter 11.   I wonder if he could comment on 
another thing.  I have been struck by the spin off or side 
benefits of these trade agreements, like the summit of the 
Americas.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something that particularly struck me in Quebec City, which I had 
not realized before, was how much we had in common with the 
nations of this hemisphere with respect to first nations.  Given 
that our first nations were inside the fence and outside the 
fence, does the hon. member believe that this summit provided 
great hope for first nations people in the Americas? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been talking about the 
importance of making democracy stronger. When I say that in a 
chapter on investment, we should avoid the problems we have met 
in NAFTA, I mean that this may be the best service we could 
provide to countries with a fledging democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, with the excessive powers this agreement would give them, 
corporations can override the governments and get decisions that 
will abolish democracy and turn corporations into the governments 
of these countries, we will go back to the banana republic era. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gist of the matter is that, if we have a good free trade 
agreement of the Americas, with a clear framework, it will be 
better than pure competition, where the big fish always eat the 
small ones, and the small ones have a hard time getting away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the rights the people or the states have must 
be protected. The hon. member gave the example of aboriginal 
peoples. When we define national treatment in a free trade 
agreement dealing with investment, we must make sure that the 
countries that are party to the agreement are allowed to promote 
the development of aboriginal communities, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we not make sure that multinationals cannot sue the 
government for having given special consideration to aboriginal 
peoples to improve their condition? We have to make sure that 
those issues are dealt with in the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not saying today in this motion that there must be no 
investment clause, but rather that this clause should be 
acceptable. It should be well structured, take into account past 
experiences and above all avoid what we felt was coming with the 
multilateral agreement on investment, that is government by 
multinationals. That is what the people are telling us. Those who 
went to Quebec City to protest, the 60,000 who engaged in 
peaceful protest in Quebec City said: We might find a free trade 
agreement acceptable, but it must have a human face. That must be 
obvious in every aspect of the agreement, especially concerning 
investments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Liberals continuously talk 
about democracy but what about democracy for lower income people 
throughout the hemispheres to have the right to public health, 
public education and a clean environment?  That is part of our 
democracy as well.  This particular deal, as it stands, threatens 
those very institutions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the free trade agreement 
signed with the United States, there were some very positive 
aspects, like the market growth. But there were also some very 
negative aspects, like the attempt to standardize the employment 
insurance plan to align it with the American one, a decision that 
penalized our workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we sign agreements in the future, not only will we have to 
benefit from the trade, but we also have to ensure that the 
wealth is adequately distributed. This is what we must do as 
parliamentarians and this is where we will hopefully assume our 
role. We must go beyond simply rubberstamping agreements 
negotiated elsewhere without anyone knowing what they include.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from the riding of Algoma—Manitoulin in northern Ontario 
where a large number of people—and we hope more in the 
future—work in the forestry sector, the mining sector and in 
tourism.  If nothing else, these are very important commodities 
in trade.  We should try to imagine what our lives would be like 
if we did not trade in forest products and minerals, and there 
was no movement of people across our borders to enjoy our fine 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could start with the premise that all trade begins between 
two people bartering something.  In the history of humankind, 
trade started with two people bartering commodities for each 
other's mutual benefit.  If we take that notion and carry it to 
the level of trade within a village and among villages, and take 
it to a higher and more sophisticated level involving trade among 
nations, the simple premise that trade should be mutually 
beneficial applies as much at the international level as it does 
at the local level.  What is good between two people in terms of 
trade must and should be good between two people at opposite 
sides of the planet.  There is no line beyond which trade no 
longer is a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are really debating is not that there should be free 
trade but that there should be freer trade.  It is hard to 
imagine a world where there would not be some rules of 
engagement, but the point is that we want to move forever closer 
to a notion of free trade in a universe where everyone can play 
by the same rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to spend two years teaching high school 
math and physics in Jamaica back in the early 1970s.  Jamaica 
traded mainly bananas and sugar within the commonwealth.  At the 
time it had a sweetheart deal with the United Kingdom.  The 
United Kingdom actually paid a premium for Jamaica's sugar so 
that it would have a guaranteed supply.  Some years ago the 
United Kingdom decided it did not want to pay a premium for the 
sugar and abandoned Jamaica as one of its suppliers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the years when Jamaica had a preferred sale for its sugar 
to Britain, a certain dependency was created.  As a result, 
diversification in the Jamaican economy did not occur.  When the 
British buyers decided to no longer pay that premium and abandon 
Jamaican producers, there was no diversified economy in which to 
respond.  I had a chance to visit a couple of summers ago, and 
sadly the economy in Jamaica has gotten worse over the years, not 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we really want to be sure about in free trade is that there 
are as few rules as possible because the best and most effective 
way to eradicate poverty, not only in our own country but around 
the world, is to make sure everyone has equal and fair access to 
the markets of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really want to make sure that education, health care and 
other social services are available around the world on an equal 
basis, we must share the benefits and the markets, which are easy 
for Canadians to access but very difficult for poor countries to 
access, through trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of our own economy, I have a few simple facts.  Others 
may have mentioned these but they certainly bear repeating. 
Since 1993, under our watch, the country has produced something 
like two million new jobs, 80% of which are the result of trade. 
In fact, exports make up about half of our gross domestic 
product.  There is $2.5 billion a day in trade.  There is no 
question that Canada is a trading nation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again there is the guise of a concern about chapter 11.  I want 
to make it very clear that our Minister for International Trade 
and, I think, our Prime Minister have said that we need to look 
at chapter 11.  We need to tighten things up and we need some 
clarification, but let us agree that things are generally 
working.  It is not unusual when we have an agreement to need to 
fine tune things from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that if we waited at all times to sign an agreement 
that we knew was perfect before we began, we would never sign 
agreements.  We would never buy a house.  It would have to be 
perfect before we bought it and there is always something wrong 
with a house when we buy it, whether it is new or old.  This is 
something we have to face after we get the key and open the front 
door for the first time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to go into agreements and deals with the idea that we 
have made the best arrangement possible in the circumstances 
facing us and that we know ongoing negotiations will be necessary 
to ensure that as time goes by we can make those adjustments and 
tweak those rules and regulations so that things get better for 
all players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A deal that impoverishes one partner and enriches another is not 
a deal.  The government believes in trade that is fair, honest 
and transparent.  I submit that the government, through the whole 
FTAA process, has been totally open to an extent limited only by 
our obligations to other nations in terms of confidentiality.  To 
the extent that the Canadian government could be open, it has 
been so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I use up all my time, I want to comment on a question 
from the member for Peterborough, who asked about the place of 
our first nations, our aboriginal people, when it comes to free 
trade or national trade.  I think it is a very poignant question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have about 25 first nation communities in my large northern 
Ontario riding.  In fact, with the support of trade officials 
with whom I have had a chance to discuss these matters, we are in 
the process of planning a one day conference on free trade in my 
riding to make sure that our aboriginal people as well as 
aboriginal people right through the Americas have an equal and 
fair opportunity to participate in the whole free trade process. 
To the extent that we leave people behind—and nobody on either 
side of the House would argue that we would leave anybody 
behind—either for reasons of illiteracy or reasons of access to 
resources and so on, to that extent we have failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, did I let you know ahead of time that I am 
splitting my time with the member for Mississauga South?  Pardon 
me for not reminding you of that at the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by making a comment about the well televised 
protests we saw at the recent Quebec summit.  I was a university 
student in the late sixties and early seventies and was involved 
in protests myself, although I never threw a brick or damaged any 
property.  If one was in university or college in the late 
sixties and early seventies, one was no doubt involved in some 
form of protest or another.  Those who would damage the 
reputation of legitimate protesters by damaging property have ill 
served all parties to the discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank you for this opportunity, as I 
pass this on to my colleague, and say that the government plans 
to continue its excellent job when it comes to negotiating free 
trade for all its citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the speech made by the member opposite. I 
share the opinion of my colleague, the member for Mercier, who 
was telling the minister a few moments ago that what troubles 
her—and it is troubling, even if the minister does not like it 
when we say that he did a complete about-face—is the fact that 
he changed his position dramatically with regard to chapter 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it makes him happy, let us say that he did not do an 
about-face, but rather that he failed to give us an explanation 
and that, like the member who just spoke, he does not seem to be 
aware of the deadly political implications of chapter 11. Once 
adopted, chapter 11 could prove disastrous to future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments can make mistakes and they have. I saw maybe 35 
finance ministers table 35 budgets year after year, and they all 
said their budget was the best that had ever been prepared and 
presented to the people. Nevertheless, we ended up with a huge 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member takes for granted that governments do not make 
mistakes, would it not be fair, in case they make one some day, 
to discuss with the opposition in order to find mechanisms that 
could, should there be a threat, allow parliament to express its 
opinion on the matter? I am not sure the Liberals have a monopoly 
on the truth. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Chambly for his question.  As I said in my remarks earlier, it is 
impossible to go into any kind of agreement with a perfect 
document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall that in the lead-up to the summit of the Americas it 
was reported, in the papers at least, that the international 
trade minister had asked the president of Mexico to work with 
Canada in terms of finding some adjustments to chapter 11 in 
order to make things clear, to provide for clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that for the time being the president of 
Mexico is saying it is well enough as it is, but I think the very 
fact that our trade minister asked his counterparts in Mexico to 
look at this shows a very clear intent that as we move forward we 
would always want to try to improve things.  We support making 
improvements.  We are not in support of throwing the baby out 
with the bathwater, so to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member suggests that maybe the opposition could have an 
opportunity to propose mechanisms for a new or revised chapter 
11.  This is the very opportunity for the member to do so.  I 
would encourage all colleagues who want to see improvements to 
chapter 11 to take the opportunity here in this debate to bring 
forward some good ideas. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to clarify that my party is not opposed to trade.  We 
recognize there has to be trade.  We recognize that trade is a 
good thing.  We always have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, trade without regulations, trade without ensuring the 
environment is looked after and trade that threatens the 
sovereignty of nations, that kind of trade is not a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the hon. member on that side of the House that if his 
government is not ashamed of that agreement then let us see it. 
Let us see it on the table so people can have honest discussions. 
That is what democracy is about.  Let us see the text.  If the 
hon. member is not too ashamed to show it to the people of Canada 
and people throughout the Americas, let us see the text. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were in Quebec City.  We listened to people from throughout 
the hemisphere, from those countries that trade is doing so much 
for.  We heard how the wages have been lowered by 10% in Mexico. 
We heard about the first nations or the aboriginal people who are 
being wiped off their land; it is no different from what our 
governments did to the aboriginal people here in Canada.  It is 
exploitation of indigenous people and we want to ensure that 
their rights are there as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member 
for Churchill taking the opportunity to comment.  Just before I 
came here I was meeting with some aboriginal leaders from my 
riding.  We were talking about free trade.  They are working to 
find ways for businesses in their communities to become more 
involved with international trade, not the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very fact that there was a huge lack of protest from the 
poorer nations, who are looking at the store window from the 
outside, from the sidewalk looking in, shows that they want to be 
part of the process.

</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK267">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today's 
motion basically suggests that Canada not enter into any trade 
agreements that include a NAFTA chapter 11 style investor state 
clause.  I am not sure whether most Canadians would know very 
much about that subject, but certainly chapter 11 does conjure up 
all kinds of interesting discussion and debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My contribution to the debate is simply to look at a little of 
the history and background of trade liberalization.  The main 
agreements to which Canada is currently or has been a party to 
are:  GATT in 1947; the free trade agreement or FTA; NAFTA; the 
WTO agreement; the Canada-Israel agreement; the Canada-Chile 
agreement; and most recently, the Canada-Costa Rica agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of these makes provision for dispute settlement mechanisms 
that apply in specific cases.  That is the reason why the member 
from the NDP would raise issues such as the environment, poverty 
and sovereignty, et cetera.  There are issues that do come up 
that do touch on those issues and are very relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to fully understand how the dispute settlement process 
works, it is important to review the history of how the process 
emerged, starting with GATT in 1947.  Where the GATT is no longer 
in effect, the dispute settlement mechanisms that were applied 
for nearly 50 years under the treaty have served as a reference 
and have greatly influenced the conflict resolution measures 
adopted in contemporary trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dispute settlement mechanism of GATT in 1947 is contained in 
articles XXII and XXIII of that agreement.  It provided that in 
the case of a dispute the contracting parties must initially hold 
consultations in an attempt to settle that matter.  If the 
dispute cannot be resolved through consultations, the point at 
issue may then be put before contracting parties who may suggest 
corrective measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years the contracting parties adopted complementary 
procedures to articles XXII and XXIII in the form of 
understandings or decisions by the contracting parties.  Under 
these procedures, if there were no successful outcomes, 
consultations with the secretary of the GATT would act as a 
mediator before the dispute was submitted to the contracting 
parties.  Moreover, when a question was put before the 
contracting parties, they had the option of forming a panel to 
review the matter, to hear the claims from the parties involved 
and to prepare a report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contracting parties then had to decide, by consensus, 
whether to adopt that report.  Even when adopted by the 
contracting parties, the report was not directly binding although 
the parties would try to implement it.  Under GATT there were no 
procedures for appealing or challenging the report adopted by the 
contracting parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the FTA and NAFTA, the FTA incorporated and 
improved on the dispute settlement mechanisms of GATT.  It 
contained not just a single dispute settlement procedure, but 
rather a number of procedures applicable to specific areas. 
Chapter 18 of the free trade agreement, like GATT, provides for a 
general dispute settlement procedure respecting the application 
and interpretation of the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It contains the following various stages of the procedure. First 
is inter-party consultation, followed by calling of a joint 
Canada-U.S. trade commission, with the possible assistance of a 
special adviser or mediator.  Next is the constitution of a panel 
of experts who report to the commission.  Finally there agreement 
by the panel on the solution to the dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 19 of NAFTA provides for settlements of disputes over 
anti-dumping and countervailing duties.  This is a procedure for 
reviewing the decisions of international bodies responsible for 
implementing domestic legislation and countervailing duties.  The 
usual review proceedings that may take place under the applicable 
legislation before a national tribunal may, at the request of one 
of the parties, be conducted before a binational panel 
constituted for this purpose under the provisions of this 
chapter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to investment, a dispute over the application or 
interpretation of chapter 14 of the FTA may be brought before a 
board of arbitration or a panel constituted under chapter 18. 
However the panel that rules on the dispute will do so 
internationally under internationally recognized rules of trade 
arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NAFTA also made changes and improvements to the procedures 
previously in effect.  Chapter 20 now contains measures for 
settling disputes over the application and interpretation of the 
treaty.  Chapter 19 concerns the consideration and settlement of 
disputes over anti-dumping and countervailing duties.  Chapter 11 
deals with the settlement of investment disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to the WTO agreements, articles XXII and XXIII of the 
GATT of 1994, and the WTO understanding on the settlement of 
disputes or USD, set out the rules of procedures for settling 
disputes over application and interpretation of the WTO 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The WTO structure also includes a dispute settlement body.  This 
is a plenary conference of all members of the WTO whose function 
is to supervise the application of the dispute settlement 
procedure under the various WTO agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to point out that Canada 
has used the dispute mechanism in NAFTA and the WTO to great 
effect.  According to the WTO Uruguay round of negotiations, all 
countervailing duty orders must be reviewed at least every five 
years to ensure that they are still needed.  Recent reviews under 
the United States government concluded that at least six of the 
countervailing duty orders were revoked.  These included steel 
jacks, elemental sulphur, racing plates, sugar and syrups, red 
raspberries and potash, just to name a few.  The ultimate result 
of these decisions will mean a further increase in trade that 
flows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear to me in listening carefully to the minister and 
to other members, that there are things which have occurred in 
the past and which have led to some concern about the 
consequential items.  Chapter 11, a dispute settlement mechanism 
with regard to contracts and agreements, is one aspect. Many 
members raised concerns about some of the more socially oriented 
subject matter, such as the impact on the environment and on 
people who cannot help themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However one thing we know is that $1 invested in promoting trade 
in Canada results in $2 of export trade.  It also means that one 
in three jobs in Canada is sustained by that trade.  When we 
improve the economy, when we grow the pie, there are more 
resources available for Canada to invest in Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I can only conclude that free trade is good for 
Canada and that there are areas which have to be constantly 
monitored.  That is why we have the very best Canadians making 
sure that our agreements are fair and equitable, that we protect 
Canadian investors and that we protect Canadian interests as well 
as the interests of all, especially those who cannot help 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also is good for the 34 countries of the Americas that met 
and agreed to pursue this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe members would agree that we cannot wait for the 
perfect situation in order to move forward on this.  I think they 
are approaching the summit of the Americas dialogue in a 
responsible fashion.  I look forward to receiving, as do all 
other members, more information on the specifics of that trade 
agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am back from my riding and I just became aware of the very 
interesting debate on chapter 11 of NAFTA being held here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are hearing pretty incredible things in this House today. I 
do not object to the remarks of my colleague, who spoke of the 
benefits of international trade, stating that $1 invested abroad 
brings in $2 in return, and of other such spinoffs. I am not 
against that, and I could hardly be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we should be very careful about today is the wording of 
chapter 11 which, I believe, has a profound effect on democracy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fellow citizens are appalled when I explain to them that 
companies and multinational corporations are able to sue 
governments, which are elected by the people, and take them to 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take for instance the case of Ethyl Corporation, which is 
probably the most talked about. I want to address my comments to 
the people in the galleries, because when they hear that for the 
first time, I am sure they will think it goes against common 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have adopted an environmental rule. I voted in favour of that 
rule because I agreed with the government on the need for a rule 
to ban the use of MMT. However, an American corporation sued the 
Canadian government for potential market loss. This turned 
against the Canadian government before the NAFTA tribunal. So, I 
believe that the question to my colleague opposite— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Three hundred and fifty-four million dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> Yes, it was sued for $354 million. However, 
it was settled out of court, and the Americans were paid 
$15 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is the following: what becomes of democracy in such 
cases? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, chapter 11 is there because, 
as an investor state in foreign markets, when we get involved in 
those situations we are required to protect the interests of 
Canadian investors.  Very simply, whether or not chapter 11 
exists in those agreements does not affect whether or not a 
multinational or another foreign jurisdiction can start a law 
suit.  Contract law is not affected by chapter 11.  It is 
available to all at all times. 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the history lesson given to us by 
the Liberal member was most enchanting.  Although the member did not 
mention it, there is this trickle down theory where if the 
government gets more money it passes to the people who need help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member like to speak to the 22,000 farmers who 
have left the family farm this year?  Would he like to talk to 
the thousands upon thousands of senior citizens who are having to 
make a decision between prescription drugs, home heating fuels 
and food? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While he is thinking of that, the whole essence of our debate is 
quite clear.  The Minister for International Trade said he would 
not under any circumstances sign any deal with an investor state 
provision in it.  That is what we are holding the government to 
account to.  The Prime Minister said something completely 
different.  Now we see the Minister for International Trade 
backtracking ever so quickly to appease his master, the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, if the government is so confident about the agreement, 
where is the text?  Second, why is there a flip-flop on a 
commitment the minister made to the member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona that the government would not sign any deal 
with the investor state provision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are two responses I 
would like to give.  First, there appears to be a disagreement 
between the member and others, including UN Secretary General 
Kofi Annan, about the impact of trade on the poor and those in 
most need in our society.  The secretary general said very 
clearly that trade is good for the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, with respect to the text, and I think the member from 
Churchill also raised the same question, it does not exist yet. 
It has not been finalized but it will be available soon.  All 
members of parliament will have access to the text as soon as it 
is ready. 
<P><A NAME="LINK271"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I find this is a rather important debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing that concerns me at this point is that I find 
myself in agreement with the hon. Minister for International 
Trade on the Liberal side of the House.  I find myself in 
agreement with my colleagues, of course, and with my Conservative 
colleagues.  The only people with whom I am in disagreement are 
members of the NDP group over on the other side.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that there are some interesting points being made by 
the NDP members.  The hon. members are entirely welcome for any 
gratuitous remarks made in their direction because there are so 
few of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with the single most significant element in the 
Canadian economy, trading with other nations.  The NDP has given 
us an opportunity to express our position on this particular 
issue, which is foundation to the economy of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members who are opposite on this issue need to recognize much of 
the support that has made the country what it is today, the 
democratic institution that exists, the various political parties 
that exist, the freedom of speech that exists and the 
opportunities for individuals to develop their businesses, is as 
direct result of free trade among Canada and other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also I point out that free trade is not just in agriculture.  I 
come from a constituency in British Columbia.  We call it 
paradise because it is beautiful in Kelowna.  I want to thank my 
constituents who elected me for the third time.  I am humbled 
with the responsibility they gave me.  It is an honour to 
represent them in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency there are a number of fruit growers, as well 
as other agricultural producers.  The fruit growers depend to a 
large degree on their income from the trade that takes place. The 
Okanagan Valley is now developing some of the finest wines in the 
world.  These wines compete internationally and are winning 
awards.  The wineries also depend to a large degree on 
international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize how dependent agriculture is on trade.  We 
should also recognize the significance of manufacturing and how 
it depends on international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we need look at is the automobile assembly plants that exist 
in the southern part of British Columbia.  Industries have sprung 
up around those assembly plants.  Magna International is 
extremely successful.  It has become a major auto parts 
manufacturing firm.  The members should recognize that some of 
the mutual funds in which they have invested have stocks in Magna 
International, so they are direct beneficiaries of that 
particular company.  Some of their friends probably work for 
either Ford, Chrysler or GM in the assembly of automobiles, 
trucks and various SUVs.  All these jobs are directly dependent 
on international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize that trade is not only in the areas of 
agriculture and manufacturing but also in the area of our natural 
resources.  Where would the economy of the country be if there 
was not a good arrangement for trading natural gas, oil, coal and 
lumber? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget lumber which is a significant part of our 
Canadian economy.  Lumber is an $18 billion contributor to our 
gross national product in British Columbia.  It is a major issue. Trade 
with the United States is very well developed and needs to be 
done properly.  That is what we are talking about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To suggest that chapter 11 somehow is an anathema to developing 
strong free trade is simply misleading everything.  Why is that 
the case?  I suggest that the first and most important provision 
of chapter 11 is to protect investors.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not a single person in the House who does not want 
their invested capital to be preserved, protected and to grow. 
That is what our party wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want Canadians to have the same kind of protection for their 
investments in another country as we give foreigners investing in 
Canada.  If there is no reciprocal guarantee for the protection 
of capital then why would anyone want to invest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but take a little shot here at the parliamentary 
secretary and his minister.  I would suggest to them that 
Canadians investing abroad is not so much a reflection of the 
strength of the Canadian economy but rather an expectation that 
they can do better with their investments outside of Canada, 
particularly with respect to the huge tax burden placed on 
corporations and individuals in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize that Canada has a negative balance today in 
terms of direct foreign investment in Canada and Canadian 
investment elsewhere.  Canadians are investing more elsewhere 
than others are investing in Canada.   We have a negative balance 
and it would be good if it were the other way around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that in the past there was a point where Canada had 
more foreign investment coming into Canada than going elsewhere. 
One of the reasons for that was the fact that these foreigners 
needed access to our resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing something about Alberta, which is where I grew up, oil, 
gas and natural gas were major contributors to the success of 
that province.  If oil and gas had not been sold to the American 
market the province would not have grown in the way that it has. 
Alberta received that investment from foreign investors not 
Canadian investors.  Today Canadians are realizing how important 
it was to invest in those natural resources, and it is going 
along very well.  However it first took risk capital from outside 
Canada to see the vision and develop that particular sector of 
our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the investors came to Canada and invested was that 
their investment was protected.  We should be forever thankful to 
them for having done that.  I know I certainly am.  If we intend 
to invest elsewhere we would want that kind of protection as 
well.  Chapter 11 does that and that is why it is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the protection of capital in that sense.  We want 
to make sure that it is safe in the sense that it competes fairly 
with other industries that are investing in the same area.  We 
want to make sure that the competition that exists in those 
countries is such that it is not mitigating against the 
successful development of a particular country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize that this investment allows us to benefit 
from technological development.  It takes money and very often 
takes a considerable risk in order to develop these technologies. 
This is what happens when good investment and risk capital comes 
into this country or goes elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now move on to the second reason that chapter 11 is not 
all that bad and why the motion before the House should be 
defeated.  It is the negative effects of tariffs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some countries have taken the view that they have to protect 
their industries and development to the point where they impose 
tariffs on any product competing either directly or indirectly 
with their local industries which are imported from another 
country.  In many cases this mitigates against the best interests 
of the consumers who buy those particular imported products. This 
does not encourage competition in the local economy. It does not 
allow, encourage or provide an incentive for manufacturing or 
other industries to be innovative, competitive or efficient, nor 
does it encourage them to seek innovation or apply new 
technologies.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen this in the lumber industry.  We have in Canada 
some of the most modern, efficient, technologically aware and 
developed sawmills and processing plants of lumber of anywhere in 
the world.  People are coming here to have a look at the way in 
which we do these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we send lumber to other places in the world and they have 
inefficient plants where they cannot on a per capita basis or on 
a per worker basis produce the same kind of lumber or they do so 
with more waste, they would not be competitive.  So they place a 
barrier and then say that they will put a tariff on Canadian 
lumber which goes into the particular country.  The people of 
that country then have to pay a premium for the lumber which is 
produced locally because it is inefficient and they have to pay a 
premium on the lumber which is imported even though they could be 
saving dollars to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tariffs work against efficiency.  They work against good 
competition and they very often work against good relations 
between nations as a consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need to have a level playing field.  That is another 
reason chapter 11 needs to be protected. If people establish a 
business in another country they want to be sure that their 
business competes with another business that may be in the same 
area or may provide the same kind of service or product.  They 
want the same rules that exist in that country to apply to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A car manufacturer goes into the United States and builds cars. 
It could also want to build cars in Canada.  We want to make sure 
that all companies are operating under exactly the same rules and 
that the playing field is as level as it can possibly be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we need to be sure about.  That is what chapter 11 
would do.  It would make sure that the advantages given to our 
industries would also exist for a company that comes here and 
vice versa.   We need to be sure that all protections are 
provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing that I wish to emphasize at this point.  No 
agreement that has ever been put together by human beings is 
perfect, and neither is chapter 11.  The North American Free 
Trade Agreement is not perfect.  The agreement with the Americas 
on trade will not be perfect either.  It is totally false for 
anyone to stand in the House and imply that if the government 
would do this one thing the agreement would be perfect.  We will 
always find ways in which we can improve something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite spoke earlier about buying a house.  If 
on the day we turn the key in the door and enter and discover 
something we did not expect, we immediately want to change it.  I 
doubt whether there is a person in the House who has not 
renovated a house to some degree somewhere along the line.  I 
doubt there is a single person in the House who is living in a 
house today which is as it was when it was purchased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to evolve and we need to develop.  Later on today we 
will be talking about democratic reform, reforming this 
institution.  Why is that?  It is not because this place has not 
been working for 125 years or that we have made no changes.  It 
is because we believe we can improve this place and we will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point that needs to be made.  It is the 
philosophic base from which the motion emanates.  This is where I 
find myself very much away from the party that presented the 
motion.  It is almost as if to have private capital and profit is 
somehow bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private individuals do a better job of running a business than 
government ever did, no matter how smart the bureaucrats are who 
back up the legislation and the policy development of government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals applying their capital, having a personal interest 
in what is developing and in what is happening with that capital, 
would do a better job of managing that money.  It is significant 
that tax dollars left in the hands of individuals always produces 
a better economy than if the government takes it away from them, 
thinking that it could spend it more effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could go through all kinds of countries in the world.  We 
could go to Ireland, the United States, Great Britain and New 
Zealand. We could go anywhere in the world where governments have 
cut taxes to see the result.  The result has been an improvement 
in the economic welfare of everyone.  People have said over and 
over again that when taxes are reduced revenues are reduced, and 
in almost every case, if not in every case, the total revenues of 
the government have increased and not decreased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The net result is that it is false economy to raise taxes.  The 
government should cut taxes if it wants more money and it should 
stop interfering in the lives of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 11 would protect the investment of individuals of 
private capital into production and services so that an incentive 
would be there, a profit could be made and more people could be 
employed.  The end result is that the economy grows, things get 
better and we are all happier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at the various agreements. We have had the 
agreement with the United States.  We have had the North American 
Free Trade Agreement which expanded that considerably.  Now we 
are talking about an even broader agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting because we have had people saying today that 
somehow the summit in Quebec City two weekends ago was 
undemocratic.  I would like to ask what is democratic.  If that 
summit was not democratic, this institution cannot be democratic 
because the people who met in Quebec City were also 
representatives.  There were 33 different duly elected heads of 
state representing their countries and the best interest of those 
nations.  Is that undemocratic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 301 MPs in this institution, elected to represent 
respective constituents.  We are here to make decisions and laws. 
Is it undemocratic because we represent those people? It is 
anything but undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the essence of democracy to be able to vote in the House, 
representing the best interest and working in the best interest 
of our constituents. That is what we are all about.  That is 
democracy.  At least that is how I understand democracy.  If that 
is not the way some hon. members understand democracy, I wish 
they would tell us what it is.  I would suggest that they would 
probably be defeated with their definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question is who signed the North American Free Trade 
Agreement.  It was not signed by an RCMP officer or by a farmer. 
It was not signed by a president of a college, by a president of 
a university or by a president of a particular corporation.  It 
was signed by heads of state who were in agreement.  It was 
signed by them, each of whom was duly elected on a democratic 
basis to represent his or her country.  What could be more 
democratic than that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was the process totally open and transparent?  No, it was not. I 
take extreme exception to that.  The process should be as open as 
possible.  Has it been as open as possible?  No, it has not. We 
need to concentrate on making these processes open so that 
democracy is not only done but appears to be done.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam,

for his excellent speech on the subject.  It is interesting to 
listen to people from different political parties speak to the 
subject.  However the detractors of free trade keep trotting out 
Ethyl Corporation and Metalclad as examples of chapter 11 without 
any knowledge or thorough understanding of it. 
They just say the corporation sued and the corporation won, but 
there seems to be no deeper understanding of the issue than that. 
However that is not the basis of my question.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted the hon. member to comment on the assumption which has 
been spun that there is swelling support of young people against 
free trade.  I am the youngest member of the House.  I am 
speaking uniquely for myself, unlike other young people who are 
active in politics and who claim to speak for all young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of my family have left Canada because of high taxes and 
lack of opportunity.  They came from British Columbia where the 
NDP governs.  They decided that high taxes and shutting off trade 
was not the way of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to speak to the issue of civil society.  We have 
heard this term trotted out by Maude Barlow and her ilk, that 
they represent the burgeoning group of civil society.  They say 
that those who oppose free trade are examples of civil society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any serious political scientist who understands the nature and 
root of the ethic of civil society, where it comes from in 
communitarianism, knows for a fact that the term civil society is 
being hijacked by the radical left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Civil society is organic people coming together and voluntarily 
deciding that their ideas have a common cause through community 
instinct.  It is not the well informed and badly intentioned 
leading the badly informed and well intentioned, which is 
precisely what happened in Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the member for Kelowna.  What does he think 
of the hijacking of people by the radical left that claims to 
speak for all young Canadians, the hijacking of the good ethic of 
communitarianism and real civil society that represents people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  I am going to make two points.  The first one 
is with regard to hijacking civil society.  I suspect that will 
come to an end very quickly in British Columbia as the NDP is 
bound to be defeated in the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I would like to make in response to the 
member's question is simply to suggest that no one can say he or 
she represents everyone in an area.  We do the best we can.  To 
say that I totally represent the hon. member to my right and the 
hon. member to my left is probably wrong.  They are individuals 
in their own right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize that we come together in a value system 
where we believe in democracy and we believe in the 
representation of people in the decision making bodies of the 
country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have listened to this afternoon's speeches with great interest 
and to my colleague in the Alliance with no less interest than 
the others.  There are some things he says that I am very 
interested in and some actually disturbed me a great deal.  I 
will divide my remarks into two questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it seems to me that rural Canada at the moment, be it 
farm country or the more remote parts of the country, depends on 
foreign trade more immediately than the rest of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I live in a riding which is 40% rural.  Half of it 
is cottage country with one mine, forestry and that kind of 
thing.  The other half of the rural part of my riding is very 
mixed farming:  150 dairy farms, 500 beef farms, a 50 year old 
buffalo farm, chicken farms, hog farms and things of that type. 
Fifty per cent of the farm gate income in my riding depends upon 
exports.  The mine's products are almost entirely exported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural Canada needs rules based fair trading overseas.  I accept 
the member's enthusiasm, but I would like to ask him a question 
regarding the dispute settling mechanism in chapter 11 we are 
discussing at the moment. 
How would he as a member of the Alliance deal with the 
oversubsidization that is occurring within and without the trade 
agreements from which our farmers suffer so deeply? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT85"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT85"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1705

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support fair rules based trading.  How would he and his party 
deal with these subsidies which we as a government have been 
struggling with to try to reduce the subsidies in the United 
States, in Europe and so on, which are crippling our farmers in 
their foreign trade? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for raising that question.  It is a wise question and a very 
insightful one.  I commend him for that.  I wish all members on 
his side of the House would share the same feelings he has just 
implied in his question.  I congratulate him on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three approaches that I think we need to think about. 
The first one is that there is global competition and a 
competitive market exists.  When one country subsidizes and 
another one does not it places the producers of one country at a 
severe disadvantage.  There needs to be competition now at that 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unfortunate part of it is that our rural producers are in 
exactly the position where governments are now in competition and 
there is a ratcheting effect.  They subsidize at this level one 
year and we try to beat them next year by going a little higher. 
The war happens at the subsidy level.  We need to recognize that 
is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should we do about it?  The ideal would be for all 
countries to say that they will open their doors to competition, 
be as efficient as possible and eliminate all existing subsidies. 
Everyone would have to do that in order for it to work.  It would 
be significant to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not only affect rural producers, by the way.  This is 
not only in agriculture.  It also exists in the manufacturing 
sector and in certain other sectors of our economy.  The ideal 
position is to eliminate all subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next position and probably the one that is realistic is to 
get to the point where we agree we will not get into a war 
between each other, gradually eliminate them or get involved in a 
process like that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK274"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to weigh in on this very important topic tonight.  I am 
delighted to be able to add my voice to the debate on the most 
anti-democratic clause of the most anti-democratic agreement 
Canada has ever seen, chapter 11 of NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all deeply concerned with the contradictory words and 
actions from our government on this critical matter.  We have 
seen the Prime Minister run in 1993 guaranteeing that NAFTA would 
not be adopted unless he got changes to protect Canada.  He then 
adopted NAFTA with only a few cosmetic changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the motion points out, we even had a glimmer of a reprieve 
from the minister before the committee a while back, saying that 
investor rights would not move into the WTO, into GATS or the 
FTAA.  Once again we saw the Prime Minister crack the whip and 
drive dissenters back in line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was recently in Quebec City where 50,000 people marched in the 
streets to protest the undemocratic process being used to make 
decisions which will affect human beings the world over.  The 
most common complaint of the hundreds I spoke with was that the 
inclusion and the existence of the investor rights outlined in 
chapter 11 which, according to a leak on the eve of the summit, 
were to be included and strengthened in the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to Quebec City as a member of parliament, along with all 
my NDP colleagues.  We clearly felt that was the place to be if 
we wanted to know what was going on in the hearts and minds of 
citizens of the country.  A recent poll showed that 4.4 million 
Canadians would have been in Quebec City if they had the time and 
the resources to be there to protest against trade deals and the 
effects they are having on our democracy, our environment and our 
culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The obvious place for us as elected representatives would have 
been to be inside the summit.  The obvious place for the text of 
the FTAA to be discussed would be right in the House of Commons 
and in public forums across the country.  As we know that is not 
the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scene that I saw behind the fence where I was with the 
50,000 people was a real forum of participatory democracy.  There 
were thousands of caring, concerned people there because they 
wanted to have a say in the kinds of deals being made for the 
future of our globe and our country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Events in Quebec City were as much about culture as about trade. 
I am talking about culture in as broad sense: what kind of world 
we want to live in and how we could continue to express our 
vision of that world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Critics of mine and the critics of other protesters have tried 
to say that we are anti-trade.  We have heard that today in this 
room.  We are not anti-trade.  We are pro-trade.  We are 
pro-community.  We want our voices to count through our 
democratically elected government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that we are inextricably linked globally by our 
telecommunications, by our labour and by our environment.  We 
have global problems that we all have to work on together, but we 
do not believe that business, that money and that the wealthy 
should have special legal rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under chapter 11 a foreign company can sue a democratically 
elected government because the government chooses to operate 
state enterprises or allows for monopolies which it deems 
desirable for the public good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under chapter 11 a company can sue a democratically elected 
government because through its actions on behalf of its citizens 
it has denied the company the opportunity to profit in a specific 
sector of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine how our history would have evolved if this had 
been true in the past:  no railways, no Canadian broadcaster, no 
Petro-Canada, no national airline, no post office.  That is not 
to mention another real threat, which is to our public hospitals, 
our schools, our environmental controls and eventually our 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that there are phrases in NAFTA which give lip 
service to protecting some of these things.  However, in the 
details, in the incomprehensible language of these agreements, 
none are protected.  If a service were to modernize, it is no 
longer protected.  If we protect our culture, we get zapped in 
another sector.  If a single province chooses to export bulk 
water, all taps are open.  If a single private school can get 
public funding, we will have to compensate all comers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time is running out, but I would like to use a current case 
before the NAFTA tribunal to illustrate my point.  UPS is suing 
Canada because it opposes Canada Post couriering mail. UPS is 
saying that because Canada Post is a crown corporation, which it 
is, it accepts parcels for delivery by the equivalent of a 
courier service, which it does.  UPS is losing potential profit 
and it feels our taxpayers should cough up a chunk of tax money 
and give it to UPS, which we may have to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could win this one.  Under NAFTA we no longer have the right 
to have crown corporations that are efficient, that use new 
technologies and that update their business plans to deliver a 
service which we as parliamentarians say Canadians want and need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have never debated this issue in the House that I know of, 
but it is not rocket science to realize that we are a big country 
which has a small population that is very spread out.  Having 
efficient, reliable and affordable service to send each other 
mail, parcels and goods makes a lot of sense to me.  Apparently 
we can only do this if we first compensate UPS.  This case shows 
how we are stuck to agreements with ineffective exemptions that 
never allow public enterprises to change, to modernize or to 
survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our democracy is our most special public right.  Under our 
charter, four of the five sections deal with guaranteeing these 
rights.  I am frightened, along with my colleagues, that unless 
we change our tune on chapter 11 these rights will be traded away 
for the sake of guaranteed profits for transnational 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very honoured to finish the debate tonight on chapter 11 
and to have expressed concerns on behalf of the New Democratic 
Party respecting the protection of our democratic rights under 
trade deals.

the constituents of Calgary East to speak this afternoon to my 
private member's bill, Bill C-290, an act to amend the criminal 
code (breaking and entering). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the enactment is to provide for a minimum 
mandatory imprisonment of two years upon a second or subsequent 
conviction for breaking and entering where the offence is 
committed in relation to a dwelling house.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Break and enter crime is much more than a property offence.  It 
is a crime against the person.  Canadians view break and enter 
crime as a very serious and traumatic violation of their sense of 
safety and security.  Victims of house break-ins rarely talk 
later about the television they lost or the other property that 
was taken.  However, they talk about the fear and the fact that 
someone invaded the sanctity of their home.  This is not a 
property offence in the same way we view an auto theft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 19, I had a town hall meeting in my riding to discuss 
break and enter crime.  A constituent came forward at this 
meeting to describe the fear she still feels after break and 
enter thieves violated her home several years ago.  She described 
how she still feels unsafe in her own home and how she thought 
about selling her home because she is scared that the thieves 
will one day come back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These kinds of stories show the reality of break and enter 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote Chief David Scott of the Saskatoon Police Service in a 
recent letter of support for the bill, he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have correctly identified what we so often neglect to realize 
is the psychological damage and the tremendous trauma suffered by 
victims of home break and enters. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Constable Guy Baker of District 4 in Calgary said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best sentence I ever saw for a repeat offender was three 
years, however, the effect on the victims lasts forever. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Females feel personally violated and their house no longer has a 
sense of being a home.  Men feel they have failed in their role 
as the family protector.  Children have a hard time sleeping and 
many children start bed-wetting after their home has been 
burglarized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the psychological impacts of break and enter crime are 
often devastating in their own right, this can also be a violent 
crime because every break and enter is potentially a home 
invasion.  In fact, according to statistics from the Canadian 
Centre for Justice, 58% of break and enter incidents involved a 
weapon being present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote an Edmonton man who was viciously beaten 
in a break and enter that turned into a home invasion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Physically I am okay.  Mentally I am not.  It's almost like I 
have to force myself to do things—even to go to work.  I don't 
know what could be enough jail time (for this).  There is no 
justification for what they did. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a victim's amendment to the criminal code because 
the result would be fewer victims brought about by imposing a 
real deterrent on professional break and enter criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Julian Santino of the Toronto Police Service said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deterrent sentences such as the one you have proposed are 
absolutely necessary if we are ever to realize the goal of truth 
in sentencing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sergeant Al Koenig, president of the Calgary Police Association, 
stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A two year minimum sentence will slow down the turnstile 
treatment of these career criminals. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Staff Sergeant Dan Dorsey of the Calgary Police Service said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have to take repeat break and enter offenders out of the 
circulation because they don't stop.  We try to keep the habitual 
home breakers incarcerated for as long as possible. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-290 will also cut off what is a real source of revenue 
for career criminals and organized crime by breaking the cycle of 
using the proceeds of break and enter crime to finance other 
criminal activities, including drug trafficking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Break and enter is a crime once thought serious enough by 
parliament that it imposed a maximum sentence of life in prison. 
Today conditional and suspended sentencing has reduced the 
average jail term served by a repeat break and enter offender to 
six months. 
Only one in ten repeat offenders receives a sentence of two years

</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, parliamentarians must provide a clear distinction to 
the courts about the serious nature of this crime by imposing a 
minimum sentence.  As Chief Alex McCauley of the Sudbury Regional 
Police stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I view incidents of break and enter as a far more serious crime 
than it appears to be getting credit for, especially in the 
courts today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatoon Police Chief Dave Scott said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident the Canadian public is exasperated and distrustful 
of the Canadian justice system's ability to deal with this 
offence appropriately. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts do need a clear direction from our legislators 
regarding Canadian citizens' concern over their personal safety 
and their homes.  A two year minimum would act as a deterrent to 
potential thieves and would take the professional thief off the 
streets.  It would not add substantial numbers of new prisoners 
to already overcrowded prisons because of the relatively low 
numbers of repeat offenders committing a large percentage of 
break and enter crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics in Calgary suggest that as few as 5% of the repeat 
professional offenders are committing 80% of the crimes.  A two 
year minimum would also prevent the provincial justice system 
from imposing different sentences from one jurisdiction to 
another.  An offender in Alberta should be looking at the same 
sentence as a person from Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was seconded by the former attorney general from 
Manitoba, my colleague, who will be speaking shortly on this 
bill.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts need a clear direction from parliament that sets out 
the concerns that Canadians have over this very serious crime. 
This bill would provide that direction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would conclude by reading the following letter sent to me by a 
constituent, who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear leaders of our great country's political parties; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I'm sure you are all aware, the member for Calgary East is in 
the process of introducing a private member's bill to give repeat 
break and enter artists a minimum sentence of two years in 
custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask all of you, especially the Prime Minister, 
to please ask for all MPs in your respective parties to disregard 
party politics, and vote in favour of this bill.  Please do not 
let a great bill, that could potentially help all Canadians in a 
great way, get squashed in favour of party politics. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter writer was concerned.  This crime happens from coast 
to coast and is not unique to any province.  I believe home break 
and enters to be one of the greatest invasions a family or person 
can endure. I am sure my family and I would be deeply traumatized 
by that experience.  I believe this is a huge problem and is 
always in the minds of all Canadians.  Please help all of us in 
this great country feel a little more secure and at ease by 
helping to reduce such heartbreaking and demoralizing invasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like unanimous consent from members of the House to make 
this a votable bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Does the member want 
to first finish his remarks and then put the question to the 
House, or does he want to put the question to the House now?  He 
has five more minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Madam Speaker, if I have five more 
minutes I will talk about this more and ask the question when I 
am finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seriousness of this break and enter offence should be viewed 
from a different angle.  I was talking to the justice minister 
who said that she may have some concern about a minimum sentence. 
I can understand, but let me explain.  We are dealing with the 
criminal code but not all of the criminal code. 
We are dealing specifically with a crime on the increase.  What 
is happening is that the sentences the courts have been giving, 
which are now only six months for everything, have created a 
lucrative business.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was told by a police officer on the beat for break and enter 
that these repeat offenders are now using breaking and entering 
as a job.  It is a profession, a job, just like me and everybody 
else going to work.  Repeat offenders do not see the seriousness 
behind it.  They do not see the seriousness of the invasion of 
individual privacy.  They view it as a job.  Why?  For the simple 
reason they know that if they are caught they will be back out on 
the streets.  Eighty per cent of people who break and enter are 
repeat offenders.  They will be out.  How do we stop it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we nip this thing in the bud before it becomes one of the 
most serious crimes in this country?  Let us have a minimum 
sentence of two years.  That way we will be able to break the 
cycle of break and enter and we will be able to take them off the 
streets as well as give them help if they need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not talking about the first time offender.  I am talking 
about repeat offenders.  We have to be very clear.  If somebody 
slips a first time, I can understand that.  We are talking about 
repeat offenders and the problem staring us in the eye needs to 
be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am sure my colleagues and everybody understand 
the gravity of this situation of break and enter.  It is to be 
hoped they would give unanimous consent to make this a votable 
bill.  May I ask for unanimous consent of the House to make this 
bill votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Is there unanimous

<P><A NAME="LINK296"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise this evening to speak to Bill C-290, an act 
to amend the criminal code with respect to breaking and entering, 
which has been introduced by the hon. member for Calgary East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The safety and security of Canadians within their own homes is a 
key priority for the Government of Canada.  The government has 
responded to concerns about home invasions by including section 
23 in Bill C-15, the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2001, introduced 
on March 14, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proposed amendments to the criminal code would indicate that 
where the offender's conduct was in the nature of a home 
invasion, the court must consider this to be an aggravating 
factor when determining the sentence to be imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-290 would amend subsection 348(1)(d) of the criminal code 
by providing, in the case of a first offence, for a maximum 
penalty of life imprisonment, and in the case of second or 
subsequent offence, a maximum life sentence and a minimum 
sentence of two years imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 348 of the code makes it an offence to enter a place 
with intent to commit an indictable offence, to actually commit 
an indictable offence, or to have broken out of a place after 
having committed or intending to commit an indictable offence. 
The current maximum penalty for committing any of these acts in a 
dwelling place is life imprisonment.  I would add that the 
offence of robbery also carries a maximum penalty of life 
imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect most Canadians would be surprised that these offences 
attract such a severe maximum penalty.  In fact, surveys 
conducted by the Canadian Sentencing Commission in the mid-1980s 
showed that the public has very little knowledge of either 
maximum or minimum penalties generally and that many were taken 
aback by the severity of the existing maxima. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current maximum penalties for breaking and entering and 
robbery demonstrate that the government recognizes this conduct 
is of serious nature which may have significant impacts upon its 
victims.  The sanctity of an individual's home as a place of 
safety and one free from intrusion has been recognized at common 
law for hundreds of years.  It is, in part, for this reason that 
the criminal code offences of robbery and break and enter of a 
dwelling house are subject to a maximum sentence of life 
imprisonment.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal code states that the fundamental purpose of 
sentencing is to contribute to respect for the law and the 
maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objectives of sentencing in the criminal code include 
denouncing unlawful conduct, deterring those who would commit 
offences and promoting a sense of responsibility in offenders in 
acknowledging the harm they have done to victims and to the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government shares the concerns of Canadians with regard to 
the relatively new phenomenon of home invasion robberies which 
occur while the home is occupied.  To protect the right of 
individuals to feel secure in their own homes and to address the 
need for denunciation and deterrence, courts across Canada have 
been imposing stiff sentences for this crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment signals that home invasions are a serious 
crime that should be met with significant penalties.  In addition 
to the maximum life imprisonment already in the criminal code for 
breaking and entering into a dwelling house, Bill C-290 would 
provide a mandatory minimum of two years' imprisonment for a 
second or subsequent offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has historically utilized mandatory minimum sentences 
with restraint and allowed courts the discretion to fashion 
sentences proportionate to the gravity of the offence and conduct 
of the offender.  Judges, who have the benefit of knowing all the 
facts and evidence regarding the offence and the offender, are 
well placed to determine the appropriate sentence in individual 
cases.  Such circumstances must be weighed in light of the 
sentencing principles I have outlined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no clearly demonstrated need for a minimum penalty for 
second or subsequent convictions for breaking and entering into a 
dwelling house given the high maximum penalty already in the 
code.  Courts also take into account whether an offender has 
previous convictions for the same or related offences.  A prior 
criminal record is an aggravating factor and the greatest 
predictor of a longer sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to home invasion, the creation of an aggravating 
sentencing provision in Bill C-15 would encourage judges to use 
the tough penalties already available.  As noted, courts 
throughout Canada are already doing so in recognition of the 
seriousness of this offence and its devastating impact upon 
victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize the concerns of the hon. member for Calgary East 
with respect to breaking and entering.  However I believe the 
existing penalty of life imprisonment for this offence and clause 
23 of Bill C-15 clearly demonstrate our commitment to providing 
safe homes for all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK297"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to speak to the 
bill in respect to break and enter crimes.  As my hon. colleague 
for Calgary East has stated, Bill C-290 provides the courts clear 
direction from parliament on the seriousness of break and enter 
crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would set out a minimum two year sentence for repeat 
and subsequent offences for break and enter crimes in a dwelling 
house.  That needs to be stressed.  We are talking about the 
residence of a person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would not simply denounce break and enter crime as a 
serious violation of a person's sense of safety and security.  By 
providing a two year minimum for repeat offenders the bill would 
prove a very effective deterrent against these kinds of 
criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the House a quick but telling example of why Liberal 
policy with respect to break and enter law has failed and why we 
need to seriously consider amending the sentencing provisions for 
break and enter crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home province of Manitoba preliminary statistics released 
by Winnipeg police on March 20 show that Winnipeg's crime rate 
jumped almost 40% in the first two months of this year.  The 
police service is stretched to the limit as front line officers 
fight to protect law-abiding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Winnipeg police, these statistics show that certain 
crimes, particularly break and enter crimes, are on the rise 
after several years of decline.  A member across the way says we 
should talk to the province or to police.  There it is.  We are 
told to blame the province and the police when we have the tools 
to deal with it here.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a typical Liberal response to simply pay lip service to an 
issue and let someone else deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to compare statistics for the first two months of 2001 with 
those for the first two months of 2000.  I will give the precise 
numbers.  Nine hundred and nineteen residential break and enters 
were reported in January and February 2001.  Seven hundred and 
ninety-three were reported for the same period last year.  This 
is not just a matter of statistics.  This is a matter of personal 
safety for the people of my province and the people of Canada. 
People live in fear because of what is happening not only on the 
streets but in their own homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This parliament does not show its citizens the respect to which 
they are entitled in their own homes.  If we let gangs run loose 
on the streets what courtesy are we showing to citizens?  What 
fears build up in their homes when they cannot even lock the door 
and know they are safe? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members across the way say that it is a police problem.  It is not a 
police problem.  Police arrest these lawbreakers every day and 
the turnstile justice system sets them free almost immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is not unique to Winnipeg.  As my hon. friend from 
Calgary has indicated, it is a serious problem in his city as 
well.  It has become such a problem that the Calgary police 
service has formed a break and enter unit in every district to 
take over from the single unit which until recently served the 
entire city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officers are becoming increasingly frustrated watching criminals 
receive little more than a slap on the wrist from the courts.  My 
friend across the way said that we should let judges determine 
sentences because they have all the facts.  Yes, they have all 
the facts and all the tools, yet they are doing nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in provincial politics one of my constituents 
suggested that one way to reduce crime in Winnipeg would be to 
make each judge live on a block in the downtown core.  We would 
perhaps not see the callous attitude with which people in those 
areas are treated when they come to the courts for justice.  Let 
judges live in the downtown core and deal with gangs not in the 
courts but face to face when they come through the doors into 
their homes.  It is disgraceful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police know what they are talking about.  Thinking citizens 
know what they are talking about.  The statistics are clear.  The 
vast majority of break and enter crimes are committed by a very 
small group of people.  Winnipeg City Police have told me that 
when they put one of these gangs away the break and enter rates 
drop dramatically.  As soon as they are on the street again the 
rates zoom up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incarceration for break and enters into residential homes is a 
clear deterrent and has a clear impact on this horrific crime. 
This is not a property crime. 
This is not a property crime.  It is an invasion of people's 
security.  It is a violation of the rights outlined in the 
section 7 of the charter: the right to life, liberty and security 
of the person.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The charter protects criminals in our courts but parliament does 
not grant the same courtesy to law-abiding, taxpaying citizens. 
That is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Break and enter crimes fund gang related activities, such as 
drug purchases and distribution.  The bill's sentencing 
provisions would cut off what is a real and substantial revenue 
source for these career criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend across the way indicated that the new amendments would 
give the courts direction.  The courts have always had the 
ability to impose life sentences, although they gave up on that a 
long time ago.  They no longer even take the facts into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My learned friend knows that the real purpose behind the Liberal 
bill is to allow the government to stand and pay lip service 
knowing that judges will do nothing about this crime.  It is a 
fraud on the Canadian people.  That is why my hon. friend from 
Calgary introduced this private member's bill.  It is absolutely 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The terror of this crime is illustrated by a newspaper article 
in today's Winnipeg <I>Sun</I>.  The article describes an ordinary 
break and enter that turned into a home invasion in which police 
officers and citizens feared for their lives.  I recommend that 
you read the story, Madam Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think about it.  While people in core areas of Winnipeg, 
Toronto and Vancouver are crouched in their homes worried about 
what is happening to their cities, the government refuses to 
respond.  I ask all hon. members to respond by voting in favour 
of this very necessary bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK298"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to have an opportunity to speak 
to this private member's bill.  I am also honoured to follow my 
colleague from Provencher and attach myself to his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has a great deal of pragmatism and takes a practical 
common sense approach to the very real problem of home invasion. 
I commend the hon. member for his intent and his perseverance in 
bringing the matter to the forefront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would amend the criminal code to provide for minimum 
mandatory imprisonment of two years upon a second or subsequent 
conviction for breaking and entering in relation to a dwelling 
house.  The dwelling house is the key principle.  The home is the 
castle, the sacrosanct place where Canadians first and foremost 
should feel a sense of security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This offence has become rampant not just in cities and towns but 
in rural Canada.  In isolated areas the chances of home invasion 
are sometimes increased by the isolation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, this crime is on the rise among youth and particularly 
young women.  It is popular among gangs because of the lucrative 
rewards involved.  I say rewards in a negative sense because 
those who engage in the activity seem to feel they can achieve 
something by breaking into people's homes and taking their 
possessions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real danger is when individuals are at home and find someone 
in their domain, particularly at night under the cover of 
darkness.  The potential for violence is very real. 
It has happened on numerous occasions when individuals were 
protecting their home, their possessions and their loved ones. It 
is a recipe for disaster and violence.  Why would we as 
legislators in the Parliament of Canada not want to put great 
emphasis on something that is happening with alarming frequency?

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many have complained about the legislation.  The parliamentary 
secretary has referred to it as infringing upon judicial 
jurisdiction.  He says that it would infringe upon a judge's 
natural task of assessing each case separately.  Surely the 
emphasis by judges is always upon the facts in a particular case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about recidivism and repeat offences, the scales of 
justice must be tipped in favour of protecting the public.  The 
scales of justice must be tipped toward deterrence and 
denunciation of that particular type of offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not take the chance that has been put before us with 
the legislation, we will miss the opportunity to send a message 
to those offenders who choose to act in this way and who watch 
with some glee when a light sentence is handed down, to the 
horror of victims and to those living in fear of having their 
home invaded, their possessions stolen or to potentially face 
violence in their homes where they should feel most secure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party supports the principle of the bill which 
recognizes the public safety concerns that arise from such 
offences.  The type of offence that is portrayed in the bill 
endangers people's lives.  That is part of the entire equation. 
That is why the judiciary in some instances must be reminded of 
the important message of deterrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Home invasion is described as breaking and entering into a home 
when the invader either knows or ought to know that the dwelling 
is occupied.  Currently such an offence is considered by judges 
to be an aggravating factor.  This comes from Bill C-15 wherein 
it talks about it being an aggravating factor in cases stemming 
from break and enter, assault and drug related offences, 
depending on the particular case.  Breaking into a home when the 
offender knows that the individual is at home is a penetrating 
statement of the obvious.  That is an aggravating factor.  What 
could be more aggravating and what could be more distressing to 
an individual? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government's response to this issue has been nothing 
more than the typical Liberal legislative half measure to please 
everyone and to appear to be addressing the problem when the 
upshot of the legislation really falls far short of what it 
should be achieving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15, which was tabled in a previous parliament and is now 
back in its watered down form, does not really achieve that goal. 
It does not achieve the message of deterrence.  It does not 
achieve the goal of sending a clear direction to the judiciary or 
to the general public that public safety has to take priority 
when it comes to this type of offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of public demand for this type of legislation, the 
federal Minister of Justice had an opportunity to send that 
message to those who invade homes and to those who put their own 
lives in jeopardy.  In some sense this type of situation almost 
encourages vigilante justice because of the sheer frustration 
that exists on the part of those who have been victimized and 
those who see offenders constantly being treated leniently by the 
system.  They are then left to feel that they have no recourse 
but to take the law into their own hands.  Nobody wants to 
condone or encourage that but that is very much the sense that I 
get from talking to people who have been victims of this type of 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 had the potential to correct this anomaly and correct 
the impression that home invasion would be treated with a strong 
hand.  It did not happen.  There is a strong faction in the 
Liberal Party who would like to embrace the legislation and the 
ideal that we have to do more to deter those who choose to break 
and enter into people's homes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges definitely have a great deal of discretion when looking 
at sentencing.  It seems to me that if we break and enter on one 
occasion and we are caught, apprehended and brought to justice 
and we do it again, a two year mandatory minimum sentence sends a 
very clear and concise message that it will not be tolerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not shy away from this type of direction to the 
judiciary.  There are occasions where the offence is so serious 
and the implications so grave that there should be a legislative 
directive.  Why on earth would we shirk that duty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the Criminal Code of Canada that is very much within 
the domain of those who dwell in these hallowed halls and who 
look for ways to improve upon legislation.  The criminal code was 
a product of this Chamber many years ago.  It has been subject to 
all sorts of amendments.  Why should we for a moment believe that 
it is not proper to bring forward this type of amendment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Home invaders have been victimizing Canadians from coast to 
coast.  This is not a regional epidemic.  It has been happening 
with alarming numbers throughout the country.  Senior citizens 
appear to be those most vulnerable and those most affected.  The 
terror and the mental anguish that result from this type of crime 
is something that is very lasting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure members can relate to the fear that people would feel 
when their home has been invaded even if they were not at home at 
the time.  Their sense of security is shattered every time they 
come into their home after something like this has happened, 
where their personal belongings have been tampered with.  They 
are looking behind doors and always wanting the lights on.  I 
have heard these remarks from seniors who have been victimized by 
home invasion.  This type of mental anguish is incalculable.  It 
is difficult for a sentencing judge to take into consideration 
just how disruptive and how unsettling this is for a person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that many Nova Scotians were very pleased that the 
Conservative government of John Hamm responded by handing down 
tougher sentencing directions for home invasions.  The justice 
minister, Michael Baker, took a very lead role and position with 
his provincial counterparts in lobbying the federal justice 
minister to enact legislation to create a separate criminal code 
offence for home invasion which accomplished very much of what 
the hon. member from Calgary intends his private member's bill to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice Minister Baker argued that a separate offence could give 
the court an opportunity to send that clear message but also 
provide an opportunity for communities to more effectively 
measure the impact and therefore deal with the problem of home 
invasion specifically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have before the House a private member's motion that deals 
with marrying this exact initiative on the part of Nova Scotia. 
The bill, although impugned to effect judicial discretion, would 
very much assist judges in putting the emphasis that many of them 
would like to put on this type of offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be more comforted if there was a limitation on the 
timeframe in which the offences occurred.  I would favour the 
mandatory minimum period of imprisonment of two years if there 
was a subsequent conviction within a set period of time, for 
example five years.  This would do away with the possible anomaly 
of having committed an offence as a youth and then 10 or 15 years 
later a subsequent offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the bill in principle.  I would hope that all members 
give it due consideration and embrace this type of initiative.  I 
congratulate the member for Calgary East.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to be able to represent the people of Elk 
Island on this important debate.  I would like to begin by saying 
that it is quite inappropriate of us to have a committee 
arbitrarily say that the member for Calgary East who proposes the 
motion has the right to bring it to the House for a one hour 
debate after which it is dropped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a committee that has said we cannot even vote on this 
bill.  I want to be on record as saying that I strongly object to 
it.  I believe that on an issue of importance like this one it is 
totally appropriate for us to be able to express our opinions on 
it.  At the end of the debate process we should all be given the 
opportunity to say whether or not we favour the measure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals are against it, let them stand and say that they 
are against it.  Let them say that they will continue allowing 
people to be attacked in their homes and have their property 
removed while they are out.  That is atrocious.  I would like to 
see them stand and say that to Canadians across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak for a few minutes about the whole system 
of justice and the idea of break and enters.  I wish to emphasize 
that we need to do better right across the country in building 
into our youth when they are young a strong sense of morality, a 
strong sense of what is right and what is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened in the country?  We actually have young people 
and even adults who think that they are doing nothing wrong when 
they walk into another person's property with the intent of 
removing property, whether or not the people are there.  Where 
did that come from? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember growing up in Saskatchewan many decades ago when we 
did not even have a lock on the door of our farmhouse.  My dad 
used to say that someone could come by when we are not home and 
need to use our phone.  We left the house open so that if people 
came by to use the phone they could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no fear that someone would take our furniture.  Maybe 
we were so poor the furniture was not worth taking, I do not 
know, but it was probably as good as someone else's down the 
road.  We did not worry about those things in those days because 
there was a built-in sense of morality and community.  We cared 
for each other and we would not in any way steal from one 
another.  We have lost the sense that it is wrong to take someone 
else's property.  Somehow in our society that built-in sense of 
morality has evaporated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when I was the chairman of the Strathcona Christian 
Academy, a new private school that we started.  I was involved in 
writing our first handbook.  We patterned it after handbooks in 
other schools.  There was an instruction in one of the handbooks 
which said that students should not bring valuable property to 
school because of the danger of it being stolen.  We added in our 
book, and I am very proud that I was part of the construction of 
that book, notwithstanding that students should be careful what 
kind of property they bring to school, we expected them not to 
take things which were not theirs even if the temptation 
presented itself.  We made that very clear because in our school 
we taught more than academics.  We taught respect for one another 
and respect for property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish that we would have strong schools, strong churches and 
strong families that would pass that sense of morality on to the 
next generation so that this epidemic of break and enters and 
stealing would come to an end.  It is atrocious that we have 
allowed it to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also say that in no small way I attribute the onslaught 
of violence to all the sorts of things that have been on 
television over the years.  I read somewhere that by the time a 
student graduates from grade 12 he or she has observed an average 
of 18,000 murders on television.  How could we then be surprised 
when students grow up and simply act out what they have been 
taught all their lives, that it is okay to do that?  There is 
something fundamentally wrong.  We have lost the handle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is step one.  We should train our young people so that as 
they become adults they are responsible and respectful citizens 
who do not abuse other people and their property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lo and behold, some people make mistakes.  What should we do 
with a first time offender?  The bill that my colleague has put 
forward does not deal with first time offenders.  He is talking 
about repeat offenders.  What do we do with a first time 
offender? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My brother-in-law would be very happy if I were to mention a 
program he has worked with.  He was involved in the justice 
system in a provinces I will not identify. 
He worked hard as a volunteer in what was called restorative 
justice.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of young people who just simply make a mistake. 
They bow to peer pressure or whatever.  They with their friends 
break into a place and take things that are not theirs.  It is a 
genuine error.  Those young people are retrievable.  Those young 
people can be shown, taught and corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe putting young people in jail at that stage is 
as good as what my brother-in-law and his wife did.  They worked 
with couples and young people.  They also worked with families 
whose homes were broken into.  In conjunction with the justice 
system in the province, they brought the offender and the 
offended together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember my brother-in-law saying that one young person said 
that doing six months in jail was nothing compared to having to 
look the person in the eye whose house the individual broke into 
and finally saying sorry that he or she had made a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next stage then is restitution.  The young people stole 
something that was not theirs.  Now it becomes their 
responsibility to restore the property that was stolen.  Those 
young people, having faced the victim and having restored the 
things, are much less likely to reoffend.  This is statistically 
proven.  Generally, we do not teach people to not reoffend by 
putting them into jail.  I personally am in favour of that kind 
of restorative justice at the early stages of young people's 
lives before they become hardened criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill talks about repeat offenders.  If the young person has 
failed to learn the principles of respect before the first 
offence and, having gone through the restorative process or 
whatever is chosen for the first offence, has still failed to 
learn, now the law has a responsibility to restrain and to 
protect innocent victims.  The member is talking about the 
sentence for a repeat offender, the one who did not learn it in 
the first place, who did it once, still did not learn and did it 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a case in Edmonton where a group of thieves were 
found.  In a one week period, while on probation, they broke into 
80 homes.  What a busy week they had.  Are they incorrigible?  I 
venture to say they need to have some time to think about it.  A 
minimum of two years would not be too much for them to admit they 
were on the wrong track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember also the grievous case in Edmonton of Barb Danelsko, 
a young mother.  She and her family were sleeping upstairs in 
their house.  She heard a noise downstairs.  She thought the dog 
wanted to go out.  Dogs do that in the middle of the night.  They 
say “Please, master, let me out.  I have some need to go 
outside.”  She went downstairs.  Lo and behold there were three 
youngsters there.  Before they left, that young mother was dead. 
They attacked her with a kitchen knife when she came down.  She 
was not expecting invaders in her house at that time of the 
night.  They prevented her from seeing her children grow up. 
They deprived those children of their mother and her husband of 
his wife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to say that we need to make sure that those who 
have not learned the lesson are restrained.  A mandatory minimum 
two year sentence is the minimum that we can do to show those 
people that if they have not learned the lesson after the first 
offence, then this is what will happen.  We as a society will 
take the measures necessary to remove them from society because 
we deserve to be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to rethink its decision on whether or not 
we should vote on the motion.  We really should get this thing 
going because it is a necessary step.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Spencer (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to say something about the 
consequences of our actions and the importance that we recognize 
consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequences, as we would address them through our justice 
system, are at least in part meant to be a deterrent.  A 
consequence to be a deterrent must be serious enough to provoke 
some thought.  It surprises me today to hear that one could be 
imprisoned for life for a break and enter.  I am one of those who 
did not know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dare say the government of the day would never vote for life 
imprisonment for break and enter unless it had the full 
confidence that the likelihood of that happening was so very slim 
that it would never be the case.  Therefore, it is not a serious 
enough threat to the offenders to even consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak from the perspective of being a father of four 
children.  When I came to the point of needing to discipline 
them, the consequences needed to be serious enough that they 
really considered them ahead of the offence.  I wanted to make 
them think.  Do members know what I did?  I did exactly what the 
government pointed out it was doing.  I had a son who was a 
repeat offender in my house.  He knew I was not serious.  I 
cannot say the number of times that I would say to him “Son, you 
are grounded for life”.  I always paroled him before the week 
was over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of threat we are hearing from the government, 
that if offenders break and enter they will be liable to be put 
in jail for life.  I hardly think so.  The threat is not really 
serious and therefore is not a deterrent.  A consequence to be a 
deterrent also needs to be not only serious but needs to be 
consistent enough to be taken seriously.  Sometimes they do, 
sometimes they do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know in our justice system today that there is a huge 
discrepancy between what judges do.  On a bad day maybe they give 
a few more years.  On a good day maybe they do not give more than 
a few minutes.  I cannot believe that we would leave it totally to 
the discretion of the judge to determine from zero to life 
imprisonment and shirk our responsibility as legislators to give 
the judiciary some sort of guideline a little narrower than from 
zero to life imprisonment for break and enter.  We need to be a 
little more consistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A consequence that will be a deterrent also needs to be fair. It 
needs to be fair as it relates to the offended and to the 
offender.  This is hardly fair to the offended.  In a sense it is 
not even fair to the offender because he did not really take it 
very seriously and offended again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A consequence to be a deterrent comes from a respected, 
responsible authority.  I worked hard at that as a father.  I 
wanted to know that I had the respect of my children.  To have 
that, I had to be serious, I had to be consistent and I had to be 
fair to have them really respect me and understand that I was 
being responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed that we as a parliament so often want to take 
the easy way out and not be responsible.  It hardly seems harsh 
to me that we would consider a two year minimum sentence to give a little 
more direction for a repeat offence of break and enter. 
I support the bill wholeheartedly.

supported this bill.  I appreciate that they were able to 
understand the seriousness of this and I am grateful for their 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice the other two parties are absent.  Regretfully they do 
not seem to think this is a serious issue.  However the important 
thing is that I wanted to hear from the government side, and I 
did from the parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am totally confused by his comments regarding the seriousness 
of this issue and how the government is tackling it, the maximum 
sentence of life imprisonment and all these things, as if it was 
not a large problem.  He claimed that the government and the 
justice system were addressing it and that everything was fine. 
He admitted there was a little more problem with home invasion 
and that the government would address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had held a town hall meeting.  I went out across the country 
and spoke on radio talk shows.  The message I got was a totally 
different one.  The message was that this government did not seem 
to be listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge every member over there to go out, have a town hall 
meeting and listen to their constituents who will tell them how 
serious the act of breaking and entering is.  The parliamentary 
secretary and the justice bureaucrats are saying this issue is 
being addressed.  It is not.  It is staring us right in the face. 
We have six month sentences and 80% repeat offenders out there. 
The justice system is failing to ensure safe homes for Canadians. 
Everybody is talking about it.  It is only going to get worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am amazed that the parliamentary secretary and the government 
said that everything was fine.  It is not fine because that is 
what I have heard.  I am not going to ask for unanimous consent 
because I know I will not get it.  However this issue will come 
back because I will keep fighting for it.  It is what Canadians 
are demanding out there.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the second debate we have had on 
modernization of the standing orders in this House.  The first was 
held on March 21 in which 44 members spoke for almost 10 hours, a 
very long time, which obviously indicated a lot of interest on 
the part of members on all sides of the House.  I thank the 
members who contributed on that day to the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members are aware, the House agreed to establish a special 
modernization committee on the House rules, which has been 
meeting since that first debate.  Tonight we are actually 
participating in this debate in committee of the whole where all 
members are able to congregate around the clerk's table instead 
of the far corners of the House, as is normally the case.  That 
is something that was developed in the modernization committee on 
which the House leaders sit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that some members will speak tonight as well and add 
their contribution to the debate to give us some more good ideas 
on how to modernize the House rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last debate I gave an extensive talk on some of the ideas 
that I had on modernization.  I will not repeat them again this 
evening because obviously they are all on the record.  I am sure 
that all members read <I>Hansard</I> on a daily basis, so they are

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a moment, though, to thank all members of the 
modernization committee; in other words the House leaders of all 
parties, as well as the Deputy Speaker who chairs that committee 
so well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that we are making considerable progress.  We have 
gone a long way, but I cannot reveal the content because pursuant 
to the order of the House we are sitting in camera until our 
report is tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot in any way criticize my colleagues in other parties. 
They have been most productive.  We have worked very well 
together.  I am looking forward to the June 1 tabling of our 
report.  I am quite optimistic that we will have a number of 
changes to present to the House.  As a result of tonight's debate 
hopefully we will gather and garner new ideas and be able to add 
to that again. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said on March 21, the House has already taken several 
parliamentary reform initiatives since the beginning of this 
parliament, along, of course, with the changes that have been 
made to the Standing Orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, funds for political parties represented in the 
House have been reallocated to take into account the new 
standings in the House following the last election and, of 
course, each political party was given additional staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have provided political parties with an additional 
$900,000 in funds for items such as party research, caucus 
services, whips' offices and so on, so that they could do a 
better job for their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members office budgets have been increased by $20,000 per 
member of parliament to cover items such as salary expenses and, 
of course, other operating costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of parliament housing allowance has also been 
improved by $3,000 to cover higher accommodation costs that MPs 
face in the Ottawa housing market, which is of course very tight. 
So, accommodation costs have gone up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Library of Parliament has received an additional 
$986,000 to better support House committees. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One point that is not said enough around here is the quality of 
work performed by parliamentary committees.  I have had occasion 
to visit several other parliaments and bar none, the quality of 
the work that comes out of our committees is tremendous, 
particularly the review of legislation from the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite common to have dozens and dozens of government 
amendments after we hear witnesses and so on.  What does that 
mean?  It does not mean that the legislation was initially poorly 
drafted or some such.  It means that the system we have developed 
whereby many people make contributions to the debate makes the 
legislation better.  We should thank members who sit on the 
committee, the clerks, the research staff, the witnesses and so 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything I have described so far today have been non-partisan 
changes made by all members of the House or on behalf of all 
members of the House.  I am looking forward again to more members 
contributing tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that one member talked in the House today in a different 
context about private members' bills and how we should handle 
them.  There is a subcommittee looking at that now.  It will make 
recommendations to the modernization committee.  I am quite 
willing to hear those recommendations.  I know all other House 
leaders are as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people say that every bill should be votable.  I do not 
disagree, per se.  We have to remember, though, that a votable 
bill takes six hours of the House: three hours at second reading 
and three hours at third reading.  That is six hours instead of 
one.  It effectively means that we reduce the number of private 
members' bills that will be considered in any year by 
approximately two-thirds.  We could say by five-sixths, but it is 
not quite like that because some are votable already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that the number would be reduced by 
two-thirds.  How would we construct that?  I would like to get 
the advice of hon. members.  Perhaps, for instance, members 
should be limited to one private member's bill per parliament to 
ensure that everybody gets their turn. 
Even then they would not all get their turn but a greater 
proportion of them would.  That would be another method of doing 
it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot just say all the items will be votable.  We have to 
look at the rest of the picture and provide an answer.  I know 
that the committee is doing that now.  I thank the committee for 
the work it is doing.  I hope it will make its counsel available 
to the modernization committee so that we can take it into 
account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, those are the preliminary remarks I wanted to 
make tonight.  My parliamentary secretary will be attending later 
and making a contribution of his own.  I know the hon. member for 
Durham with whom I am sharing my time this evening would like to 
give us his ideas on modernization of House rules.  I hope 
members on all sides of the House will contribute to that 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, any comments made by members on the modernization of 
the House rules are compiled by the clerk of our committee on 
modernization.  The suggestions by members are presented to us 
and we go through them every week trying to find where there is 
consensus and where could incorporate them into the changes we 
are about to make.  Anything that is said here is obviously very 
useful to us.  It is brought immediately to the attention of our 
committee in the subsequent week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want members to know that their contribution is helpful and 
what they say tonight will assist us.  We do not go at this in a 
partisan way.  First, the way our modernization committee works 
we must have unanimity to change any rule.  If all parties agree 
then a recommendation is presented.  If one or more of us 
disagree a recommendation is not presented.  That is the way the 
modernization committee has been working and working very well, 
if I can describe it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to listening to the contributions of other 
members to the debate.  I repeat for the benefit of another House 
leader who is joining us that the advice given to us by members 
tonight, as was the case the last time as well, is extremely 
useful.  It is compiled and it is brought to the attention of our 
committee by our researcher, Mr. Robertson, who makes a list of 
all recommendations that are made, and then they are studied. The 
list also indicates who made each recommendation so that we can 
speak to those particular measures at the committee.

for the few minutes until the member for Durham takes over.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Chairman, I need a clarification.  We are in committee of the 
whole which means that there is no time limit on speeches, except 
as regarding courtesy to each other.  Also, we can speak as often 
as we wish.  Am I correct in that or not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B>  The second part is 
correct, but on the first part a motion was tabled in the House 
this morning that says two members may divide one 20 minutes 
speaking time period.  That motion was accepted this morning in 
the House.  Therefore there are 20 minute periods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Chairman, I spent about six hours 
today in the finance committee so I was not here at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B>  Perhaps I should read the 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  No, that is fine.  I have some questions of 
the government House leader.  I concur fully with the suggestion 
that perhaps members should be given one private member's option 
in a session.  I think that would work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when we were kids at camp that nobody got seconds at 
the meal until everybody had firsts.  Everybody could have 
firsts, and if there was some food left over we went back for 
seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been a member for seven and half years, since the 1993 
election, and I have never been drawn.  It is just not my lucky 
lottery day, I guess.  I have some good private members' bills 
that I would like to get on the floor and voted on.  I feel that 
they are important enough for actual decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite made that suggestion.  I am ready to write 
the computer program.  In fact I already have one.  I recommend 
that we take all members and simply randomize their order. If 
members do not have a private member's bill or a motion and want 
to pass on it, they can let their name go to the bottom of the 
list, or maybe we could have a scheme whereby we could trade with 
others so that everybody would be involved in one rotation. 
There are other members in the House who have been picked three 
or four times in the last seven years.  That is one correction I 
think would be really worth while.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another one he mentioned was that we would not have enough time. 
Very frankly I would rather have one private member's bill every 
seven years and actually have it votable so that we can make a 
decision on it than have three or four that I can just talk about 
and never do anything about.  I would not mind dealing with a 
reduced number of bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, let us take for example the private member's bill 
we dealt with today.  It was not votable, but surely after one 
hour of debate we pretty well all knew the issue.  I do not think 
that it should take more than an hour or maybe an hour and a half 
of debate before it is sent to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' bills generally are quite focused.  They are 
single issues.  If we could send them to committee and then maybe 
have them come back for another hour debate in what would compare 
to third reading of another bill, I think it would really 
expedite the matter.  Basically it would take the House two hours 
instead of one hour for one that we just debate and do not vote 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also increase the number of hours.  I have no problem 
at all with having an additional hour or two per week of private 
members' business.  I have a little problem with some people who 
have suggested making Friday private members' day.  That is 
really bad because it basically tells members it is an 
unimportant day and they do not need to be here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, if I can even be a little facetious, I have 
said to some people that I think it might not be a bad idea to 
make a member of parliament's salary in direct proportion to the 
number of hours he or she spends in the House while we are 
debating private members' business.  If we were here 50% of the 
time, we would get 50% of our salary that month.  That is a 
little facetious.  It is not a serious suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really think that some of the best ideas come forward from 
private members.  They are the ones out there listening to their 
constituents.  Those constituents have concerns.  We start 
dealing with the bureaucracy and find out that we cannot solve 
their problems, so we come here with a private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the government House leader to respond to some of 
my suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B>  That was a question that 
took four minutes, so we will go on for one minute to the 
government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Chairman, it is somewhat 
informal, so I do not mind that the question took a bit longer. 
That is all right with me.  At any rate, it does not seem that 
dozens of members are ready to make speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member knows, there is an ongoing survey of members 
in this regard.  I think it is a good idea.  I suspect all House 
leaders are looking forward to its conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member said about the three hours is not quite correct. 
It is a maximum of three hours.  For instance, we had a votable 
private member's bill last week.  I am trying to remember what 
was the subject.  We adopted it and sent it to committee after 
one hour, even if it were votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the maximum.  If we are amending the criminal code, it 
is not a bad idea if we knew it was votable to have a longer 
speech.  Perhaps we do not need that long at second reading, or 
we might want to have that long at second reading and once a 
committee goes at it we would not need that long at third 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I go back to the British example, they tend to have very 
short, if any, speeches at all at third reading on anything, even 
government bills.  It is quite common to have a government bill 
debate of five minutes at third reading.  Second reading, I would 
argue in this case, would probably be a little longer than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, as I said, I am not against per se some of these 
ideas about all of them being votable.  I was very lucky as an 
opposition member in terms of getting my name drawn.  For 
whatever reason, I always seemed to have something that was on 
the floor of the House of Commons.  Probably one of the greatest 
satisfactions I had was the motion I sponsored which was passed 
to erect a statue in honour of the Right Hon. Lester B. Pearson. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1915"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That statue beside the west block, Mr. Pearson sitting in a 
chair, if members have noticed, actually includes a design of the 
chair of the House of Commons.  That was my idea, everything, 
including that he should be sitting in a chair and so on.  That 
was my motion. I was there when we unveiled it.  The then prime 
minister, Prime Minister Mulroney, did the unveiling.  I think it 
was a tremendous exercise by an individual member.  Had I not 
done that, like other members who took similar actions, these 
things probably would not have happened.  We just cannot get 
things to move sometimes without prodding from members of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably another good example of this is the bill on 
competition.  It will be before the House this Thursday with 
reference before second reading.  The bill on competition bears 
great similarity to two private members' bills, one in the name 
of the member from Kitchener and the other in the name of the 
member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One involves gasoline pricing and competition in that regard. 
The other one involves issues regarding the misuse of Canada Post 
to send out phony things where people are alleged to have won 
something.  To claim their prize they phone a 1-900 number, which 
gives them a huge telephone bill and usually a prize of exactly 
nothing.  That bill largely covers those items.  They are private 
members' ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a minister I think this is great.  I support that entirely. 
As I said, though, in my opinion the price to be paid for it is a 
dramatic reduction in the number of private members' bills 
debated.  Perhaps that is not bad.  As my colleague said, it 
means that the more important ones will be debated, and because 
we know they will be votable, they will always be of that 
importance because otherwise we would not put them.  We would not 
want something to be put to the House to have it defeated by 
everybody because it was a very bad idea.  Of course if it is not 
votable anyway, one does not really care.  So arguably there is a 
benefit in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I think all of us should think of the effect of what 
the hon. member just asked and hopefully the committee doing the 
work will think of it, namely, should people have two or three 
tries at it before everyone has had at least one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps one way of doing it would be this:  at the beginning one 
would draw from the list of everyone who has at least one item 
for private members' business in the kitty.  We would draw, and 
as we go through the process, three or six months later we would 
draw a name and if that name has already been drawn it would be 
thrown out and we would take the next one, until we find one that 
has not been drawn.  At the beginning of a session that would not 
be a problem, but as we go along it would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we reach the end and everybody who had an item in the kitty 
has had their name drawn and other members just do not want a 
private member's item, we could start again.  We would assume the 
list is complete because we would have zero names left in the 
kitty, or at least zero names that have items in the pot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, ministers such as myself are ineligible. 
Secretaries of state are ministers at a different rank but 
similarly are ineligible.  Parliamentary secretaries while they 
are parliamentary secretaries are also ineligible, but because 
they are generally on a rotational basis serving a term of two 
years, someone could be ineligible and then a year and a half or 
two years later become eligible for the draw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever mechanism we develop should bear all these things in 
mind to ensure that it is fair for everybody.  Those are some 
ideas on how to handle that one, but I am not married to those I 
am suggesting.  I am giving them as examples of how to reform 
this.  I would like other colleagues to add to them the good 
ideas that they might have as well, and by the way, not just on 
private members' items, I hope, but on everything else we do 
around here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton Southwest, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Chairman, I was an assistant here with Ian McClelland 
before I became a member of parliament.  In terms of the 
relationship between private members' business and government 
bills, one of the researchers for the Library of Parliament told 
me that before 1911 most of the bills that were passed were 
private members' bills but that since that time there has been an 
increasing tendency to spend most of our time in the House on 
government bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The researcher felt that the system actually worked better when 
more time was devoted to private members' bills.  As the hon. 
member for Elk Island pointed out, we tend to be closer to the 
ridings than the government bureaucracies are.  Perhaps it has 
shifted too much in favour of government bills and there should 
be more time allotted during orders of the day for private 
members' bills.  Would the hon. government House leader comment 
on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Chairman, when I came here in 
1984 it was almost impossible to get a private member's bill 
voted on.  The system was somewhat different and was reformed to 
the way we have it now as a result of the McGrath committee 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the McGrath committee report the items were all 
theoretically votable, but they were votable when the debate had 
concluded.  We had one hour of private members' bills debate 
every day.  The trick at the end of the day was to talk the bill 
out, as it was called.  Then it went to the bottom of the list, 
only to reappear perhaps 18 months later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the same as killing it except that it was not really the 
same.  It was in a state of suspended animation.  With any luck, 
of course, 18 months later the House had prorogued and we were 
into a new session and it started all over again.  It was the 
same as killing it, except we were not killing it.  That is the 
problem we had then.  I think that was the absolute worst system 
one could have ever devised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system we have now is from the McGrath committee report. 
There is one member of the McGrath committee who is still a 
member of the House.  That member is the House leader for the New 
Democrats.  He is the only survivor of that committee, 
politically speaking, although there are several other survivors 
otherwise speaking.  It was a good innovation.  That does not 
mean we cannot improve it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the numbers of private members' bills passed, I know 
of some provincial legislatures that pass exactly zero private 
members' bills.  It is just not done.  Very few, if any, are ever 
passed in the Quebec provincial assembly.  It does not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I served for a number of years at Queen's Park as a provincial 
member in Ontario.  There it was a different system.  They were 
all theoretically votable, but there was so little independence 
in voting that effectively the government stood up and killed 
them every time by voting them down.  It really did not do 
anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The innovation we have here, I think, is that first of all there 
are enough of us in the House with 301 members that there is a 
critical mass of people and at private members' hour it is a lot 
harder to separate strictly along party lines.  That is a good 
thing.  It makes for members with a little bit more independence 
of thought and that works reasonably well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the numbers of private members' items, we have 
some every day, with a couple of exceptions, and hon. members 
will know that occurs if we are having the budget debate or the 
throne speech.  For the throne speech is easy to understand why 
we would not want to have any there.  It is at the beginning of a 
parliament and we have not had the private members' items in yet 
so there is no reason to have them there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to why we cannot have them at the same time we are having 
budget debates, I do not particularly object to that.  I do not 
see that there is anything particularly offensive about other 
times around here.  I do not know why we cannot simply have them 
every day.  It is effectively the case now, with a few 
exceptions.  Why not remove some of these exceptions?  I am not 
against that either.  All of those things seem to be at first 
glance good occasions to have private members' items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we will always be governed by our constitution in any 
case.  Obviously members know that we cannot have a money bill at 
private members' hour, unless we find a minister who will provide 
a recommendation from the crown, a royal recommendation.  That is 
a constitutional issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, if a bill is to generate a tax then it is even more 
complicated.  Not only must it be a minister but a minister must 
have tabled a notice of ways and means and have the ways and 
means motion adopted by the House before he or she can even 
introduce a bill to levy a tax.  The equivalent in the United 
States is that there has to be a recommendation of the ways and 
means committee.  The Canadian equivalent of that is a little 
different.  It is the same as the British in that we have 
concurrence in the ways and means motion, which is the enabling 
motion that permits a minister to even introduce taxation 
measures in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are two restrictions that I suspect will always be there 
because of our constitution, but that does not mean that there 
are not dozens of good ideas that can be addressed by way of 
private members' items. 
<P><A NAME="LINK309"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Chairman, I would like to take advantage of the 
fact that the government House leader is here because he has a 
very long memory of parliamentary procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems that I noted in my time here with respect to 
private members' business and trying to give it more opportunity 
was that often members would say, “Well, let us just vote yes 
for this at second reading and it will go to committee”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the problem with that was that the committees were 
suddenly burdened with business that they did not properly have 
the time to manage.  Some committees were burdened more than 
others.  I think, for example, of the justice committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have thought a lot about this.  I wonder what the government 
House leader thinks about restoring the old legislative 
committees.  Is there not an argument to be made for creating a 
legislative committee to receive private members' legislation to 
in some way, if you will, pre-examine it for appropriateness and 
viability before it goes on to the proper committee?  Or perhaps 
the legislative committee could handle it right on to report 
stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just seems to me, Madam Chairman, that in order to make more 
bills votable we have to find a new system that makes it possible 
to process these bills without adversely affecting the very 
limited time of committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Chairman, on the second point, 
this business about having a pre-approval by a committee, that is 
in fact what members are advocating tonight to get rid of, 
because now we have a committee that in a way screens them to 
make them votable.  It is kind of the same thing, not quite, but 
it is analogous to that, I would argue.  My feeling is that most 
people do not want that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing, though, is in regard to once a bill has been 
read a second time and sent to committee.  We did make an 
amendment a few years back whereby committees now have to report 
the bill within a certain amount of time.  Otherwise the bill is 
deemed reported anyway without amendment.  We have that in our 
present rules.  That did not exist even in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an amendment produced I think in large measure as a 
result of an innovation of the then Reform Party House leader, 
the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford.  I believe that was one 
of his innovations.  Perhaps others were involved with it too, 
but he was associated with the cause of bills deeming to have 
been reported, which made it such that bills that kind of 
disappeared into a black hole called a committee do not do that 
any more.  They go to committee but they now have to come back 
out, and the period is reasonably short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one problem that remains, though, and I guess we will 
all have to be very frank about this, and that is that private 
members' bills are more times than not all about justice.  For 
instance, on the weekly list that I was looking at Monday when I 
had a meeting with my staff, four out of the following six days 
were about justice issues.  Of course if they all were votable 
and all sent to the same committee, I think the hon. member who 
just raised the question obviously has seen what would happen 
then.  That is going to absolutely overload the system. 
Hopefully when the subcommittee makes it recommendation it will 
address that because it would make it impossible to function if 
that happened.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of a legislative committee, it is still in the rules. 
It was largely unused because it had a tremendous deficiency. The 
last time we used it was on Bill C-20 of the previous parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty with legislative committees is the following. 
Suppose we set up a legislative committee on agriculture to 
review a particular bill, like the bill we passed today on farm 
credit.  The agriculture critic and the agriculture parliamentary 
secretary and so on would want to sit on it.  All the people on 
the agriculture committee would also end up sitting on this 
special committee but there would be a different clerk.  The end 
result was the agriculture committee would be the legislative 
committee with a different clerk.  That was always the result of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a few years of this, people began to look at it. They said 
why not keep their usual clerk and the usual everybody because 
they were the people who knew something about agriculture?  Why 
was somebody else doing this and not the people who actually had 
the expertise in the area?  That is how they fell into disuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had the multiplicity of private members' items in a given 
area, we would obviously have to rethink that in a way perhaps 
like or somewhat like the suggestion made by the member who just 
asked me the question. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK310"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Chairman, 
I am sure that the government House leader will agree with me that 
in a parliament, it is advisable that members use available 
resources to inform parliament of all concerns pertaining to their 
immediate communities. Private members' bills allow that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not agree with the House leader when he 
suggests that there are enough statutory resources available. 
Resources alone are not enough, there must be no strings attached 
to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the House leader tell us how many legislative counsels 
there are at present? I do not think there are more than three; 
they are very dedicated, extremely competent and a credit to this 
House, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And does he have any idea of the timeframes that are 
involved when, as an ordinary parliamentarian, one has to 
register to have a bill drafted and would like the work to be 
performed within a reasonable time? It may take a legislative 
counsel weeks to come up with a bill that satisfies the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, we are not questioning the individuals' 
abilities, but rather their numbers. There are only three, four 
or perhaps five legislative counsels who draft amendments for the 
committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Chairman, you were yourself a member of the standing 
committee on justice for a long time; you know that many 
amendments come from committees, particularly from the justice 
committee.  Legislative counsels then draft bills which take 
considerable time. The government and the Clerk of the House of 
Commons were very reluctant to commit additional resources for 
legislative counsels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the leader agree with me that, to restore the function 
of a member of parliament and the independence of thought that must 
be a attached to it, it is important that we have a sufficient 
number of legislative counsels to ensure a speedy process with 
regard to the drafting of private members' bills? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> Madam Chairman, I do not disagree in 
principle with what the member is saying. However, as the member 
knows, the amount of money for that is not determined by the 
government, but by the Board of Internal Economy, and all the 
political parties represented on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improvements have been made; our clerk and his predecessor 
addressed this issue. The staff was increased, budget estimates 
were made, and increases were granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is also aware of what happened. Following an 
unexpected increase in the number of amendments that could be 
presented at report stage, it was taking legislative counsels a 
lot of time to draft them, sort them and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the rules having been restored—because these are not 
new rules—there may be more resources available.

the issue will be raised with the Board of Internal Economy. If 
they were not affected, we will check to see if the delays are 
still unacceptable. In any case, the Board of Internal Economy 
sits every two weeks or almost every two weeks and goes over 
these kinds of issues when they arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I now have to conclude on this issue. If the 
member is asking me if delays of several weeks and even months 
are normal, I would say no, this is not reasonable. A member 
should have the right to speak, which means, of course, the right 
to introduce a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings us to a whole new debate. 
Will a private member's bill have to be as precise as a 
government bill? Can it be amended in committee? This is a whole 
new debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these bills are to be considered much more seriously by 
the House and always be designated as votable items, then they 
will have to be as well drafted as government bills. If they are 
rarely designated as votable items, then will it be necessary? 
Maybe not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, members can always, of course, raise issues through 
motions. It does not take a legal adviser to do so. I have 
drafted enough motions to know that. Issues can be raised simply 
through motions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Madam Chairman, I am very pleased to 
be sharing my time with the government House leader.  I also want 
to congratulate him on his initiative to allow members not only 
the time in the House of Commons but in this format.  I find it 
very friendly and congenial to possibly reforming the rules of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am interested in pursuing an issue which is dear to my heart 
and I guess is an issue that has been around since parliament 
started.  That is the whole concept of the estimates process.  In 
a lot of fundamental ways parliament was formulated as a watchdog 
to focus on the whole area of government spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically an estimates process was developed.  If one studies 
the history of parliamentary democracy, most parliaments spent 
most of their time reviewing the estimates of departments, asking 
questions about why they were spending money certain ways and 
tried to ensure that governments spent taxpayer money effectively 
and efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to elaborate on the estimates for those people at home 
who may not understand the process.  Estimates come from the 
budgetary process.  The budget is presented, then individual 
departments prepare estimates.  In other words, they are 
estimating the costs of running their programs for the 
forthcoming year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 we have improvised two other fundamental reports that 
come with the estimates.  One is called plans and priorities, 
which is basically a document that looks forward two years to 
what individual departments will do.  It is not so much trained 
on dollars and cents.  It is more about their ideas and so forth 
and where they are going in the future.  I suppose one could 
actually look at the budgetary process which talks about two year 
rolling budgets, which also fits into this analysis to some 
extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other report that was added was the performance report.  The 
concept was that the performance report would be the report card. 
In other words, it listed a department's plans and priorities and 
what it said it would do.  The performance report obviously comes 
after the fact and tries to measure what a department's plans and 
priorities were and how well it measured up.  That was an add on 
to the accountability function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been in the House for seven and a half years and watching 
this process unfold, I think it is fair to say the estimates 
procedures and the review of the estimates has declined in 
importance for a number of reasons, not the least of which is 
that it is a deciphered process.  The estimates show up in 
various committees, whether it is health, transport and so forth. 
They are dealt with in very short order and a very short period 
of time is spent on them.  A lot of members do not have the 
resources or the wherewithal to get involved in the estimates 
process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very much a problem for us as members of parliament and 
how we represent our constituents.  It really gets back to the 
fundamental duties of members of parliament and what they are 
sent here for in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, the whole issue of estimates and improving how we 
handle estimates has been around a number of times.  I go back to 
Senator John Stewart who back on December 5, 1995 tabled an 
all-party Senate report.  It recommended that we establish an 
independent committee to deal solely with estimates, plans and 
priorities and the performance of reporting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then we have had two other committees of the House with 
members from across party lines.  The member for St. Albert 
chaired one of these committees along with our member from Ottawa 
West—Nepean.  Once again, back in 1998 the committee recommended 
the importance of establishing a separate estimates committee. 
There was another election but it was reported to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequent to that on May 4, 1998 another House committee, this 
time chaired by the member for Mississauga South, came back with 
the same recommendations.  These were not government committees. 
They were committees of the whole and creatures of parliament. 
They have recommended this over and over again.  Looking back at 
this there was all-party support in pursuing this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it important that we develop this in one committee?  Some 
people will say what is wrong with the process now, that we look 
at estimates and so forth?  I was in a discussion the other day, 
not only members of parliament but also the bureaucracy.  The 
suggestion came up that it would be very interesting to ask 
members of parliament, who just received the estimates recently, 
if they actually opened up the binders.  I think if we polled 
members of parliament and they were honest about it, we would 
find that it would not be a great number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be ashamed of ourselves because of that.  However 
there is something wrong fundamentally within the system that has 
created that lack of interest in that whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition there is a number of other things going on in this 
country and in the world.  We are changing technologically.  We 
are talking about government online and people are able to 
interface with a government using the Internet.  Often people now 
think in terms of horizontal issues.  I heard that mentioned 
earlier today.  We have to find a way to deal with horizontal 
issues imprinted on a system which is now working in silence, a 
vertical process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk sometimes at length about societal indicators.  We as 
members of parliament should be thinking about what it is that 
our constituents and people across the country expect of 
government.  There are things called societal indicators.  They 
want employment, a good quality of life, quality of air, et 
cetera.  There are a number of societal indicators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that we need a committee to develop a filtration system 
picking out maybe 16 societal indicators, and treasury board has 
16.  We could all sit down and argue about what we thought were 
societal indicators.  Once we agreed on the societal indicators, 
these documents could then possibly be reviewed by an estimates 
committee and members of parliament could look at the whole 
process somewhat through that litmus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that would be very useful for members of 
parliament would be the plans and priorities procedure.  They 
could interface with the bureaucracy before a plan and priority 
was established by a department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are limitations as to what members of parliament can do 
obviously.  We still have the concept of responsible government 
and ministerial responsibility.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a great place for members of parliament to have a 
significant impact, not necessarily on changing the overall view 
and direction of the government's policy but rather to look for 
things that perhaps are inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the object of the exercise is to improve culture in our 
country, is the expenditure better on CBC television or on CBC 
radio?  These are some fundamental things with which we could 
deal.  In other words, we could deal with the internal shifting 
of money within the estimate process and the plans of priority 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, the system we have today is not working well, 
even with the plans, priorities and performance reporting. Most 
members of parliament who were not involved in that process would 
say that it was not working very well.  If I were to pick up a 
performance report on any government department today I would not 
find one negative comment.  It would be like having a report card 
with all A's.  Most people would agree that if we really want 
performance reporting we should really have some failures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to members of parliament to refine the process and 
create a filtration system that each department could go through. 
We could create a litmus test for situations dealing with 
budgetary things.  Sometimes we are over budget and sometimes we 
are under budget.  This triggers questions and accountability 
arguments from members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to talk about the accountability of government and our 
ability as members of parliament to impact on the accountability 
of government.  By having an estimates committee we could develop 
an expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The counter argument is:  What is wrong with the process?  One 
committee of parliament, which is the government operations 
committee, deals with about half the government estimates. I sit 
on that committee and the operations committee is a hybrid.  It 
is not even an independent committee.  It has been coupled up 
with transport issues and the whole thing is getting lost in the 
process.  My experience on the committee is that people come for 
two or three hours to talk about the estimates, spend 
billions of taxpayers dollars and then shuffle out the back door. 
We then get back onto a legislative agenda.  That is kind of the 
norm of what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a little bit of direction, perhaps Treasury Board people 
and others could come to that committee.  We could develop a 
significant expertise on how to analyze estimates, how to report 
on them and how to change them to have some impact on that 
process of government.  Our constituents elected us to do that. 
They elected us to come here and ask about the accountability 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know a lot of members of parliament who came here in 1993 
studied estimates.  I know I did.  I went through page after 
page.  Members who have been here longer do not pay any attention 
to them at all because they feel they do not have any impact on 
the system.  Some members do not have the expertise to understand 
them, but even if they have raised questions the money has 
already been spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I keep talking about the estimates committee, which is 
inappropriate in some ways because the estimates are historical 
documents.  When we talk about estimates we are really talking 
about something that has already been processed.  The likelihood 
of changing the estimates is not of much value but the plans and 
priorities certainly are.  If we could link the plans and 
priorities process to the performance reporting process it could 
have an impact on future estimate processes and a significant 
impact on how governments spend or do not spend and how we could 
save the taxpayers money in some of these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is not new.  There has been a lot of resistance to 
moving in this direction.  Some common law countries already have 
all kinds of estimates committees.  Some have an estimates 
committee just for transport.  New Zealand has a number of 
estimates committees.  These committees study and improve the 
estimates process on a department by department basis and have 
developed an expertise in those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of this country deserve a better accountability 
framework for government.  We need to take this a lot more 
seriously than we have in the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had all party support on establishing a pilot project to 
start an estimates committee, we could deal with one or two 
departments to see how it would work.  Perhaps we could develop a 
degree of expertise to impact on the system and to talk about the 
societal indicators that people are interested in impacting on 
the government system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to change government to some extent.  The whole idea of 
silos is very difficult.  There are many bureaucrats and 
governments trying to talk about cross horizontal issues.  The 
issues of disability affect many departments.  It could affect 
transportation.  It could affect health.  It has all kinds of 
cross indicators.  Sometimes the directions of one department are 
doing something in tandem with another department when they are 
working at cross purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An estimates committee could define those problems and eliminate 
them.  It could have the power of bringing departmental officials 
forward to ensure that we alleviate some of those problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave the House with the concept that something as unique 
as an estimates committee would be useful.  Some people would ask 
why we cannot use the public accounts committee.  The public 
accounts committee is entirely a different animal because it is 
examining things that have already happened and things that have 
been reported by the auditor general.  The estimates committee is 
a forward looking committee that would examine how it could 
change government financing and how governments spend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that note, it would be my suggestion that we try to look at 
some of the recommendations made by parties of the House in the 
past and to create a pilot project in the fall involving an 
estimates committee.  We could see if we could work on this with 
a degree of co-operation from all parties.  The object of the 
exercise would be to spend taxpayer money wisely. 
<P><A NAME="LINK312"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian ALliance):</B>  Mr. Chairman, 
I have a couple questions.  I 
respect the member.  He is an accountant.  There is no doubt in 
my mind that he is very concerned about government expenditures 
and the whole process of approval and accountability after the 
fact.  However he dreameth in Technicolor.  When the finance 
minister presents a budget most of what he says, in essence, is 
already law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that less than a year ago we had a bill in the House 
respecting the Budget Implementation Act that dated back 10 
years.  That is how far back we went in implementing a budget 
provision.  Meanwhile, the finance department and the revenue 
department had been implementing those things per the date of the 
budget speech.  The hon. member, like I say, dreameth in 
Technicolor when he thinketh that he can have any impact on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to vote on the budget, we have this arcane process 
that says that no government member can vote against the budget 
because it is considered a confidence vote.  There is no 
mechanism in parliament now, according to the present rules, to 
change even the smallest part of the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the estimates, they are tabled in the House. We 
usually start the voting at 10 o'clock at night and by the time 
we are finished at 2 o'clock in the morning we have approved the 
expenditure of maybe $70 billion to $80 billion.  It sort of 
rolls off our backs like water off a duck's back.  There is never 
an adjustment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember about three or four years ago our party made an 
amendment to change HRDC's budget to reduce it by $20,000, which 
in the grand scheme of things is like changing my budget by a 
penny or thereabouts.  We said explicitly that it was for the 
purpose of making a statement to declare that parliament had 
final control over expenditures.  Every Liberal member on command 
voted against that little amendment to change the budget, showing 
that parliament did not have control over the budget process.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While I appreciate what he just said, I wish him lots of luck. I 
hope he has lots of fun with his proposals and that the 
government House leader accepts his suggestions, because I favour 
what he has said.  However I do not believe they will go 
anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Chairman, the hon. member 
misunderstood what I said.  I used the words estimates committee. 
I see the functioning of the estimates committee as having less 
to do with estimates and more to do with what are called plans 
and priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens is that every department, in addition to giving 
their estimates, gives their plans and priorities for the next 
two years.  In other words, I am not talking about something that 
is written in cement.  I agree with the member in the sense that 
once we are into the estimate process, we are pretty much into 
cement.  We ask people why they did what they did, as opposed to 
why would they do what they are planning on doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Possibly the name of the committee is wrong.  Maybe we should 
call it the plans and priorities committee.  However the object 
of the exercise has two functions: to deal with plans and 
priorities and with performance reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plans and priorities would be an interface for members of 
parliament to get involved with the process that has not happened 
yet.  In other words, the budget has not happened.  It will, two 
years from now.  The budget has not been presented, but the 
internal mechanism of departments is now planning on how they 
would spend money two years from now. It is the interface for 
parliamentarians to be able to catch up with a forward looking 
concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of it is to make departments accountable for 
their plans.  Right now, if we read their plans and priorities, 
there are great latitudes and platitudes.  Some of them are good 
and some of them are not so good, but the reality is that they 
are not much good to members of parliament because they do not 
tell them specifically how or where they would spend the money 
and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same fault exists with the performance report.  This is all 
new.  This is new in terms of parliament.  It is six or seven 
years old, but the reality is that the performance report today, 
if we read it, gives all the departments an A.  They never make a 
mistake.  It makes no mention of some of the worst scenarios of 
which all members would be aware. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The object of the exercise of an estimates committee would be to 
try to link the plans and priorities with the performance report. 
We would agree as a committee on the plans and priorities or 
disagree with them.  We would report to parliament.  We may think 
the spending plans could involve the spending of money in better 
ways if the objectives were based on societal indicators.  That 
is the concept and therefore when the performance report comes in 
we expect there to be failures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are involved in this process there are risks and with 
risks there are failures.  We are big enough to realize that.  We 
talk about letting government departments manage. We should let 
them manage.  If we let them manage, they will make a mistake 
somewhere along the line and that is fine. We understand that, 
but it should show up in the performance report. 
<P><A NAME="LINK313"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, we would all agree that 
what the member for Durham is saying is appropriate.  We want 
that.  Everything that he said about the lack of oversight on the 
estimates and the lack of oversight on performance reporting is 
certainly a shortcoming of the way government is operating and 
how parliament is operating on the committee system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However what we have to ask ourselves in the context of what the 
member for Durham is saying is how do we achieve what it is he 
wants us to achieve.  How do we make time for that special 
committee on the estimates? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the number of members of parliament, out of 
the 301 in the House, who have an interest in things financial is 
probably less than 10%.  Maybe it is more than 10%, but just 
around there.  They are spread over the finance committee, the 
government operations committee and the public accounts 
committee.  There is literally no time to use this talent to give 
the estimates the kind of attention they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would suggest, and I would like all the members here to 
consider it, is that this is all about modernizing the way 
parliament works.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe what we ought to be considering is setting up a committee 
on the estimates that sits outside the time that parliament is 
sitting, that sits perhaps during the January break which is one 
month long or perhaps sits after the House rises in June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give incentives for the expertise that we need on this 
committee of the estimates we could, as they do in the United 
States, actually pay the members of parliament who agree to 
sacrifice the time they should be in their constituencies for 
working on this committee.  We could pay them in the same manner 
that is done in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not like the idea of paying members of parliament to serve 
on committees, but this is an exceptional problem that actually 
needs to be addressed.  It requires members of parliament with 
particular interest and expertise and indeed it requires a 
sacrifice on the part of members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the member for Durham and other members here think 
about the possibility of striking a committee that sits outside 
the normal sitting days of parliament and that may even involve 
giving a special remuneration to those members who agree to sit 
on the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I thank the member for 
his comments.  I must admit that I have not put my mind to doing 
that.  My experience has been that members of parliament work 
very hard when they are here and look forward to their time back 
in their constituencies.  There are obviously some problems, but 
his opinion has merit and is probably worthy of some 
investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the member's first comment that all the people 
interested in these areas are already gainfully employed, I do 
not know if that is quite true.  If this thing could take on a 
life of its own, I suspect that once people got the impression 
they could have some impact on the way governments spend in the 
future it would possibly be more popular than the other two 
committees he talked about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another function of creating this committee and its interface 
with some of the other ideas about societal indicators and 
horizontal issues as opposed to vertical issues is basically to 
raise awareness.  What would come with that pilot project would 
be some kind of education process for members of parliament. 
Treasury board officials or others would explain the process and 
how they could impact it.  It would be a very powerful tool. 
People would warm up to the idea once they understood that they 
had an impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen the reverse scenario.  People came to this place in 
1993 and were all keen about these things.  Now that keenness has 
declined and people are not interested and have drifted away to 
other things.  This would be a great forum to attract members who 
are keen and idealistic about changing things.

experience I have endured in trying to address and get a point of 
view across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent three and a half years going across the country from 
coast to coast speaking on every radio talk show that I could.  I 
had townhall meetings and I had Canadians expressing their views. 
I came to the House, supposedly a democratic House, and with one 
swat it was wiped out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Gone.  People out there are thinking 
and saying something about this.  There is a viewpoint out there. 
If a person does not agree with a viewpoint, that is fine.  If 
the government does not agree, it should not allow the whole 
Canadian voice to go out the window with one swat.  We are a 
little concerned.  Now what?  I stand here shaking my head and 
asking now what.  What do I do with the bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One member has been in the House seven and a half years and has 
never been allowed to speak his mind.  Now what should I do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  I spoke my mind on yours, though. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Is that right? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  I spoke my mind too.  The question is 
what should I do now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Was it voted on or not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No, it was not.  That is the frustration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  No, because the committee did not make 
it votable.  There are four people sitting out there deciding 
what should be on the table.  There is something wrong with the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have identified this issue and the government House leader 
has come here and said there is an ongoing survey.  I do not 
know, but maybe my colleagues can remind me.  In the last 
parliament did a survey come out on the same issue, on whether 
private members' bills should be in committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a new member.  I was not experienced on private members' 
business so I did not fill out that one.  I have strong views now 
on how the system works.  I strongly believe that if a member 
works hard for two or three years to get an issue before the 
House, we owe it to the member that the issue be votable.  There 
is no point in doing three and a half years of work otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  We agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  I know the member agrees.  I just 
heard the member say he agrees, but the question is:  Will those 
who have the power to make the changes agree?  That is the point. 
I do not know.  Frankly speaking, after listening to the 
minister, I do not know whether he will agree to this votable 
bill.  He has put out a survey.  So what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sat on enough committees that have been chaired and have 
seen manipulation take place.  Whatever the government side 
wanted, the frontbench wanted, it was done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  You are supposed to be non-partisan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  What do you mean by non-partisan?  I 
suppose we can use ordinary language since we are in committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  We cannot swear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Then stop heckling me.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make all private members' bills votable.  Interestingly I 
heard the government House leader raising objections that it will 
take too long.  He asked how many hours and what we should do. He 
also said that it would tie up resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the government House leader raised these issues I see 
reluctance on his part.  He is trying to say that this cannot be 
done.  I am telling him everything can be done if it should be 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that 301 members of parliament represent 301 
constituencies and speak on behalf of their constituents.  Even 
the Prime Minister phoned a bank on behalf of his constituency 
and proudly said that he was working for his constituents.  The 
fact of the matter is that we are working for our constituents, 
but if we are muzzled, if we cannot raise anything after spending 
so much time on it, what is the point?  We must be objective 
about it.  Let us make them votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point in time we should put no restriction on it.  They 
should just be votable.  It is common sense.  The government 
House leader said it and I agree with him.  I do not want to put 
forth a bill that will be defeated.  I will look pretty stupid if 
I put forth two votable bills that are defeated.  Maybe I could 
come along and put forth three bills.  In the beginning I could 
be very proud, but I can say very rapidly that I will become a 
laughing stock if my bills are not acceptable all round. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question that counts.  Should private members' bill be 
subject to a free vote?  It would be best to have private 
members' bills votable but they should be free votes.  If they 
are not free votes, they fall back on to the government agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be far more advisable for such bills to reach committee 
stage to consider their good elements.  One good thing about 
committee is that witnesses are called before it and provide a 
broader view of what people are saying.  At the end of the day, 
whether or not it becomes law, I agree the government has been 
chosen but at least we know that good points in a bill have been 
picked and the voice of Canadians has been heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have all private members' bills votable.  They should be 
free votes.  It is not binding on the government.  The free vote 
would only say it is going to committee.  Once it goes to 
committee, we can take the good points and filter out those that 
do not fit or make a slight amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we start doing this we will have an argument from the 
government House leader saying that it will tie up resources, 
that they do not have the resources and the committees will be 
tied up.  I do not think so.  At the end of the day we can do it, 
if we want it to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am totally opposed to the subcommittee on private members' 
business.  I have been through that subcommittee and I can only 
say that I will not appear before it again. I will not appear 
before those four people to try to tell them what I am doing on 
behalf of my constituency.  I felt like a bloody fool. I know 
that is not parliamentary language, but I do not feel that I 
should appear before four people to represent my constituents.  I 
do not feel that subcommittee should be made available.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is a frivolous bill the House leader could sit and explain 
to the member that it has no chance.  The bill could be weeded 
out through common sense.  If not, we should let it go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government has two or three defeated bills the opposition 
would love it and could play on it during election time.  Members 
must therefore work hard to make sure their bills are passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all come here to work.  We do not come here to play a media 
game.  We come here to work and we put in a lot of hours.  I put 
in a tremendous amount of hours behind the scenes on these 
things.  It is not a media circus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that at the end of the day it will settle down and we 
will find a happy medium.  The problem is that we are not letting 
things rise to the top because we are putting up barriers.  The 
government House leader says there are not enough resources and 
that a bill may tie up the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did a quick calculation regarding private members' bills.  Let 
us say we have a votable bill and are deciding whether to take 
one, two or three hours to debate it.  If we have a maximum of 
two speakers on such a bill it would take the five parties two 
hours to debate it.  It is as simple as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two speakers is enough.  My colleague made a good point when he 
said two speakers could put forward their own and their party's 
position.  He is right.  We do not need three or four speakers. 
Two speakers could present the gist of an issue.  After that it 
becomes repetition.  I therefore recommend two hours for private 
members' bills to become votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader said a lot of private members' bills deal with 
justice and could therefore tie up the justice committee.  Let us 
think for a second.  What is wrong with setting up justice 
subcommittees?  There are 301 members of parliament.  Why should 
the main committee be stuck on this?  The Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade could not handle all its 
work so it created subcommittees.  What is wrong with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice is an issue on the minds of Canadians, and members of 
parliament are bringing questions to the justice committee.  Why 
not have subcommittees?  Once the justice issues settle down we 
will perhaps no longer need subcommittees, but let us not have 
restrictions.  There are solutions to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address another point.  House leaders, government 
ministers and private members put forward bills and then we are 
forced to stand and do a lot of huffing and puffing and all that 
kind of stuff, and the parliamentary secretaries do not have the 
foggiest idea.  We should have a question and answer period for 
bills that are tabled.  Dialogue is more important than simply 
making statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speeches should be followed by a question and answer period, 
with extended time for the Prime Minister, the Leader of the 
Opposition and the members tabling the bills.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sat here at times and heard statements I did not agree 
with.  I would have liked to offer my point of view but could not 
because there is no question and answer period.  I believe there 
should be a question and answer period after every speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a house of debate.  This is not a place to sit, make 
statements and then go away.  We want to debate the issues.  That 
is why we are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My third point, and this is quite a contentious one, is 
committees.  The way our committees are structured must be 
addressed to better deal with the issues.  If we are to send 
private members' bills to committee we must structure committees 
to be able to deal with them.  We are all here to see that things 
improve.  We are all speaking for Canadians.  We must therefore 
take a serious look at committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know which government members formerly sat on this side 
as the opposition, but I am sure they know that sitting in a 
committee is very frustrating.  At times I have gone to my leader 
and asked him to take me off committees.  I find it hopeless.  I 
asked him to send me where I could do something useful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot do anything the way this committee is structured.  No 
one is interested in listening.  The witnesses all favour one 
point of view.  Government legislation needs to be pushed through 
so everything is done accordingly.  Ministers come to the 
committee and make a speech, and I have three minutes to ask them 
questions.  What can I ask in three minutes?  Nothing.  Then the 
ministers get to say they have set up a committee to address the 
issue.  The committee tables its report and it ends up on the 
shelf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have this notion that parliamentarians are not 
effective.  As far as I am concerned, the protests in Quebec City 
reflected the feelings of the Canadian public that parliament is 
irrelevant.  Maude Barlow has said quite clearly that she feels 
parliament is irrelevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in Geneva I heard United Nations bureaucrats saying 
that they, and not parliamentarians, speak for the people because 
they talk to them better.  There is a growing mindset out there 
that it is okay to bypass parliament.  Why?  It is because of the 
way parliament is structured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad we are having this debate tonight.  There are good 
points coming from all sides.  The hon. member made a very good 
point about the estimates.  He is not comfortable because the 
estimates come in and go out and billions are spent and gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot 
said something about being paid for sitting on committees and I 
have a hard time agreeing.  I am not here to make money.  I came 
here to make a contribution.  I had quite a comfortable job 
before I came here.  We need to make this contribution.  I am 
sure 99% of members of parliament are here to make some kind of 
contribution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now look at committee structure and recommendations on 
how to make committees more effective.  First, we must get 
parliamentary secretaries off the committees.  I call them the 
whips.  They sit there and control what happens.  We should also 
rotate committee chairmen so that government members do not 
always occupy the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government controls committees but does not give them power. 
One may wonder if at the end of the day the recommendations of 
committees are binding on the government.  They are not, and yet 
the government wants to control the committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I totally enjoyed making this point because of how I feel about 
it.  I will leave it at that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK315"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I 
listened with great interest to what our colleague had to say. 
Some of the things he said I have great sympathy for.  Some I 
have less sympathy for, but I was concerned about his tone.  Most 
members this evening have avoided blaming whatever faults there 
are in the system, and no system is perfect, on the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that in a majority parliament the majority has a good 
deal of sway.  However I honestly believe that in the end the 
operation of this place depends on the co-operation of all 
parties and members.  When we have unanimous consent on an issue 
almost anything can be done, as we all know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member's comments on a few things.  We 
need all parties to make committees work.  I believe televising 
committees gives them more power and influence.  Public input 
carries more weight when it is televised across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time I was involved with discussions about the 
televising of committees there were all sorts of hang ups, 
including those of leaders of the opposition parties, about 
whether it would make committees freer than they are at present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member would commit to televising committees 
more than they are now.  Would he compromise a bit on the views 
of his House leader and other House leaders so that we can get 
our committees out to the Canadian people through television? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point relates to committee travel.  Our committees 
have more influence when they travel, and it has nothing to do 
with the standing orders.  Visiting the regions of this great 
country is not only the right thing.  It allows committees to 
carry more moral authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was parliamentary secretary to the government House leader for 
two years.  When I was last involved with travel arrangements in 
the House the most common reason for not travelling was lack of 
unanimous consent by the opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member if he would work with his party and other 
opposition parties to make it easier for our committees to 
travel.  It would give them more strength.  I understand the 
difficulties the smaller parties have with committee travel, but 
it is a practical thing and has nothing to do with the standing 
orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to see more formal use made of the small 
quorum committees already have for hearing witnesses and 
receiving testimony.  We do not need a full quorum to receive 
testimony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it is difficult for the small parties to staff 
committees.  However if they had the confidence of their House 
leaders they could give committees the authority to operate for 
several meetings, knowing there would be only five or six members 
and that the number would vary with the size of the committee. 
They could then hear testimony and report back.  That would feed 
back into the travel arrangements as well.

<A HREF="#LINKT120"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned the formation of subcommittees.  That 
is very special in this parliament.  The subcommittees are 
effectively small equivalents of our large committees, but I 
think committees operating comfortably with a small quorum would 
work.  It would be practical and would not need a change to the 
standing orders.  It would simply need the willingness of the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next thing would be to strengthen the liaison committee. The 
liaison committee is the committee of chairs of committees, which 
I believe should have much more influence over the operation of 
committees.  To give you an example, I have been to the liaison 
committee as chair of a committee with a unanimous direction of 
my committee, including the unanimous direction of each of the 
parties opposite, only to have what I proposed annulled by the 
opposition members on the liaison committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Or, going back to the power of the liaison committee, it is the 
liaison committee's requests for committees to travel that are 
annulled by opposition parties when they come to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member work with me to strengthen the liaison 
committee and through it strengthen the role of members of 
parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, this is much more to do with the government, that is, to 
have the chairs of committees being given status equivalent to 
that of parliamentary secretaries.  I believe it would be a 
simple step that would encourage members to seek the chairs of 
committees and to stay longer in their positions as committee 
chairs to get some continuity between years.  It would give them 
more confidence and as a result would strengthen the committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member be willing, rather than simply blaming the 
government side, to work with his party and the other opposition 
parties to strengthen committees in ways such as those? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Chairman, my colleague from the 
NDP is telling me to say yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It's the only way I can get in on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Chairman, actually he is 
absolutely right.  For the first time I am hearing some positive 
suggestions on the committees.  On all the suggestions that have 
been made I do not have any difficulty, except maybe a caveat 
here or there, but on the general scheme of things, no.  A caveat 
for argument's sake on TV, yes.  I think it is a good idea.  It 
is accountable.  We will probably have to be accountable for 
committee travel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think travelling is a good idea because we want to hear from 
Canadians and not all Canadians can come here.  However, I do 
have a problem with travel.  A judgment has to be made on travel. 
We cannot just have blind requests coming from every committee. 
When I was vice chair of a committee I definitely looked at the 
purpose of the travel, how it worked and what the advantages 
were.  I will tell members that I did extensive travelling on the 
foreign affairs and international trade committee on the WTO 
hearings.  I thought we were totally wasting our time and our 
money at some of the places we went to because the input was 
hopeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree, but what I am saying is that there is a need to sit 
down and review it and see if this travelling we are doing gives 
Canadians a voice.  I do not have an objection to it, but every 
travel request should be looked at to see if it functions within 
the broader objective of getting what we want to get at.  At 
times we are denied travel because the government is muscling its 
majority and not giving it to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On continuity, yes, there is nothing wrong with it.  We do need 
to have continuity in a committee.  Also, the idea of smaller 
committees is good.  We need to have smaller committees to be 
effective.  What the member is saying to me is that he recognizes 
that committees need improvement and that all members of 
parliament, not only the opposition members but every member of 
parliament, should be feeling that they are contributing to that 
committee and doing an important job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry, but right now if we were in the government and we 
had a parliamentary secretary over there, the hon. member would 
probably be standing up saying the same thing to me and saying to 
take the parliamentary secretary off, because then the government 
would not control it.  So the hon. member is right.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to 
speak.  If I may ask the indulgence of the House, I would like to 
thank the Tory caucus staff and the New Democratic caucus staff 
for holding a wonderful birthday party on the sixth floor and I 
will say happy birthday to the hon. member whose birthday was 
celebrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a more serious note, talking about committees, I would like 
to ask the hon. member from Calgary a question in regard to the 
effectiveness of a committee.  One thing I feel very proud of is 
my work on the fisheries and oceans committee from 1997 to 2000. 
Out of that committee we produced 13 reports, 8 of them 
unanimous.  The one I am most proud of is the east coast report. 
As we all know there was a crisis in the cod fishery and the 
ground fishery on the east coast.  That report cost Canadian 
taxpayers $182,000.  We travelled extensively throughout Atlantic 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All five parties unanimously agreed to every single word of the 
report.  When we moved consensus of that report in the House of 
Commons through a vote, guess what happened?  The same Liberals 
who signed the report and agreed to every single word voted 
against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question, then, is this:  what are we telling the people we 
spoke to?  We spent an awful lot of their money listening to 
them.  We spent an awful lot of their money travelling in 
helicopters and on hotels and for meals, et cetera.  Those people 
spent a considerable amount of their energies and efforts coming 
to the committee to listen, to talk to us and to pour out their 
stories. One man near Pouch Cove poured out his heart about the 
fact that he only had 18 cents left in his bank account because 
he was running out of TAGS money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals were there.  They heard the stories.  The 
parliamentary secretary heard them.  We made a report.  It was 
unanimous.  We sent it on to the House for consent and the same 
Liberals that worked on that report then voted against their own 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of committee work.  It is essential to what we 
do as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question, then, is very clear.  When this happens in Canada, 
does that not send a very negative message to Canadians?  We are 
saying we will listen to them, do a unanimous report, bring it to 
the House and then the government side will ignore it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Chairman, frankly I have no 
comment except to say that this is exactly what I am saying.  We 
feel that after working so hard in the committees at the end of 
the day it does not go anywhere.  The member has given a dandy 
example of it.  Then we ask what we were doing on the committee. 
This applies to the members on the government side as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not in a boxing match.  We are trying to see how we can 
really work this out with suggestions from this side and that 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point he indicated about committees was to say how 
committees can be ineffective.  Maybe the government did not want 
it.  If it did not want it, its members could have been told. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need effective committees.  The member is right.  He has used 
an excellent example.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Chairman, it 
is a new experience for me 
to rise closer to the Chair and to talk from the first row. I felt 
it was important for me to participate in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those people watching us tonight on 
television, I would like to explain that this debate is focused on 
a review of the standing orders of the House of Commons. It is 
therefore a debate that concerns all parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not agree with my colleague who just spoke and who 
suggested that decisions are not made in parliament. 
I myself have not yet lost my illusions as a member, and I still 
believe that it is possible for all members to work together to 
make parliament a place where real decisions are made.

<A HREF="#LINKT122"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For parliament to become a place where real decisions are 
made, we obviously have to change a few things, because the way 
it is working now, members do not trust parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to ask every parliamentarian how the caucuses 
work during the Wednesday meetings and how unsatisfied the 
members are with the way the parliamentary system is presently 
working, I think that the dissatisfaction index would be 
very high in all parties, on the government side as well as on 
the opposition side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite disturbing when one thinks of it, because the 
duties of a member should normally inspire confidence. 
Members are rather well paid to carry out their duties. They hold 
socially prominent positions, but when asked to assess their 
work, members of parliament express a considerable degree of 
dissatisfaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This feeling of dissatisfaction comes from the belief that 
we cannot change things around and there is no room for a member 
of parliament to become a true spokesperson for his or her 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have jotted down some things, since our House leader, the 
member for Roberval, your friend, Mr. Chairman, said that the 
clerks will be taking notes tonight on what members say and that 
a report will be submitted. So, this should be a real opportunity 
to change things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have thought about the five things I would like to change. 
We all know that we cannot bring 50 changes about, that is not 
how members work and the system works; we could not deal with 
dozens of changes at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if, as the member 
for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, who loves parliament, who has yet to 
lose his illusions, and who is quite happy as a member of 
parliament, I were asked if there is anything else I would like 
to do beside being the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, I would 
say no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe I would not mind, from time to time, sitting in your 
chair, Mr. Chairman, but for the main part, I am very happy as 
the member representing the riding of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. I 
find my work very rewarding and I love the people of Hochelaga— 
Maisonneuve. I also love the relations I have with all of my 
colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to suggest five changes, however. 
First, we must have confidence in the fact that we are producers 
of laws. We chose to live in a society where it is believed that 
all people are equal. We chose to live in a society where the 
rule of law is paramount and where social relationships are 
enshrined in laws. We are parliamentarians whose first concern is 
to produce laws. This is why bills are so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish all members could, once a year, produce a bill that 
would be voted on. I make a distinction between bills and 
motions. 
I think that, over the span of a year—there are 365 days in a 
year—which is divided into two parliamentary sessions, the 301 
members of the House should have the opportunity to introduce a 
bill which, of course, would reflect a concern of their 
community. That bill would go through a three stage process and 
then be voted upon. The fact that the member would win or lose 
that vote is not what is important here. The purpose of a private 
member's bill is to tell the government “There is, in my 
community, such and such a concern that needs to be brought to 
your attention”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And this is also true for members of the government 
majority. Let us not think that government members are satisfied 
with the way things work. 
We will certainly hear from members who are called backbenchers. 
I do like this expression, because a backbencher simply does not 
exist. We are all members of parliament who have the same 
responsibilities and who enjoy the same trust from our fellow 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some dissatisfaction because we do not feel that we 
can really change things. One way to give more freedom to members 
of parliament so that they can truly be spokespersons for their 
communities would be to allow them to introduce bills that would 
be votable items.

<A HREF="#LINKT123"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make a distinction as regards motions. In my opinion, 
motions should not automatically be votable items. If a member so 
indicates, then the motion should be voted on, of course. The 
member would then use up his turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that, in a given year, each member have the 
possibility of triggering a debate on a motion or a bill 
reflecting a concern of his or her community. During the course 
of our parliamentary mandate—assuming that it would last three 
or four years—we would have three or four opportunities to 
introduce bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sub-Committee on Private Members' Business circulated a 
questionnaire, which members of parliament had to fill out by 
April 27 and in which they were asked if they thought that this 
should be done by party. I do not want some time allotted to the 
Bloc Quebecois to discuss bills, because party politics are such 
that it would always be the most important bills, electorally 
speaking, that would be debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example. In 1995, I introduced a bill to 
recognize same sex spouses. This was a controversial and 
relatively new issue on which there was no consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not upset with the government, but do you know what 
subterfuge it used?  The member for Saint-Léonard, who was the 
leader of the government at that time, called a vote at 11 
o'clock on Monday morning.  Because this was a controversial 
bill, there was not one minister in the House to vote on it, 
except the member for Hamilton East, who was responsible for 
Canadian Heritage and who showed great political courage.  She 
was the only member of Cabinet to vote in favour of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying this to blame the government, but if we do 
not have strict rules that are equitable and applicable to all 
MPs, certain controversial matters will never get discussed.  In 
a democracy, just because a question gets only minority support 
at one point in time does not mean that it cannot gain majority 
support at some other time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, if we want our fellow citizens and our fellow MPs 
to have confidence in the parliamentary process, we have to allow 
bills to be debated and voted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment I would like to propose relates to 
parliamentary committees.  When I was first elected as an MP, I 
was not even 30 unlike you, Mr. Chairman.  Let us recall the 
situation.  Mr. Bouchard was the leader of the Bloc Quebecois at 
that time.  At the first Bloc caucus, he told the members “the 
place within the parliamentary system where an MP can really make 
his presence felt, where he can show what he knows and what he is 
capable of, is the parliamentary committee”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A parliamentary committee is not supposed to be partisan.  It 
is the only place we are supposed to work without any partisanship 
for the good of our fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that parliamentary committees become a tool of 
the government.  For parliamentary committees to become a truly 
non-partisan working place, three conditions must be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members appointed to these committees must not be removable. 
The whip must not be able to change them depending on whether 
or not he is happy with the work they have done.  Members must 
remain on committees for the duration of the parliament and they 
must report only to the parliamentary committee to which they 
are assigned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, committee chairs must be elected by secret ballot by all 
members of the committee.  It is not necessary for a committee 
to be chaired by a member of the government majority.  This may 
be the case, but the chair can be a member of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of a member with extensive experience 
who is very knowledgeable about a subject and who has the trust 
of his colleagues.  Chairing a parliamentary committee is a 
self-sacrifice because one gives up one's speaking time and takes 
on responsibility for management and administration.  The work 
of a parliamentary committee involves a great deal of 
administration. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2050"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT124"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if one has the trust of others as chair, if one is elected 
by secret ballot, and if committee members are not removable 
during the parliament, I believe that we have a guarantee of 
impartiality which will serve everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, my colleague said that there is a problem with 
committees' travels.  I agree with him because, too often, 
opposition members have taken a parliamentary committee hostage 
over travel matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that permission for a committee to travel should 
be based on unanimity.  The rule of the majority should apply, 
because it is important that committees be able to travel. 
There are costs associated with democracy and there are costs 
when a committee travels. 
We cannot, on the one hand, hope that Canadians may have a forum 
to express their views and that we may become true spokespersons 
for our constituents and, on the other hand, still think that 
everything must be done in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Thursday afternoon, the government will be submitting its 
bill on new reproduction technologies to the Standing Committee 
on Health, on which I sit. I will be begging for the committee 
to be authorized to travel across Canada in order to find out 
what Canadians, but not only Canadians, think of this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, this is another way for the committees to become more 
effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My third suggestion is very important. As a member, I presume 
that I have the trust of my constituents and that the trust they 
put in me sometimes leads me to act as a arbitrator. 
I know that the government member for Beauce works very hard for 
the Liberal caucus. I hope that members will be provided with 
financial support for community organizations to the tune of 
around $1 per constituent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, if I had $90,000 or 
$100,000—which is not a whole lot—I could as a community leader 
elected by the people give $3,000, $4,000 of $5,000 to a 
community organization and tell its members “On behalf of my 
fellow citizens, I am offering a small amount of money to help 
you carry on. It is our way, as members of parliament, to keep 
an eye on what is going on in our communities”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we would have to be held accountable. 
I would not have a problem if, once a year, I were asked to 
state in the local papers using my own advertising budget how I 
spent the $90,000 or $100,000 I am allocated, and my fellow 
citizens could know democratically how this money was spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now raise another point, which is the speaking time MPs 
should be allowed.  I am not in a good position to say that, 
because, obviously, everyone knows that I like to talk a lot and 
that I generally use all the time allotted me.  However, I think 
it can be said that in 20 minutes it is possible to cover the 
issue of a bill fairly well.  I do not think speeches would have 
be limited to two speakers per party, since there may be a 
subject more than two people from a single party would like to 
speak on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say a 20 minute speech in general terms.  But when we are at 
third reading, since we have become familiar with the principle 
of the bill, the bill has been examined in committee, and, 
generally speaking, we know the amendments the opposition 
parties want, I think we should be allowed 30 minutes, plus ten 
minutes for questions and comments, to have an in depth debate. 
Generally, when we are at third reading it means the bill is 
likely to be passed and is likely to apply to society as a 
whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, in summary, I would like all bills to be votable items and 
all members to be able to introduce a votable bill once a year, 
which would mean three or four bills per mandate. 
I make a distinction between bills and motions because motions 
involve less work than the drafting of a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the members' attention to the fact that, these last 
few years, we did not always have the resources we needed as 
parliamentarians. We ought to remember the time when we had only 
three legislative counsels here, in the House of Commons, to 
draft all the amendments proposed in committee and all the bills. 
It was absurd. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2055"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT125"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were reputable legislative counsels who paid dearly 
for their desire to serve their members well because, 
unfortunately, certain members of this House made representations 
that cost these people their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to see to it that these legislative counsels 
are independent, that their only concern is their relationship 
with the members they serve and that, as parliamentarians, we 
have all the resources we need to ensure that the drafting of a 
bill does not take three, four or five months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Chairman, I want to address one small criticism to you, 
a friendly criticism. 
You are my respected friend and everyone knows of your 
willingness to serve this House.  However when, taking a 
practice at Westminster as your inspiration, you expressed the 
desire to limit Parliamentarians' right to express themselves on 
the matter of the amendments, to not allow certain amendments to 
be introduced before the House but through the committees, 
and when you restricted members' access to introducing 
amendments, it is my feeling that, although far from your 
intention, you have done considerable harm to parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bill is something dynamic, and it should be the members' 
prerogative to decide whether they want to bring amendments 
before a committee or before the House.  Taking your cue 
directly from Westminster—and we are aware of just how much you 
admire the mother of parliaments—could unfortunately lead to our 
being gagged as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am bringing all our good feelings for each other into play to 
call upon you to review this decision, to be the true small-l 
liberal one needs to be in a democracy, to allow all 
parliamentarians to use all possible forums to bring amendments 
before this House, without their having to be screened by a 
committee or subjected to any restriction other than the need to 
be compatible with the bill in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all I have to say.  I hope our debate will be a 
profitable one.  I am very confident that the government and all 
of the opposition parties want to work together to ensure that 
MPs' duties are rehabilitated.  If the duties of the MPs are 
rehabilitated, then all politicians will benefit. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK318"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I thank 
the member for his comments.  They were well thought out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate him for speaking without reading.  It is one of 
the unwritten traditions of parliament that speeches should not 
be read.  Written material can be referred to for quotations or 
detailed technical information.  The enthusiasm and sincerity 
comes across much more clearly to people when notes are not read, 
so I congratulate the member for that.  All members could learn 
from that.  Possibly our committee should consider maybe applying 
that because I would rather see members faces than the top of 
their heads when they are reading a speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to just question the hon. member briefly on the private 
members' business.  I had much success in the 35th parliament.  I 
had three or four items selected, three of them were votable.  In 
the 36th parliament I had none selected.  So it has been either 
feast or famine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that there are more members than we could 
possibly deal with all votes and that is not possible.  If we do 
not get our item past second reading and the session ends, our 
matter dies and we have to go back into the lottery et cetera. We 
can only have an item carried forward from a session if it has 
passed second reading.  Then it could be reinstated at the same 
spot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that there are far too many members and far too many 
ideas out there for which to do justice. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2100"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT126"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the solution would be to establish more rigorous 
criteria so we could come up with legislation that would be more 
innovative and timely and which would capture the imagination and 
support of a significant number of members in the House not just 
at committee.  I believe the entire House must opine on the 
calibre of legislation in order to allow it to go the full 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest and support a process where the private members' 
business committee would not deem votability but rather assess 
criteria compliance.  The House would then deal with whether the 
bar on a particular bill or motion should be set higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 155 dealing with health warning labels is an example 
of a motion where a bill would not have been any more concrete. 
We need more relevant bills regardless of the fact that we have 
strong criteria.  It would be nice to know that if a bill or a 
motion meets the criteria and passes the hurdle it will get a 
hearing.  It would raise us all to a higher level in terms of 
quality of bills and motions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to refer to the 
questionnaire that the clerk of the subcommittee on private 
members' business distributed to all members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A major distinction was made between a subjective and an 
objective criterion. We should rely on an objective criterion. 
This means that, once a year, all members should have the right 
to see one of their bills or motions voted on. If we start 
setting criteria, we might ask ourselves what is an innovative 
measure, an original measure, an unprecedented measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each member of parliament and each political party may have a 
very subjective view of what is an unprecedented, original and 
innovative measure. 
We must start from the premise that all members of parliament 
are committed to the common good. Not all of them will want to 
introduce a bill, but we must start from the principle that they 
all want the common good and that they speak on behalf of their 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bill may be extremely important to my community, but less so 
for another one. Unfortunately, this cannot be used as a 
criterion to accept or reject that bill. All members of 
parliament must be able to play their role as legislators and be 
able to have a vote on an issue that concerns their community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member began his remarks by saying that, in the 
previous parliament, three of his bills became votable items, 
but our colleague here did not have any bill become a votable 
item in recent years. This is why parliamentarians do not all 
show the same interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, just about all of us represent 80,000 people.  We all have 
the same salary.  We all have the same legitimacy.  If all 
members had the opportunity once a year, that is, three or four 
times in their mandate, to have a bill or a motion voted on, I 
think we would be very happy with the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by telling you that we should do the analysis. 
I have no doubt that, if we asked the Chair and the clerks how 
many really outlandish bills there have been, that would 
embarrass us as parliamentarians over the past 10 years, I for 
one have not seen many that were really off the wall.  It is 
true that I have seen some that did not reflect my political 
philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That explains why in a democracy we belong to different 
political parties. 
However, I think the members are sufficiently mature to prepare 
well drafted responsible bills that reflect their community. 
Very few bills have been totally crazy and a discredit to 
parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a clarification 
for the committee of the whole.  Mr. Bill Rodgers, media 
relations for the leader of the Conservative Party, is 
celebrating his birthday this evening.  I just wanted to extend 
congratulations to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member from the Bloc is this.  The 
other day I had a bill drawn actually from the committee and it 
was deemed non-votable. 
Thirty bills and motions were combined and the committee only 
picked seven.  Mine, unfortunately, was not of them.  It 
concerned hepatitis awareness month and it was a non-monetary.  I 
thought it was a great idea.

<A HREF="#LINKT127"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was not my idea.  It was the idea of a lot of people 
who are suffering from different forms of hepatitis.  They asked 
me if I would, as a member of parliament, be able to do 
something.  They said that we have breast cancer awareness month, 
this month and that month but that we do not have anything for 
hepatitis.  Over 700,000 Canadians have been inflicted with this 
disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I moved the bill but it was deemed non-votable.  We had the hour 
debate.  All opposition supported it wholeheartedly.  The 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health supported it, 
but he said that since the department said no that he had to say 
no to make it votable.  The parliamentary secretary, the only one 
in the House that day, stood up and voted no, making a tremendous 
amount of people very angry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good news about this bill is quite clear.  The minister 
himself decided, through whatever parameters he is allowed to 
operate, and the parliamentary secretary said it yesterday as a 
statement in the House and today in a conference in Montreal, he 
stated to all these people that the month of May henceforth will 
be known as hepatitis awareness month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally congratulate the minister for taking the initiative 
to do that.  Over 700,000 Canadians also thank the minister for 
acknowledging their concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I wonder is why we had to go through that whole process 
when it was a straightforward bill.  I had 100 signatures from 
both sides to get it approved yet it was deemed non-votable.  I 
tried to make it votable but the government said no.   The 
minister then turns around and says yes.  I thanked the minister 
for that publicly but why did we have to go through that type of 
process to make what I thought was a straightforward bill move 
along? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am tempted to say jokingly that 
it was to try the member's patience, to see whether he really 
had any. He certainly did, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, on a more serious note, I think that what the member is 
saying is that this was a bill that had no impact on the public 
purse and was wanted by all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember taking part in this debate one Friday, and our 
colleague was very eloquent.  The only thought that comes to 
mind is that, when we are considering a bill, we should judge it 
on its merit alone and not on who is sponsoring it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government introduces a good bill, I believe that all 
political parties will vote in favour of it.  Regardless of 
whether or not the government is introducing it and whether or 
not we are members of the government, if the opposition 
introduces a good bill, the House should vote in favour of it. 
Once again, we must come up with a system which allows this 
freedom of thought and this respect for the work of 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the disappointment of the member, who worked hard 
to draft a bill. Furthermore, he had invited Mr. Haché, who was 
here with us in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one thing that needs to be changed, it is how 
private members' bills are treated.  I am confident—because a 
majority of parliamentarians understand the importance of 
this—that we will arrive at a solution which will satisfy all

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I want to correct my colleague from 
Mississauga South on three points he made in his brief 
intervention a moment ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, his mathematics are not quite up to snuff here.  He said 
that we would not be able to have all members have a bill made 
votable in the life of a parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a parliament is approximately 600 days in total, although it 
may be only 500 days, but if we do sit 150 days for four years 
that is 600 days.  If there were 300 members and we had two hours 
a day devoted to private members' business, which is something I 
would like to see, every member would get his or her bill made 
votable if we had two hours of debate.  That was one of the 
options put forward in a questionnaire.

<A HREF="#LINKT128"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to limit the debate to two hours per bill or motion, 
which I think is reasonable, each member could have one bill or 
one motion made votable during the life of one parliament.  It is 
possible.  To simply dismiss that as impossible is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing I would like to correct is that labelling a 
motion as having the same weight as a bill is not quite accurate. 
Using the example of the labelling of alcohol containers that we 
voted on is a prime example of how a motion is not the same as a 
bill.  I could support that motion but I could never have 
supported a bill.  The motion was very fuzzy.  It just wanted to 
examine the issue, and yes, of course I could examine the issue. 
A bill would have been more definite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third thing he mentioned is that he would like to have all 
MPs speak from the heart and not use notes.  The way parliament 
is structured, if I have a 10 minute speech and a lot of points 
to make I do not have time to make it up.  I need to get all my 
points in very quickly and I need them to be tightly structured. 
Because of the way the system is set up we often are forced to go 
to notes.  I am not using notes tonight.  It is easy to say that 
we should not use notes but it is more difficult to practice 
under the constraints of parliament if one has a lot to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me get into the remarks I wanted to make.  For those who are 
watching on television, this is a take note debate which is very 
different from the normal debates that take place in parliament. 
I appreciate the government allowing us an opportunity to talk 
about the standing orders that govern the House.  For the people 
who are watching and do not know what the standing orders are, 
they are the rules that we play by in parliament.  They are the 
rules that govern us.  In essence, they govern how democracy 
unfolds at this level in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the opportunity to make some brief remarks on a 
couple of select issues.  I could go off on all kinds of things 
and it does not mean I do not have an opinion on them, but we 
have to make some changes here.  Unless we change the system we 
will not change much else in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke at a high school this afternoon, about a 20 minute drive 
out of Ottawa.  One of the things the students gave back to me as 
I spoke about what goes on in this place is that they do not see 
much meaningful activity happening here.  I do not think those 
students are at all out of touch with what is going on.  In fact, 
I get that across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very sad commentary on what happens here.  If we are 
in fact the highest court in the land and we are making the laws 
by which all Canadians have to play, the laws that govern the 
country and set the tone for what we feel is right and wrong, we 
need to be perceived as having open debate and that Canadians 
have input into what we do here.  They need to feel that this is 
a meaningful activity and that through their member of parliament 
they have a voice in what is happening in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cynicism that is developing across the country about the 
political process is becoming so ingrained that if we do not 
start making some changes here, it will be very difficult to turn 
that around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is one change we could make?  We could make private 
members' business votable and make any consequential changes that 
may be required in order to do that.  I feel very strongly that 
if we were to make that simple change and allow members to have a 
free vote on that, it would begin to change the way parliament is 
perceived across the country.  It would give us a lot more 
credibility as we participate in things.   That seemingly small 
change could send a ripple effect through the entire Chamber that 
would begin to go out across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The students I spoke to this afternoon asked me what they could 
do.  They said they felt helpless in influencing things that 
happen in the country.  They felt their voices were not being 
heard.  They felt they could not meaningfully participate in the 
debate.

<A HREF="#LINKT129"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we made private members' business votable, I do not believe 
that debate would take place for only two hours.  As an issue is 
raised and over the three or six months the issue is before 
parliament people across the country would begin to debate it. 
That is the problem as I perceive it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is not just in parliament.  The problem is that 
people do not debate things across the country.  They do not take 
an interest in what happens in Canada.  People do not feel they 
have to scratch beneath the surface on issues because somebody 
else will do it for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to give people a voice.  We need committees that travel 
and do meaningful work.  MPs have to tell people that a certain 
issue would be coming up in parliament and ask them what they 
think about it.  That would begin to send out the message that 
MPs are playing a very meaningful role in representing their 
constituents.  This could happen through private members' 
business.  It could reinvigorate this place like nothing else I 
know.  It would begin to make MPs feel a lot more meaningful in 
what they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of MPs feel alienated in that they do not have a lot of 
roles to play in what is going on in this place.  By making 
private members' business votable, many things would happen as a 
result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' business would probably be debated more than 
some of the government legislation in the House.  We would begin 
to have conversations in parliament, behind the scenes and across 
the country on issues that really matter to Canadians.  The lack 
of respect for parliament that has begun to creep in would be 
reversed.  That would be a very healthy thing.  The more we could 
make people feel that they are part of the process and that they 
have control over issues that govern them, the more they would 
take an interest in the affairs of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At election time we can create an impression and get votes. 
However we have to be sure that when people vote they vote on 
meaningful issues that really affect their lives.  I speak from 
somebody who has gone through three elections now when I say that 
is something that needs to happen in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to belabour these points.  I could elaborate on 
every one of them.  We have to make sure that people across 
Canada have the feeling that they have meaningful input into the 
process that is used in this place to govern them.  One of those 
things would be to reinvigorate private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As deputy whip I happen to sit on the committee, so I have been 
able to give this a little more thought than most members.  I 
feel very strongly that this is something we need to do.  I would 
suggest increasing the time for private members' business as 
well.  If it is possible to have it for two hours a day or an 
equivalent amount on a Friday or a Monday, we should try and fit 
that in.  It would be a very healthy thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that this might divert attention away from 
government business.  I do not know if that is a positive or a 
negative.  The government might view it as a positive, not having 
all the focus on its legislation, but it could also be very 
negative because what it introduces is very important 
legislation.  We need to have that considered and looked at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the problems we have will not be solved by that.  I am not 
naive enough to believe that, but it would be a step in the right 
direction.  I urge the government to work on that and maybe some 
of my colleagues would like to ask me some questions about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The media tend to focus on leadership and on issues that really 
are not all that significant in the grand scheme of things when 
they report things on the evening news.  This is another problem 
we also have.  By making private members' business votable and by 
beginning to focus more on issues, we would get away from some of 
the extraneous stuff that often occupies a lot of media 
attention.  That is true of every political party.  That is not a 
partisan issue.  It would be healthy to get issues discussed 
rather than personalities and scandals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see a lot of good spinoff benefits from this.  I want to 
put that on the record.  If anybody has any comments, I would 
appreciate hearing from them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian ALliance):</B>  Mr. Chairman, 
I would like to respond to a 
couple of things.  With respect to the number of hours required, 
I would point out to my colleague and to the other members that 
not all 301 members would have a private member's bill that they 
would want to put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the order paper right now, and even the notices of 
bills, we find 25% of members at most have submitted private 
members' bills.  The issue of how many people would have their 
name in the hat at any time is greatly exaggerated if we are 
thinking of 301 members.  At most it would be 100 members, so 
that would alleviate the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat a comment that I made earlier today as the 
personalities in the House have totally changed.  We should have 
a deal whereby nobody gets seconds until everyone has had firsts. 
That is the way we used to do it at camp.  Everyone got through 
the line for food and no one went through for the second time 
until everyone had firsts.  Can you see, Mr. Chairman, if I went 
through the second time?  I always made sure that I got enough 
the first time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would be a good way of doing this.  All members who have a 
private member's bill they would like to submit would present it 
as we do now.  Their name would go into the hat.  When there is a 
draw we would draw them but not put their name back until there 
are no names left.  That way if other members have a bill then 
their name would go in the hat.  Those that have their bills 
ready would be eligible for each draw until they are drawn. Once 
they are drawn then other members would take precedence over 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said this before.  The hon. member for Mississauga South 
has had five private members' bills drawn and I have had none, so 
it would increase the fairness. 
<P><A NAME="LINK322"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, when 
I last spoke I tried to differentiate between the debate changes 
that need to take place that would be rightly fitted under some 
topic of parliamentary reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the issues and the challenges that the Chamber faces are 
of much greater magnitude than we would deal with in the debate. 
We have to deal with finding ways of changing this place to make 
it fit better with the ever changing community that we live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the problems that we face are as a result of the Chamber 
being unable to find ways to move the pace of the external 
community.  I will not spend a lot of time on that tonight.  We 
are here to talk consequentially, to offer some advice to the 
committee about specific changes to the operations of the House 
that may produce the kind of effect that would allow members of 
the community to see this place as more relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not mean to dismiss some of the talk about private members' 
bills and other instruments.  They are not unimportant and their 
process is not unimportant.  I do however wish to make one point. 
We are dealing with an odd kind of loss of authority.  It is an 
odd kind of loss of authority because the House has enormous 
authority.  Committees have enormous authority. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT131"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an incredible power in this place.  We make and change 
laws.  We tax, spend and do all sorts of things.  We, the members 
of this place, can do it.  Yet for a couple of reasons that are 
hard to reconcile, it is difficult for us to function in a manner 
that expresses that authority in a useful or consequential way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I mean by that is that we have two things going on here. 
When the hon. member opposite talks about private members' bills 
and the importance of individual members being able to put 
forward a bill, one could argue that all bills emanating from the 
House should be the bills of all members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that we have allowed to happen, and it is 
interesting to read some of the observations of people who have 
studied the British parliamentary system and studied this 
parliament, is very hot partisan debate that has very little to 
do with governing to intrude upon the process where law is made. 
When one talks to members of the House, particularly members who 
have been here for a long time or former members, and asks them 
what experiences they talk most about or feel proud of, they say 
committee work.  They say that the real work is done in 
committees.  That is where they have the debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least two hon. members opposite are members who I have worked 
with on committee.  We have had very real debates that have 
produced very real compromises which produced a permanence to 
legislation.  We can all feel good about that if that is what we 
were doing here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand we have the kind of debate that takes place in 
this Chamber.  The problem with it is that it is easy to make fun 
of.  I could say that we have spent the last however many months 
arguing about Shawinigate and I could deride the opposition about 
that.  The fact is that we would have done the same thing if we 
were on the other side of the House.  I was in opposition for a 
period of time.  The fact is that in the public arena, through 
the eyes of the television camera, we get rewarded for outrageous 
behaviour and strategic outrageous attacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Attacking the credibility and the personality of the Prime 
Minister is, I would argue, not a very pleasant thing to do, not 
a very nice thing to do.  Unfortunately I cannot argue that it is 
not a strategically smart thing to do.  However it has nothing to 
do with running the country.  It has to do with fighting the 
battles of politics, which are about getting oneself in the 
position where one has the power to govern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The circle I cannot square is that we cannot control that debate 
because there is a reward for that debate.  There is a reward for 
members opposite to make members on this side look like they are 
corrupt or stupid.  There is a reward for members on this side to 
make members on the other side look like they are incompetent or 
whatever pejorative kind of phrases one wants to use.  If there 
was not a public reward for it we would not be doing it, however 
distasteful it might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not blame anybody in the House because we all do the same. 
That is the way the community has trained us to behave in the 
same way that we have concerns about public servants because that 
is the way we have trained them to be.  How do we step aside from 
that debate into that environment that we all want to be a part 
of, which is an environment that produces law? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were a consequential change right now in the context of 
this modernization of the rules, and modernization is a tough 
word to apply because we are not making it very modern, we could 
talk about a whole bunch of other things such as the House 
getting the tools to function in the world.  Unfortunately that 
is a topic for another time given the focus of this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had to recommend to you, Mr. Chairman, and to the other 
members of this committee one change that would have a 
significant impact on the operation of this place, it would be to 
create a process whereby members would be elected to a committee 
for the duration of a parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exact mechanism for that might be a combination of seniority 
in election, much as we do with parliamentary associations.  When 
a member comes here he or she would know where they would be. 
They would make that choice and they would have to fight for it. 
Older members who had more experience would have a chance to get 
there.  Members would have to convince their colleagues that they 
are the person to be elected to that committee in the same way 
you and Mr. Speaker had to convince your colleagues about the 
election of the Speaker. 
However once there we have a couple of things.  We have 
stability.  The election of the chairman becomes a consequence of 
that because members now own that committee.  If we think about 
that for a second, there is a whole bunch of powers of authority 
that those committees have that we never exercise.  Why we do not 
exercise them is really the question?  We do not exercise them 
right now because there is a fear that sits out there that 
somehow we will not be on the committee any more or that each 
year we will have to face reconsideration for the committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there is always talk about estimates.  The estimates 
process in this place is a joke.  It is a farce.  We do not deal 
with estimates.  We do not provide an accountability function to 
anything around here, in part because it is not consequential. 
We cannot do anything, so harrumphing about what has gone on in a 
department for a period of time is not worthwhile.  The amount of 
work it takes to get a piece of information in order to have the 
harrumph is not worth the effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made a bunch of changes when we came to government.  If 
members focused on the system that is there, those committees 
would have enormous authority.  The problem is we have allowed 
that partisan debate to intrude upon the committee debate, so in 
committee it is hard to have the kind of partnering that we would 
like to talk about.  We have done it on occasion.  I look across 
to one of the members who worked with me on a particular 
committee where we did a lot of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an aspect to committee travel that is very interesting. 
Not only do we get a chance to understand the country a little 
better, we get a chance to understand each other a little better. 
We get a sense of the shared values that we all have.  Part of 
the real value of this place in a Canadian context is the way it 
acts as a massive kind of values clarification exercise.  We all 
understand our country and what makes the country work a little 
better 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process is really simple.  The departments come forward and 
say what they are planning to do.  Has any committee ever held 
hearings on that and then written a report that has differed with 
the department's opinion of what they wanted to do?  The 
committees have the authority to do it.  If the department did 
not respond to that comment by putting in their estimates, the 
committee could delete the funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody gets a little twitchy about that but not only would 
that cause a complete reconsideration on the part of the 
department or its relationship with the House, it would also 
cause members to take their actions seriously.  Right now we can 
be as irresponsible as we want on committee because we do not 
affect anything.  However if we actually committed an act that 
changed a policy, we would have to live with that and I think 
that would force us to be more serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should think of the value we place on minority governments. 
Why is that?  It is because we have to negotiate.  We have to 
negotiate, we have to clarify our values, we have to debate and 
then we have to decide.  Those functions could occur within 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Making members stable on committee, would that produce the kind 
of change we want?  I am honestly not sure because I think the 
real problem in here is us and our unwillingness to exercise the 
authority that we have.  However stabilizing members on 
committee, and committees already have the right to elect their 
own chair, would take away an excuse for why the place does not 
function in the way we would like it to function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very simply, I will help design the system for election but that 
one change, break the prerogative, the members control of it, and 
then trust us to mess up but as long as we do the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I listened carefully 
to what the hon. member said and I agree with much of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be a bit of a devil's advocate.  The member talked 
about how we try to find scandals on the other side and the 
opposition is made to look like they do not know what they are 
talking about, et cetera.  How much value does he perceive there 
is in question period? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2135"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT133"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member think that question period meets a need that is 
somehow fulfilled in what is played out here every day?  I have 
found some question periods to be valuable, but if we abolished 
question period would there be a great loss to the country?  Is 
question period just a very easy way for the media to get 
something for its time slot every evening or is there a 
meaningful role to be played by question period? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sense that question period is what you were referring to when 
you talked about the opposition looking for scandals in 
government and that the government was trying to make the 
opposition look like it did not know what it is talking about. 
What does the member honestly feel about question period? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  Before the member replies, I would like to 
make a suggestion because we are on new ground.  We should be 
cautious in terms of addressing one another directly across the 
floor.  While it certainly appears to be a healthy, positive mood 
in the debate at this time should it change it becomes difficult 
to bring it back to some semblance of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I have thought hard about 
this.  The problem is that it is really easy to look at something 
like that and say that that is the problem, but the reality is it 
is what we do.  It is easy to look at it and say it is 
inconsequential, stupid and noisy.  Do I think the debate that 
took place here for the past couple of months served any great 
public purpose?  Absolutely not.  There is a saying I think about 
all the time: “For every complex problem there is a simple 
answer and it is wrong”.  Let us do it with a partisan debate. 
Would it not be wonderful if we all just focused on solving 
problems? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is the partisan debate is in part how we establish 
differences which is how we provide people with choice.  The 
trouble is the hot medium of television has made it possible to 
focus attention around such minutia and forced it to get hotter 
so we no longer talk about problems, we use the big words like 
liar.  We have to get a word like that out there in order to 
break through the fog. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However that is also the environment we live in.  It is a real 
part of the environment.  It is really easy to blame the press. 
The press is part of the process, it is not the problem.  The 
problem is the human appetite for that kind of debate.  People 
watch it, they are interested and make their decisions based on 
it.  How did they make a decision in the last election?  Was it 
on a bunch of images about where one party stood versus another 
one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the sentiment that there needs to be more massive 
reform here but I am not certain we are ready to go down that 
road just yet.  We need to think about that one a little more. 
Quite seriously, I spend a lot of time trying to figure out how 
this place can move faster and become more relevant in the lives 
of people.  It is not by tinkering with these rules.  I can think 
of little changes that might help in the short term but I think 
we all need to get focused on the bigger changes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK323"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I 
would like to thank my hon. colleague for his wonderful lead into 
the comment that I would like to offer to the debate. This is an 
excellent form of debate.  It gives us an opportunity to talk 
somewhat more frankly than we might otherwise speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to offer comments on three areas: personal 
behaviour of members; caucus reform; and parliamentary reform. 
There is not really a great deal of difference between caucus 
reform and parliamentary reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of personal behaviour, I find it of some 
embarrassment to go home on a regular basis and talk about what 
has happened here, particularly given people's experience with 
parliament which is question period, which really has nothing to 
do with questions and even less to do with answers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The analogy I use when I talk to people in schools, whether it 
is high schools, universities or public schools, is that if we 
had to judge the education system by recess, we would probably 
question the value of our taxpayer dollar.  Similarly, if we had 
to judge question period, we would question the value of our 
taxpayer dollar.  Regrettably that is what colours the public's 
perception of what we do here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a relatively new MP.  I have been here almost four years. I 
expect that my experience was somewhat similar to others.  It is 
a little like getting married.  I really did not know what I was 
doing.  No amount of preparation actually prepared me for this 
experience.  The books are not of any particular usefulness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make a point of trying to explain to constituents what I 
actually do.  I had that experience last Sunday afternoon.  We 
are all prone to meet with constituents.  There was a group of 
about 50 or 75 people.  I went through my agenda for the last 
three weeks and explained what it I did, the interactions I had 
with people and what the issues were.  Over the course of half an 
hour to 45 minutes I did not lose a soul in that conversation. 
They were quite fascinated by what an MP does outside this 
Chamber and particularly outside of question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I developed a series of points that really are random and 
somewhat haphazard, but that I think would move us from the point 
of personal behaviour as we interact with each other to points of 
caucus reform to points of parliamentary reform, which I hope 
would be helpful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think members, as points of communications with constituents, 
should publish their agendas and tell people what they are doing. 
They should explain the issues that are of concern to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It strikes me as quite strange that parliament is not 
particularly proactive in explaining itself to the Canadian 
public.  The counter distinction is amazing when we think about 
it.  The Prime Minister's office literally has dozens of people 
who do nothing but promote the Prime Minister in a variety of 
areas, and justifiably so.  Ministers literally have dozens of 
people in their offices who do nothing but promote the agenda of 
the minister and promote the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same cannot be said for either parliament as an institution 
or members of parliament who have little opportunities to 
communicate.  The irony is that unless a member does something 
outrageous there is no way that he or she will have any 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose it is somewhat naive to say that members should not 
take cheap shots but we are all going to do it.  I just throw 
that out to put it on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should be serious about their compensation.  I practised 
law for 22 years.  I never noticed that anyone who came into my 
office was overwhelming in his or her enthusiasm to pay me a 
retainer.  However I learned rather quickly that if I did not ask 
for compensation for a retainer, which was commiserate with my 
abilities and skills in a particular area, then I would certainly 
not get that retainer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It strikes me as strangely ironic that members are so shy about 
dealing with their own compensation.  I cannot imagine what 
hockey player, teacher or doctor would work for 50% or 25% of 
what they are actually worth and still take all the same bumps 
and bruises.  I find that strangely ironic among politicians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, the Canadian Taxpayers Federation puts out a 
little pamphlet on a regular basis and dumps all over us.  I 
cannot quite fathom why we put up with that sort of nonsense, but 
we apparently do.  The Canadian Taxpayers Federation is not the 
only vehicle that diminishes the role of MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MPs have to start thinking in terms of growing democracy.  We 
have a group that calls itself the civil society.  The civil 
society has aggregated to itself the position of defending 
democracy.  This is hugely ironic, given that not one or very few 
of the members of the so-called civil society representing 
so-called groups that may or may not appreciate the 
representation have ever voted for any of these people.  None of 
these people have ever run in a municipal, provincial or a 
federal election.  Yet they apparently defend democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is somewhat trite civic law to say that there are three 
branches in any government:  the legislative branch, the judicial 
branch and the administrative branch.  This debate occurs in a 
larger context and there is a huge pincer movement by the 
judicial branch and the executive branch.  We live in an age of 
executive federalism with all its royal prerogatives, and I am 
using this pejoratively.  Those royal prerogatives are being used 
on a somewhat aggressive basis and have real consequences for 
members who aspire to having careers in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly the judiciary has been handed an enormous instrument 
to involve itself in issues of society, namely the charter.  I 
notice that the judiciary is not overly shy about exercising the 
charter in areas where it feels it should.  As a consequence, we 
have these two very robust and aggressive aspects of government, 
namely executive federalism and the judiciary, squeezing the 
legislators and squeezing this place.  I respectfully submit that 
is the context for this debate.  I think it is time for push 
back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of caucus discipline and parliamentary reform 
members need to think through the degrees of discipline.  Clearly 
budget bills are of great significance for this side of the 
House.  Clearly items that we ran on in platforms are of great 
significance for the House.  After that issues of discipline I 
think diminish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the occasion to be in Mongolia recently.  Mongolia has 76 
members in its legislature, 72 of whom are with the government 
party.  It has electronic voting.  As we sat there I was watching 
the government lose votes.  That was somewhat ironic.  Here are 
we, a mature democracy, apparently explaining to Mongolia, a 
relatively new democracy, how to exercise its democratic rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' time should be reorganized so that there is a 
reasonable chance that private members' bills will see the light 
of day.  There has been some discussion about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committee hearings should be opened up so that we have draft 
bills at a much earlier stage and that we have white papers, 
brown papers and green papers; it does not really much matter. 
There is nothing more irritating as a member of a committee than 
to listen to staff members from a department saying that they 
have consulted with all the stakeholders.  Really.  Who are these 
stakeholders and so what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of earlier notice on opposition day motions, I like to 
speak to those motions from time to time, but I do not find out 
about them until 9 or 9.30 on the morning of the debate.  Frankly 
I do not have a great deal of time to think, and I am up on my 
feet 10 to 15 minutes later responding to the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On shortened deadlines for government responses, I do not see 
why the government needs 150 days to respond to a committee 
report or whatever.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not be overly embarrassed if the House was closed down 
for a few weeks every year during sittings and we just did 
committee work, either committee of the whole or standing 
committees.  It would not bother me in the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could get through a lot of stuff and make spending and 
estimate debates meaningful.  We should either have one committee 
that looks after it all or have each committee develop some level 
of expertise so that we can hold the department's feet to the 
fire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should give the House leader time to debate and speak to the 
issue of time allocation.  We have used time allocation from time 
to time.  Opposition members might know that, but the House 
leader has no opportunity to speak to it on debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to create an MP culture which empowers MPs.  MPs frankly 
need to go to MP school.  They need to know that they cannot be 
removed from committee by the whip only, that it actually has to 
be by a vote of the House.  They are secure.  They need to know 
that, for instance, they can designate five people in their place 
and those people are the first up.  Therefore a whip cannot load 
a committee with more obedient MPs than others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committees have, as does the House, virtually unlimited power of 
subpoena which we do not exercise.  We can vote for reductions in 
departmental bills, and we do not exercise that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer these thoughts as a potpourri of things which can be 
done.  I am not overly persuaded that a lot of standing orders 
need to be amended.  I think, rather, that MPs need to realize 
there are a great number of things they can do.  Whether it is 
singly or in smaller groups, they can make impacts such as my 
colleague to my left did who I think had a double-double last 
week with significant pieces of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating this motion because we love this place.  There 
is sort of a bizarre way in which it all works.  As Churchill 
said, parliamentary democracy or democracy in general is one of 
the worst of all forms of government until we look at the 
alternatives.  That is the context of this debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK324"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I compliment the government member 
on his eloquent suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is really quite simple.  Will his government listen 
and implement the constructive solutions that he just spoke 
about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. member for 
his concise question.  I think the government is moving 
incrementally along the path of parliamentary reform, but the 
essential problem is that no ministers, no members of government, 
can ever convince themselves that parliamentary reform is in 
their own interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because members cannot convince themselves that it is in their 
own interest, there is no great enthusiasm to do what they need 
to do.  If this system works, and it seems to work very well from 
the government's standpoint, why bother with change? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ministers and the government in general need to rethink their 
position.  My view is that good opposition makes good government. 
My view is that opposition comes not only from over there but 
back here.  In our caucus a lot of the most significant 
opposition to government initiatives come from its own members. 
They refine legislative initiatives as much as they can.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think certain ministers have seen the light, have reacted 
positively to suggestions from both sides of the House and are 
prepared to strengthen legislation.  Let me take a controversial 
example of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament the Minister of Justice, prior to 
dissolution, amended the youth justice bill based upon testimony 
before the committee.  She introduced voluminous amendments which 
have now found their way into Bill C-7.  Frankly I thought that 
was quite courageous on her part.  The consequence regrettably 
was that she has been stonewalled by certain members of the 
opposition and it is very difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do I think the Minister of Justice will be persuaded in the 
future to amend her own bills after listening to testimony on the 
justice committee?  I think I will have a tough sell.  In that 
respect, if in fact we open those kinds of things there has to be 
a corollary that members of the opposition and our own 
backbenchers have to behave in some sort of responsible fashion. 
It has to be recognized at some point that debate finishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot answer the question with great precision, but I offer 
as a response that government and government ministers need to be 
convinced that this is in their own interests.  I think 
ultimately they can be convinced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I would love to have my 
friend from the government define incremental, but I will not 
ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current government House leader in 1992, along with a number 
of other former cabinet ministers who are not here today, put out 
a document that was an unbelievable tome on specific solutions on 
how to reform the House.  It contained everything from voting 
procedures and committee structures to how people are selected to 
sit on committees.  It was a fantastic piece of work and an 
expression of the frustration that the current government felt 
when in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my friend from the government whether he will ask the 
current government House leader to resurrect the document he 
wrote in 1992 so eloquently describing changes to democratize the 
House and implement the changes in that document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I cannot specifically refer 
to the report of the House leader, but I think there is some 
element of good will on the part of the House leader to respond 
to some of those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will suggest in defence of the House leader that there has 
been more than incremental progress since January until now, 
frankly under the chairmanship of you, Mr. Chairman.  One area 
was in terms of getting electronic voting.  Our caucuses voted on 
that issue and I think it will move forward.  It is pretty 
significant reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of first reading, I think we will see more and more 
bills leave the House earlier and get into committee for longer 
periods of time, with which I think all of us would agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On increases to the budget of the Library of Parliament, $1 
million has been put toward that.  Any time there is more money 
in the Library of Parliament, it gives all of us an opportunity 
to be better prepared.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meetings such as this, committees of the whole, I think give 
more opportunities for, how shall I say it, less partisan 
interaction.  I have to commend the House leader for that kind of 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that has been discussed is more opportunity 
for first time members to meet the candidates for Speaker and to 
give speeches on those candidates so that people who are in this 
House for the first time get to know the people who are offering 
themselves as candidates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that for things like closure debates, et cetera, 
there may be time issues that are coming up.  As well, I believe 
concurrence issues are being discussed, with a reduction of the 
time that the government has to respond to parliamentary reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one level I could argue this is happening at just a snail's 
pace.  On the other hand I might also argue that from January to 
now, the House leader, with the co-operation of the committee 
chaired by the Chairman here, has made significant progress. 
Regrettably all votes are equal on the committee and frankly he 
can only make as much progress in this Chamber as he is able to 
make in the committee with all five members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, at this point I am not prepared to be overly critical of 
our House leader.  I think we all have our shopping lists, our 
wish lists.  He was good enough to publish his in 1992. 
<P><A NAME="LINK325"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Chairman, it is an honour to speak 
on this topic.  I will preface my remarks by saying that if we 
looked at all the problems we have in the country today, if we 
talked about health care, about jobs, what is the one that is the 
most prominent, the one that is actually the most important, the 
route that actually can effect change and help the people of our 
country?  That problem is the problem of democratizing this 
House.  In my view, there is no challenge or problem in our 
country today greater than that of making this parliament a 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, like many members of the House here today, I was 
elected.  We came here motivated by largely the same reason:  to 
improve the health and welfare of Canadians.  What motivated us 
to come here, to leave our personal lives aside and to maybe take 
a financial hit, was to improve the health and welfare of the 
people we dealt with on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we saw people living in their cars because they were 
homeless.  Maybe we were struck by individuals who needed health 
care and were waiting months to get a test to determine whether 
or not they had cancer, waiting for far too long.  Perhaps we saw 
the conditions that aboriginal people live in, squalid conditions 
in many cases, that are unthinkable in a country like Canada. 
Perhaps we saw an education system that did not provide the 
education our children need.  Perhaps we saw an economy that was 
declining and slipping far below those of our competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever our motivation, every person, to a man or to a woman, 
came here to make our country a better place.  We came here with 
that in our hearts.  We knew this was not a democracy.  We came 
to change that.  We came with hope.  However, instead of finding 
a House of Commons we found a house of illusions.  With the large 
change in the numbers of people that we had in 1993 and the hope 
that engendered in all of us, rather than making the changes 
which we had a narrow chance of doing, we saw this place, rather 
than getting more democratic, becoming less democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This speech is not for the members in the House but for the 
public out there.  It is for the few hearty souls out there who I 
hope are tuning into CPAC and listening to what my colleagues are 
saying here today, and I hope they bring it forward to their MPs, to 
the Prime Minister and to every single elected person that they 
know in this institution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those changes required in the House are changes that 
will enable us to help them.  Those changes will enable us to 
reform our health care system, to improve our economy and to make 
this a land of opportunity, a place where we could start to 
achieve our potential rather than being hit below the belt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public may or may not understand that the House of Commons 
is not a democracy.  It is a place that is controlled with a 
viselike grip, where the members from political parties are 
controlled by leaderships, where they are used as little more 
than voting machines and as bodies that attend committees, and 
hopefully we have a palpable pulse when we do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a waste.  What an abysmal waste of the incredible talent 
that exists within the House, for every man and woman in the 
House has talent, skills and passions that they came here to 
apply for the betterment of the people in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can it be done?  Absolutely.  What needs to be done?  First of 
all, let us look at the structure.  Bills basically come in a 
standard form right into committees.  Minor changes are made and 
they are rubber stamped all the way through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to private members' business, the public would find it 
extraordinary that an MP puts forth a bill and works very hard on 
it but only if his or her name is selected out of a big vat with 
300 other names in it will he or she be lucky enough to be able 
to introduce that bill.  Whether it is votable or not is the 
jurisdiction and the choice and the decision of a number of 
fellow committee members.  Why we have private members' bills 
that are not votable is extraordinary and completely absurd. 
That is what is happening now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MPs are not allowed to innovate because innovation is called 
freelancing, freelancing being a pejorative term to suggest that 
the individual who is trying to use his or her skill to build a 
plan is a maverick, a lone wolf, a rebel, not part of the team. 
When a member is accused of not being part of the team, a member 
unfortunately becomes polarized in regard to his colleagues.  A 
member who tries to work with members from different political 
parties is again frowned on as being perhaps not one of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, how do we make change?  How do we 
actually do our job?  The most important aspect of that job is to 
help the people on the ground who may not have a home, who may 
not have health care, who may be unemployed, who are not eating 
well or who live in squalid conditions.  The only way we can 
change that is if we reform this place so that we can use the 
collective talent in the House and apply it to those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why have we seen the death of innovation, particularly over the 
last two years?  Why has this place been so restrained and 
constricted that individual members are frowned on if they work 
together?  It is frowned on if they try to innovate, if they try 
to step ahead, if they lead from the front.  Why do we have a 
structure like that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not tap into the extraordinary potential that we have 
in the people in our country who are not members of parliament? 
Few of us in the House are experts on anything, just as I am an 
expert on nothing, but all of us are wise enough to find the best 
people in the country and find the best solutions not only within 
Canada but outside Canada and apply them to the problems of the 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I spoke to my constituents a week and a half ago about 
this, they found it extraordinary that there were so many 
obstacles to trying to innovate and bring ideas to bear on the 
problems that are important at their dinner tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to allow innovation in the House, so what can we do? 
First, and I am probably repeating things that have been said 
before, free votes have to take place.  Second, free votes have 
to take place but if the government loses a vote it should not be 
a vote of non-confidence in the government.  That would require a 
very simple rule to be implemented by the government.  It could 
be done overnight.  No bill, other than a money bill, should be 
matters of a vote of confidence in the government.  On all other 
bills if the government loses a vote, then the government had a 
bad bill and it can take it back and fix the problem.  It should 
not have to lose power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to committee structure, I was at a committee meeting 
about the free trade of the Americas and spoke to a person who 
was putting forward a very heartfelt intervention on the free 
trade agreement. 
She asked me why the committee was studying the free trade 
agreement weeks before the actual meeting in Quebec City.  I said 
to her that surely she did not expect the committee meeting to 
have any meaning.  I told her that her assessment was perfectly 
right.  The purpose of the committee was to keep MPs busy.  That 
was what it was for.  It was not meant to use her considerable 
talents in a meaningful way.  What a tragedy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It breaks my heart, as I am sure it breaks the hearts of all 
members in the House, to sit on a committee listening to 
brilliant suggestions and solutions and heartfelt interventions 
on the part of members of the public in regard to fixing an 
important problem in our country and to know full well that it at 
best will become a report that will get one day of press coverage 
and then be tossed on a shelf with thousands of other reports to 
collect dust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is a case in point.  We are to study it again after 
having studied it in 1995.  Nothing has happened since then. 
There was a blue ribbon panel in 1995 that studied this most 
important issue affecting Canadians, a matter of life and death, 
and what happened to it?  Nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to aboriginal affairs, there was an eloquent, lengthy 
$60 million study with umpteen constructive suggestions to help 
the group in our society that is most impoverished.  Has anything 
been done about it?  Nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A solution would be to give committees more independence and get 
parliamentary secretaries who are really whips for the government 
off committees.  Bills should go to committee in draft form so 
that the public making interventions can actually mould and craft 
the bill into something effective and reasonable.  They should do 
this along with members of parliament from across party lines. We 
could use our collective talents and collective wisdom to build a 
really effective bill rather than having bills come from the 
ministry and made by the minister's lawyers.  That would make a 
good bill.  The bill would go back to the minister and he or she 
and his or her people could carve it up.  However, ultimately in 
this process the bill would be superior because it would have 
tapped into a greater potential within our country and within the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All private members' business should be made votable.  Every 
individual MP should have at least one bill votable per term, bar 
none.  Each MP should also have one private member's motion 
votable, although that is of less importance.  Also with respect 
to private members' business, why has the government gutted our 
legal tools?  We have only four lawyers compared to the more than 
80 provided to the government to deal with bills.  The 250 plus 
MPs who are not in cabinet need more than four lawyers to help 
them with private members' business.  We need to invest in this 
so individual MPs can have access to these legal tools.  This 
would do much to improve the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I can only ask the members of the public who are 
listening tonight to please get involved in this process.  I can 
only ask them to come to the front of the House of Commons and 
demand change, demand that we make the House a democracy.  With 
the same vigour and zeal, in a non-violent way, that people 
protested the FTAA in Quebec, although that was misguided, 
Canadians should be coming to the House and demanding that we 
make private members' business votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge members of the public to do that because if they 
work with us then we will make a change that will benefit not 
only the people of Canada but will certainly benefit the House 
and make it a nimble, vigorous institution that will make our 
country in the 21st century much better than it is today.

I do not want to turn this 
into a debate for members from Scarborough, but I want to ask the 
hon. member about his bargain, some might say Faustian bargain, 
the bargain that every one of us made when we came to this place, 
and that is that we all ran under a party label.  I ran under the 
Liberal Party label, which was in my case a particularly good 
choice and I did very well. 
If I am brutally analytical about that vote, almost all that vote 
was attributable to the fact that I was a Liberal, running under 
the leadership of the Prime Minister.  I know the member opposite 
has had some awkward moments of late, with respect to his party.

<A HREF="#LINKT141"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bargain that I make, as a government member, is that I 
support the team.  The quid pro quo is that I have virtually 
unlimited access to ministers and to the Prime Minister.  I can 
voice my views on an issue or a bill in private in a very direct 
fashion and literally influence the direction of government.  I 
have seen that among a great number of backbenchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corollary is that no one will ever know about it.  That is 
the government backbencher bargain, that on issues of concern to 
me I will be able to influence government direction.  I can give 
a variety of examples.  The homeless issue was of significance in 
my riding.  I and a few others had a great deal to do with the 
180 degree change in direction by the government.  However the 
understanding is that once that change in policy is made, I will 
support the team in other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member, in the context of what is a parliamentary 
democracy and in the context five parties in the House, how would 
he see the whole issue of free votes, freelancing and all that 
the member considers to be pejorative to operate, when in fact we 
are all here as part of one party or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Chairman, there is constructive 
discourse and destructive discourse.  I support freelancing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Freelancing implies that an individual, at least in the terms I 
used, is putting forth views, ideas and solutions that will be 
beneficial to the people of his or her community, the country and 
perhaps even the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should members not be allowed to do that?  Why is it 
discouraged?  Why has rigor mortis set in in terms of innovation? 
Why are cabinet members not allowed to innovate? What a tragedy 
for individuals who have perhaps hoped through their professional 
career as a politician to get into the Holy Grail of cabinetdom. 
If they get there, they might be lucky to get a cabinet post that 
is commensurate with their talents.  Why not allow talented 
individuals to move forward to push for ideas and changes that 
will enable that ministry to function better for Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have that right now.  People are scratching their 
heads and asking: why are we studying the health care system 
again; why have we not dealt with the environmental problems 
which are significant yet are untouched; why are we not dealing 
with endangered species legislation; and why is the tax system 
not more efficient, effective, reasonable and user friendly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go down every single cabinet member's post, as any other 
MP could, think of some big problems and some solutions, which 
the minister I am sure knows, to address those problems.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are these problems not dealt with?   It is May 1 and we have 
a situation where the government is trying to keep the opposition 
fractured.  It is a political game.  The Liberals will not 
raise their heads and do something innovative, so no fire is 
drawn to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the point of having power if it is not used for the 
public good?  If one wants to sit on the government benches and 
not use it then it is useless.  We may as well go home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a tragedy for the members of cabinet and members of the 
government, or anyone in that position, to be forced and 
shoehorned into that kind of behaviour.  What a tragedy for us. 
What a tragedy for the people in Canada, particularly those who 
are really hurting in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have only made a Faustian bargain, if we allow ourselves to 
make that bargain.  We can do much to change that.  We can make a 
bargain with our souls and with our community that is far better.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I know you have an 
important role to play with regard to the committee that the 
House has charged to look into the modernization of parliament 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it very fascinating the work that has been done and the 
proposals which have been presented, for instance the leadoff 
debate by the government House leader.  Much of that was 
discussed at committee and unanimous consent is mandated for any 
changes.  I understand there is very good progress so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly enough though, the entire debate has split into 
two channels.  The committee as I understand it is dealing with 
the procedures of the House such as how to make it run smoothly, 
how to deal with filibustering and report stage motions which are 
frivolous and how do we make it more efficient?  All those points 
are very characteristically how does this place work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other stream that has taken a life of its own has to do with 
the premise that there is a question as to the relevance of 
members of parliament and how do we engage the public and 
convince them that they have a role to play and a say?  That is 
the citizen engagement issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the public as if they were a homogeneous 
group but they are not.  Across the country very few members of 
parliament had more than 50% of the vote in any riding.  So the 
views of constituents in a particular riding are going to be 
divergent.  There is going to be a bit of everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certain things that go beyond partisan purposes or 
objectives.  Members of parliament on committee and when they do 
special work seek items that can go beyond the partisanship.  We 
have an official Opposition and other opposition parties, and 
their role is to be the opposition.  The government's role is to 
implement its mandate.  Its democratically elected government has 
a constitutional obligation to deliver a program under which it 
was elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the governing party are considered to be sheep 
because they support the platform on which they ran.  How ironic, 
of course they have to support the plan on which they ran.  There 
are issues that are not specific in the platform but certainly 
are specific in a party's policy such as a long standing policy 
background.  It is clear that the thrust of most of the voting 
here probably is reflective of either the platform or the policy 
of a particular party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who just spoke raised some issues.  There are issues 
related to the environment, reproductive technologies, some 
cloning and stem cell harvesting and other issues which could go 
way beyond partisanship. 
These are things I can study and get into.  We can hear 
witnesses, come up with good reports and help government fashion 
a legislative and regulatory framework which could guide some of 
these things that are evolving in our society.  This is where the 
participatory democracy comes from, when we can find those ways 
to set aside the partisanship.

<A HREF="#LINKT143"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take this opportunity to suggest three or four items that 
I would like the committee to look at in trying to provide some 
guidance in shaping some of the things that happen in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one is the concept of relevance.  I must admit there 
was one member who spoke earlier who said that if there was time 
to speak, he always got up because he loved to speak.  We have to 
exercise personal discipline.  The Chair has some discretion to 
impose or to raise the question of relevance when members rise 
and tend to ramble on or repeat themselves et cetera.  The 
efficiency of the operation of the House, if enforced 
judiciously, would encourage members who like to speak for the 
sake of speaking to check themselves periodically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole aspect of debate within the House, and it would spill 
over to committees, is to make it much more relevant and crisp. 
In the British parliament the speeches of ministers on very 
important bills are very rarely more than 10 minutes long.  There 
are certain points to be made and many of them have been well 
debated, but when we get down to it, a minister does not need 40 
minutes to speak on a bill.  Quite frankly, it is very difficult 
to fashion a good speech to last 40 minutes and keep everybody 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of relevance should not be overlooked in terms of the 
principle that the members should try to discipline themselves on 
that.  However the Chair should also encourage us to keep on 
point and ensure that we do not act in a partisan way simply to 
repeat or to somehow stretch the envelope into areas that are not 
terribly relevant to the matter before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of question and comment is an area which leads to a 
lot of abuse in the House in that regard, simply from the 
standpoint that comment generally lends itself to members 
speaking for some time and raising new issues which were not in a 
member's speech.  It tends to sidetrack the focus on the comments 
of a previous speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping that the relevance issue will play an important role 
in shaping a signal for discipline by all members.  Personally 
imposed and with the assistance of the Chair, I think we could be 
more efficient within the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was fascinated to learn the longstanding tradition in the 
British parliamentary system, and I have not seen written rules 
on this, is that speeches should not be read in the House unless 
they are quoting from some references or providing detailed 
technical information.  One member responded very quickly by 
saying that he had a lot to say, that he had 10 points to get 
across and he could not do it by memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that members should not have any paper in 
front of them.  Certainly they could have one page which would 
have the themes to which they were speaking.  However imagine 
what would happen to the quality of the speaking within the House 
if members had to address the House rather than read to the 
House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be very important for us to consider whether or not 
members should come here with their piles of papers.  As the 
cameras film them giving their speech all that would show would 
be the tops of their heads.  I have often thought, when 
watching CPAC and the proceedings of the House, that those 
members who address the House have eye contact.  They can sense 
whether or not they have lost people or whether they are 
grumbling.  There can almost be an interactive dialogue going on 
simply by checking the mood of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we consider the great orators of 
parliamentary tradition.  That skill has been lost. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2230"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT145"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2230

<A HREF="#LINKT144"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that people can come in here with canned speeches and 
read them.  If the paper were taken away from them and they were 
asked to carry on, they would probably say in many cases that 
they could not because they do not know very much about the 
subject they were in the House talking about.  It would be 
terribly embarrassing for some members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hate to say this but, if that is the case, what is the 
relevance of a member standing up here?  We might as well simply 
circulate the speech to all members or put it on their ParlNet. 
If a speaking spot opened up on a subject on which the member was 
not too familiar he or she could just read the speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the relevance of speaking in the House has to reflect 
the fact that these people have evidentiary knowledge or have 
done their research because the subject matter is something that 
is important to them.  Debate is to try to sway opinion.  I do 
not think many people are moved by looking at the top of 
someone's head as they read a speech prepared for them by 
somebody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has been said about committees.  Committees have a very 
important role to play if they can get their act together. 
Fortunately we have some committees that do extremely well.  I 
would think the finance committee has an excellent reputation. 
The foreign affairs committee has quite a good reputation.  The 
environment committee to some extent has a pretty good reputation 
because it has strong leadership, et cetera, and I think the 
people on it are very interested.  They continue to educate 
themselves and champion important initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the big problems we have with five official parties, and 
the need to put members on different committees—I think it is 16 
members—is that it spreads us very thin.  Members who have 
served on two committees know what I am talking about.  I know of 
a number of cases where members are on two committees and the 
committees happen to meet at exactly the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can a member properly prepare let alone keep up with 
committee work?   It is unfortunate that we are in that situation 
but there is not much we can do about it because we have five 
official parties.  It was a lot different when there were three 
parties.  We could have 10 members or maybe even 8 members on a 
committee and still do some good work.  Quite frankly, more work 
would get done on committees if there were fewer members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the committees' principal responsibilities is to deal 
with government bills.  In committee today we went through clause 
by clause of a bill and some 30 amendments were proposed by the 
government.  I would think by and large that most of those 
amendments were housekeeping in nature.  No major changes were 
made to the thrust of the bill.  The committee took a long time 
to deal with the bill which created a lot of frustration among 
the members, particularly those in opposition.  They did not like 
the idea that the government was ramming through a bunch of 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very clear though, by watching the opposition members' 
growing frustration, that they were not quite aware of the way in 
which bills are dealt with at committee, particularly at clause 
by clause, and in fact did not know their rights as committee 
members.  They could have put forward their own amendments and 
called for recorded votes.  They could also have stood clauses 
for later consideration while they consulted with someone.  This 
tends to support the suggestion of one member that an MP school 
might be important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I became a member of parliament and we received orientation 
in early 1994, the one day orientation was sadly lacking.  There 
was more information than could possibly be absorbed.  It 
certainly did not prepare us for what we had to do.  We were just 
told to fend for ourselves and hopefully we would learn a little 
bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly enough, this time around after the election, there 
were, I believe, 17 new members of our caucus.  I penned a 10 
page typed letter on a potpourri of items just as a heads up.  I 
probably could have gone on a lot longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It strikes me that some of the day to day ordinary activities of 
members of parliament do not get communicated to MPs.  I think we 
do a terrible job, quite frankly, on orienting MPs on the day to 
day activities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is duty?   What are votes?   What are motions?   What does 
it mean when the Speaker says “on division”?   Those things are 
not written in too many places unless we start using enormous 
textbooks.  We should probably start building a pragmatic manual 
for members of parliament so they can better understand 
budgeting, House duty, House hours, private members' business and 
where they can get help.  They do not realize that they do not 
need a legislative assistant.  The library of parliament is there 
with a large number of people with PhDs who are prepared to do 
all kinds of work for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resources we have are enormous.  I can look around this 
place at members who have been here particularly from the class 
of '93 or earlier.  I can point to each one of them and tell 
exactly the niche they have found for themselves in this place 
and the contributions they have made.  Regardless of partisan 
stripe, I know that each and every one of them looks for a way to 
make a contribution and find their niche, usually related to 
either their riding or their own personal experience or 
expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no sympathy for members who just whine about things and 
say they do not get this or that.  There is an onus on each 
individual member of parliament to take up the challenge and to 
understand that the best way to get an item past the chair, 
whether one is a government member or an opposition member, is to 
get a bill or a motion before the House, to have it voted on by 
the members and passed.  The very best outcome is to do the best 
job possible to garner consensus, to get public support and to 
convince the government that it should take on the item and 
introduce it, just as the member for Sackville—Musquodoboit 
Valley—Eastern Shore said.  He had an idea on the blood issue 
but it did not go the way he wanted.  Good ideas should bypass 
partisanship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I want to talk about has not been mentioned yet. 
I hope the House will take this in the spirit in which it is 
given.  The premise is that Canadians do not feel engaged or they 
do not seem to understand parliament.  I told the member from 
Scarborough what my agenda is.  A lot of people were amazed. They 
did not know what I did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that we are not doing a very good job of 
explaining to Canadians at large the scope of activity that goes 
on.  More important, I do not think Canadians feel connected to 
this place.  They can watch CPAC if they can get away from work 
but that means sitting in front of a television. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping there is a way to do this.  I am wondering why I as 
a member of parliament or a constituent of mine cannot tune in to 
a radio band and listen to the proceedings of the House of 
Commons of Canada.  Why can I not follow the debate unless I am 
not in front of a television?   Why do my constituents need to be 
in front of a television to hear me speak on an issue that 
concerns them or to hear the questions I am asked or the answers 
that I give? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How hard could it be for the Parliament of Canada to communicate 
to Canadians the activities in the House?  Question period is not 
a good reflection on members of parliament and the quality of 
work in this place.  The debate on bills, motions, opposition day 
motions and the like are very interesting and very important to a 
lot of people out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise that with you, Mr. Chairman, in the hope that you will 
bring it to the committee to find out if there is a possibility 
for Canadians to listen to the House of Commons when there are 
matters of importance they would like to hear rather than waiting 
for <I>Hansard</I> to be published or going to the library if they 
do not have access to the Internet.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is important enough to be debated in this place it is 
important enough for Canadians to be aware of it and to be aware 
of it on a timely basis.  The broadcasting angle may be a way to 
address that need and to connect with Canadians about the 
important work in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  I would like to remind my colleagues that 
we have approximately 20 minutes left.  I understand there are 
yet a few members wishing to speak.  We will begin with the 
member for Elk Island and I will leave it to the three members 
who wish to speak to share the time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK328"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Chairman, I will ask some questions of the hon. member who just 
spoke.  We have had some good times together on the finance 
committee.  I will ask him the questions, but I will not give him 
an opportunity to answer because I am now speaking myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may want to consider this.  He said he ran on a party 
platform, as we did.  There is certainly a lot of truth to that. 
The fact of the matter is that we deal with many issues in the 
House that are not the object of debate during an election 
campaign.  It is incumbent on us, then, to make sure that we as 
individual members of parliament have the ear of our constituents 
so we can represent them in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very curious question for which I have never been able 
to get a decent answer, that is, how come we, on our opposition 
day, chose word for word a paragraph right out of the election 
platform of the Liberals which all of the Liberals on command 
then voted against?  To me that contradicts what he said, but 
that is getting partisan and the whole tone of tonight is very 
non-partisan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I already stated my case on private members' business earlier 
today during questions and comments.  I also spoke when we had 
the debate some time ago.  I would like to add a few things that 
I do not think I spoke about previously and that I think are 
relevant to your committee, Mr. Chairman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to committees, I have some really important points. 
I have enjoyed working on the finance committee.   We have a good 
working relationship in the committee, but there are some real 
frustrations.  First, the majority the government holds on the 
committee and the presence of the parliamentary secretary, who 
seems to direct the votes, are very frustrating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not mind if I present my ideas and the people hearing those 
ideas reject them because they are not valid or I do not have a 
strong enough argument or I do not express them well enough. Then 
I lose that debate and the vote goes against me.  That is fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when I present something in committee and can tell by 
the body language that the people agree with me—I taught for 31 
years and learned when my students were with me and when they 
were not—but the parliamentary secretary opens his mouth and 
basically suggests to the members that they should vote against 
me and then they all do, I find it very frustrating.  I do not 
know whether our standing orders can be changed to accommodate 
this frustration, but I certainly would echo what some of the 
other members have said and that is that perhaps the 
parliamentary secretary should not be on the committee acting as 
whip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found the process of the election of chairs very frustrating. 
I do not think it is right that all we get is a motion that 
so-and-so be elected and then we vote on that.  Usually in 
elections there is a list of candidates.  In meetings which we 
conduct under <I>Robert's Rules of Order</I>, we open the floor 
for nominations and accept all the names.  Then there is a vote 
based on all of the names on the slate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens too often in our committees here is that the 
instant the clerk of the committee, who chairs the committee 
until the chairperson is selected, says the meeting is 
constituted and we are accepting nominations, whoever yells the 
loudest gets recognized.  I have noticed in the meetings I have 
been in that the clerk of the committee always has her face to 
the right so that she is looking at the Liberal members, whereas 
we on the other side are ignored.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact the last time we elected the chair of the 
finance committee I was prepared to nominate the person who won. 
That would have been a wonderful non-partisan effort to show that 
we were working together as a committee.  We should have a slate 
of candidates and there should be a ballot, perhaps a run-off 
ballot.  I would like it to be a secret ballot.  The choice of 
the chairs of the committees should not be orchestrated from on 
high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about government control with its majority on 
committees.  Some may say that the government has to have the 
ability to promote its agenda.  That is true to a certain extent. 
I have had several experiences in my seven years where the 
committee chair has in my humble unbiased view made an error. I 
referred to this once or twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I brought one to the House as a point of order.  A motion 
actually passed and the chairperson of the particular committee 
said that it had failed.  I pointed out to the chairperson that 
only two people had said yes, that nobody had said no and that 
therefore the chairperson saying the motion had failed was the 
opposite to what it should be.  Then we got into a bit of a 
shouting match because I did not accept the chairperson had the 
right to say that a motion had failed when in fact it had passed. 
Eventually in this case he went back to the rules and said that 
was his decision.  Then he said “Shall the decision of the chair 
be upheld” and the majority on the government side said yes, the 
decision should be upheld, and so it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot do that.  One cannot do something that is against the 
rules of procedure in committee and then somehow justify it by 
getting other people who happen to be on one's side to back it 
up.  I would like to see something in our standing orders which 
would allow an appeal for things like that to the Speaker or to 
the procedure and House affairs standing committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committee travel was mentioned earlier.  Sometimes our party, as 
the official opposition, has denied the right of committees to 
travel.  I recognize that it is important for committees to 
travel, but very often the official opposition uses that as a 
bargaining chip when it wants something else.  Often it is the 
recalcitrance of the House leader of the government that changes 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to say a little about free votes in the House.  It is 
something that we should do.  Even though the government ran on a 
platform, there are sometimes amendments which are needed to 
improve legislation.  To always wholesale deny a motion, because 
it comes from opposition without in my view proper thought being 
given to it, is an affront to me as a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say something about the parliamentary calendar. 
I would like to see MPs have more days in the riding.  I am one 
that is in this place way too much.  I do not know why it is. 
Maybe I have a problem and should go to see a psychiatrist about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of this lady that I have in my riding who is 
always watching CPAC.  I asked her one day if she had any other 
medical problems.  The parliamentary calendar should be changed 
because I would like to have more days in my riding, but I feel 
when the House is in session I have an obligation to be here. 
That is how it ought to be.  Consequently I would like to see 
some change to in calendar to allow members of parliament more 
days in their ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to suggest that we improve attendance in the 
House.  I really would like to see members actively engaged in 
debate in the House, instead of just a token number of people. 
With committees running at the same time we are in committee and 
then we get a phone call in the committee room which says to get 
down here and make a speech.  We come down here and make our 
speech on the topic, and we have not heard what other people have 
said.  It is not a true interaction.  It is not a true debate. It 
is a monologue that we deliver and then rush back to our 
committees.  I would like to see some changes in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say one thing about time allocation and closure.  The 
government holds the record on the number of times it has been 
used.  That defeats what parliament is about.  Parliament is 
about words.  We use words to spread ideas.  The clerk will know 
that I have stated to him some time ago that one of the flaws of 
this place is that we do not know how to use the language.

<A HREF="#LINKT148"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Language is the embodiment of the ideas that we have in our 
heads.  I would like to see the rules on closure changed.  The 
government should not be allowed to introduce closure or time 
allocation until a certain minimum period has been spent on a 
bill at each level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a number of occasions the government has moved time 
allocation at the report stage of a bill saying that the bill 
will go through all the remaining stages and will be finished at 
the end of the day.  That is not adequate.  We should have a 
minimum of one day to debate each stage of a bill, although I 
would like to see more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to comment on bills going to committee before second 
reading.  I find that unsatisfactory.  It sounded at first to be 
so good, but we need to debate the principal of a bill before we 
send it to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I have some question with respect to all the disallowed 
words.  We as members of parliament should use our discretion and 
should be very careful when we condemn other members.  However I 
personally find it an affront when other people do something and 
I am called out of order for having pointed it out.  I resent the 
restriction on the words that we can use.  Nevertheless, we 
should still be very honourable all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  In the 10 minutes remaining, I will 
recognize the member for Yukon.  The hon. member for Elk Island 
on a point of order?. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I would not have any objection 
if we went five or eight minutes longer to give other members an 
opportunity to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B>  As this is a new format and in the spirit 
of co-operation I hope members will be mindful of the late hour. 
The understanding was that everyone would have completed their 
remarks by 10:58.  Trusting that members will not abuse the 
latitude the Chair will exercise, I will begin with the member 
for Yukon. 
<P><A NAME="LINK329"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I 
appreciate your flexibility and I will try to make the few points 
that I have as quickly as possible.  These comments have come up 
during the debate tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 301 of us in the House and we will not always get our 
way.  In any job that any of us have had I am sure there were 
some frustrations.  Before people out there line up to break 
down the doors of parliament, as was suggested by the member from 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, I would like to make contrary arguments 
to some of the points that he made which I feel are a bit of 
hyperbole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that this was not a democracy.  In my adult life as a 
spectator viewing parliament, whatever government was elected by 
the people or whatever party was elected by a majority, it seems 
to have been able to make the laws of the land, to promote 
programs and platforms that it wanted and to implement them in a 
democratic fashion.  It seems to be working relatively well in 
that respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member went on to ask why we were dealing with taxation 
issues or endangered species.  The point still puzzles me.  This 
is a democracy and times have changed so that there is a surplus 
and a more competitive world.  We need to make tax cuts and that 
is why we made the biggest tax cut in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in parliament and across the country are unified in their 
beliefs that we need to solve child poverty or work to reduce it. 
That is why we brought in the child tax credit, the largest 
recently started, social program.  The people of Canada and the 
majority of parliamentarians wanted this so the government 
implemented it.  That is democracy and that is exactly what 
should be happening here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about the major huge reports on health 
care and on aboriginal affairs.  Again I think it is hyperbole to 
say that nothing came out of them.  It is never a loss to do 
study.  It is never a loss to do education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a major health accord this fall between the provinces 
and the federal government that had all sorts of innovative 
things in it.  I assume that some of those things and other 
progress in health care that has happened since that report came 
from that report.  The people who work in the field refer to 
those reports and use what knowledge they can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course in the aboriginal affairs field there has been 
“Gathering Strength” and a number of very progressive items 
in the throne speech.  It is not productive to say that nothing 
comes out of the studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the member for Elk Island being here tonight.  We 
have shared many late night debates.  I want to say that 
sometimes party positions change, in all parties, because the 
circumstances change.  A member would be doing the wrong thing if 
he or she did not change.  That relates to the taxation item I 
mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my frustrations in the parliamentary system is that we 
cannot be here all the time when there are debates because we 
have so many other events to attend, such as committee meetings 
or dealing with constituents.  We come into a debate having 
missed half of it, so how can we be knowledgeable when it is our 
turn to speak on that topic?  I do not know how this is solved. I 
want to table this as one of my frustrations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will elaborate on something one of my colleagues said earlier 
on the pincer between the judiciary and the executive.  At least 
it is not there without our own doing or causing.  A strong 
executive and also a first past the post system allow us to have 
a strong government that can work fast to solve the problems. 
That is more important in this rapidly changing world.  We have 
elected to have government work in that way.  As to the 
judiciary, the only reason it can make decisions is that we make 
laws that are unclear or we give it the latitude to make 
decisions.  If we want to prescribe it so that the judiciary does 
not have an effect, we can do that.  Once again, that limit on us 
is through our own doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the idea that came up earlier of explaining things 
better to the public and to ourselves when bills are coming 
forward on the legislative agenda.  Perhaps we could have a one 
page summary for parliamentarians and Canadians.  Perhaps CPAC 
could play it.  I appreciated the reception that CPAC gave today, 
because it explained some things I did not understand in regard 
to people knowing what bills were before the House.  I 
congratulate the <I>Hill Times</I> for doing this.  I was reading 
it today and I kept that aside.  There is not a lot of that 
information out in the public so that people know what bills they 
might comment on and what the intent is of those bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my last points is on private members' bills.  There has 
been a lot of discussion on this, with several debates this 
session.  If people want more respect for this, they also have to 
remember how legislation is normally arrived at:  through a large 
bureaucracy of professional expertise that has studied and has 
been expert in that area for years.  Private members' bills might 
come forward from members who have not taken advantage of that 
expertise and the knowledge of how it fits into the present 
environment.  Then they expect the bills to be taken seriously. 
If that procedure is ironed out it would help to give this more 
credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final point is on question period.  Someone asked during the 
debate what would happen if we eliminated question period.  One 
comment is that I think it would be good if we eliminated 
discussion in question period that relates to individual members 
of parliament.  There are issues in the country that are a lot 
larger than that.  In the last several months, part of question 
period has been taken up with discussion on members from 
virtually all the parties in the House.  To me that has not dealt 
with the major issues of the land and our time is limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last quick point is that if we did not have question period, 
which is the 45 minutes a day that the press is in the gallery 
and everyone is here, I wonder what would be covered.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, I congratulate the hon. 
member for Yukon for taking part in this debate because these are 
important debates.  The hon. member for Yukon is a new member to 
the House and it takes a lot of courage to just plunge into this 
kind of thing.  I will try to be brief because I appreciate that 
it is late and the staff are staying here, waiting for us to 
finish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to most of the debate and have been here for 
much of it as well.  I make the observation that particularly a 
lot of it dealt with private members' business.  The theme that 
ran consistently through the debate tonight was the whole idea 
that private members' bills needed to be made votable, but lost 
in all of that, in my opinion, is that it is not a matter of 
whether private members' bills become votable automatically or 
whatever.  It is a matter of whether private members' bills 
succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is this whole idea of backbench MPs bringing in 
legislation.  The real message we want to get out to the public 
is that these bills that we do introduce actually do become law 
eventually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You well know, Mr. Chairman, with all your long experience, that 
in fact the government holds all the cards when it comes to 
legislation going through the House, whether it is government 
legislation or private members' legislation.  That is not wrong. 
The government is elected to govern.  The government has the 
resources and the absolute duty to make sure that no legislation 
succeeds through the House that actually does not work or that is 
inconsistent with the interest of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty with private members' business is, as we have 
heard tonight, that we get focused on our own ideas.  We get 
focused on the interests of our own constituents.  We will see a 
piece of private members' legislation as the be-all and the 
end-all.  It may be selected.  It may be deemed votable.  It may 
go to committee.  We as individuals will defend that legislation, 
even if that legislation in fact may have a very negative impact 
out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed in private members' business, as I have discovered 
because I have been a great champion of expanding it, the reality 
is that we are all politicians here.  We all act with the sort of 
self-interest of our constituents, but a self-interest 
nevertheless of politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The classic example is all those backbench MPs who submit 
private members' bills with no intention of them ever becoming 
votable, who submit them for first reading debate for the sole 
reason that they can get the quick hit in the newspapers.  I have 
seen members submit six, seven, eight or ten private members' 
bills and motions, all for the short political advantage that 
they might get in their riding or with their constituents, or 
just to say something about a faint hope cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my first recommendations in private members' business 
would be that we restrict the number of first reading motions and 
bills that a member can put forward. As you 
well know, Mr. Chairman, it is one of the things that so occupies 
those members of staff who are responsible for drafting private 
members' bills or all those, shall we say, dilatory bills that 
members never intend in the first place to ever go anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point that has come up, and I think it is a very good 
point, is the proposal that has been bandied about to get around 
the subcommittee on private members that we all agree we do not 
like.  It works by consensus and it determines whether bills are 
votable or not votable.  It is not a satisfactory arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been proposed is that every member of the 301 MPs has 
the opportunity during a mandate to have one bill deemed votable 
and that the draw would only determine the order in which the 
members have their bills appear on the order of precedence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very good, but it still has a problem.  The problem is 
that there are still 301 MPs in the House.  We cannot deduct the 
parliamentary secretaries because they only serve for a short 
time and they need to have their turn at their own private 
members' legislation, but if we deduct the frontbenches and the 
ministers we still have 280 members of parliament, all with a 
votable bill.  We would never get through them all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would propose that in a mandate every MP had the choice of 
having one bill deemed votable that he can put forward and still 
be subject to a draw, or that he be given the choice of having 
three non-votable motions or bills so that he can have three 
hours of debate on things that he does not want to go forward but 
he wants a debate on. 
In that way there will be less votable bills overall going to 
committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a bill comes forward to debate I think it is very 
important on private members' bills, if we really do believe that 
they should succeed and they really have merit, that there be 
genuine debate in this House.  I have heard one member say that 
if it is a votable private member's bill there only needs to be 
two people who speak on it and then it should go to the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is wrong.  What we really need when it is private members' 
business and when it is a votable bill are questions and answers. 
What we have now is three hours of debate in which there are 
token speeches or there are real speeches but there is no debate. 
I think if we really believe in private members' bills, that they 
should have merit and they should go the whole distance, then we 
need to have debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also extend the hours of debate for private members' 
business.  Again, if we really believe that it should succeed, 
then we have to have opportunities for that debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of MPs that would rather spend less time here 
than more.  I can tell you, speaking for myself, Mr. Chairman, I 
believe so passionately in this place and in private members' 
legislation that I would be quite happy to stay an extra week or 
an extra two weeks or stay extra hours in the day in order to 
have the private members' debates that we need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is very important that we consider formulas, ways in 
which we can have extended debate on a Friday, for example, or 
extended debate on a Monday, or even a special period for private 
members' business, maybe a couple of weeks even during the break 
in January or in June.  I think it is a mistake if the House 
leaders rule on private members' business on the basis of those 
MPs who are not interested in the business of the House.  I think 
it is very important that we serve those who have legislative 
initiatives that they want to put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just very quickly, I have four other points related to the 
general business of the House.  I would like to see reports from 
committees when they are tabled by the committee chairman.  I 
would like to see some words of debate with respect to them 
because what happens is today the chairman of the finance 
committee tabled the report of the finance committee.  I do not 
know what it says and it just disappears.  I really think it is 
important that something be said with respect to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On minutes of the committee, I would like the minutes of the 
committee to be properly hansarded and put on the Internet.  It 
is not enough just to televise.  It is very, very important to 
have the minutes of committees moved into the public domain as 
quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would just say that like private members' business I 
think committee activity needs to be extended.  As I proposed 
earlier tonight, I think there is much to be said for striking 
special committees that can sit when the House is not sitting and 
even pay those members to sit on those committees if necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Chairman:</B> I thank the hon. member for his 
co-operation and all members for their participation throughout 
the evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 11.08 p.m., pursuant to the order made earlier today, 
the committee will rise and I will leave the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> This House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 2 p.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 11.08 p.m.)
