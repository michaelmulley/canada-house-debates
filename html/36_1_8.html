take this opportunity to pay tribute to Ralph Campbell, a 
constituent in my riding, for his work as a volunteer with 
Canadian Executive Services Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CESO is a non-profit, volunteer based organization which 
transfers Canadian expertise to businesses, communities and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this Liberal government treats the aspirations of British 
Columbians as grievances. The fact of the matter is that British 
Columbians have lost faith in Ottawa and who can blame them? 
British Columbians are crying out for federal leadership and this 
government is failing them miserably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere is this better displayed than in the Liberals' 
mismanagement of the Pacific salmon dispute over the past four 
years. The sustainability of the Pacific salmon fishery is at 
stake and the minister of fisheries sits on his hands and does 
nothing except criticize his own citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having witnessed the Tory government destroy the Atlantic 
fishery a few years ago, this government seems intent on doing 
the same to the Pacific fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a simple case of Liberal, Tory, same old incompetent 
story. This government had better wake up to the concerns of 
British Columbians.  A good start would be to resolve the crisis 
in the salmon fishery before it is too late.

rise today to recognize the outstanding municipal career of Mr. 
Tom Edwards who announced Monday that he will not be seeking 
re-election as mayor of the town of Whitby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mayor Edwards has a long and distinguished career in public 
service spanning five decades.  After faithful service to his 
country in the armed forces he became involved in the labour 
movement and served as either president or vice-president of the 
Oshawa and District Labour Council for 18 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entering politics in 1960 Mayor Edwards was elected to the 
Whitby Public School Board.  In 1964 he was elected to the 
council for the county of Ontario where he served in the 
capacities of reeve and councillor.  In 1980 he moved to Durham 
regional council and in 1991 was elected as mayor of the town of 
Whitby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a rookie councillor in 1991, I often turned to Tom for 
guidance and advice.  He was never too busy to help a newcomer 
learn the ropes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tom Edwards has served his community well over the years and 
Whitby is a better place for it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for some 
days federalist circles have been on red alert, because Mr. 
Bouchard's economic mission to France has been a success on all 
counts, which disturbs the federalists across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, this mission is a real success.  Again yesterday, Mr. 
Bouchard spoke before 500 world business leaders, and a few minutes 
later some 30 economic agreements with a total value of $170 
million were signed between French and Quebec businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ultimate goal of the undertakings by Mr. Bouchard and the 
ministers accompanying him is to make Quebec a focal point of trade 
exchanges between Europe and the rest of America, and we believe 
this project has every chance of success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This unprecedented support for Quebec democracy and the 
contracts and jobs for Quebecers arising out of this mission by our 
premier ultimately benefit all of Quebec.  Anyone who would dare 
minimize this good news would be showing bad faith, nothing more.

Speaker, I wish to inform the House and all Canadians that 
October is breast cancer awareness month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Breast cancer remains a major health problem for women in 
Canada. We estimate that approximately 18,400 new breast cancer 
cases will be diagnosed this year and that 5,100 women will die 
of this disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is concerned about the suffering caused 
by breast cancer in our society and has taken steps to address 
this present situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 Health Canada launched a five year $25 million 
initiative on breast cancer, a collaboration among breast cancer 
survivors, health care professionals, NGOs, provincial 
authorities, researchers and support groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Borrowing from the ideas generated at the landmark National 
Forum on Breast Cancer in November 1993, federal leadership 
mobilized concerted country wide efforts around breast cancer 
through five linked components:  the Canadian breast cancer 
research initiative; and the Canadian breast cancer screening 
initiative; clinical practice guidelines; the professional 
education strategy; and five breast cancer information exchange 
pilot projects.

the throne speech neglected to acknowledge and invite municipal 
governments, the governments closest to the people to help keep 
Canada together. There are over 4,400 municipal governments in 
Canada who are the first order of government, again the 
governments closest to the people. Who better to consult on any

medication can get medication without price being an impediment.

<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It is my duty to inform the House that a 
vacancy has occurred in the representation, namely Mrs. Sharon 
Hayes, member for the electoral district of Port 
Moody—Coquitlam, by resignation effective October 1, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to section 25(1)(b) of the Parliament of Canada Act, I 
have addressed today my warrant to the Chief Electoral Officer 
for the issue of a writ for the election of a member to fill this 
vacancy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the House to provide a brief 
explanation of the resignation today of the member for Port 
Moody—Coquitlam and pay tribute to her dedication to the House, 
to her constituents and her family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will know that the member for Port Moody—Coquitlam 
was a tireless advocate for and defender of the Canadian family 
both within our caucus and without. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House and in committee, Sharon Hayes was a tireless 
advocate for tax relief for families, protection for the unborn 
and the elderly, protection of the family from violence and state 
interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all her work she was supported by her own family, her two 
daughters and her devoted husband Doug.  However, in April of 
this year just before the federal election was called, tragedy 
struck her family.  Her husband Doug, an insurance industry 
executive, suffered a heart attack followed by a number of 
serious complications which affected his eyesight and other 
faculties. These complications have not gone away. They have in 
fact increased Doug's dependence on his family's care and 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For five months through the election campaign, through the 
summer and the opening of Parliament, Sharon valiantly struggled 
to perform two duties, to her constituents and to the House, and 
her duty to her husband who needs her more than he has ever 
needed her before.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many of us when we are confronted with two hard choices or 
options, she attempted for a while to pursue both.  Just this 
week she decided that a real choice had to be made and, 
consistent with her attachment to the supreme value of the 
family, she has chosen to devote all her time to Doug's support 
and recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the people of Port Moody—Coquitlam for their 
understanding of Sharon's dilemma over these past five to six 
months.  We assure them that other members of Parliament are more 
than willing to help represent them until a successor for Sharon 
is chosen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I want to pay tribute to Sharon Hayes, who is now 
demonstrating her commitment to family in the most profound way 
possible.  Our prayers and best wishes are with both Sharon and 
Doug.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in accordance with Standing Order 48, I would like to 
raise a question of privilege regarding the premature disclosure 
of a committee report.  I am presenting this question at the 
first possible opportunity since committees of the House were 
only struck yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to information documents reveal that on April 18, 1997 
the industry minister and industry department officials were in 
possession of draft copies of the fifth report of the Standing 
Committee on Industry. The final report of the committee, 
entitled “Review of section 14 of the Patent Act amendment, 
1992” was reported to the House of Commons only on April 
23, 1997, five days later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a copy of that draft report with me.  In accordance with 
Beauchesne's reference No. 116 on page 29 I would like to table 
that document with the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beauchesne's reference No. 877 on page 241 states that “no act 
done at any committee should be divulged before it has been 
presented to the House”.  Beauchesne's citation No. 877(2) goes 
further to state that “the publication of proceedings of 
committees conducted with closed doors or of reports of 
committees before they are available to members will constitute a 
breach of privilege”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the privileges of the House, divulging an in 
camera draft report is a breach since it runs against the 
tradition that members of the House have the right to first view 
reports of committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beauchesne's reference No. 57 on page 18 states “the House has 
in the past regarded the publication of the proceedings or 
reports of committees sitting in camera to be a breach of 
privilege”. 
<A NAME="LINK143">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I move: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House refer the matter to the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs. 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK144"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I understand it correctly, 
the issue brought to our attention by the hon. member is that the 
Minister of Industry of the last Parliament saw a document before 
it was tabled in the House.  Mr. Speaker will know that the 
Minister of Industry is a member of Parliament and all members of 
Parliament can avail themselves of the privilege of seeing a 
document that is before a committee.  It is the revealing of it 
generally that is prohibited under the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding that, I believe that you, Mr. Speaker, claimed 
the privileges of the House for this Parliament on Tuesday of 
last week. Prior to Tuesday of last week no privileges were 
claimed.  You had not previously claimed them on behalf of this 
Parliament because this Parliament did not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that one who says that there has been a breach of this 
Parliament for an act that occurred in a previous Parliament is 
not a question of privilege.  There is perhaps a point of order 
that could be made were it to be in the same Parliament, but it 
is not even that.  It was in a different Parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would urge you not to be persuaded by the rather feeble 
argument offered by the government House leader that whatever 
happened in the last Parliament is somehow immune to your 
judgment or to the judgment of members of its appropriateness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government House leader actually saying you can do 
anything you like in the dying days of a Parliament because once 
the election is called there is no more privilege, there are no 
more rules and it is perfectly okay for a committee to vet its 
report with the government minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument that the minister is also a member of Parliament 
completely evades the point of this point of privilege.  What 
should concern us all, if we are concerned at all about the 
independence of committees, is that government members on this 
committee vetted the report with the Minister of Industry and it 
was subsequently changed.  This is an affront to our notion of 
how committees should work and how Parliament should work.  It is 
something that the Chair should take very seriously. 
<P><A NAME="LINK146"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  First, with regard to the tabling of the 
document, I will accept as a submission to myself so I can look 
at the document, the draft I believe the hon. member called it. 
I would like her to put that in my hands following these 
procedures today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will of course take into consideration the point made by the 
hon. government House leader as soon as I get all of the 
information that I need to proceed on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear, if at all possible, comment from the 
minister, but I would reserve even that judgment until I settle 
in my own mind the point that the hon. House leader has brought 
as well as that of the member for Winnipeg—Transcona. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take the information under advisement and I will study 
it.  I will get back to the House after I have satisfied myself 
that I have enough information to proceed to make a judgment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, again it 
goes back to question period and the purpose of question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that 
question period is there so the opposition to take the government 
to task for deeds it has either done or not done and answer to 
the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What confuses me in this whole process is in the last number of 
days we have had questions thrown at the ministers in advance. In 
other words, backbench members of the government are putting on 
average two questions a day and the ministers are absolutely 
prepared in advance and actually reading from statements— 
<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member and all hon. members 
will agree that all members in the House, except of course the 
parliamentary secretaries and the ministers, have the right to 
put questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Charlotte can believe or not that the 
minister is well prepared.  Some people would look at that as a 
compliment and other people would look at it in another way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for myself, I intend to recognize members on all sides of the 
House when they stand in their places to ask questions.  I know 
all hon. members will accept this in the spirit with which I say 
it.  It is not my decision to judge either the quality of a 
question or the quality of an answer. I leave that to the House. 
It is my responsibility to see to it that hon. members' rights 
are respected in the House. 
Until the House decides to give me a new set of guidelines to 
work by, I will try to recognize all members of the House who 
feel when they have a legitimate question, that they will get, I 
hope, what they feel is a legitimate answer.

<A NAME="LINK153">&nbsp;</A>

is going to include the other two immediately? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there have also been 
consultations regarding the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the report of the Security Establishment Commissioner for 
the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997, laid upon the table April 
24, 1997, be permanently referred to the Standing Committee on 
National Defence and Veterans Affairs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I also move: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Standing Order 104(2) be amended in subsections (h) and (j) 
be deleting the word “sixteen” and substituting therefor the 
word “eighteen”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has to do with adding two members of Parliament to two

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order. Yesterday I rose on a point of order 
during Routine Proceedings after the member for Scarborough 
Southwest had introduced a private member's bill which in the 
previous Parliament passed all stages in both the House and the 
Senate. The process was interrupted by the calling of the 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I asked for the unanimous consent of the House to deem 
the bill to have passed all stages in the House once again. 
Consent was given except for one member of the Bloc who indicated 
that if I brought the matter up again today when there would have 
been time to study it overnight then we could revisit that 
unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might ask, Mr. Speaker, if we might revisit now that unanimous 
consent to have that member's bill deemed to have passed all 
stages. 
<A NAME="LINK156">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member have the unanimous 
consent of the House to move this motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, for clarification purposes, 
the bill is to prevent criminals from making profit from the 
proceeds of crime from the writing of stories or the making of 
films having to do with their exploits in crime.  I wanted to 
clarify it for all the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-224, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
(offence committed outside Canada). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, section 6(2) of the Criminal Code 
specifies that, with few exceptions such as war crimes, hostage 
taking and hijacking, persons are not to be convicted of offences 
committed outside Canada.  This results in situations where, as 
has happened, two Canadians holidaying in the Caribbean assault 
another Canadian.  At present there is no way of prosecuting 
those people in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the authorities in the Caribbean do not proceed with a 
charge, the people get away with what would clearly be a crime if 
committed in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill closes this loophole by providing that any act or 
omission committed outside Canada, which if committed in Canada 
would constitute an offence under the Criminal Code, shall be 
deemed to have been committed in Canada if the perpetrator is a 
Canadian citizen, a permanent resident or is present in Canada 
after the commission of the act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the bill can be succinctly 
stated.  It would ensure that the only valid marriage in Canada 
is between one man and one woman.  There are a few cultures and 
religions in the world which allow multiple wives or husbands. 
That is not part of Canada's history, tradition or values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are one or two countries or states which either permit or 
are thinking of permitting persons of the same sex to marry. 
That is not part of Canada's history, tradition or values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's history, tradition and values are being challenged in 
our courts.  The United States has already passed similar 
legislation to defend the institution of marriage.  It is time 
for Canada to do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would ensure that marriage remains what Canadians have 
always known it to be:  a legal union between an unmarried female 
and an unmarried male.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-226, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
(protection of witnesses). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce this bill, which 
I had also introduced in the last Parliament and which had received 
majority support at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, my bill died on the Order Paper due to the 
dissolution of Parliament and the election call. At the time, it had 
been referred to the Standing Committee on Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to amend the Criminal Code so that 
every person who testifies in proceedings relating to a sexual offence 
or assault, or in which the offender allegedly used, attempted to use or 
threatened to use violence, is afforded the same protection as witnesses 
under 14 years of age are currently afforded under the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would amend the Criminal Code so that an accused can no longer 
personally cross-examine a witness in such proceedings, unless the trial 
judge is of the opinion that it is necessary for the proper 
administration of justice. 
Therefore, this bill seeks to protect, under certain circumstances, the 
integrity and the safety of those who testify in criminal proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I hope my bill will again get the support of the 
members of this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That a Message be sent to the Senate to acquaint that House 
accordingly. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, on April 15, 1997, the Quebec National 
Assembly voted unanimously in favour of a resolution for a 
constitutional amendment that would end the application to Quebec of 
subsections (1) to (4) of section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tabled an identical resolution in the House on April 22, but the 
election call prevented us from moving to strike a committee to examine 
this constitutional amendment.  That is why I am tabling that resolution 
again, so that it can be referred to a special joint committee that is 
to report to Parliament in the coming weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated on several occasions, the Government of Canada 
supports the proposed amendment because it is a good thing for the 
citizens affected by it and because it enjoys a reasonable degree of 
support from those citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing to want linguistic school boards and another thing 
to want to achieve them by way of a constitutional change. 
Although the Government of Canada has noted in recent months the 
existence of a consensus surrounding this proposal, including for the 
constitutional amendment, we could not flout the democratic traditions 
that Quebeckers share with all their fellow Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Official Opposition in the National Assembly asked the 
Government of Quebec, in vain, to strike a parliamentary committee. 
Therefore, we feel it is necessary to proceed, respecting our 
parliamentary procedure, by striking a joint committee to which experts, 
groups and citizens will be able to express their views.  Such a 
committee will allow them to make their opinions known while promoting 
better understanding of the changes sought by the constitutional 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some time now, Quebec society has been secularized and has 
become considerably diversified through the contribution of newcomers. 
It is therefore not surprising that this society has questioned on many 
occasions the appropriateness of a system established on a 
denominational basis.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the consultations and reports that have marked the past 
30 years, a consensus has emerged on the need to reorganize school 
structures along linguistic, rather than denominational, lines.  That 
consensus was confirmed during the Estates General on Education in 1996, 
which verified that Catholic and Protestant Quebeckers, anglophones and 
francophones alike, wanted to establish linguistic school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's National Assembly acted on that desire for change by 
unanimously passing, on April 15, 1997, the resolution to amend section 
93 of the Constitution Act, 1867, with respect to its application to 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two months later, on June 19, 1997, Quebec MNAs again demonstrated 
their agreement on this matter by unanimously voting in favour of the 
legislation that will ensure the implementation of linguistic school 
boards and govern the place and role of confessionality in Quebec's 
school system.  This legislation is the Act to amend the Education Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment not only makes it possible to adapt the 
Canadian Constitution to take account of the deep-seated changes Quebec 
society has undergone, but it also has the merit of allowing for the 
changes sought by the vast majority of the citizens that are affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is noteworthy that the Quebec government is not seeking 
to exclude any reference to religion in education, but rather to 
secularize the administrative structures.  Many Quebeckers are attached 
to religious instruction, and the Quebec government has taken account of 
that. 
Section 520 of the Education Act, as amended by section 36 and by the 
schedule of the Act to amend the Education Act, authorizes schools that 
so desire to retain their denominational orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the right to religious instruction is still guaranteed 
under section 41 of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, a 
document that has quasi-constitutional status according to the Supreme 
Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such arrangements help explain the support garnered by the reform 
sought by the Quebec authorities.  While it has not expressed itself on 
the means used, the assembly of Quebec bishops has nevertheless publicly 
supported the establishment of linguistic school boards and has not 
opposed amending section 93. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For their part, many groups and associations have endorsed the 
constitutional amendment requested by Quebec's National Assembly. 
By way of example, I would mention the Catholic Committee of the 
Superior Council of Education, the Federation of School Boards, the 
Federation of Parents' Committees, and teachers' associations 
representing the entire teaching force of the province. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While section 93 does not protect linguistic rights, language 
and denomination nevertheless have close historical ties.  In the 
past, Quebec's anglophone minority relied heavily on the 
Protestant school boards to ensure its development.  The 
constitutional amendment proposed today does not run counter to 
the interests of that community.  On the contrary in effect 
section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms will 
continue to provide strong constitutional guarantees to Quebec 
anglophones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While section 93 guarantees the existence of denominational 
management structures in Montreal and Quebec City and the right 
of dissent in the rest of the province, section 23 allows the 
minority to control and manage linguistic school structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition the establishment of linguistic school boards will 
allow the anglophone community to consolidate its school 
population and thus to establish a more solid foundation for its 
rights under section 23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As things stand now, Protestant school boards serve a growing 
number of children whose language of instruction is French.  This 
phenomenon threatens to strip the anglophone community of its 
control over those institutions, institutions which are less and 
less reflective of sociological reality and which cannot in any 
event address the needs of the Catholic segment of the anglophone 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard it is important to note that students who profess 
the Protestant faith today account for less than 40 percent of the 
school population served by Protestant school boards.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course it is normal for any minority group to want to 
increase its constitutional rights.  We understand the anglophone 
minority's concerns about its demographic situation, about the 
provisions which limit access to English schools and about the 
secessionist orientation of the current Quebec government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this light we understand why some groups in the anglophone 
community are using this opportunity to call for the full 
application of section 23 in Quebec. Nevertheless the Government 
of Canada believes that this issue raises a whole other debate. 
While the proposed amendment does not go as far as some might 
want, it nevertheless deserves to be passed because it is in the 
interests of both the minority and the majority in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of which I am a member has reiterated on a number 
of occasions that any constitutional amendment must be the 
subject of a reasonable consensus within the minorities affected. 
I am pleased to note that that requirement is met in this case. 
The Government of Canada solemnly affirms that the same 
requirement would be indispensable in the event that another 
province called for an amendment with respect to guarantees for 
minorities within its territory. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Quebec society has succeeded in reaching a consensus 
on a constitutional issue which touches upon such vital issues for 
citizens as schooling, language, religion and the Constitution.  For 
that reason, and because it will benefit the Quebec community as a 
whole, the government believes that this amendment should be passed.

<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the minister's remarks 
today, which he has made in large part at an earlier time in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say at the outset that the official opposition 
regards the proposed amendment to be studied by the proposed 
joint committee as an extremely important one.  It deals with the 
Constitution which is the fundamental law of the land.  It deals 
with children and education.  The manner in which it is handled 
may set an important precedent for other provinces with respect 
to educational reform.  It deals with majority and minority 
rights. Of course it also involves Quebec-Canada constitutional 
relations and is therefore part and parcel of the national unity 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform is generally supportive of the establishment of a 
parliamentary committee to study the proposed resolution and 
amendment and to report to the House.  We note that the 
government's motion directs the committee to consult broadly.  We 
like those words.  We want to encourage the government to consult 
broadly on any constitutional initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to give the committee more time to do its work, we will 
propose an amendment to the government motion that the committee 
make its final report no later than the last sitting day in 
December. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some reservations about the proposed committee.  For 
example, we share the view expressed by the member from 
Saint-Hubert in the last House that it is absurd to have senators 
who have no democratic legitimacy in either Quebec or Canada on a 
joint committee.  However until the Senate is reformed, this 
resolution has to pass the Senate as it is, so we do not intend 
to quibble over Senate representation on the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some further comments to make on the committee and the 
process it would employ.  These comments will be made a little 
later by my colleague, the hon. member for South Surrey—White 
Rock—Langley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because this subject is so important to the people of Quebec, I 
dearly wish that I could be making my principal points en 
français.  Since that is not yet quite possible, I am pleased 
that my bilingual colleague from Edmonton—Strathcona will also 
be commenting on the motion a little later in the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few moments to sketch the background of 
this particular motion and resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister said, on April 15, 1997 the Quebec legislature 
voted unanimously in favour of a resolution for a constitutional 
amendment which would end the application to Quebec of 
subsections (1) to (4) of section 93 of the Constitution Act 
1867.  This is the section dealing with provincial jurisdiction 
over education.  This resolution is the latest stage in an 
ongoing internal debate in Quebec over the past 30 years on how 
to change the province's denominationally based school system, 
known as the Confessional School system, into a secular system 
based on language rather than religion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read the text of the resolution passed by the Quebec 
Assembly into the record because I think members studying this 
should have the resolution in front of them. They might want to 
see the section of the Constitution that we are amending. The 
Quebec resolution reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>WHEREAS the Government intends to institute linguistic school 
boards as soon as possible: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>WHEREAS in so doing the National Assembly of Quebec reaffirms 
the established rights of the English-speaking community of 
Quebec.  More specifically, whereas Quebecers whose children are 
admissible in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the 
French Language have the right to have them receive their 
instruction in English language educational facilities under the 
management and control of this community, as provided by law and 
which are financed through public funds; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>WHEREAS it is desirable, for that purpose, to amend the 
Constitution Act, 1867 so that Quebec may recover its full 
capacity to act in matters of education; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>WHEREAS such amendment in no way constitutes recognition by the 
National Assembly of the Constitution Act, 1982, which was 
adopted without its consent; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>WHEREAS undertakings were given by the federal government to 
proceed rapidly with such amendment, through bilateral action and 
with the agreement of the National Assembly, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the National Assembly authorizes the amendment to the 
Constitution of Canada by proclamation of his Excellency the 
Governor Canada under the Great Seal of Canada in accordance with 
the following text: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1.  The Constitution Act, 1867, is amended by adding immediately 
after section 93, the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>93A. “Paragraphs (1) to (4) of section 93 do not apply to 
Quebec.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2.  This amendment may be cited as the Constitution Amendment, 
year of proclamation (Quebec). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be noted that the Quebec assembly goes out of its way to 
state that its proposed amendment in no way constitutes 
recognition by the National Assembly of the Constitution Act of 
1982.  At the same time, the amending formula which the federal 
and Quebec governments propose to apply to this amendment is that 
provided for by section 43 of the Constitution Act of 1982.  In 
other words, the Canadian Constitution is to be amended at the 
request of the Quebec assembly by means of an amending formula 
which the Quebec assembly does not recognize.  Only in Canada 
would we have this phenomenon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The section of the Constitution Act 1867 which the Quebec 
resolution seeks to amend is section 93.  This is a section of 
the Constitution providing for exclusive provincial jurisdiction 
over education, subject to certain provisions pertaining to the 
protection of minority rights. Again I hate to take the time of 
the House but I think it is important to read into the record 
that section so members may have in front of them everything that 
is being talked about here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The full text of section 93 is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>93. In and for each Province the Legislature may exclusively 
make Laws in relation to Education— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is provincial jurisdiction over education, clear and simple. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—subject and according to the following provisions: 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1)  Nothing in any such Law shall prejudicially affect any Right 
or Privilege with respect to Denominational Schools which any 
Class of Persons have by Law in the Province at the Union; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2)  All the Powers, Privileges, and Duties at the Union by Law 
conferred and imposed in Upper Canada on the Separate Schools and 
School Trustees of the Queen's Roman Catholic Subjects shall be 
and the same are hereby extended to the Dissentient Schools of 
the Queen's Protestant and Roman Catholic subjects in Quebec; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the one subsection that specifically mentions the 
province of Quebec. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3)  Where in any Province a System of Separate or Dissentient 
Schools exists by Law at the Union or is thereafter established 
by the Legislature of the Province, an Appeal shall lie to the 
Governor General in Council from any Act or Decision of any 
Provincial Authority affecting any Right or Privilege of the 
Protestant or Roman Catholic Minority of the Queen's Subjects in 
relation to Education; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(4) In case any such Provincial Law as from time to time seems 
to the Governor General in Council requisite for the due 
Execution of the Provisions of this Section is not made, or in 
case any Decision of the Governor General in Council on any 
Appeal under this Section is not duly executed by the proper 
Provincial Authority in that behalf, then and in every such case, 
and as far only as the Circumstances of each case require, the 
Parliament of Canada may make remedial Laws for the due Execution 
of the Provisions of this Section and of any Decision of the 
Governor General in Council under this Section.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Parliament of Canada approves the amendment sought by the 
Quebec assembly, it will be declaring that these last four 
subsections just quoted pertaining to the rights, powers, 
privileges and duties of the denominational schools do not apply 
to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the background, the content and the import of the matter 
to be placed before the proposed special joint committee of the 
House of Commons and the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment to summarize what I think the 
government's position is.  The government will have a chance to 
correct me if I do not have it right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 22 the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs proposed 
that members and senators analyse the proposed amendment by 
asking and answering three fundamental questions.  I take these 
questions to be the principal test that the Government of Canada 
feels members should apply to this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, what amending formula is applicable to this particular 
case?  Second, the government suggests that we ask, is the 
proposed amendment a good thing for the citizens affected by it? 
Third, does this amendment enjoy a reasonable degree of support 
from the citizens affected by it?  Those were the three tests 
that the government proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister then answered those questions on behalf of the 
government first, by saying that in the opinion of the federal 
government section 93 can be amended pursuant to section 43 of 
the Constitution Act, 1982. In other words, this is a bilateral 
amendment which can be made with the approval of the House of 
Commons and the legislature of the province to which the 
amendment applies, namely, Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister answered his second question by saying that the 
proposed amendment is a good thing in his judgment because it 
acknowledges the secularization of the Quebec school system while 
still guaranteeing rights to religious instruction, and because 
it permitted the Quebec educational system to be based on 
language rather than religion and that the proposed system, in 
his judgment, was fair to both language groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister answered his third question by saying that the 
amendment did enjoy a reasonable degree of support from the 
people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to outline the approach of the official opposition 
to this amendment.  First of all, I want to make clear that the 
Reform Party believes strongly in provincial jurisdiction in 
education.  The official opposition therefore neither supports 
nor opposes a confessional school system for Quebec.  We feel 
that this is an issue that the people of Quebec must decide for 
themselves by free and fair democratic processes and in 
accordance with the rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition also wishes to propose that members and 
senators analysing the Quebec resolution subject it to three 
great tests.  I suggest respectfully that our three tests are 
broader and deeper than those proposed by the government.  I 
would like to encourage the government to adopt them as useful 
tests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We propose that if a constitutional amendment proposed by a 
province—whether it is the constitutional amendment proposed 
recently by the Newfoundland Legislature or that now being 
proposed by the Quebec Assembly—meets these three tests, then it 
should be supported by this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We propose that, if a constitutional amendment proposed by a 
legislature does not satisfy these three tests, that legislature 
then be encouraged to make such changes in what it is proposing 
as would be required to meet those tests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to suggest that our three proposed tests for application 
to constitutional amendments are broad enough and deep enough to 
handle any proposed constitutional change, including those of the 
most radical variety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, I think it is very important for this 
Parliament, which is going to be dealing with constitutional 
problems and approaches that have never been dealt with by this 
Parliament, to establish tests that will be applicable to 
virtually any situation that we may be confronted with, and not 
to get into a situation where we apply one set of tests to one 
type of constitutional amendment and then another set to some 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These then, are the three great tests that we would propose 
being applied to this constitutional amendment or any other that 
comes before this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is the test of democratic consent.  The first question 
we ask members and senators of this joint committee to answer for 
themselves is:  Do a majority of the citizens affected by the 
proposed constitutional amendment, in this case a majority of the 
people of Quebec, approve of the amendment?

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not believe since Charlottetown or since Meech Lake that 
any major constitutional amendment should be passed without 
public ratification through a referendum. The public has had too 
many cases where their governments have said this is what our 
people want in terms of constitutional change, and found out 
later that that was not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe on major amendments that the test should be conducted 
through a referendum.  We would therefore ask, have a majority of 
Quebeckers approved of the proposed amendment through a 
referendum process?  Was the referendum process fair and was the 
referendum question unbiased? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second test we propose, and this is not something that 
should have to be said in a parliament or legislature, but it 
does have to be said and that is that the proposed amendment be 
subjected to the test of the rule of law. The Canadian 
Constitution contains four different amending formulas, each of 
which is used for amending different parts of the Constitution. 
Most parts of the Constitution cannot be amended without the 
consent of at least seven provincial legislatures plus 
Parliament, as provided by the amending formula in section 38 of 
the Constitution Act of 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provisions which relate to only one province can be amended by 
the less rigorous section 43 amending formula which requires only 
the consent of Parliament and of the relevant province's 
legislative assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says, and I gather with the concurrence of the 
Government of Quebec, that section 43 is the relevant amending 
formula.  Members and senators, however, on the joint committee 
will want to satisfy themselves that this is in fact the case.  I 
will return to this point in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that the intent of the Fathers of 
Confederation with respect to section 93, the one that is amended 
by this Quebec amendment, was to provide exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction over education, subject only to certain provisions 
for the protection of minority rights. Section 93(1) as it 
currently stands does not prevent Quebec or any other province 
from reforming its educational system or from implementing 
reforms that affect minority rights, but conformity to the rule 
of law as provided by section 93(1) does require that the Quebec 
government demonstrate that any proposed reforms do not 
prejudicially affect the rights of those who desire a religious 
orientation in the education of their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members and senators on the committee should be asking 
themselves and asking the representatives of the Quebec 
government, does the proposed Quebec constitutional amendment 
prejudicially affect in any way the rights of those who desire a 
religious orientation in the education of their children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a third test which must be applied to any proposed 
constitutional amendment and that is the test of the Canadian 
national interest.  I suggest that is a test that in the final 
analysis only the Parliament of Canada can apply.  The actions of 
one province affecting minority and majority rights in education 
may set important precedents regarding educational rights of 
majorities and minorities in other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members and senators on the committee will therefore want to 
assure themselves that the passage of the proposed Quebec 
amendment in no way establishes a precedent prejudicially 
affecting minority rights in other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having outlined those three tests, and I could say a lot more on 
each of them but I have said enough already, I would now like to 
make a preliminary application of those tests to the amendment 
that has been put forward by the Quebec assembly.  I am not 
saying this is the last word in that analysis but I want to 
illustrate how these tests might apply to the amendment that the 
committee will be studying.  It will be up to the joint committee 
of course to apply these tests and other tests to the Quebec 
resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me apply first of all the test of democratic consent as we 
understand it.  In the case of the recent request from the 
Newfoundland legislature asking the House to amend section 17 of 
Newfoundland's 1949 terms of union, the Newfoundland government 
has conducted two referendums and a majority of those voting 
voted on both occasions in favour of the proposed amendment.  In 
our judgment that therefore meets this test of democratic consent 
in a virtually indisputable way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the proposed Quebec amendment, no provincial 
referendum has been held.  We would suggest the test of 
democratic consent has not yet been fully passed.  If the 
provincial government is confident as it says it is that there is 
a broad province wide consensus in favour of the amendment, it 
should conduct a referendum in order to demonstrate that fact 
beyond a reasonable doubt to this House and to other Canadians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to application of the test of the rule of law, the 
government says that section 43 of the 1982 Constitution Act is 
the appropriate amending formula to apply to the Quebec 
resolution. We want to be absolutely certain of that because if 
we proceed on that assumption and the courts end up saying that 
no, we have applied the wrong section, we have done more damage 
than we have good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clearly understood by everyone that the section 43 
amending formula can be used to amend the Constitution of Canada 
in order to place further restrictions on any individual 
provincial government's freedom of action.  In practice whenever 
that is done, a sort of provincial constitution with additional 
safeguards for the rights of the citizens of that province is 
being created. This is what was done for example when several 
sections were added to the charter of rights requiring the New 
Brunswick government to offer services in both French and 
English. Similarly, it is presumably acceptable to use section 43 
to remove any such special restrictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it is not clear that it would be acceptable to use the 
section 43 amending formula to remove a restriction from one 
provincial government when that restriction is still in place for 
every other provincial government in the country, since this 
would have the effect of extending the powers of one province 
into an area henceforth outside the jurisdiction of any other 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such an amendment could potentially require the use of the 
general amending formula, the seven and fifty formula. At the 
very least any provincial government demanding an amendment of 
this sort should be expected to refer the proposed amendment to 
the province's supreme court for a ruling as to whether the use 
of the section 43 amending formula is legally acceptable.  If the 
provincial government fails to do so, the Government of Canada 
should make a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada on that 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These facts relate to section 93 in the following way. Paragraph 
(2) of section 93 was clearly intended to apply only to Quebec 
which is mentioned by name in the paragraph, the only place that 
it is mentioned. Therefore paragraph (2) is in practice part of 
the provincial constitution of Quebec and can be amended using 
the section 43 amending formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But paragraphs (1), (3) and (4) are intended as sections of 
general application to all provinces. These paragraphs apply to 
all provinces except Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and 
Newfoundland. In each of these four provinces, section 93 has 
been replaced by a section which restricts the provincial 
government's ability to prejudicially affect denomination schools 
at least as much as section 93 would have done had section 93 
applied to that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example section 22(1) of the Manitoba Act corresponds to 
section 93(1) and uses almost the same wording, but it contains a 
further restriction on the province's freedom of action. That 
section says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or 
privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class 
of persons have by law or a practice in the province at the 
union. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My argument therefore is it appears that it is probably not 
constitutionally permissible to use the section 43 amending 
formula to amend the Constitution in the manner proposed by the 
federal government and the Quebec assembly. This matter could be 
resolved through a supreme court reference by either the 
Government of Canada or the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party strongly believes in majority opinion and 
majority rights as expressed and exercised through referendum. 
However the Reform Party also believes that the majority has an 
interest in minority rights.  We are all part of some majority in 
some situations, maybe an election or something else, but 
virtually all of us are part of a minority one way or another. It 
is therefore in the majority's interest to have protection of 
minority rights and minority interests and the best way to do 
that is through rigorous adherence to the rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In raising this point I am not trying to be obstructionist in 
any way.  I am trying to wave a red flag.  I think the last thing 
that any of us would want, whether we talk about the people in 
Quebec or people from outside Quebec, is for an amendment like 
this to pass through the Quebec assembly and to pass through this 
Parliament and then to have it be overturned in the courts as 
unconstitutional.  That would be bad for us.  It would be bad for 
Quebec. It would be bad for the process of educational reform in 
that province.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make a preliminary application of the test of the 
Canadian national interest to this amendment.  As previously 
noted, the actions of one province affecting minority or majority 
rights in education may set important precedents regarding 
educational rights of majorities in other provinces.  That is why 
we take so seriously the amendment coming from Newfoundland. Yes 
it pertains only to Newfoundland but does it have precedent 
application for other provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example parents in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba with a 
keen interest in ensuring a religious based education for their 
children are watching both with interest and apprehension the 
precedents being set in educational reform and changes to 
minority rights in both Newfoundland and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, Parliament will want to assure itself that the 
passage of the proposed Quebec amendment or the Newfoundland 
amendment in no way establishes a precedent prejudicially 
affecting minority rights in other provinces.  Even if the 
supreme court were to determine that it is acceptable to use the 
section 43 amending formula to give Quebec powers that are not 
available to other provinces, the use of an amending formula that 
excludes most Canadians in order to grant special status to one 
province violates the principle of equality of provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this were to be permitted, a dangerous precedent could be set 
under which restrictions that had been placed on the powers of 
all provincial governments could be stripped back unilaterally 
from one province or another.  Under such conditions Canada could 
become a patchwork quilt of provinces with different powers.  No 
other federation in the world permits such a situation although 
all federations allow provinces, states and cantons to establish 
their own constitutions so that citizens of each of these units 
can impose further restrictions on their own governments if they 
choose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While no one questions that an improved educational system for 
Quebec is in the Canadian national interest provided Quebec 
remains in Canada, it appears that the form of the proposed 
amendment and the precedents which it may establish do not yet 
fully satisfy the test of the Canadian national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to be constructive.  We therefore want to conclude with 
some suggestions for repairing the possible defects in the Quebec 
constitutional amendment which may make it impossible for this 
House to approve it in its current form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The children of Quebec and provisions for their education are of 
great importance to all Canadians.  They are of great importance 
to the official opposition in this Parliament.  Reform believes 
most strongly that education is a matter of provincial 
responsibility and that provincial jurisdiction over education 
should be respected and enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal interest of the federal Parliament in educational 
reform is mainly that such reforms do not prejudicially affect 
the rights of minorities which Parliament has an obligation to 
protect.  Parliament should discharge these responsibilities by 
applying to constitutional amendments allowing for educational 
reform the three great tests of democratic consent, the rule of 
law, and the Canadian national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chances of the Quebec government's constitutional amendment 
satisfying these three tests would be greatly enhanced and its 
prospects for gaining the support in this Parliament of the 
official opposition would be enhanced if this constitutional 
amendment were to be accompanied by three things: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One, clear evidence of majority support for the Quebec 
constitutional amendment through the results of a province wide 
referendum.  Two, compelling legal evidence, preferably a supreme 
court ruling, establishing that both the proposed approach to 
amending the Constitution and the constitutional amendment itself 
conform to the rule of law. Three, clear evidence demonstrating 
to this Parliament that Quebec's educational reforms do not 
prejudicially affect rights previously granted and thus in no way 
establish precedents which may be damaging to minority rights in 
Quebec or in any other province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give effect to these arguments I therefore move: 
<A NAME="LINK194">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended: by adding immediately after the 
words “concerning the Quebec school system;” the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“more specifically the matter of applying the following three 
tests for such a proposed constitutional amendment:  the test of 
democratic consent, the test of Canadian national interest, and 
the test of the rule of law”; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>and by replacing the words 
“November 7” with the words “the last sitting day in 
December”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
allow me to congratulate you on your new duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are on the verge of a truly historic experience.  I want to 
thank all the parties in this House that will join with the Quebec 
National Assembly to permit, and this is the core of the issue, the 
implementation of a resolution passed by the only francophone 
parliament, the only one controlled by a majority of Quebeckers, 
the National Assembly, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to give three warnings.  The resolution 
that will create the joint committee does not concern Quebec's 
language rights. 
The debate concerns obviously Quebec's ability to withdraw from the 
effect of section 93, especially subsections 1 to 4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be hard pressed to find reference to Quebec's 
language rights.  If we want to consider language rights, we would 
have to consult section 173 of the Charte de la langue française 
and of course the Charte québécoise des droits de la personne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our minds the matter involves—and I see that the Privy 
Council agreed—a bilateral amendment.  I hope the Reform Party 
will understand that the five options offered by the Constitution 
Act, 1982 are clearly worded so that we can make no mistake as 
parliamentarians that we are right to put Quebec's resolution into 
effect according to the bilateral amending formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the leader of the Reform Party does not fully grasp what 
one may call the consensus in Quebec. As for linguistic school boards, 
because that is what this is all about, the resolution says that 
religious beliefs have no bearing on the way Quebec will be organized or 
the selection of an administrative or management method. There is 
therefore no connection between people's religious beliefs and the 
method of management we will adopt for school boards. This is what 
dividing school boards by language is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has a referendum on this issue not been held in Quebec in the 
past 15 years? Because of a lack of democracy? Of course not. 
The reason we have not had a referendum is, first, that the main 
stakeholders in education, regardless of their sympathies, have 
expressed exceptionally clear support for dividing school boards by 
language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the hon. members—as the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs indicated, I think—that, in Quebec, we have 
had a consensus on this issue since 1982: the Conseil supérieur de 
l'éducation and the Assemblée des évêques are in favour of the proposed 
change. When the Assemblée des évêques makes a pronouncement on an 
issue, it usually does so solemnly. Bishops being at the service of the 
Lord, they generally give a great deal of thought to any decision they 
make. They take every necessary precaution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the Leader of the Opposition—and I am prepared to 
table a list of organizations, if he wishes, to help him better 
understand the reality in Quebec—that every player in the area of 
education, organizations such as the Alliance des professeurs, the 
Fédération des cégeps and the Council of Universities, were in favour 
and still are in favour of dividing school boards by language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the official opposition should also know that, since 
the Parent report was tabled, both sovereignist and federalist 
governments have attempted on six separate occasions—yes, six 
occasions—to reform the education system in Quebec. 
Each of these attempts was blocked by the requirements, the obligations 
under section 93. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, what will we do as parliamentarians when, before the holiday 
season—indeed Christmas is coming, but I am confident and also 
grateful to the government for its diligence—we pass a motion 
allowing the National Assembly, therefore the people of Quebec, to 
modernize, thanks to the existing consensus, its school system, so as to 
have linguistic school boards? This is the fundamental issue that must 
be understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this mean, assuming we proceed, that religious or pastoral 
teaching will no longer have its place in schools? 
Of course not, because the Education Act requires us to provide such 
teaching, and because section 41 of the Quebec charter of rights 
expressly recognizes such rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I ask the Leader of the Opposition to make a careful 
reading of Quebec's reality. For goodness sake, there is no betrayal of 
democratic principles here. The Leader of the Opposition rose to say 
that education is sacred. We Quebecers have known that since the 
Tremblay report. Every Quebec premier has always said that education is 
sacred, primarily because it has to do with one's identity, culture and 
training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec National Assembly adopted the resollution unanimously. 
As parliamentarians, we all know how difficult this is to achieve, that 
unanimity in Parliament seldom occurs. So, let us rejoice at the Quebec 
National Assembly's unanimous stance on the establishment of linguistic 
school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition should never forget that six attempts 
were made to reform Quebec's school system. Again, who, in this House, 
can claim that, in Quebec or elsewhere—but we speak for Quebec—there 
is a link between the religious convictions of individuals—which 
we respect, given their noble character—and school boards? 
There can be no links between the religious beliefs and convictions of 
individuals and the way we will, or want to, set up school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the worst thing that could happen to this 
Parliament would be for there to be a slippage, a sideways skid, 
and for there to be an attempt to link this constitutional 
amendment with the language rights of anglophone minorities, 
something which, as you know, all hon. members hold dear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why this attachment to the anglophone minority?  First of all, 
because the anglophone minority is part of our history.  There 
were Thompsons, there were Jeffersons, in our history, and we 
know very well they had a hand in building the province of 
Quebec, the country of Quebec, and we acknowledge their special 
role.  None among us can claim—I see that the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine is nodding her agreement—that the 
English Quebec community, the anglophone community, and the 90 
some-odd other groups co-existing in Quebec, can be put on the 
same footing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore recognize—and I am pleased that the Leader of 
the Opposition has read the National Assembly motion—that the 
anglophone community, or the English speaking community as they 
chose to put it, is entitled to its educational structures, to 
schooling from kindergarten to the university level, according to 
a criterion found in article 73 of the Charter of the French 
Language.  No one is challenging this.  Moreover, generally 
speaking, I do not believe I am mistaken in thinking that the 
anglophone community, via a number of spokespersons, has been 
rather favourable to the point that, when it comes down to it, what 
it will get from the linguistic school boards is an enhanced 
control over its institutions.  That is what it will mean to the 
anglophone community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some, of course, who link this amendment with 
section 23(1)(a). 
Let us be accurate about it.  To repeat, what we are dealing with 
today is an amendment which invites us to follow up on a unanimous 
resolution by the National Assembly concerning denominational 
schools and not—and I repeat—a debate addressing language rights.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not creating a precedent here, and I hope the Leader of the 
Opposition is going to share our enthusiasm and agree that we are doing 
the right thing, as parliamentarians, in relying on section 43 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982. We know full well that in the recent history of 
the Constitution, no precedent has been created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliament was asked on four occasions to use this amending 
formula, and you will recall that two of these cases concerned 
Newfoundland. 
In the first instance, it was to grant the Pentecostal Church the same 
rights the five other churches had in Newfoundland, and to that end 
section 42 was used. The Leader of the Opposition spoke at length about 
the most recent case involving Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same section was applied to New Brunswick to enshrine the 
equality between the francophone community and the anglophone community. 
Closer to us—and at the time I was a member of this House—we used 
section 42 with regard to the construction of the bridge linking Prince 
Edward Island to the mainland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should know that, as we speak, there is a bill before the 
national assembly, Bill 109. It is the result of the consensus I have 
been talking about for the past several minutes. 
I say to all my colleagues from every party that should we not be able 
to pass and proclaim this motion and the resulting bill due to a twist 
of fate—passing them is not enough, they have to be proclaimed—the 
national assembly would have a major problem. Bill 109 will create 
linguistic school boards across Quebec, thus bringing the number of 
school boards from 158 to 70, and making the Quebec education system 
more coherent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it were not passed by December—and this is why it is 
important that all political parties, the government, the Reform Party, 
the Conservatives and the NDP co-operate—it would create a problem 
for the National Assembly, because its legislation provides that 
everything should be in effect at the start of the next school year, 
including the administrative provisions dealing with the boundaries of 
the school boards' territory, student registration, and the sharing of 
existing facilities between the new school boards that will be created. 
In any case, the act still provides that school boards will be created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if it were not passed, it would complicate things and the 
provincial government would have to reopen collective agreements with 
the unions. 
Such a situation would not benefit anyone, and certainly not Quebec 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it very clear—and I am grateful to the minister 
for pointing it out—that in no way will the right to religious 
teaching be marginalized or diminished when linguistic school boards are 
created. As I said earlier, that right is clearly stated in the 
Education Act and in section 41 of the Quebec charter of rights, which 
is a quasi-constitutional provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it is the National Assembly's prerogative to act upon this 
consensus. 
There is a consensus among all those who have expressed their views on 
the issue. We are talking about a large coalition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I took the time to mention all those who have been interested in 
this issue since the early eighties and who hope we can modernize 
Quebec's school system, you would see that everyone in our province 
supports this change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Assembly approved the resolution unanimously, which 
means that all parties agree. This is no mean feat, considering it is 
the parliamentarians' role to debate, to challenge ideas, sometimes to 
reach a consensus. We are talking about a group which includes some very 
knowledgeable people, such as the MNA for Marquette who was at one time, 
albeit for a very brief period, chairman of the Montreal Catholic School 
Commission. Again, there is a consensus in Quebec's National Assembly, 
in fact, there is unanimity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be lying if I said we are happy with the fact that seven 
senators will sit on this committee. The Government of Quebec believes, 
and we agree, that a strong enough consensus has developed and that the 
amendment only concerns Quebec and the federal government. Therefore, we 
would rather have done without the joint committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we respect the government's prerogative to conduct such 
consultations. We hope they will be carried out with all due diligence, 
but we will take the process seriously. 
We will listen to those who wish to make presentations but, again, we 
must bear in mind that we are dealing with education and what this 
amendment is about is enabling the National Assembly to rearrange the 
way school boards are managed. We think there is a strong enough 
consensus to allow this to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarities with the situation in Newfoundland make it necessary 
to exercise some caution. 
First, when we read about what happened in Newfoundland, we see that a 
referendum was held, the results of which were unequivocal—let us 
hope this will happen again—but still, the case of Newfoundland is 
somewhat unique, as I am told that it is the only Canadian province 
where the six religious denominations each controlled their own 
institutions and that the amendment passed by referendum in Newfoundland 
is designed to establish a public education system across the board so 
to speak, which is obviously not what Quebec is asking for. The 
amendment it is seeking is more administrative in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should therefore be careful not to make hasty comparisons with 
Newfoundland. I think it is important to reiterate our deep attachment 
to the anglophone community. We believe it has historically played a 
role in Quebec and we look to a future that includes the anglophone 
community. We are strongly committed, and I want to make it very clear, 
to rights. 
I find this a good test of democracy.  I think it was the 
philosopher Valéry who said a civilization must be judged on the 
way it treats its minorities.  Minority rights are, of course, an 
important element in the balance of a community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker,  you would not find the same thing anywhere 
else, if you and I were to agree, in a burst of generosity, to take 
a trip across Canada in order to try to find somewhat comparable 
examples elsewhere of how francophone minorities outside Quebec are 
treated.  I think no Quebecker need feel ashamed of how the 
anglophone community is being treated, and we must continue along 
that path, as we have in the health system. An anglophone living in 
Quebec has access to institutions, to a public education system 
from kindergarten to university. That is something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to section 223 of the 1982 legislation, there is not 
even a numerical criterion. The Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs knows very well that we have never subjected anglophone 
rights to a clause such as “where numbers justify”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that these are the facts the Reform Party ought to 
read, and I hope that our debates will run smoothly.  I greatly 
fear we will get sidetracked and I am calling upon the maturity of 
all parties, of course.  As you know, I shall keep my distance from 
any such sidetracking because what the debate must be about is 
denominational schools.  The debate must be about the right of the 
province of Quebec, and the country of Quebec, to organize its own 
school boards, as the National Assembly wishes, and must not be 
about language rights. 
I think a great effort must be made to keep that in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to state that what strikes us as very 
important for the future is that the National Assembly must be 
respected and that we must be able to modernize the Quebec school 
system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, since you are indicating that my time is up, 
let me conclude by hoping that the debates will be calm ones and 
that the wishes of the National Assembly will be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to remind the leader of the Reform Party 
that he need not look for a flawed democracy where it does not 
exist.  If ever he would like to improve his French by coming with 
me to meet those who are actively involved in the Quebec 
educational system, I would be only too pleased to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  I 
would like to thank the member for his speech and his invitation 
to serenity.  I did not realize that serenity was part of the 
Bloc's platform but I am glad to hear that it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just one question that I would like him to perhaps 
enlighten us on.  He appealed in his talk to section 43 of the 
Constitution Act 1982 as this would be an appropriate formula for 
amending the Constitution in the way that Quebec desires. But the 
very resolution that Quebec has brought to this Parliament says 
that this in no way constitutes recognition by the National 
Assembly of the Constitution Act 1982.  In other words we are 
being asked to amend the Canadian Constitution in compliance with 
a section of the Constitution that the Quebec assembly does not 
recognize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member explain how he reconciles those two 
positions? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, may I say to the leader of the 
official opposition that calm is to my party what openmindedness is 
to his.  This is what leads me to think that the debate will be 
calm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, the Leader of the Opposition knows very 
well that the motion tabled in the National Assembly states very 
clearly that we do not recognize the Constitution Act, 1982, for a 
number of reasons, and with the support of a number of analysts in 
English Canada, who studied its impact.  What did it mean to 
Quebeckers to have a charter of rights and freedoms? 
It meant that whole chunks of the only law of national redress ever 
to be passed by the National Assembly, Bill 101, were invalidated, 
as concerns display in administrative terms, and of course the 
Canada clause versus the Quebec clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, we are governed by a constitutional 
order and contrary to our will we must, in order to modernize our 
school system in Quebec, face this obligation before us to use the 
amending formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Leader of the Opposition is above making 
simplistic links.  We are democrats and here we are in a national 
parliament where each member was elected by the people in his or 
her riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a constitution, which we did not sign for all sorts 
of reason, but the first—and I would propose to the Leader of the 
Opposition that I give him for Christmas a book written by an 
intellectual by the name of Mandel of the University of Toronto, 
who proves the point clearly.  He is an anglophone who is not a 
sovereignist.  I am sure this book is in the Privy Council library. 
The author demonstrates in his book that the basic reason why in 
1982 we adopted a charter with language rights incompatible with 
those of the National Assembly was to invalidate Bill 101.  And he 
made no mistake, because, as you know, entire chunks of Bill 101 
were invalidated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, the Leader of the Opposition should never 
forget that we are democratic.  There is a Canadian 
constitutional order that will apply until international law 
takes over. As part of the process, we are obliged to use the 
amending formula, a bilateral formula.  To achieve our goal, we 
must respect this state of affairs.

I enjoyed the hon. member's speech but his reply did not please me 
nearly as much. He launched into a debate that was completely off topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that the Constitution Act of 
1982 applies. It does. The reasons put forward by the PQ government in 
Quebec and other political parties for not recognizing the Act of 1982 
are very shaky. This is a debate I have taken part in on several 
occasions already, but we could also have it in this House, I guess. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we speak about the rule of law, 1982 is the rule of law in 
this country and I am very happy about that.  Some parties might 
be unhappy about that, but it applies. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mamdam Speaker, if I pleased the minister with my 
speech at least, that makes me happy. He must realize however that my 
reply was directed to the Leader of the Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, I would like the Université de Montréal to organize 
a debate opposing the minister and myself. I was a student of his. I 
hope he has a fond memory of those days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs agree with me that 
legislation was properly and duly passed in the Quebec National 
Assembly, which is said to be the only national redress act ever to have 
been passed in Quebec, and I am referring to Bill 101? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister recognize that there are those who claim that the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms could potentially weaken the authority of 
the National Assembly, by invalidating entire chunks of the act; 
does he agree that I am right when I rise in my place to make that 
argument, and does he agree that it is not desirable that francophones 
who have a unique responsibility on this continent could see their 
language rights weakened by a Constitution that was never recognized by 
the National Assembly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I am saying and I am prepared to argue my position in 
any forum and debate it with the minister in the forum of his choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B> Madam Speaker, I am ready when he is, but this 
is not the right time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is contradicting himself. While in his first speech 
his heart went out to the anglophone community, he is now bothered that, 
under a charter of rights and with the support of a large majority of 
Quebeckers, a support which they have expressed in one poll after the 
other, the use of English on commercial signs has been allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is obviously a serious contradiction, one that is furthermore 
irrelevant to the debate on the issue before us, which is the fact that 
Quebec wants linguistic school boards and, as far as the government is 
concerned, that is no problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, it is true that we must distinguish 
the two. I agree with the minister. However, the minister will realize 
that I was responding to a question from the Leader of the Opposition. 
He knows full well that, as a man of principle, I simply must reply to 
the opposition leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the debate must be conducted in a dispassionate manner. 
I thank the government for its intention to act diligently regarding 
linguistic school boards, because such is the wish of the National 
Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we make the necessary distinctions between denominational 
and linguistic rights. I want to reiterate, on behalf of all Bloc 
members, our attachment to that founding minority, the English 
community, whose rights will be maintained in the future. 
I am confident that, in the future, the dialogue will always be 
conducted in a spirit of generosity, as it has been in the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of what unanimity may exist in the National Assembly 
in Quebec, obviously a variety of concerns if not viewpoints have 
been expressed here this afternoon that point out the reason why 
we have due constitutional process in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Constitutional resolutions which are to be considered by the 
House of Commons are as a rule considered by a special joint 
committee.  It is only appropriate despite the obvious 
anxiousness on the part of the Government of Quebec and perhaps 
the National Assembly of Quebec that this be expedited as quickly 
as possible, that we observe this due process and have the 
opportunity to consult broadly with all Canadians who may be 
concerned about this particular constitutional resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the perspective of the Reform Party with respect to the 
continuing inappropriateness of the role of Senate, not 
individual senators but of the Senate, in so far as its 
undemocratic nature is always a procedural contaminant in our 
proceedings here, especially when we are required to do things in 
the context of a special joint committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also remind the Leader of the Opposition that long 
before the Reform Party darkened these halls or lit these halls, 
depending on one's perspective, the NDP and before that the CCF 
were calling for the abolition of the Senate, precisely because 
it offended our democratic values and our feeling that whatever 
institution we have, whether it be no Senate or a new Senate, 
that it be democratic in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a variety of reasons why this is a very important 
matter.  Many of them have been touched on already.  It does have 
the possibility of setting a precedent, if not a legal precedent 
at least a political precedent with respect to how similar issues 
will be dealt with in other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is legitimate concern among the religious 
constituencies not just in Quebec but outside Quebec as to how we 
deal with these issues. We are mindful of the fact that we will 
be dealing with another not identical but nevertheless related 
issue, that of the future of denominational schools in 
Newfoundland.  Therefore how we deal with this both in terms of 
process and in terms of substance is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has to do with the whole role and relationship between 
minority rights and the role of the majority.  This is a very 
difficult question.  It always has been and always will be. It 
needs to be sorted out as well as can be in respect of this 
issue.  It has to do with national unity.  We need to deal with 
this sensitively in respect of Quebec but we also need to respect 
due process.  We want to do that in a way that can be respected 
by the National Assembly in Quebec and the Government of Quebec 
in so far as that is possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to use this and other opportunities that will be 
presented to us to have if not a full debate, at least a 
preliminary debate about the future of the education system in so 
far as religious values are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an underlying concern, and the minister himself has 
referred to this as the secularization of the school system in 
Quebec.  It seems to me that for a lot of Canadians, whether they 
are looking at the situation in Newfoundland where the government 
is considering getting rid of denominational schools altogether, 
or in Quebec where the denominational school system is being 
transformed into a linguistically based school system, there is 
an underlying question.  That question is on the future of 
education as it pertains to values and how we continue at the 
same time to recognize that we no longer live in what might be 
technically called Christendom while on the other hand we want to 
live in a society where the appropriate role of religious values, 
religious instruction and religious world view are taken into 
consideration and not relegated to the realm of something purely 
private, something that exists only after hours or in some 
special segregated way.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem to me that we all want to be pluralistic.  On the 
one hand we want to recognize that we no longer live in what can 
be called Christendom but on the other hand we do not want to 
accept that we will live with our schools under the illusion that 
there is no such thing as fundamental values, that there is no 
such thing as something in which everything we do has to be 
grounded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will stop the theological dissertation at this moment, but 
this is something we need to pay more attention to when we are 
talking about education.than we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the motion.  I will reserve judgment on the Reform 
amendment but on the face of it I do not see why the amendment is 
necessary.  I sometimes think the Reform Party has a talent 
for moving the obvious in this House when it comes to certain 
things.  I would hope that the committee would not have to be 
instructed to take into account the matter of democratic consent 
or the rule of law or the matter of whether or not it is in the 
Canadian national interest.  It seems this would be something 
that I would hope parliamentarians would do without instruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing that remains to be considered is whether the 
postponement of the reporting date is appropriate.  The member 
from the Bloc raised some of the concerns that the Government of 
Quebec has with respect to any postponement beyond the date.  I 
feel that has to be taken seriously although the concern does 
prejudge the outcome of what the hearings will be and what the 
fate of the resolution will be.  However, we know what the fate 
of the resolution will be because the government has said that it 
intends to pass this resolution. We presume that its majority 
will be effective in that respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of things I cannot resist commenting on. Much 
was made of the patriation debate or the Constitution of 1982. I 
think I am the only member of Parliament in the room at the 
moment who was here during that debate.  I say to my Bloc 
colleagues that this was not passed without the consent of 
Quebeckers, at least in so far as those of us from outside Quebec 
perceived it at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were 75 members of Parliament from Quebec in this House at 
that time.  At least 74 of them voted for that package.  It would 
be wrong in the mythology of the sovereignist movement in Quebec 
to imagine that somehow members of Parliament from outside Quebec 
at that time did something in the face of opposition from Quebec 
as they understood it. They did it in the face of the opposition 
of a particular government in Quebec at that time, but they had 
no reason to believe that there was anything in the way of 
unanimity in Quebec in opposition to that package because they 
could see every day members of Parliament from Quebec getting up 
and urging other members of Parliament from outside Quebec to 
pass that patriation package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Keep that in mind when telling the story because the story ought 
to be told in full and not just selectively.

<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am going to make a comment and, if he wishes, the member is welcome to 
pick up on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says that, at the time the Constitution was patriated, there 
were members who voted in favour.  In fact, 74 of the 75 members 
from Quebec were Liberals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have news for the member.  This is why the Bloc 
Quebecois is here, to prevent this dual legitimacy in Quebec. 
The Bloc Quebecois, and increasingly all of Quebec, is very 
clearly unanimous on this as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Liberals in the National Assembly, those close to the 
federal Liberal Party at the time, were unanimous in disagreeing with 
how the federal government wanted to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he should take another look at his history, including 
that of Quebec, because just because there were Liberal members 
from Quebec who were in agreement or who voted in favour of 
patriating the Constitution does not mean Quebeckers were in 
agreement. They were not in agreement.  There was a Liberal party 
line and they toed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in the National Assembly, and this is what counts, they were 
unanimously opposed to patriating this Constitution. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
the question.  It does not seem to me that it contradicts what I 
said. The point I was trying to make is that it would be wrong to 
set up what happened in 1982 as something that Canadians, members 
of Parliament or Canadians from outside of Quebec did to Quebec. 
But rather that there were 74 members of Parliament in this House 
who voted for it.  There were Quebecers who were against it, who 
were part of the PQ government at the time and others.  I agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is, and this is a continuing dimension of the debate 
which is frustrating for those of us outside of Quebec, it was a 
family fight.  It was a fight between Quebeckers about the 
appropriateness of the patriation package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Bloc and others are looking for the culprits, if there 
were culprits because I think there were legitimate positions on 
both sides and it is wrong to sort of demonize either side, it 
was other Quebeckers who were holding this position and who were 
telling people outside Quebec this was okay and had the support 
of the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To pretend there is not that in-house dimension to the debate 
which goes on and which I have watched in the House for 18 years 
between various sets of Quebecers, federalists and sovereignists 
and nationalists, it gets very frustrating after a while when 
positions are attributed to the rest of Canada which are 
positions which arise out of the debate between Quebeckers 
themselves. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the member's remarks.  He suggested 
that maybe the committee does not need any instruction, although 
I would suggest that a committee with some senators on it might 
at least require instruction on the subject of democratic 
consent.  Maybe he would concede that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He supports the amendment which has come to us from the Quebec 
legislature which includes asking Parliament to strike down 
section 93(1) as it applies to Quebec.  The section says nothing 
in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege 
with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons 
have by law in the province at the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's province has a very similar quotation in the 
Manitoba act.  It is virtually identical. I am wondering what his 
position is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he support striking down that section of the Manitoba act 
as it applies to Manitoba? Does the member have any fears that if 
this section is struck from 93(1) it might create a precedent for 
striking that section from the Manitoba act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Madam Speaker, all I indicated on 
behalf of the NDP was that we supported sending this to the 
committee so that all the various concerns could be examined.  I 
did raise the matter of what precedence this may set for other

both in respect of the Newfoundland situation and the Quebec 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the Leader of the Opposition, in terms of the three tests it 
seems this represents some development in Reform thinking when it 
comes to democracy. It has always seemed to me that until today 
there has been a more simplistic attachment to the result of 
referenda than we see today.

it be Barabas or will it be Christ, saying it is up to the 
people and making a choice of your own as to what is right.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B>  Madam Speaker, members 
have been speaking about the 1982 patriation of the Constitution 
for the last few minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening to what has been said.  The Leader of the 
Opposition, among others, mentioned that, because an amending 
process is involved, thought should perhaps be given to a 
referendum to validate the democratic basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that in 1982 there was not all this 
nitpicking about a referendum.  For Quebec, it meant the loss of 
a number of powers conferred on it by the original Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine for a moment, and I ask the Leader of the Opposition to 
picture this, that the American Congress decided, without 
consulting one quarter of the American states—California, 
Florida, New York—to change the American Constitution.  Imagine 
for a moment that that were to happen.  There would be a second 
American revolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with an identical situation, since Quebec represents one 
quarter of the Canadian population, Quebec looked for an 
accommodation. Even now, with the demand from the National 
Assembly, Quebec is looking for an accommodation, without 
recognizing the Constitution, which was the result of a process 
from which it was excluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP member mentioned that it was in good faith that he 
supported patriation of the Constitution in 1982 because, he 
says, 74 Liberals representing Quebec said it was all right. 
First of all, since Liberal members were involved, he should have 
been on his guard. Am I not right, Madam Speaker? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When all parties in the Quebec National Assembly say that they 
are taking a particular stand, it seems to me that this House 
should take notice.  I await my hon. colleague's comments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am not sure.  It seemed 
the hon. member was asking questions of the Leader of the 
Opposition. I have given my account of what I think happened in 
1982.  It ought to be taken seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The points the member makes are legitimate, but I was simply 
trying to point something out for the purposes of historical 
accuracy and, for that matter, for a kind of emotional accuracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise to speak to the motion put forward by the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs on the establishment of a joint 
committee of the House of Commons and the Senate to study matters 
related to the proposed resolution respecting the amendment to 
section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867, concerning the Quebec 
school system.  That is just to be clear on what we are 
addressing today.  We seem to be wandering a little bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend and congratulate Madam Speaker on her appointment as 
speaker.  The Right Hon. John G. Diefenbaker once said to 
parliament “Parliament is more than a procedure.  It is the 
custodian of the nation's freedom”.  Madam Speaker, you are 
charged with a very important duty in the House as members seek 
to serve their constituents.  I, on behalf of my constituents, 
look for your assistance in the pursuit of serving Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I want to thank the constituents of 
Compton—Stanstead who entrusted me with the important task of 
representing them in the House of Commons.  It is an honour for 
me to be their MP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compton—Stanstead is a half urban, half rural riding.  It is a 
dairy farm region. It is also an area full of lakes and hills 
where one can do some sailing, boating and trekking during the 
summer and ski or go on snowmobile tours during the winter. 
Finally, it is a region where everybody loves the great outdoors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to invite all the members to visit this wonderful 
region where people have never stopped working towards a stronger 
Canada, a part of Quebec where anglophones and francophones have 
rubbed shoulders for many generations and have learned to live 
and work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a representative of this Eastern Townships region, I have 
some experience in the issue before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Eastern Townships have been used as a test area for 
linguistic schools in Quebec for the last 10 to 15 years and I 
must say we are very pleased with the results so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Linguistic schools were tested in the Eastern Townships in 
preparation for their implementation all over Quebec.  At first 
there were some real concerns, because people did not know how 
this system would work and they wondered if it would be fair. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact it worked.  It worked quite well.  We were the test 
case.  We went through it.  At present I have lived through the 
experience personally.  It has been a good working system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This committee, however, will examine something a lot larger 
than the test case of linguistic schools in the eastern 
townships.  At present the rights of minorities are guaranteed in 
the Canadian Constitution.  They are guaranteed under the 
Constitutional Act, 1867 and 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It remains my opinion that amending the Constitution is a very 
serious matter that should not be taken lightly, which presents 
the House with a dilemma. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Assembly in Quebec City has voted overwhelmingly in 
favour of instituting linguistic school boards as soon as 
possible.  It is desirable for that purpose to amend the 
Constitution Act, 1867, so that Quebec has full capacity to act 
in matters of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, in my experience this probably makes good 
sense.  Yet it concerns me.  Is it the role of the House to stand 
in the way of what seems to be the overwhelming will of the 
people of Quebec?  Or, is the role of the House to ensure that 
the rights of all Canadians are protected under the law?  Can it 
do both? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am new to this debate.  I have much to learn about the 
Constitutional nuances of my country. What I do know is that the 
Reform Party's proposal to have a referendum on this question is 
without merit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point we have to trust elected officials.  On this 
particular matter there seems to be consensus in the national 
assembly.  The Reform Party is proposing to have a constituent 
assembly comprised of the entire province of Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a constitutional amendment must not, it seems to me, be made 
with a nod of the head, I intend to ensure that the committee 
examines all the repercussions of the proposed amendment on 
Quebec and on the Constitution of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like now to speak of my immediate concerns and the 
questions this committee must answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The matter is a complicated one, but it concerns a very basic 
right. I believe that, in the context of the debate on these 
issues, we must first and foremost answer the following question: 
will these decisions best serve the interests of young Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still on the subject of education, let us look at a few other 
concerns.  First, minority rights and specifically the rights of 
the anglophone minority in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislative report of the Government of Quebec indicates 
that, in order to protect the rights of linguistic minorities 
within denominational school boards, the bill would have language 
councils in each.  I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parents of students of the linguistic minority in question 
will sit on these councils.  As appropriate, the language 
councils will have sufficient authority to ensure constitutional 
guarantees to anglophones are honoured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The language councils are to be consulted prior to the 
establishment of the schools needed for the students of the 
linguistic minority. They will ensure the school boards provide 
the minority with an equitable distribution of human, material 
and financial resources.  In the event the school boards conclude 
service agreements, these agreements shall also be approved by 
the language councils. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that seems reasonable.  The minorities will have their 
language councils.  That seems perfectly reasonable.  However, 
the document continues, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foregoing provisions are contained in a specific section of 
the bill, which indicates clearly that denominational school 
boards and the right to dissent shall remain in force until such 
time as the Government of Quebec regains its full legislative 
powers in the field of education. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words once the Constitution is amended that is it for 
language councils. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it is important to note that not all francophones are in 
favour of linguistic school boards.  I have a stack of letters in 
my office from very pious, observant francophone Protestants who 
are concerned they will lose their own schools and no religion 
will be taught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read one letter as an example. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Mr. Price, 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have three children, two of whom have attended and one of 
whom still attends a French Protestant school called Le Sentier. 
I am writing to express my disagreement with the request of the 
Quebec government to amend section 93 of the Constitution Act, 
1867 to make school boards non-denominational in the province of 
Quebec. I am very satisfied with this school for which we fought 
for well over 15 years before it finally opened six years ago. I 
am totally opposed to the fact that we can be denied our right to 
an education that is tailored to the needs and aspirations of our 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I urge you not to allow our Constitution to be 
amended, particularly section 93. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to keep the right to dissent, which to me is synonymous with 
freedom, and I am counting on you. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And this letter is signed by Mr. and Mrs. Béliveau of Rock Forest. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my experience in the eastern townships there has been a 
chaplain in all the schools.  These chaplains are trained to 
teach and handle issues arising from different religions. This 
will satisfy the needs of very religious people, but will there 
still be chaplains?

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern raised by some is that without religion in the 
schools there is nobody to teach and instil values in Canada's 
young people.  This has to be addressed by the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last concern to which I will speak today is crucial.  The 
Government of Quebec is devoted to independence for Quebec.  It 
is imperative that any decisions regarding this issue be made for 
the right reason, not to appease that government or because we 
feel threatened by the separatist government in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly we should not make a decision that only serves to 
frustrate the Government of Quebec.  The interest of Canada's 
young people must be the guide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out something that I found very 
interesting. When the Quebec minister responsible for education, 
Pauline Marois, issued the notes for the press conference to 
introduce the bill she made reference to several objectives in 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number one objective in notes of the Quebec minister was to 
promote the integration of immigrants into the francophone 
community.  While it is important and necessary to ensure 
immigrants are welcomed and integrated into the Quebec community, 
it seems that bettering the education of Canada's young people 
might be a more important first objective for a government 
serious about education, not just talking about taking Quebec out 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the differences between the situation in 
Quebec and Newfoundland, and I say differences because there are 
very few similarities.  The people in Newfoundland have spoken 
clearly on the issue.  There has not been full public 
consultation in Quebec.  The public needs to be consulted and 
this committee will ensure that the public will be consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Newfoundland two school systems are being combined to create 
one public school system.  In Quebec it is proposed that two 
school systems change dramatically to create two new school 
systems.  While the principle might be similar, the realities 
vary.  For this reason it is important to look at the issues of 
Quebec and Newfoundland separately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the House is getting around to considering 
this matter in a serious fashion.  It was completely unacceptable 
for the government to forgo any real consideration of the last 
constitutional amendment that came its way.  Thankfully the 
Senate did an admirable job last year in travelling to 
Newfoundland to hear all the views and concerns of interested 
parties.  The House should not have dispensed with its 
constitutional duty so cavalierly, without debate and without 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A last concern is that it has come to my attention that this 
committee will not be permitted to travel.  This seems strange. 
I hope I have succeeded in outlining the importance of this 
committee.  It should be given the resources to conduct its job 
properly and efficiently.  This will almost certainly mean 
hearing from witnesses who would not come before committees if it 
meant being unreasonably inconvenienced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eastern townships was a test case and it worked out quite 
well. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

and especially for our youth.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to question the member about one thing in his speech. 
His wording was something like there was a time when people had 
to trust their representatives or their officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the member distinguish the times when he would trust 
his constituents as opposed to trusting himself?  Does it have to 
do with self-interest or an academic qualification?  How does he 
define his representation of constituents?  Does he represent 
them?  Does he represent himself or does he represent his party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is quite straightforward 
that I represent my constituents.  They elected me to do a job. I 
do not think they expected to come here every time there was a 
separate vote, that they would have to vote individually.  I am 
here representing them and that is the job we should be doing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I take part in this 
dispassionate debate on the creation of linguistic school boards. 
I say with “great pride”, because the constitutional amendment 
proposal introduced today by the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs, whom I will not name, is an important step in a debate 
which, in Quebec, lasted 30 years before a consensus could be 
reached. Therefore it is not with indifference that we should 
welcome this day but rather with a deep satisfaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 15, the National Assembly voted unanimously in favour 
of a constitutional amendment to section 93 of the Canadian 
Constitution. The aim of this amendment was essentially to 
restructure the school system along linguistic rather than 
denominational lines. Our government supported this initiative 
and, on April 22, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
introduced a motion to that effect here in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, because an election was called, which brought us back 
to power on June 2, it became impossible to pursue this 
initiative. This government is therefore addressing the situation 
today. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not only be pleased that the debate is entering a new 
stage today but also that a majority of Quebeckers, francophones 
and anglophones, support the establishment of linguistic school 
boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A consensus has been forged, and as the intergovernmental 
affairs minister has noted that consensus is sufficiently broad 
for us to go ahead with the proposed change. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, in tabling the resolution for a constitutional amendment 
to section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867, the Minister 
announced that it would be referred to a special joint committee 
that would report back to Parliament in the next few weeks.  This 
is a logical initiative that should have the support of all hon. 
members of this House.  We should certainly be glad that all 
stakeholders were able to achieve a consensus but, in accordance 
with parliamentary custom, we have to provide an opportunity for 
these stakeholders and others to be heard on such an important 
constitutional amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is so obvious that no one can object in good faith to the 
approach taken by our government without flouting the democratic 
values of Canadian society from coast to coast. I would certainly 
not accuse any of my colleagues of having such intentions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dissenting voices have the right to make themselves heard.  We 
as members of Parliament have the right to inform them and to try 
to convince them of the merits of this constitutional amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who already support it, striking the joint committee 
will give them the opportunity to reiterate their support.  This 
is a democratic exercise that is not only healthy and necessary 
but also respectful of the opinions generated by all sides in 
this debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A minute ago I was talking about our democratic values. 
Quebeckers have always shared and espoused these values. In fact, 
if our country is so widely respected throughout the world, it is 
partly because of its respect for this heritage that generations 
of Canadians have preserved over the years. The motion before us 
today seems like a golden opportunity to emphasize our respect 
for democracy and our institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another reason for creating this joint committee, as 
the minister has pointed out in the past few weeks. Some time 
ago, the official opposition in the National Assembly asked the 
Quebec government to set up a parliamentary committee on this 
issue. That request was rejected. All the more reason to create a 
committee that will allow the various groups, experts and 
concerned citizens to express their views.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach would allow us not only to comply with 
parliamentary procedure but also to promote a better 
understanding of the changes that would be effected through this 
constitutional amendment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the consensus forged on this issue, obviously some 
groups and citizens are worried about the disappearance of 
denominational school boards.  Our government is sensitive to 
that aspect of the issue.  Moreover, we are fully aware of the 
uncertainty felt by some groups and citizens in Quebec's 
anglophone minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in light of a disturbing demographic situation we 
are well aware of provisions that limit access to English 
schools.  As the minister has pointed out so well, we cannot 
ignore the secessionist ambitions of the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these circumstances is it too much to offer those groups and 
citizens a forum so they can make themselves heard?  Not at all. 
That is why our government will go ahead with its proposal to 
strike a joint committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now come to the main point of my comments.  Certain Quebeckers 
are worried about this constitutional amendment.  However, as the 
minister has said, the proposed changes do not run counter to the 
interests of the anglophone community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which 
guarantees linguistic minorities the right to instruction in 
their own language, will continue to provide solid guarantees to 
Quebec's anglophones as it has in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover—and the minister has highlighted this reality—the 
Government of Quebec is not seeking to root out religion from 
education but rather to secularize the administrative structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate has not arisen for no reason.  In recent years the 
repositioning of Quebec's society has been modified by the 
contribution of newcomers at the same time as secularization has 
increased.  At that point the need has been felt to reorganize 
school structures along linguistic rather that denominational 
lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constitutional amendment tabled by the minister takes 
account of that evolution. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such debates are nothing new; it is not the first time Quebec 
society has felt the need to review its school system. But the 
evolution of Quebec society with all its characteristics has seen 
a consensus emerge in both the francophone and the anglophone 
communities. We should seize this opportunity to set up school 
boards along linguistic lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One last question, if I may, before I conclude. It concerns 
co-operation between both levels of government. Being used to 
recriminations from the Quebec government, we see in this debate 
a meaningful example of what we could all achieve if the 
secessionist rhetoric gave way to true co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important point deserves to be mentioned. This 
constitutional amendment on linguistic school boards is 
considered a bilateral amendment in constitutional legalese. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some irony here. While the 1982 Constitution is still 
being condemned by secessionist leaders, this same Constitution 
allows them to request this amendment today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, we can achieve a consensus, change our federation and 
even our Constitution without tearing this country apart. I urge 
all my colleagues in this House to support the motion before us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my friends in the Bloc always get a little concerned 
when I speak on these issues.  It is no secret to members of this 
Chamber that I came here almost 10 years ago from downtown 
Toronto because my constituents wanted somebody to make sure they 
had a voice that would always speak up for a strong national 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They wanted someone who would be outspoken at the appropriate 
time on minority rights.  When disadvantaged regions of our 
country needed financial support or extra support as they were 
going through difficult times and did not having the necessary 
infrastructure, they wanted advantaged regions to be there to 
help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always tried to be consistent on the primary reason I was 
elected.  That was why I originally opposed the Meech Lake 
accord.  The Meech Lake accord essentially dismantled the 
national government.  It was essentially a process that promoted 
offloading on to the province's national government 
responsibilities.  It has been like a litany of transferring of 
powers over the last many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say to the minister I applaud the fact that he 
is putting this motion into committee where over the next few 
months we can have broad based support from both sides.  Members 
will have an opportunity to speak on the amendment.  Even though 
the amendment is different from term 17, make no mistake.  It is 
inextricably intertwined with what is happening in terms of the 
constitutional amendment process in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I say to the minister that it is a good thing it is going 
to committee.  I appreciate that the prime minister has also said 
the vote on the amendment would be a free one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have all the answers in terms of the process today. 
That is why we will be going into a joint committee over the next 
few months.  In the last little while we have moved so quickly on 
so many offloadings and dismantling of national government 
responsibility that I would appeal to members of the House, as we 
head into a new term, to remember the Chamber is not a rubber 
stamp for the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chamber has always been the custodian of minority rights. It 
has been here from time to time to stand up to the provinces and 
say it will not agree with them on a particular program or policy 
thrust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few of us in Ontario have concerns about what the amendment 
will mean, could mean or might mean in terms of setting a 
precedent in the province of Ontario and the separate school 
system that exists there, which is recognized as an efficient 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of that efficiency we have a government in the province 
of Ontario right now that in the name of a dollar would save 
putting up the Ontario flag on a day.  It is a very tight, cost 
cutting government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of us are concerned this could set a precedent that could 
affect our educational system, especially those of us who do not 
believe in a total secularization of the school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Are you willing to cut the transfers?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B> The member talks about transfers and 
economics.  One of the reasons given by the province of 
Newfoundland for changing its entire separate school system was 
that it wanted to save $9 million to $11 million.  I for one 
think that is a pitiful sum of money to shut down an entire 
system and a tradition that has always been a part of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to repeat that it is important that Canadian who want to 
speak out on this issue, those who want to make representation, 
have an opportunity to appear before the joint committee between 
now and the end of November. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always accepted the outcome of any vote in this House but 
between now and then it is very important that we reflect on what 
is the responsibility of this Chamber.  I urge members to make 
sure that this Chamber does not become a rubber stamp for the 
provinces. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today as we debate Motion No. 3 we are 
embarking on a debate that has a number of interesting aspects to 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface the motion is relatively straightforward.  The 
motion calls for the creation of a special joint committee of the 
House of Commons and the Senate to study matters relating to the 
proposed resolution respecting a proposed amendment to section 93 
of the Constitution Act of 1867 concerning the Quebec school 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I will not go into any great detail about the 
proposed amendment as the government will be introducing the 
amendment as Motion No. 4 which will be debated after the special 
joint committee reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Toward the conclusion of my speech I will briefly touch on a 
couple of areas of concern.  I would first like to concentrate on 
the special joint committee itself.  Reformers involve themselves 
with the Senate with some trepidation.  One of the basic tenets 
of Reform Party's principles is to reform the Senate.  We believe 
in a triple-E Senate where the Senate is equal, elected and 
effective. We believe that such a reformed Senate would go a long 
way in legitimizing the upper Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the fact that all the members of the Senate have been 
appointed by the prime minister of the day that causes Reformers 
such grief in dealing with the upper Chamber.  The appointment of 
any political representative is an archaic practice that should 
have been forever consigned to the history of the 19th century. 
Yet here we are, almost on the eve of the 21st century, and the 
prime minister is still indulging in this patronage riddled 
practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that there are not good people in the Senate.  There 
are.  I have met with a number of talented individuals from the 
upper Chamber, many of whom perform admirable service to the 
people of Canada.  But since they are unelected and therefore 
unaccountable to no one but the prime minister who appointed 
them, they have no legitimacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are reluctant to convey any legitimacy to that 
unelected upper Chamber by working with them on a special joint 
committee.  But Reformers are also pragmatists.  While we will 
constantly strive to reform the Senate, we recognize that the 
reality of today is that Canadians have a Senate that is 
unelected, unequally distributed by any measure and whose 
effectiveness and legitimacy are questionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Senate does have some constitutional powers.  One of 
those powers is that it must ratify any constitutional amendment. 
Since the ratification of the Senate is required under section 43 
of the Constitution Act of 1982, it must play a role in this 
exercise.  The question is:  Should it play a joint role with the 
House of Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was not a special joint committee with members from 
both the House of Commons and the Senate, then the alternative 
would likely be that both chambers would hold committee meetings 
on their own.  This redundancy would undoubtedly lengthen the 
time that it would take for the two chambers to deal with the 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other concern the Reform Party has with this motion is the 
amount of time that the government is providing to the committee 
to complete its work.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Committee be directed to consult broadly and review 
such information as it deems appropriate with respect to this 
issue; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion goes on to state that the committee is to make its 
final report no later than November 7, 1997. That is only 38 days 
from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it possible for the committee to consult broadly, as the 
motion calls for, and meet the November 7 deadline?  That of 
course will depend on the number of people who want to address 
the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is near unanimous support for the amendment in Quebec 
and few individuals or organizations are interested in appearing 
before the committee, then the deadline will not be a problem. 
If, on the other hand, the committee is deluged by people who 
wish to appear before it and the committee can only hear a small 
portion of them, then the short timeframe becomes a major 
problem, as many Quebeckers would be denied their right to 
express their views on a constitutional amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under different circumstances I would be horrified that the 
government would even suggest putting such a short timeframe on 
the committee.  However, in this instance I acknowledge the 
government's desire to have a short timeframe.  If the committee 
were to undertake a prolonged and detailed review of the 
amendment, then the separatist government in Quebec and the 
separatists here in the House would probably use this as an 
example of the federation being dysfunctional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would caution the members of the proposed committee 
to ensure that what they are doing is in the best interests of 
all Canadians and not just worry how their actions will be 
perceived in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for that reason that we put forward the amendment to 
lengthen the timeframe for the committee until December 31, 1997, 
to ensure that all Quebeckers who have a desire to make a 
representation before the committee have the opportunity to do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it becomes apparent to the committee that it can hear all the 
interested parties in a shorter period of time, there is nothing 
preventing that committee from reporting earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason for the extended time period is to ensure that 
the committee has sufficient time to consider the three tests for 
such a proposed constitutional amendment, as delineated earlier 
by the leader of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude my remarks I would like to repeat those tests 
which the committee must address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first obligation of the special joint committee must be to 
ensure that the amendments meet the test of democratic consent. 
Does the amendment have the consensus of the Quebec people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Newfoundland amended term 17, which affected its 
educational obligations under the Terms of Union, it held a 
province-wide referendum on two separate occasions.  There has 
been no such universal consultation with the people of Quebec on 
this occasion.  Thus, the committee must feel satisfied that 
there is substantive evidence to ensure that the people of Quebec 
are behind this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second concern for the committee is to ensure that the 
amendment meets the test of the rule of law.  While there are 
various legal aspects of this process that must be considered, I 
would like the committee to consider this one.  Section 93(1) of 
the Constitution Act, 1867, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in any such Law shall prejudicially affect any Right or 
Privilege with respect to Denominational Schools which any Class 
of Persons have by Law in the Province at the Union. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am not a constitutional expert, I take that to mean that 
although the provinces were given exclusive jurisdiction over 
education, they could not make laws after Confederation which 
would prejudicially affect any right with respect to 
denominational schools that a person had by law in the province 
at the time of union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that at the time of union there were not four 
provinces, but rather only three:  New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and 
the united province of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the committee must be satisfied that Quebec can use 
section 43 of the Constitution Act, 1982, without the consent of 
Ontario.  This could set a significant precedent because if this 
amendment is passed without Ontario's consent now, will Quebec 
separatists use this to further their argument that they can 
unilaterally alter the Canadian Constitution without the consent 
of their partners in Confederation?  This is just one of the 
questions of law that the committee must address.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third and final issue that the committee must address is: 
Does this amendment meet the test of Canadian national interest? 
Does this amendment give Quebec unique powers in amending the 
Constitution?  Would it lead to Quebec gaining the power to opt 
out of the Canadian Constitution one clause at a time?  Is there 
sufficient protection for minority groups not only in Quebec but 
across Canada if this amendment should pass?  Again, these 
questions must be addressed by the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is endeavouring to ensure that this 
process is done correctly. I call on the government and all 
members of the House to heed our concerns. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to congratulate you on your new responsibilities. I had 
absolutely no intention of participating in this debate but I 
think that I must set the record straight, with the benevolent 
and informed support of the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You know that, according to the amending formula of the 
Constitution Act, 1982, there are five ways to amend the 
Constitution. In some instances, the federal government may act 
alone. There is the well known 7-50 formula, that is to say that 
an amendment needs the support of seven provinces representing at 
least 50 percent of the population. Furthermore, provinces can 
act alone in their own areas of jurisdiction.  There is also the 
bilateral formula and the unanimity rule, which applies to the 
position of lieutenant governor, the Queen's representative, and 
to the redrawing of some boundaries, among other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the hon. member, who is well versed in and loves 
constitutional issues, cannot make a parallel and argue that a 
bilateral approach would create a dangerous precedent by 
supporting the legitimate sovereigntist option to act 
unilaterally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear: there is absolutely no doubt that, in this 
case, the bilateral formula applies. When Quebec decides in a 
democratic way to declare its independence, it will be on the 
basis not of Canada's legislation but of international law as the 
Constitution makes no provision for such a scenario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I would ask the hon. member to make the necessary 
distinctions, for these are two distinct debates with nothing in 
common at this time and I wish the hon. member did not really 
want the committee to proceed as she is suggesting. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, many of us are concerned 
that any constitutional amendment passed under section 43 or any 
of the other provisions might set a precedent. We want to make 
sure that the Constitution is amended under the rule of law.  It 
has yet to be determined whether this is the right amending 
formula to be used in this case. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a 
brief question for the member of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with interest to her comments on the reform of the 
Senate.  I wonder whether she could confirm for the House that 
the senator from Alberta who died a few years ago, the former 
Premier Ernest Charles Manning, was the father of the current 
leader of the Reform Party in this House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that yes 
he was the father of the present leader of the official 
opposition.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to support the motion to amend the motion to 
refer to a joint committee the proposed amendments to section 93 
of the Constitution Act, 1867. It is also a pleasure to know that 
I am done with this long and complicated sentence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment put forward by the hon. member for Calgary 
Southwest draws attention to three important principles on which 
constitutional amendments should always be based: democratic 
consent, the rule of law and the national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through you, Mr. Speaker, I would like to add my comments to 
those of my colleagues from Calgary Southwest and South 
Surrey—White Rock—Langley concerning the joint committee to 
which the proposed amendment to section 93 of the Constitution 
Act, 1867 will be referred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to commend the Bloc for its comments 
on the illegitimacy of an unelected Senate. This shows that its 
democratic instinct is similar to that of the Reform Party. This 
shows once again that the Reform Party and the Bloc both want our 
federal system to be changed in order to give more autonomy to 
the provinces in areas that directly affect their cultural and 
economic characteristics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, I do not have to remind the House how much the 
objectives of our parties differ. It is obviously possible to 
obtain provincial autonomy by becoming sovereign, at a very high 
cost to all parties concerned. We would, however, better serve 
the national interest by changing the way our federal system 
works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out to the House that the national 
interest is precisely the third criterion on which we should 
judge constitutional amendments. I hope that by pointing out this 
fact to the House we will be able to instil these principles into 
the collective political conscience of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our attachment to the objective of national unity that 
worries us so much when a constitutional amendment is 
contemplated in a more or less judicious manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. leader of the official opposition said, using the 
amending formula of section 43 may not be not totally legal. It 
is clear that this amending formula applies to subsection 93(2) 
of the Constitution, but not to subsections 1, 3 and 4. The 
legality of this approach should be determined by the Superior 
Court of Quebec. If not, the federal government should ask the 
Supreme Court's opinion on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This having been said, our caucus continues to believe that, 
before amending the Constitution, the three tests referred to 
must be done.  The test of democratic consent is the first 
principle we feel should be applied, under the circumstances.  Do 
the majority of Quebeckers support the constitutional amendments 
proposed?  The best way to answer that question is to hold a 
referendum, which is why my hon. colleague has recommended that 
the Government of Quebec hold one.  If Quebeckers support the 
amendment, the provincial government has nothing to lose.  If 
they reject it, this government has everything to lose.  One need 
not be a populist to realize that it is never wise to go against 
the voters' wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second test is the rule of law.  As my colleague from 
Calgary Southwest has clearly stated, section 43 may not apply 
here. I will go no further with this, but I would like to address 
the question of minority rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the political discussions on unity have essentially 
focussed on the decentralization of powers and the subsequently 
greater provincial autonomy, the question of minority rights 
becomes all the more important. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By giving increased powers to the province of Quebec in areas 
such as language, culture and education, are we not abandoning 
the anglophone minority of Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an easy issue, but I believe it draws our attention 
to the very important role of the Constitution in regard to the 
protection of minority rights. If Quebec is not bound by section 
93(1), the Superior Court of Quebec should rule that this 
proposal will have no adverse effect on minorities in Quebec. I 
cannot overemphasize the importance of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third test relates to the national interest. Does the 
proposed amendment meet the national interest? From a certain 
point of view, the answer is no. 
The use of section 43 in this instance will allow all provincial 
governments to question the limits of their jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party strongly believes that provinces need more 
autonomy. They need powers which will allow them to create 
institutions that are truly representative of the economic and 
cultural realities of the regions. However, all provinces must 
have the same powers. The way they will exercise those powers 
will depend on the will of their respective population. It is not 
appropriate, however, to create a precedent which would allow 
Quebec to be exempt from the law of the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Constitutional change is a necessity in this country. We must 
create a new balance of powers if we want the Confederation to be 
adapted to the needs of its provincial partners.  These are the 
goals that our caucus hopes to reach. However, democracy is more 
a matter of process than result and I believe it is important to 
review carefully the process to amend section 93. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as some people spoke to me very highly of this new member, I 
cannot resist the temptation and ask him two short questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion that a referendum might be held cannot apply here for 
the two following reasons: first, as the hon. member will 
understand, what this is all about, from <I>A</I> to <I>Z</I>, on the <I>X</I> 
as well as on the <I>Y</I> axis, in any way one tries to look at it, 
involves only the education sector. We are not dealing with an 
amendment that is going to change the balance between 
communities, between francophones and anglophones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with an amendment that will enable the province 
of Quebec, the country of Quebec—I should never use the words 
“Quebec” and “province” in the same sentence—to modernize 
its school system. That is the basic and sole purpose of this 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says there has to be equality among the provinces. I 
should probably take on the challenge of convincing him of the 
contrary before the end of the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member thinks that all the provinces are equal, therefore 
that Quebec is equal to Prince Edward Island, in spite of all the 
beauty that Prince Edward Island has to offer with its beaches 
and the ingenuity of its people, it essentially means that the 
member thinks that we are not a nation, that there is only one 
nation, the Canadian nation, and that he does not want things to 
change to recognize the fact that we speak French, that our 
political system is different, that our justice system is 
different, that we have a vernacular language, that we have a 
collective desire to survive and, most of all, that Quebec is the 
only state in the world that is controlled by 82 per cent of the 
population. That is what the specificity of Quebec is all about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I hope that, by dint of rubbing shoulders with him in very 
parliamentary settings, I will convince the hon. member that we 
cannot in all honesty say that all provinces must be equal, for 
that would be denying the fact that Quebec is a nation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member mentioned 
a point that I would like to clarify.  Despite the fact that 
there are differences in Canada—I mentioned that—we are all 
equal.  That is fundamentally what we in the Reform Party are 
fighting for.  The size of the province does not matter, whether 
it is Prince Edward Island, Quebec or Alberta.  We are all equal, 
and that is what we are trying to accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this amendment we are saying that it is still important to 
respect the views of the people who have elected us, even in the 
province of Quebec.  That is why we propose holding a referendum. 
I think the hon. member would agree that there is no harm in 
doing so.  There is no harm going to the people in his province 
and asking them what they think about this amendment.  I firmly 
believe that we stand for that view of equality. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak in support of the motion to strike a parliamentary 
committee to review the proposed constitutional amendment to 
reorganizing Quebec's school boards along linguistic lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the proposed amendment enjoys a reasonable degree 
of support from those who will be affected by it.  Indeed, the 
reports and consultations that have taken place in Quebec show 
that a consensus has emerged.  Quebeckers clearly feel that, 
while denominational school boards adequately reflected the 
reality of Quebec before the quiet revolution, today linguistic 
school boards would correspond more closely with the values and 
sociological realities of the province. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that Catholic and Protestant Quebeckers, anglophones 
and francophones alike, share this point of view.  When a society 
reaches a clear consensus regarding the administrative structures 
required to educate its children, it is then up to the government 
to react. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, in April of this year, the National Assembly of 
Quebec voted unanimously in favour of a constitutional amendment 
that would replace the Catholic and Protestant school boards with 
francophone and anglophone boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs wasted no time 
presenting an identical resolution in this House on April 22.  We 
were then prevented by the federal election from setting up a 
committee to examine the constitutional amendment, but we are in 
a position to do so now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may wonder whether it is necessary to set up such a 
committee, given the unanimous vote in the Quebec National 
Assembly and the consensus that exists in Quebec in favour of 
this amendment.  To these people I would point out the 
importance, in a democracy, of hearing from everyone.  It is 
clear that, although the great majority of Quebeckers support the 
proposal, some people who favour linguistic school boards are 
less certain that a constitutional amendment is the route to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy requires that all citizens be able to express their 
views on the important issues of the day.  Parliamentary 
committees have been part of the Canadian democratic tradition 
precisely so that experts, groups and citizens may express their 
points of view and so that citizens and their elected 
representatives can reach a better understanding of important 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition in the National Assembly asked that 
similar hearings be held in Quebec, but its request was turned 
down.  The decision by the Government of Quebec not to set up a 
parliamentary committee to discuss the switch to a 
non-denominational school system makes it doubly important today 
to vote in favour of creating such a committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A parliamentary committee will allow those with qualms about the 
proposed changes to voice them and it will give those who 
advocate the new system an opportunity to allay these concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a stronger consensus in favour of a constitutional amendment 
thus emerges it will be surely helpful to the Quebec government 
as it charts a new course for the educational structures in the 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mentioned the concerns of those within Quebec about the 
proposed amendment but I should like to take a moment to address 
briefly the concerns of other Canadians, Canadians who wonder 
what implications this constitutional amendment might have for 
them.  In particular, I think that for those Canadians in other 
provinces who enjoy rights to denominational schools there has 
been some concern expressed, for example, by certain Catholic 
groups in my home province of Ontario.  This is another reason to 
support the striking of a parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that in its discussions the fact that the changes 
proposed by the Government of Quebec have no bearing on minority 
educational rights in other provinces will be raised and 
reinforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we stress today very clearly that this 
amendment would be a bilateral one involving the governments of 
Canada and Quebec City.  As the Minister for Intergovernmental 
Affairs mentioned, it is a proposal that has been endorsed by the 
Catholic committee for the superior council of education, the 
federation of school boards, the federation of parents committees 
and teachers associations representing all the teachers of the 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that should another province bring forward a request 
to replace its denominational school system or to otherwise 
change the constitutional guarantees of its minorities the 
Government of Canada would once again insist that a reasonable 
degree of support be demonstrated by the affected minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment responds to the particular reality of 
Quebec.  It is one of the strengths of our federation that it is 
flexible enough to accommodate the different and diverse needs of 
each of our provinces.  What is appropriate for Quebec may not 
necessarily be appropriate for Alberta or Ontario or vice versa. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our federal system allows us to rally our forces for the common 
good, but it is flexible enough to facilitate the full expression 
of regional identities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, our Constitution is not a strait-jacket that prevents 
change.  Rather, it is a framework that allows change to take 
place in an orderly and timely manner.  It is an evolving 
reflection of who we are as Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec, no less than the other provinces, flourishes within our 
federation and it will continue to do so in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to a point mentioned earlier, but which certainly 
deserves to be re-examined. I am afraid that these secessionist 
leaders who contend that our Constitution of 1982 hinders 
Quebec's development will have to find other arguments. After 
all, this constitutional amendment, which would allow the 
government of Quebec to change the very foundations of its 
education system, was made possible by the patriation of the 
Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Constitution had not been patriated 15 years ago, this 
debate would be taking place in the shadow of Big Ben and not of 
the Peace Tower. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It all goes to show that our federation has evolved a great 
deal.  It is still evolving.  As our government stressed in the 
recent Speech from the Throne, we are committed to working 
collaboratively with our provincial partners to strengthen and 
modernize country. The proposed amendment clearly demonstrates 
that we can work side by side with the Quebec government to 
modernize the federation, a federation which belongs to us all.

<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on Friday I asked a question of the Minister of Transport about 
untendered contracts on a highway 104 project in Nova Scotia 
which is being done under a federal-provincial agreement. The 
minister's reply was basically that it is a provincial issue.  I 
take exception to that.  It is not a provincial issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under normal conditions perhaps a highway is a provincial issue, 
but this deal is anything but normal.  It is not normal because 
the federal and provincial governments have contributed money to 
set up a business to operate a highway at a profit of $151 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not normal because the province of Nova Scotia gave up 
control of the speed limits and fine amounts. It gave up control 
of who can drive on the highway. It even gave up the right for 
the financiers, Newcourt Credit, to establish their own police 
force on this highway. So it is not normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not normal because this is the only highway in and out of 
the province of Nova Scotia and it will affect every person in 
Nova Scotia and also Newfoundland because it is the only highway 
that serves Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a screwball agreement. The reason we have it is because 
there is no national highway program, which we will get into 
later. If we continue with projects like this one, we will have a 
hodgepodge of agreements all across the country if we do not have 
a national highway funding program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the issue is the untendered contracts. The minister said 
that it was a provincial issue.  I will read from the agreement 
where the federal government and provincial government put $55 
million into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 5.1 states that the $55 million agreement will be managed 
by two members of a management committee, one member appointed by 
the federal minister and the other appointed by the provincial 
minister.  It goes on to say that all decisions of this 
management committee will be in writing and shall be acted on 
only if they are unanimous.  So every decision had to be approved 
by the federal government, it had to be unanimous and it had to 
be in writing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also leading on into the agreement another clause states that 
all contracts shall be awarded to the qualified and responsible 
tenderer submitting the lowest evaluated bid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering it is very clear that all the contracts had to be 
tendered and also it is clear that all decisions had to be agreed 
to by the federal government, did the federal government agree to 
issue $113 million of contracts untendered, or did the province 
circumvent the terms of the agreement and do it by itself?  It is 
either one way or the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the feds did agree, we would like to have a copy of that 
decision because in the agreement it says that all decisions will 
be in writing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few other little things we would like to have from 
the hon. minister concerning this agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the Minister of Transport 
stated to the hon. member in question period on September 26, 
under the Constitution of Canada responsibility for highways, 
including highway 104 in Nova Scotia, falls under provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the clarification of the member opposite, I would like to 
explain it a little further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada's only involvement in highway 104 is to match 
dollar for dollar $55 million with the province.  That amounts to 
$27.5 million each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The highway 104 western alignment project is one of a few 
projects funded through the Transport Canada/Nova Scotia 
strategic highway improvement program agreement signed in 1993. 
This agreement makes provisions for both the federal government 
and the province to each set aside about $70 million, for a total 
of $140 million, for highway improvements in Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for the hon. member to note that Transport 
Canada's involvement in the highway 104 project ends right there. 
The province of Nova Scotia is the responsible authority for the 
project.  It is the province that decides on the alignment, 
design, construction standards, tendering process and how to 
finance the construction costs of the provincial highway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Nova Scotia chose to use a public-private 
partnership concept as a means to construct and finance highway 
104.  Nova Scotia decided the developer would be allowed to 
charge tolls as a means of recuperating costs directly from the 
users of the new highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is neither party to nor responsible for 
Nova Scotia's public-private agreement with the developer.  As 
the minister has stated to the member, the government's only 
involvement is to match the funding provided by the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester also expressed an 
interest in the tendering process for the highway.  According to 
the officials in Transport Canada, the province of Nova Scotia 
went through an extensive selection and tendering process for 
highway 104. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry but the hon. member's time 
has expired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted.  Accordingly the House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7.17 p.m.)
