</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.)</B> moved that 
the first report of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and 
Oceans presented on Monday, March 23, 1998, be concurred in. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin—St. George's, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I very much want to take part in this debate this morning to 
speak to the east coast fisheries report that was presented to 
parliament on March 23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was quite an undertaking for members of the committee to go 
about Atlantic Canada and parts of Quebec to hold 15 public 
meetings in the presence of thousands of people from the fishing 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall very well the large numbers of people at places like 
Tors Cove, Burgeo and Îles-de-la-Madeleine who came for hours to 
pass on their views and their observations to the members of the 
Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report the committee submitted to parliament reflects the 
feelings, the sentiments and the desires of people in those 
provinces, and the changes that should take place in DFO policy 
particularly.  It was quite an undertaking, an undertaking that 
has not been undertaken by any other standing committee of 
parliament to my recollection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report received quite a bit of attention, as everyone knows. 
But the recommendations of the report were those desires, wishes 
and recommendations that came from the public hearings that were 
held in the various provinces we visited.  We held 15 meetings 
and listened to thousands of people involved in the fishing 
industry.  Fishermen, fish plant workers, trawlermen, retired 
trawlermen and people who had held top management positions with 
fish processing companies came before the committee to give their 
views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the contentious issues was the state of our fish stocks, 
particularly our cod stocks, the effect of foreign overfishing 
and what foreign overfishing has done to the fish stocks over 
the years.  Everyone recognizes that foreign overfishing has 
declined, but it has mainly declined because it is not 
financially viable for foreign countries to come so far from home 
to catch diminished amounts of cod and diminished amounts of 
flounder.  The main reason they are not coming over to catch the 
fish is because it is not financially viable to do so.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the parliamentary secretary shaking his head.  He is 
probably shaking his head in disbelief.  He is shaking his head 
in disbelief or he is shaking his head at the truth.  I am not 
quite sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Get your facts straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  The hon. member would not know a fact 
about the fishery if he fell on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still foreign fishing going on and the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans a number of times, in appearing before the 
standing committee, has said that if there are Canadian interests 
which still want fish to be caught by foreigners he will make 
that fish available to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go on record this morning as saying that I know of at 
least two Canadian enterprises which at present have submissions 
before DFO looking for fish that is now being caught by 
foreigners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I am on the topic of foreign fishing I cannot bypass the 
opportunity to comment for a few moments on the recent NAFO 
meetings in Lisbon, Portugal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those Lisbon, Portugal meetings, for the first time since 
1949, for the first time since Newfoundland joined Confederation, 
the co-ordinates of the fishing zones on the nose and the tail of 
the Grand Banks and the Flemish Cap have been altered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the first time since 1949 that we see a change in area 3M 
which we always refer to as the nose of the Grand Banks.  There 
has been a change which will allow foreigners to catch shrimp on 
the nose of the Grand Banks for the first time since 1949. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For members who do not know, the nose and tail of the Grand 
Banks are considered nursery areas.  It is where juvenile fish 
grow.  It has great feeding potential.  Fish grow very well 
there.  We try to protect the nose and the tail of the banks for 
that reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has Canada done?  Just a few short weeks ago in Lisbon it 
agreed to alter fishing zone 3M to allow foreigners to catch 
shrimp in the nursery area.  It is the first time.  It is now an 
area known as 3MA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Wrong again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  I say to the hon. member that I am not 
wrong again and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has 
indicated that the governments of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia 
have supported this move.  That is still debatable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very widely debated in Newfoundland whether or not the 
government of Newfoundland agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  We are dealing with facts, not fiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  We are dealing with fish, I say to the 
parliamentary secretary; something which he did not know a lot 
about a year ago.  He knew a lot about spuds, but he did not know 
a lot about fish.  He still knows more about potatoes than he 
knows about fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very disturbing situation for a number of reasons. 
The foreigners will not be content in five, six or ten years just 
to catch shrimp on the nose of the Grand Banks because then they 
will claim historic attachment and they will want to catch cod 
and flounder and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to listen to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
and top management at DFO, they would lead us to believe that 
Spain and Portugal are not overfishing, that they are not 
catching cod on the nose and tail and the Flemish Cap of the 
Grand Banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to inform the House that right now, as I speak, Portugal 
and Spain have huge amounts of headed flatfish, American plaice, 
yellowtail flounder and gray sole for sale in frozen form in 
their warehouses.  Where did they get this frozen flatfish? There 
is only one place they could have gotten it:  from fishing on the 
Grand Banks of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They got the flatfish as a bycatch for cod.  How much cod did 
they take to have these huge amounts of flatfish, American 
plaice, yellowtail flounder and gray sole for sale?  Yet the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and his top management people 
will try to convince Atlantic Canadians particularly that they 
have Spain and Portugal under control.  What malarkey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just as bad out there today as it was 10 years ago. 
The Government of Canada has made it worse by now allowing the 
same people to catch shrimp on the nose of the Grand Banks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary shakes his head.  He shakes his head 
a lot these days.  He shakes his head about the problems with the 
fishery and he shakes his head about some of the problems his own 
colleagues are experiencing.  He shakes, shakes and shakes his 
head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  About misinformation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  The hon. member keeps shouting 
“misinformation”.  The government is good at trying to turn the 
truth into misinformation.  The hon. member cannot deny the 
obvious.  The hon. member would not know, but since the NAFO 
meetings in Lisbon there has been a huge outcry about the shrimp 
situation on the nose of the Grand Banks.  A lot of people have 
their you know what in the wringer over this situation.  It is a 
very serious situation in Newfoundland and Labrador and Atlantic 
Canada.  We suffer most when foreigners fish on the Grand Banks 
of Newfoundland and Labrador; not central Canada or western 
Canada but Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another recommendation in our report dealt with the early 
retirement post-TAGS program.  The committee in its wisdom, after 
listening to those thousands and thousands of people affected, 
recommended that if the government came forward with an early 
retirement program it should develop a formula consisting of age 
plus attachment to the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommended that.  Everyone that came to our meetings 
recommended that.  However, once again the minister of HRDC in 
particular did not accept the recommendation.  I am sad to say 
that because thousands of people with 30, 32, 34 and 35 years of 
attachment to the fishing industry in Atlantic Canada have fallen 
through the cracks of the early retirement program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to see anyone with anything taken away.  We can 
look at someone 55 years of age with 10 years of attachment to 
the industry who will receive early retirement benefits.  Then we 
can look at a person 54 years of age with 35 years of attachment 
to the industry who will not receive any early retirement 
benefits.  There is an obvious unfairness and injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why the government did not accept that recommendation I will 
never understand.  I have consistently said that there was not a 
need for the government to allocate any more than the $730 
million it allocated to the program.  There could have been a 
redirection inside the fund to take care of this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggested very strongly to the minister of HRDC and the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans in written form and verbally 
that they should have redirected the $100 million allocated to 
ACOA for community regional development.  They could have 
redirected some of that money to early retirement and taken care 
of those people with 30 to 35 years of attachment to the 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very serious situation unfolding in Atlantic Canada 
today.  I know about the riding of Burin—St. Georges which I 
represent.  Newfoundlanders and Labradorians have always in large 
numbers gone away to look for work.  They have always gone to 
Ontario, British Columbia or Alberta.  It has been part of our 
life.  However, in the rural communities of Burin—St. Georges 
and rural communities of other ridings that make up our province 
the out-migration is frightening.  It is very difficult in most 
of our communities to find anyone under 45 years of age.  Most of 
them are 50 years of age plus.  Most of them are retired people 
or the few who hold government jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is happening in Newfoundland and Labrador and in a 
lot of communities in Atlantic Canada today.  It is as a direct 
result of what has happened to our fishing industry, what has 
happened to our fish resource, our fish stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our report recommended a change in DFO policy and attitude so 
that as our stocks regenerate and rebuild there would at least be 
a future for Atlantic Canadians in the fishing industry.  All we 
got in response from the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans was 
that he cast the report aside.  He tried to downplay the report. 
He did not take the recommendations of the committee very 
seriously.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very disappointed by that because as all members of the 
House know the majority of members of the standing committee like 
all other committees are government members.  There were nine of 
them.  Nine of them participated in the writing of the report. 
Nine of them supported the recommendations of the report.  Nine 
of sixteen government members wrote and supported the 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans do?  He just threw 
it aside and said “hogwash, bunk”.  The biggest problem in the 
fishing industry on the east and west coasts today is that the 
people in the industry do not have confidence in the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans because of that kind of attitude.  At least 
the minister could have taken the report and very seriously 
reviewed and considered it.  He could have at least responded to 
it in a meaningful way, which he refused to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report from the committee generated a lot of attention in 
Atlantic Canada.  There were 15 public meetings.  Thousands of 
people appeared before the committee.  They expected something to 
follow from the report and from the recommendations.  All they 
got was more arrogance and more nose-thumbing from the Minister 
of Fisheries and Ocean, which is not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some very serious problems in Atlantic Canada with the 
unemployed and the out-migration.  There are some positive signs 
in some of our fishing zones, particularly in our southern zones, 
that our fish stocks are regenerating.  In the province of 
Newfoundland and Labrador that I represent this year we had a 
commercial cod fishery with a total allowable catch which 
increased from 20,000 metric tons to 30,000 metric tons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fishermen I grew up with and worked with in the fishing industry 
when I was working my way through university tell me that there 
is more fish in the southern zones today than they have seen for 
the last 15 year.  They have no reason to mislead me.  I am one 
of them.  I grew up with them.  I am concerned about them.  They 
tell me there are good signs of fish in the southern zones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the northeast coast northern cod stocks the signs are not 
so great, but within the last few weeks I was pleased to hear 
scientists say that there is at least some small sign of some 
regeneration in the northern cod stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our committee did not only hear about cod.  We heard about red 
fish, turbot, lobster and scallops.  You name it, we heard about 
it.  The shellfish industry particularly is still a very solid 
industry.  There are some very good earnings.  Fishermen are 
doing very well.  There is still a very good fishing industry in 
Atlantic Canada in other species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to allude to the NAFO meetings and the observer coverage 
on foreign vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  It is 100%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  The parliamentary secretary is as 
proud as the minister to talk about the 100% observer coverage. 
Observers come from the European Community.  Observers are hired 
by the European Community.  They are not Canadian observers. They 
are Spanish and Portuguese.  In fact they are mostly British 
observers who are paid by the owners of the vessels they observe 
on.  So what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have 100% observers but the price we have to pay is the 
giving away of shrimp on the nose of the Grand Banks to have 
observer coverage for another two years when it will be reviewed 
again.  We may not have 100% observer coverage after two years. 
The foreigners may reject it in two years.  That is what I am 
told.  I am not saying it is correct.  I am told that in two 
years it is up for review.  The parliamentary secretary will have 
an occasion to respond to my remarks.  If I am wrong he can set 
the record straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  It will take me all day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  No, it will not.  It will not take the 
parliamentary secretary very long to deal with it because he 
knows what I am saying is correct.  He knows full well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans be so delighted 
with 100% observer coverage on foreign vessels by foreigners who 
are paid by foreigners?  We do not get to see the observer 
reports. 
They can tell us what they like.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  They were offered to you in camera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  I refuse to accept the observer 
reports in camera.  If I saw them the first thing I would do is 
get in trouble because once I read them I would tell people what 
were in them.  I would rather not see them, because if I see the 
observer reports I want to talk about them.  I do not want to see 
them for my information.  I want to tell Atlantic Canadians and 
all other Canadians what is in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are the people who deserve to know.  Satisfying my 
curiosity is not good enough.  I represent 158 communities in 
Newfoundland and Labrador.  These people want to know what is in 
the observer reports.  What is the point of my looking at the 
reports in camera and not being able to tell them about it 
without getting myself in trouble? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans did not give us the 
reports so that we could look at them, say what we wanted about 
them and make public what is in them, is a matter of real debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the government's way of covering it up.  It wants to cover 
it up and pretend that it is rosy.  The Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans beats his chest about 100% observer coverage.  So what? It 
is like having Jesse James looking after the bank.  It is like 
paying Jesse James to be security at a bank.  Jesse would argue 
that he did not steal any money.  The foreigners tell us that 
they did not violate any of our NAFO regulations and we believe 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a situation nine miles off the coast of Newfoundland 
and Labrador where the French are still catching salmon.  The 
commercial salmon fishery of St. Pierre and Miquelon has 
increased while our fishermen have been bought out.  The French 
bought our fishing nets and set them nine miles offshore.  The 
salmon fishing has increased.  The French tell the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans that they are not catching very many salmon, 
and the minister believes them.  Yet the French do not have one 
salmon river that contributes to the resource.  All they do is 
take out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of situations that we get from the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, from the parliamentary secretary and 
from others over there who are big wigs in government.  They try 
to bamboozle the public.  They try to give a false impression but 
the people are seeing through it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I finish by saying that I was very pleased to be a part of the 
east coast report, to have participated in the committee, to 
listen to Atlantic Canadians, and to express their desires and 
wishes to the government.  However, I am sorry to say the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans did not take the report very 
seriously. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too was very 
pleased to be part of the Standing Committee of Fisheries and 
Oceans.  Its 15 meetings in Atlantic Canada and Newfoundland were 
excellent.  We had good discussions and listened loud and clear 
to what fishermen had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will admit that we had very good co-operation by all members 
of the committee in a non-partisan sense and came up with an 
excellent report.  Not all is abed as the member for Burin—St. 
George's paints it in terms of the minister's response. There was 
an excellent response to a number of points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the member wants to raise a lot of false flags in the 
foreign fishing issue, the minister clarified the concerns on 
foreign fishing.  I would like to make some points relative to 
what the member said about foreign fishing to try to correct the 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The catches from quotas allocated to foreign fleets in Canadian 
waters have dropped to less than 2,000 tonnes in recent years. 
They are down from an average of 350,000 tonnes in the late 1970s 
and 1980s.  The member is shaking his head; he knows that. We 
still have foreign fishing within our 200 mile zone.  A question 
needs to be asked.  Why? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1030

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that this foreign fishing is under bilateral 
fisheries agreements with those countries that abide by our 
conservation objectives inside and outside 200 miles. That is an 
important point. Inside and outside 200 miles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These foreign allocations do not deprive Canadian fishermen who 
still leave large portions of their quotas in the water every 
year.  Some of the foreign vessels in two special Atlantic 
fisheries are chartered by Canadian quota holders.  These foreign 
charters provide jobs for Canadian plant workers and new markets 
for Canadian companies.  It is important to see that Canadians 
are working through the allocation of these quotas to foreign 
fishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, foreign vessels fishing in Canadian waters are 
carefully monitored.  The member talked a bit about this point. 
In Canadian waters they must be licensed and they must carry 
Canadian observers at their expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> What about the reports? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  As I indicated earlier, the observer 
reports were offered to the committee in camera. There is 
confidential commercial information in those observer reports. 
The worry was that if they were not offered in camera in a 
confidential way, as the member for Burin—St. George's said, he 
would make that information public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition parties really should have looked at the reports. 
Then they could have confirmed publicly without giving the 
details that what the minister is saying is correct.  The fact is 
they did not want to admit that the minister is correct on this 
particular issue in terms of what those observer reports state. 
Those are the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact that these charters benefit Canadians, some 
have argued that these fish should be allocated to Canadians. 
That would be great, but Canadians do have the first right of 
refusal for all fish in Canadian waters.  Before any foreign 
allocations are made, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
undertakes extensive consultations with industry and the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the member for Burin—St. George's indicated that 
he knew of two people who are interested. I would hope he would 
bring that information forward and negotiations could go on. 
Maybe they could get their allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we need to remember that the 200 mile nautical zone is 
a matter of international consensus.  It was established during 
the negotiations of the United Nations convention on the law of 
the sea in the 1970s of which we were one of the key players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me move on to a couple of other points that I want to 
clarify and question the hon. member on.  The member talked about 
the— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  If the parliamentary secretary wants to debate this, then 
why does the government not allow this debate to continue instead 
of using up all the time for questions and comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  With great respect, I do not think 
that is a point of order, but I am indicating to the hon. 
parliamentary secretary that this is questions and comments and 
there are other members who want to make comments and ask 
questions. The hon. member has used up half the time already.  I 
would ask him to bring his comments to a close within the next 15 
seconds, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member raised points 
in terms of the NAFO meeting in Lisbon and the 100% observer 
coverage. I just want to point out to him that there are other 
checks and balances in terms of observers that come from foreign 
countries on those boats.  There is spot monitoring by our own 
vessels and there is dockside— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for St. John's East 
may wish to respond.  If not, I will go to another member who 
wishes to comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is Burin—St. 
George's.  I am sure if the hon. member for St. John's East were 
here, being a Newfoundlander he would want to respond, but I will 
take the opportunity to answer the parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was talking about the changes to the co-ordinates for the 
first time since 1949 in moving a line in area 3M to be now 
called 3MA to allow foreigners to catch shrimp on the nose of the 
Grand Banks, for some reason in his speech the parliamentary 
secretary conveniently forgot to allude to that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious situation.  We are now allowing 
foreigners to catch shrimp in the nursery area of the Grand Banks 
for the first time since 1949.  As I said before, they have 
fished shrimp for five or six years.  Then we go off to another 
NAFO meeting and the foreigners will say “Now we have been into 
that new 3MA zone for five years, we have historical fishing 
rights there so we want cod and flounder there”.  I say to the 
parliamentary secretary that is what is going to happen.  And the 
government will try to justify that by saying “But yes, we have 
100% observer coverage.  On every vessel we will have an 
observer, a foreign observer on a foreign vessel”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no protection.  All it does is make the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans feel good.  He pounds his chest about 100% 
observer coverage, but they are foreign observers on foreign 
boats.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to ask my colleague from Burin—St. George's 
a question.  I certainly agree with the comments he has made 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary thinks Canadians are going to 
believe, and I will quote him, “foreign fishers only get what 
Canadians don't want”.  This is an unbelievable statement.  He 
should go back to growing spuds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Burin—St. George's worked very hard on this 
report and all it got was the chairman of the fisheries committee 
fired.  There are some great recommendations in that report. 
They are good for fisheries in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know there is a report on the west coast fisheries 
coming out. The member for Burin—St. George's has forgotten more 
about fisheries than the minister of fisheries or his 
parliamentary secretary will ever know. What advice could he give 
us on the west coast to make sure the west coast does not end up 
with the same disaster from this government that there is on the 
east coast? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the west coast has 
problems that are different and unique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems on the west coast are the direct result of the 
policy of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.  What it has 
done on the west coast, more so than it has done on the east 
coast, is it goes under the guise of consultations.  It goes 
about having these consultative hearings but it does not listen 
to a word that is said. Consequently the minister has had a great 
charade out there of consultations, but he has not listened to 
the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those in top management in DFO continue in spite of those 
consultations in their old ways.  Consequently we see the west 
coast fishery coming apart the same as has happened on the east 
coast.  The same management personnel that have made decisions 
for the last 10 or 15 years are still there making the same 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is going to go about it right, make some 
changes in top management and when consulting with the people, 
listen to the people.  Take their message seriously and make some 
changes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 7, consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-51, an act to amend the Criminal Code, the Controlled 
Drugs and Substances Act and the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak at second reading of Bill C-51, 
introduced by the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is entitled: An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the 
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act.  It cleans out a lot of our penal law 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an omnibus bill. Traditionally, these omnibus 
bills always require particular attention from parliamentarians, 
since they involve several laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A careful examination of the measures proposed in Bill C-51 would 
show how pertinent the minister's proposals are.  I must take 
this opportunity to point out how important the work of the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On numerous occasions in this House we have criticized the 
quality of the work done by the parliamentary committees, 
because of the government's systematic obstruction .  It rarely 
acts on the recommendations made to it.  It is therefore vital 
for the opposition parties to join together to demand 
transparency from the government in committee proceedings. 
As I have done for a number of other bills, I offer the minister 
my full co-operation in improving this bill, if possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this is an omnibus bill, I am going to address a number of 
extremely important matters, naturally those which involve the 
concerns of Quebeckers most directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first part I am going to address deals with casinos on 
cruise ships.  Since other Bloc Quebecois MPs have already 
spoken on this, I shall be brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-51 deals with certain amendments relating to casinos on 
cruise ships.  I will give a brief historical review. 
Without the St. Lawrence River, Quebec and Canada—the entire 
North American continent in fact—would have developed in a very 
different way.  Very early on in our history, it was the route 
taken by the foreign explorers who discovered the marvellous 
part of this continent now known as Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although its role 
has changed over the years, this great navigable waterway has 
always influenced the development of our communities, 
culturally, economically and touristically.  Until know, 
however, our legislation has had a direct impact on the river's 
tourism potential, by preventing cruise ships from operating 
casinos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cruise ships had to shut down their casinos when they hit the 
waters off Anticosti Island, or in other words two days before 
reaching Quebec City. 
The direct result was that a number of carriers avoided 
stopovers at Quebec City and those that did put in did so for a 
much shorter period of time, in the interests of keeping their 
passengers happy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Bloc Quebecois was elected in 1993, the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans has been trying to 
get the House and the government to see the disastrous impact of 
existing legislation on cruise ships with casinos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these ships are allowed to operate their casinos in the St. 
Lawrence River, tourism in the Quebec City area will pick up, as 
passengers will be able to disembark and spend more time in the 
area, returning to the ship at night to enjoy the casino.  This 
will be legal.  When passengers disembark, they will provide the 
Quebec City area with a significant economic boost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this, we owe a big thank you to the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, and to all 
members from the Quebec City area, who worked together to get 
the government to see the advantage of this amendment, and 
especially how important it was to Quebec to amend the Criminal 
Code so that cruise ships could continue on their way, but be 
able to stop over in Quebec City, so that neither the region nor 
vacationers would suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other important thing I wanted to mention about Bill C-51 is 
the accelerated parole review provision.  I would like to speak 
to this briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, the media brought us the Lagana affair.  It will be 
recalled that this involved a lawyer, Joseph Lagana, sentenced 
in 1995 to 13 years in prison for his involvement in a drug 
importing case and for laundering almost $47.4 million. 
The worse part of this story is that Mr. Lagana was released 
after serving only one sixth of his sentence, that is 26 months 
instead of the 13 years of imprisonment he had been sentenced to 
by the judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accelerated parole review procedure provided in the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act benefited this major 
drug trafficker, who was released after serving only one sixth 
of his sentence because his crime was considered a non-violent 
offence under the law and he had not served time before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this subject, let me digress to say a word about the 
application criteria of this accelerated review procedure. In 
1987, the chief justice of the supreme court made a decision in 
the Smith affair, saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because they are the direct cause of the hardship experienced by 
their victims and their families, we must ensure these importers 
of narcotics bear their share of culpability for the countless 
serious crimes of all sorts committed by drug addicts to support 
their addiction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It read further: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With due respect, I believe that, when convicted, these 
individuals, with very few exceptions, should be sentenced and 
actually serve long term sentences. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows that the supreme court considers drug trafficking to 
be a scourge of serious magnitude that must be eradicated. 
In our view, since money laundering sustains this scourge, 
anyone who is found guilty should indeed, in the words of the 
supreme court justice, serve long term sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Liberal government obviously does not agree, since it is 
allowing criminals like Joseph Lagana to take advantage of 
accelerated parole reviews. The Lagana affair prompted the Bloc 
Quebecois, through the member for Charlesbourg, to introduce a 
private member's bill to have this kind of review denied to 
criminals found guilty of money laundering, among other 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Bill C-51 is a step in the right direction, the new 
provisions will not apply to Mr. Lagana and others like him, 
because bankers and lawyers who are convicted for money 
laundering but not for an organized crime offence will still get 
away with serving one sixth of their sentence. 
This is totally unacceptable to the Bloc Quebecois. We will not 
tolerate other Lagana cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we are informing the House that, on Bill C-51, the 
Bloc Quebecois will be proposing amendments to offset the 
Liberal government's lack of courage on this issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the government is making a minor correction to a 
situation does not release it from all its obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to discuss the powers of the attorney general of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-51 affects the respective powers of the federal and 
provincial attorneys general regarding criminal proceedings. 
Indeed, while section 2 of the Criminal Code gives provincial 
attorneys general exclusive authority to institute criminal 
proceedings, Bill C-51 introduces an exception in the case of 
proceedings that relate to the trafficking of uncut rough 
diamonds. 
In fact, the bill creates a concurrent power for this type of 
offence, while pointing out that the new provisions do not 
affect the powers of the provinces in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of that clarification, we feel the amendment proposed 
in clause 16 of the bill opens the door to new federal 
intrusions in the administration of criminal justice which, as 
we know, is an area under exclusive provincial jurisdiction. The 
Department of Justice justifies this undermining of the 
provinces' authority by saying that the mining of diamonds takes 
place almost exclusively in the Northwest Territories. Under 
section 2 of the Criminal Code, the attorney general of Canada 
has, exceptionally, the authority to institute proceedings in 
the two Canadian territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the illegal trafficking of uncut rough diamonds can take 
place across provincial borders, the department feels it would 
be wise to allow the federal attorney general, who institutes 
criminal proceedings in the Canadian territories, to be able to 
bring these proceedings to conclusion in the provinces, if 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we feel this is not enough of a justification. The 
diamond traffic , like many other offences listed in the 
Criminal Code, can be dealt with through co-operation between the 
federal and provincial attorneys general, so that criminal 
proceedings can be brought to a fruitful conclusion. Such 
co-operation currently exists, and nothing indicates that it 
would not exist in the specific case of the trafficking of uncut 
rough diamonds. I am asking the government to respect the 
jurisdictions established in the Canadian constitution—its own 
constitution—and not to get involved in areas under provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other very important characteristic of this bill is that it 
deals with section 227 of the Criminal Code, which states that 
“no person commits culpable homicide—unless the death occurs 
within one year and one day from the time of the occurrence of 
the last event”. The bill would repeal this provision linked to 
British legislation from the Middle Ages. That was a long time 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The centuries old one year and one day rule remained part of our 
criminal legislation without its relevancy ever being seriously 
challenged. Over the years, two main reasons were offered to 
justify this rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it was argued that it would be unacceptable for a person 
to be indefinitely subject to prosecution for murder. 
Second, in cases where the victim lives a long time after an 
injury, a causal connection between the act in question and the 
subsequent death may be difficult to establish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of these justifications, the rule set out in section 
227 of the Criminal Code continues to be strongly criticized. 
The first criticism is that the rule flies in the face of the 
principle that homicide procedures are not subject to any 
statute of limitation in Canada. Furthermore, the 
“one-year-and-one-day” rule is viewed as an arbitrary rule that 
brings our justice system into disrepute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While a causal connection may be obvious, death may occur 
immediately following the period of prescription provided for in 
section 227 of the Criminal Code, which means that the act in 
question could no longer qualify as culpable homicide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we must bear in mind that, with technological progress, 
crime victims may survive for longer periods. 
Technological breakthroughs in medicine help artificially 
prolong the lives of patients who otherwise would have died much 
sooner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By proposing that section 227 of the Criminal Code be 
repealed, Bill C-51 addresses these many criticisms. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By rescinding the year and a day rule, parliament would, among 
other things, be acting on the recommendation of the 
federal-provincial task force on homicide, which, in 1991, wanted 
to have sections 224 and 227 of the Criminal Code replaced. 
This recommendation would have led to the formulation of a 
causality rule, which is in keeping with the jurisprudence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end, it is also important to point out that the repeal 
of section 227 would clear the way for the rules formulated by 
the supreme court in the Smithers case on the determination of a 
causal link between a death and an illegal act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this jurisprudence, the only requirement of the illegal 
act is that it at least contributed to the death of the victim 
and that its contribution was not insignificant. 
Even if the act itself did not cause the death in question, it 
may nevertheless constitute a legal cause once it contributed in 
any way whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the light of the foregoing, the repeal of section 227 of the 
Criminal Code appears justified.  Nevertheless, the 
deliberations of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights should enable us to dispel all ambiguity on this matter 
and I hope to question doctors and lawyers about it so that we 
end up with the best section possible in the Criminal Code 
dealing with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In introducing Bill C-51, the government could have been braver 
and proposed measures more vigorously attacking the real 
problems of the Canadian justice system.  As we mentioned 
earlier, the amendments to the accelerated parole review in the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act are inadequate. 
The battle against money laundering does not seem to be a 
priority for this government, which takes a piecemeal approach 
to things.  The solutions it is proposing do not go nearly far 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt about this government's apathy, because it 
could, right now, take effective action against money 
laundering.  The Bloc Quebecois has been raising this whole 
issue for a long time now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listeners will probably recall that 
we even made it part of our platform in the last election 
campaign, and that we were not short of suggestions for what 
this government should do about this terrible problem in Canada. 
As I mentioned earlier, the member for Charlesbourg introduced 
a private member's bill to deal with the issue.  Since its 
purpose is to do something about the problem of money 
laundering, I trust that it will have the support of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing the government could easily and rapidly do, even in 
Bill C-51 before us, is to eliminate $1,000 bank notes, which is 
a top priority for the Bloc Quebecois.  Canada is one of the 
only countries to issue such a high denomination.  Police forces 
tell us that this makes it easier for criminals to launder their 
ill-gotten gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is also suggesting that financial 
institutions should in future be required to inform the police 
of any dubious transaction involving $10,000 or more.  This 
requirement would also apply to casinos and travel agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what it is saying, the Liberal government's response to 
money laundering has been far from effective.  Strict measures 
are long in coming. 
Because of that inertia, we must constantly raise the issue and 
hound the government, as we did in the case of the motorcycle 
gangs, for instance. The government finally decided to act 
following the enormous pressure exerted by the Bloc Quebecois 
regarding that issue. I do hope that, following our private 
members' bills and our representations, the government will 
finally take action regarding money laundering, if not with Bill 
C-51, then in a subsequent piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since time is running out, I will conclude by saying that the 
Bloc Quebecois is pleased that operating casinos on cruise ships 
on the St. Lawrence River will now be permitted. As I said 
earlier, thanks to the hard work of several MPs from the Quebec 
City area, the government finally realized that the situation 
could no longer persist. 
The tourist industry in the Quebec City area will now be in a 
position to thrive even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is also pleased to have made the government 
realize that the accelerated review process was flawed.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the Bloc Quebecois said repeatedly that it was 
unacceptable to see a notorious drug trafficker take advantage 
of that procedure. Unfortunately, the government did not realize 
the magnitude of the problem, since its proposed amendments do 
not go far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government understand that it is useless to try to 
fight gangs if nothing is done about money laundering? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of crime, as in any other one, money is everything. 
However, the government does not seem to have understood that 
yet, or at least it is slow to do so. 
It is slow to amend the legislation, so that Canada can finally 
lose its unenviable title of money laundering haven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports Bill C-51, to the extent that the 
government is aware that the legislation has a number of flaws 
on which the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights will 
have to work. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am as always pleased to rise and take part in the 
debate, in particular a debate as important as this involving 
substantial changes to the Criminal Code of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-51, as has been previously mentioned, is an omnibus bill 
to amend the Criminal Code of Canada, the Controlled Drugs and 
Substances Act and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice and the solicitor general both tend to 
avoid substantive changes to our statutes.  I was surprised to 
see that the government had tendered this bill to change the 
legislation in June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Optimistically I would like to believe that this is finally a 
sign that this government takes issues of law and order 
seriously, but for reasons that I will outline later I remain 
sceptical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This omnibus bill is nevertheless positive legislation. I want 
to state that at the outset.  The federal government, the 
provinces and the territories share jurisdiction over a number of 
these issues.  The bill itself takes into consideration many of 
the consultations which have taken place between these levels of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned by previous speakers, it would amend the Criminal 
Code with regard to homicide, child prostitution, conditional 
sentencing and parole. These are serious issues of which all 
Canadians should take note.  It was also amend the Controlled 
Drugs and Substances Act, dealing specifically with sentencing 
and criminal liability for on duty law enforcement officers. 
Finally, the bill would amend the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act to exclude those convicted of organized crime 
offences from the eligibility for accelerated parole review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This comes at a time when organized crime units across the 
country sadly are being cut or scaled down by the current 
government.  In my riding of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough the 
local Stellarton detachment has undergone this downsizing.  Able 
and very dedicated officers like Constable Pat Martin sadly have 
been taken away from the crime and specifically the drug units of 
this detachment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to outline some of the significant provisions of 
this bill.  The Criminal Code currently disallows the prosecution 
of an individual for murder, manslaughter and other capital 
offences after more than a year and a day have passed from the 
death of the victim, regardless of how clearly it may be proven 
that the victim's death was caused by the accused. This was 
certainly a situation sadly in need of change. This bill would 
remove that provision in light of advances in forensic science 
and the medical profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ultimately the government with the support of the NDP and 
the Bloc, however, that decided to neuter the DNA Identification 
Act which would further strengthen and stress the importance of 
this particular amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other amendments to the Criminal Code included in this bill 
would simplify the prosecution of an individual if he or she 
attempts to procure the sexual services of a prostitute that they 
know is under the age of 18 years.  It would also allow police 
officers to use electronic surveillance and technology in this 
area to investigate prostitution related offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to note the government's amendment to the 
conditional sentencing provisions in Bill C-51.  If an offender 
breaches his or her conditional sentence this bill now allows the 
justice system to permit the issuance of an arrest warrant until 
a court hearing is held on the breach itself.  Again, I view this 
as a positive amendment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT15"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT15"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1150
<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The breach hearing limit of 30 days would also be changed to 
permit the court to deal with the offenders who cannot be found 
or brought to court within that time period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, however, very unfortunate that the government did not 
choose to further restrict conditional sentencing provisions 
period so that no offender convicted of a crime of violence is 
granted a conditional sentence.  This is a situation I would 
strongly urge the government to reconsider.  It should be 
remedied and, at the very least, there should be efforts made to 
ensure that conditional sentences are not applied to certain 
designated offences such as sexual assault and capital offences 
and those involving high end violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments themselves would ensure that offenders with ties 
to organized crime or gangs would no longer receive accelerated 
parole review.  I view this as positive change.  While this is an 
extremely positive step, I would like to know why the government 
has lectured members for months that it would be inappropriate to 
propose amendments while statutory review of the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act was underway at the justice committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we have seen a bit of a contradiction in what the 
government says and what the government does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal government is willing to amend the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act in this way before the statutory 
review is complete then surely it should be willing to support 
positive and constructive amendments to the CCRA review from 
private members in this House on both government and opposition 
side because I know there are government members who have brought 
forward very intelligent and insightful private members' bills as 
they reflect on the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also question the government's true commitment to fighting 
organized crime given that the solicitor general and the Liberal 
government itself could be doing much more in this area. Recent 
revelations from the auditor general seem to indicate that 
contrary to what the solicitor general announced publicly about 
this government's commitment to organized crime, the reality is 
that millions of dollars have been taken out of the RCMP budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that in the last year to year and a half we have 
seen the devolution of the ports police in areas like Halifax and 
Vancouver.  I assure this House that one very prevalent factor 
waiting in the wings is the decision to make Halifax a 
post-Panamax port.  With this decision there will be 
significantly increased traffic on that port. Instead of a 
specialized police force, the ports police aimed at combating 
organized crime and the importation of drugs, weapons and other 
contraband materials, now we have that duty being passed on along 
with other duties the current Halifax metro police and RCMP are 
charged with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a partisan comment on my part.  That is simply the 
conclusion that has been reached in examining these facts.  I do 
not reach this conclusion alone.  Each year the U.S. State 
Department prepares a report called “International Narcotics 
Control Strategy Report”.  In its most recent report, the State 
Department singled out Canada as an easy target for drug related 
and other types of money laundering.  The same report also listed 
Canada in the same category as Columbia, Brazil and the Cayman 
Islands as an attractive location to hide illegal cash. Finally, 
the same report was very critical of Canada's lack of legislation 
to control cross-border money flow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Association, as it is a very insightful 
group, has also echoed similar concerns.  London police Chief 
Julian Fantino, head of the organized crime committee in the 
Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, said that money 
laundering is an easy feat in Canada.  According to some reports, 
the RCMP has estimated the value of laundering money in Canada 
between $3 billion and $10 billion. The solicitor general 
recognizes this problem, should be aware of it and should act on 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the government's first ever annual statement on organized 
crime, the solicitor general promised new anti-organized crime 
legislation that would finally require significant steps toward 
combating this situation.  It would also require that financial 
institutions report suspicious transactions and cross-border 
currency movements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of interest, the solicitor general's predecessor and 
the current Deputy Prime Minister made a similar commitment in 
September 1996 following the conference on organized crime. 
Sadly, Canadians continue to wait and organized crime continues 
to penetrate this country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April of this year the present solicitor general repeated 
that promise again and had a conference that was very well 
publicized.  There was a great deal of ballyhoo about the 
solicitor general's initiatives and spoke quite openly about his 
intentions for combating organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made the same promise to the police in the past year in 
August and in the span of nearly two years this government has 
made the same promise on four separate occasions but have 
delivered nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would concede that the solicitor general has a laudable 
commitment to consultation as well as airline conversations but 
he also should know that the law enforcement community has had 
enough and does not want any more shallow promises.  The 
government is incessantly holding conferences under the guise of 
consultation and yet there do not seem to be any meaningful 
consequences that come about as a result of these consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general's dismal response to the problem of 
organized crime and this government's manipulation of 
consultation has become a tool of delay and frustrated police to 
the point where the executive director of the Canadian Police 
Association recently stated to the media: “Quite frankly, we 
don't care what this government has to say anymore”.  That is a 
very telling comment from the Canadian Police Association when 
saying this in response to the government's commitment to 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to believe the brave talk of the solicitor general? Given 
his credibility problems of late, that does stretch it quite a 
bit.  The solicitor general since June 1997 has said we would do 
away with any problem recognizing his statements that fighting 
organized crime is one of his strategic priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are patiently waiting, as are the Canadian people, the 
Canadian Police Association and indeed all police associations 
across the country.  Police and the public are forced to judge 
the solicitor general's commitment to strategic priorities by 
actions and results.  Words alone, no matter how tough they 
sound, just do not cut it when it comes to fighting organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also significant amendments with respect to 
telemarketing fraud.  Proceeds gained from deceptive 
telemarketing practices that would be subject to seizure and 
forfeiture under Bill C-51 are a positive step.  This bill would 
also make it illegal to generate currency by copying bank notes 
by computer assisted or electronic means.  Certainly forgery has 
become a problem in this country as it has around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the government for this positive amendment although it 
is unfortunate that we have yet to see other measures aimed 
specifically at organized crime in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the rising market value of forged currency, this amendment 
would establish theft and smuggling of other valuable commodities 
such as diamonds, gemstones or any rock or ore. It is a positive 
focus of this omnibus bill and would make offences aimed at those 
types of forgeries punishable under the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-51 is also an amendment to legislation regarding 
non-communication orders.  Previous speakers have highlighted 
this as one of the more positive and more significant changes 
brought about by Bill C-51 and I tend to concur with that 
assessment.  This amendment would allow a judge who remands or 
denies the bail of an arrested person into custody to order that 
they not communicate while in custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker would know that unfortunately this does happen and 
where the riding of Kingston also includes the Kingston 
penitentiary, there are means now available for prisoners to 
contact victims or contact other cohorts involved in their crime 
or perhaps involved in the case itself that may still be pending 
before the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest this is a very significant amendment that has been 
brought forward and one which I commend the government for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment would the allow judge who remands the arrested 
person into custody to order that they not communicate with any 
witness or any other person between the time of the arrest and 
the bail hearing for judicial interim release hearing.  The law 
currently deals with the judge's power to order non-communication 
orders only at the time of the bail hearing.  That lag time in 
between does permit for this communication to occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to gaming which is also touched by this bill and 
the Criminal Code, we would like to highlight the fact that under 
this bill to exempt international cruise boats from offences 
pertaining to the Canadian gaming provisions is a positive 
step as well. 
Cruise boats would be able to operate casinos while in Canadian 
waters, but not in Canadian ports.  This has very broad sweeping 
ramifications for the provinces of British Columbia and Quebec as 
a significant number of cruise ships currently attend ports in 
both of those provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also allow provincial governments to conduct and 
manage dice games in order to compete with similar operations 
that are under way in the United States.  There are tremendous 
earnings and tremendous amounts of money that change hands over 
the dice games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some concern with this provision in light of the ongoing 
capitulation of the provincial Liberal government in my home 
province of Nova Scotia in dealing with the ITT Sheraton casinos 
in both Halifax and Sydney.  I would like to see this amendment 
further scrutinized by the justice committee to see exactly what 
the long term ramifications will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-51 would also provide that a peace officer or agent is 
not guilty of an offence while acting under and for the purposes 
of upholding the provisions of the Controlled Drugs and 
Substances Act.  This amendment is aimed specifically at support 
for front line police officers and officers who find themselves 
in the line of duty in a situation that results in a charge 
surrounding their behaviour.  This would be outside any internal 
disciplinary action that might be taken under a forum like the 
RCMP Public Complaints Commission which is going on currently in 
Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This allows an opportune time to suggest to the House that the 
commission as we have come to know it is aimed specifically at 
police conduct, not the conduct of any individual outside the 
RCMP Act.  It is not the forum to look at situations such as 
political interference that might come from sources like the PMO 
or other bodies in Ottawa.  The RCMP Public Complaints Commission 
is a body that has a mandate set up to look at RCMP conduct and 
to call witnesses and as we see under the current process, to 
look at the actions specifically of officers of the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular change to the provisions of the Controlled Drugs 
and Substances Act is an important move forward.  Our party is in 
support of this particular change.  The act has been sorely 
lacking and needs to have a change in this manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I would like to express the guarded support of the 
Progressive Conservative Party for these initiatives.  We would 
like to see further amendments as they are deemed appropriate 
under this omnibus bill.  Hopefully the government will take a 
more open, constructive and non-partisan attitude toward bills 
that are brought forward in the House as they pertain to justice 
and criminal law in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have liked to have seen a number of changes to other 
bills such as Bill C-3, the DNA data bank bill, or to the Bill 
C-68 regulations at the very least if we could not have that bill 
struck completely from the rolls.  We would have liked to have 
seen some amendments that perhaps would have been a little kinder 
to organized shooting clubs and to members of the public 
generally who are engaged in the lawful exercise of either 
hunting or sport shooting.  Sadly however, partisanship raises 
its ugly head in the justice system as it does everywhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give our guarded support and our guarded 
optimistic view that the government has recognized the need for 
changes in these justice bills in this omnibus bill.  Bill C-51 
is seen as a positive step forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of bills will be coming before the House in the next 
weeks, months and years, bills such as the bill put forward by 
the member for Mississauga East that deals specifically with the 
issue of consecutive sentences.  I advise the House at this time 
that the Progressive Conservative Party will be in support of the 
hon. member for Mississauga East in her ongoing efforts to have 
the bill brought to fruition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will bring forward a bill with respect to changes to the 
sentencing and probation provisions of the Criminal Code as they 
pertain to the ability of a judge to put certain restrictions on 
those convicted of sexual assault or assault against children. 
It would allow a judge the ability to put restrictions so that a 
person convicted of those types of offences would not be able to 
attend the dwelling house and be in the presence of a child 
without the supervision of an adult.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would take this opportunity again to commend Ms. Donna Goler 
from Nova Scotia for bringing this to the attention of all 
members of the House.  Her ongoing efforts in this area are 
extremely significant in light of her own personal tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I am very pleased to speak on behalf of the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada with regard to these important 
changes to the Criminal Code, the Controlled Drugs and Substances 
Act and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be glad to take any questions from hon. members present 
with respect to my remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, again I comment quite favourably on the speech of the 
hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, or New Glasgow 
to be more specific.  I thank him for his comments. There are a 
couple of things I would like him to elaborate on if at all 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He speaks of the solicitor general but after the last couple of 
days, I think we should be speaking of the Office of the 
Solicitor General because we in our party more or less think of 
the current solicitor general in the de facto mode. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the responsibilities of the port police and what 
has happened in Nova Scotia and Vancouver regarding two major 
ports and the easier access organized crime now has to smuggle 
contraband items of any kind, whether they are drugs, weapons, 
forged money or whatever, those responsibilities are now merging 
with the ones of the municipal police or the city police of the 
area. Of course, I am in total disagreement with that.  I really 
appreciated the idea of a separate police force or enforcement 
agency and that their business was strictly only that, not only 
in the two major centres but in the smaller centres as well, in 
the smaller ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned a concern about the drug trade and our cuts to 
foreign aid. Would he and his party not also agree that one way 
of reducing organized crime's efforts to bring in contraband 
drugs for example, would be for our foreign affairs department, 
our immigration department, CIDA, et cetera to give third world 
countries more access to capital? Their farmers and people in the 
agricultural industries, and I am thinking of Asia, Columbia and 
other third world countries, would then get away from their 
dependency on things like cocaine, heroin and poppy seeds and 
would be able to concentrate on more economic alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he knows, the cuts to foreign aid to these countries have 
made these people very desperate for any cash or income of any 
kind. They resort to what we would call the criminal element and 
grow the cocaine and heroin that organized crime brings into our 
country. Of course, the effect of cuts to our military and cuts 
to our police allow organized crime to bring this contraband into 
our major ports as well as to our coastal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Communities on all three coasts are being devastated by economic 
cuts in terms of fisheries and other related matters. People are 
moving away from those communities and we do not even have a 
civilian presence in some of these communities, which makes it 
easier for organized crime to do its job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough to 
comment, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Sackville—Eastern Shore, a fellow Bluenoser.  He is 
obviously very aware of the fact that Nova Scotia in particular, 
because of its extensive coastline is very vulnerable to the 
importation of illegal drugs and other contraband material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to any number of the questions he posed, regarding 
Canada's increased foreign aid as a means of attacking the 
continued worldwide problem of production of drugs by less 
financially sound countries, it may sound somewhat shallow but my 
initial reaction is that we have a great deal to do in our own 
country first. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has had a wonderful international reputation for having 
given foreign aid to any number of countries, in any number of 
causes and causes that are very important and very real.  As the 
hon. member knows, we have a very significant economic problem 
facing our country, with a $600 billion debt, a dollar that is 
continuing to fall on the international markets and decreasing 
confidence from outside the country as to the economic stability 
of Canada.  In simple terms we have to clean up our backyard 
first and foremost.  If we cannot take care of things here, we 
are not going to be in a position in the future to extend that 
helping hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the member's comments on the ports police specifically 
in Halifax which is close to his riding, there has been a very 
unfortunate decision made by the current government to devolve or 
do away with Canada's ports police on both the east coast and the 
west coast.  I know that there have been efforts made to absorb 
some of those officers into the existing forces, like the Halifax 
Metropolitan Police and the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains, and the member has highlighted it in his 
remarks, that the ports police served a very specific purpose. 
They had specific training.  They had a specific aim in combating 
the movement of contraband material through ports in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member makes the significant point that there are a number 
of communities in Nova Scotia that not only do not have the 
presence of law enforcement officers, but are virtually becoming 
wastelands because of the departure of their citizens.  Nova 
Scotia and other maritime provinces have been facing this reality 
and this unfortunate situation for a long time.  Young, talented 
and educated people are leaving because of the lack of work and 
the lack of economic opportunities.  That does not apply only to 
the young, it applies to young and old and everybody in between. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gives me the opportunity to state uncategorically that this 
government has not done its job with respect to taking care of 
all of the regions of this country, in particular the regions 
such as the province the hon. member and I share and call our 
home. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to speak after the 
Progressive Conservative House leader and hear his words.  I know 
he was a prosecutor in his province.  His words are taken well in 
this House, in fact so well that I hope he will come to our 
united alternative convention in February.  He would make a great 
solicitor general in a new government after the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are very concerned about crime.  On a scale of one to 
ten, Canadians rated it 8.3.  Compared to five years ago 91% of 
Canadians are either much more or somewhat more concerned about 
crime.  Eighty-nine per cent of Canadians strongly or somewhat 
agree that we should increase the severity of sentences of young 
offenders who commit serious crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-51 which is before us now at second reading could have 
begun a change in the right direction and begun to address the 
concerns of all Canadians.  Instead it is late off the mark and 
weak in areas such as child prostitution, conditional sentencing 
and organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government so hesitant to provide alternatives to the 
most likely to participate in crime?  Why is the government so 
hesitant to provide a tougher prison system and give the police 
the resources to prevent and fight crime?  We only have to look 
at Bill C-3, the DNA bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-51 is the quintessential omnibus bill, an inch deep and a 
mile wide.  It is cosmetic at best and timid in its degree of 
efficacy in change.  Bill C-51 could have gone a lot further. 
There are areas where the Reform Party will move amendments at 
the appropriate stage of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the following questions concerning Bill C-51 and the 
impact it has on the feelings of Canadians concerning crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982, 35% of Canadians were afraid of walking alone at night; 
today 42% are afraid.  Does Bill C-51 do anything to change that? 
In 1982, 61% of Canadians were afraid of having their homes 
burglarised; today 63% share that fear. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT20"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT20"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1215
<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does Bill C-51 do anything to allay these fears?  In 1982, 48% 
of Canadians were afraid to go downtown alone.  Today 58% are 
afraid to go downtown alone.  Does Bill C-51 do anything to 
dispel these fears?  It is not what is in Bill C-51 that is 
objectionable.  It is what is not in Bill C-51 that concerns the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-51 surely reflects how the government feels about crime: 
don't get tough, shuffle some paper, commission a study, hire a 
consultant, and above all don't offend criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at the specifics of Bill C-51 and what we are 
being asked to support.  The whole concept of conditional 
sentencing from the start has been ill conceived and an 
unfortunate episode.  In Bill C-51 the loophole in conditional 
sentencing of having time on a conditional sentence, even when 
the person is alleged to have breached the condition, is now 
closed and the hearing can now go beyond 30 days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an acceptable change, but it does not address the most 
glaring problem with conditional sentencing, specifically its use 
for violent offenders.  Why would the minister ignore this 
obvious issue?  This is the real problem in the area of 
conditional sentencing.  Why avoid it again?  The bottom line is 
that conditional sentencing should not be used for violent 
offenders.  Case after case in this area begs for change.  The 
minister will only go so far to correct the problem and then she 
pulls back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A simple amendment to section 742.1 to exempt convictions for 
serious personal injury offences as defined in section 752 would 
prevent such travesties as the two Haitian rapists in Montreal 
last year who did not go to jail.  This was a particularly 
heinous crime by violent individuals who received a conditional 
sentence, and the two Haitians are licensed to do it again thanks 
to conditional sentencing.  Is there any sense of justice or 
backbone in the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can be accused in the House of being partisan.  Let me quote 
what a few judges, who everyone in the House would agree are not 
partisan, say about conditional sentencing.  An article in the 
Edmonton <I>Sun</I> headlined “Top judges skeptical of soft 
sentence trend” read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early trends in conditional sentencing, a method of punishing 
offenders that is still in its infancy, got a damning review by 
Alberta's highest court yesterday. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Justice Catherine Fraser in a decision indicated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surgery should not be performed simply because a surgeon has a 
new scalpel—. Improperly used or skimpily drafted, it will 
undermine the respect for the law.  Like all tools or 
instruments, it is to be used for the right situation, not the 
wrong situation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a judge talking about conditional sentencing, not a 
politician.  In a 50 page ruling the appeals justices detailed 
several major complaints they had with the way judges and lawyers 
had been applying the reforms.  Yet we see no changes in the 
legislation which will allay the fears of judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another articled headlined “Judges attack improper 
use—conditional sentencing undermines respect for the law” 
read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta's highest court criticized judges across Canada for the 
unimaginative and skimpy conditional sentences they've imposed 
and urged them to be tough and creative instead. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are judges talking about a law brought in by parliament, 
and the bill does nothing to change that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Minister of Justice in a headline in the Edmonton 
<I>Journal</I> supports a court ruling critical of conditional 
sentencing.  I quote from the Edmonton <I>Journal</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's justice minister says she's pleased with an Alberta 
Court of Appeal decision critical of the way in which conditional 
sentences are applied across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“There have been some circumstances in which I believe 
conditional sentences were used when it was not the intention of 
parliament to have them used, and those should be appealed”— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the justice minister said Thursday. The justice 
minister had an opportunity with the bill to make changes so that 
the courts do not have to appeal these things.  She could have 
made the changes and she did not make the changes.  That is why 
the bill is faulty.  That is why we will move amendments when the 
time comes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on. I have quotes from newspapers across the 
country indicating that judges, lawyers and Canadians do not like 
the conditional sentencing that has been brought in by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a survey of 850 police, lawyers, probation officers and 
corrections staff the following was revealed:  90% thought the 
sentences imposed by the courts were not respected and 69% 
thought the actual amount of time served should be the same as 
the sentence imposed. 
Is it not an amazing thought that somebody can be given some time 
in jail by a judge and other people in the system would allow 
them out in a very short period of time?  We have all heard of 
how short some of these sentences really are.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 76% of the people in the business thought criminals avoided 
jail too often and 55% considered the law to be too soft.  As one 
crown attorney said, this does not make any sense.  If we do not 
have the resources to keep somebody in jail then let us not 
sentence them to jail.  The system is losing credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One judge out of eleven interviewed said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundamentally, they couldn't care less what we say when we send 
someone to jail for 30 days and they only serve 5.  It's as if we 
miscalculated and we were fools for imposing 30 day sentences 
when they did not deserve them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When judges imposes a 30 day sentence it should be a 30 day 
sentence, but the government through its legislation makes the 
judges look like they are fools.  Bill C-51 does nothing to solve 
the problem.  It is about time we had some real truth in 
sentencing.  It could start with Bill C-51 if the government had 
the will.  We will move amendments, hoping the government has the 
will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will discuss another story in relation to conditional 
sentencing.  Domenico Tozzi, the greatest money launderer in 
Canadian history, was sentenced to 10 years and a fine of 
$150,000 for his role in the importation of 2,500 kilos of 
cocaine plus 25 tonnes of hashish.  When he did not pay his fine 
the sentence was increased to 12 years and he was released after 
only serving two years in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what 2,500 kilos of cocaine and 25 tonnes of 
hashish are worth, but I would guarantee it is in the millions. A 
judge put him in jail for 10 years and gives him a $150,000 fine. 
He wondered why he should pay the fine if he would only get two 
more years in jail.  Then our great system allowed this man back 
on the streets after just two years in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-51 does nothing to solve that problem.  We are going to 
make amendments to it.  As my Conservative colleague said, 
hopefully the government and the rest of the House can work on 
this in a non-partisan way to bring in laws all Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ex-lawyer Joseph Lagana was involved in the importation of 558 
kilos of cocaine and in laundering $47.4 million.  He was 
sentenced by a judge to 13 years.  He was released after two 
years and two months to a halfway house where he is free from 6 
a.m. to 11 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What message does that send to Canadians?  He imported cocaine 
which kills young people and laundered $47.4 million.  That 
probably goes right over top of of the average Canadian's head. 
It is astounding.  Average Canadians cannot even think of figures 
that large. What does he get?  Two years and two months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That shows young people that a life of crime pays.  It creates 
career criminals.  Will this man go back to an honest job?  Will 
anybody in Canada be convinced that after two years and two 
months he has been rehabilitated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anthony Volpato, described by the papers as one of the leading 
figures in the Montreal Mafia, was sentenced to six years for 
conspiracy to import 180 kilos of cocaine.  He was freed after 
only one year.  This kind of sentencing has to stop and we have 
to make amendments to the bill to make sure it stops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about organized crime, another area in which Bill 
C-51 is sadly lacking.  As Bill C-51 implies organized crime 
figures are not choir boys.  Why would we treat them that way? 
The minister thinks she is getting tough in Bill C-51 by 
eliminating the accelerated parole hearing after one-sixth of a 
sentence has been served.  It is better than before. Organized 
crime figures will still have access to day parole and be 
released after serving one-third of their sentences. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT22"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT22"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my previous comments on conditional sentencing, 
this is a joke.  It is objectionable, unacceptable and naive. 
Organized crime laughs at going to jail for a couple of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am sure you like going to the movies.  The part 
of the bill on organized crime kind of reminds me of the movie 
<I>Goodfellows</I>.  In that movie three Mafia members were 
convicted of a crime and doing time by having pasta dinners in 
prison.  They are sitting tight being model prisoners, knowing 
they will get out before their full sentence is served.  The 
notion and the part of the movie with the Mafia members drinking 
Chianti and making pasta is as comical as Bill C-51 in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the justice minister that members of criminal 
organizations are by definition in section 2 members of a group 
of at least five persons, formally or informally organized, 
having as a primary activity the commission of an indictable 
offence and the members having been in the preceding five years 
in a series of such offences.  That is very serious stuff.  In 
short, these people should be held for their full sentences. They 
should not get full parole as Bill C-51 allows.  Serious crime, 
serious time.  We have to get that message across to organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people should not enjoy the generous system of day parole, 
full parole and statutory release.  There should be no exception 
for organized crime.  Does the minister really believe, be it 
one-sixth or one-third, that these people can be rehabilitated in 
such a short period of time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I gave an example before of those with 13 years sentences being 
out in two years for crimes involving millions of dollars.  They 
will, as the movie <I>Goodfellows</I> portrays so accurately, sit 
tight, keep up the connections while incarcerated and return to 
their lives of crime when released.  Is the minister expecting 
organized crime members to have some sort of Epiphany while in 
prison?  This is another sadly lacking element in Bill C-51 and 
one we cannot support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to another item lacking in Bill C-51 in the area of 
child prostitution.  Bill C-51 calls for giving police more tools 
in the juvenile prostitution area.  All Canadians say wonderful, 
that is great.  Living off the avails of a child prostitute, 
keeping a common bawdy house and using an underage prostitute are 
made offences justifying the issuance of a wiretap order.   The 
offence of attempting to obtain such services is expanded to 
include communicating with anyone for the purpose of 
prostitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is commendable, but surely we could go further in dealing 
with this parasitic behaviour by sick people who prey on 
juveniles.  Right off the top, how about a mandatory minimum jail 
sentence for those convicted of procuring under 18 year olds? Why 
not send a clear message that society frowns on such perverted, 
exploitive behaviour? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get these offenders off the street and let us keep them 
off the street.  Why is the government so fearful to change the 
penalty which remains at five years maximum?  The fact is no one 
changes the penalty.  Judges give discharges, suspend the 
sentence or impose the good old conditional sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many young children in our big cities today are getting into 
child prostitution.  We have to let the pimps know, the people 
involved in that business, that the Parliament of Canada does not 
accept that.  It is happening too often in our cities today.  The 
life of crime has been shown to these young people as a way to 
live.  We have a responsibility with the bill to toughen this law 
and reduce child prostitution.  My party will put those 
amendments in the proper place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Around and around the charade goes.  The government is doing 
nothing to change this perverted procurement by perverted 
individuals.  A slap on the wrist will not be a deterrent, and 
the tools we just gave the police to wiretap are moot.  Give with 
one hand, take away with the other.  This ensures inertia, which 
is a specialty of the government. 
It is time to get serious with child prostitution.  The Reform 
Party wants mandatory jail time for first offences and repeat 
offenders to get triple time with no possibility of serving a 
sentence intermittently.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put the minister on notice.  This is not good enough and we 
will deal appropriately at committee and report stage with this 
aspect of Bill C-51. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of the Criminal Code that begged for change and for 
a change got it is the so-called year and a day rule for 
homicide.  It only took 12 years for this lethargic government to 
move on a recommendation first made by the Law Reform Commission 
back in 1987.  The commission brought this forth and recommended 
an immediate amendment 12 years ago.  But in typical government 
fashion it had to be studied to death and the government waited 
to stick this necessary and easy amendment into an omnibus bill. 
One simple bill and one simple line would have accomplished this 
but the government has to wait for another example of an outdated 
law allowing a heinous crime to go unpunished; a government would 
be so lackadaisical as to allow a law to stand which allows a 
killer to avoid a murder charge if the death of the person he 
assaults is a year and a day after the offence.  As my colleague 
says, there is just no value on life. Why does it take so long? 
It is absolutely incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to tell a story that finally shook the government out 
of its sleepiness into including an amendment in this bill.  It 
involves a mentally challenged 50 year old Winnipeg man, Marvin 
Ward, who was savagely beaten by a 17 year old using a baseball 
bat.  The perpetrator stole a grand total of 75 cents in the 
robbery of Mr. Ward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately Mr. Ward died 14 months after the vicious attack. 
Due to the centuries old law, as I said earlier that was 
recommended to be changed in 1987, the government allowed to 
languish on the books, the individual could not be charged for 
murder because Mr. Ward died more than a year after the attack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This punk served 28 months in closed custody for robbery and 
assault with a weapon, because the law was not changed, even 
though an amendment was recommended in 1987.  This government 
should be ashamed that it took this long to make this kind of 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why in the world have successive governments allowed this law to 
go unchanged knowing how easy it would have been to change it and 
reverse this travesty that took place?  It is tragic.  Despite 
the Law Reform Commission expression of concern in 1987, a 
recommendation by the federal-provincial working group on 
homicide in 1991 and consultations in 1994-95 by the justice 
department on the general causation rule nothing was done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1997 the former minister of justice promised to change 
the law.  It was reiterated by the current minister in September 
1997.  Why did the current minister wait so long?  It was just to 
tie it into a series of unrelated amendments contained in Bill 
C-51.  Surely there was more urgency or was she just embarrassed 
by her inaction as she thought no one would notice it hidden away 
in Bill C-51, the omnibus bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wild Rose attempted through his private member's 
Bill C-215 to change this year and a day disgrace. Unfortunately 
it was not deemed votable. It was another example of the Reform 
Party leading the way on criminal justice and dragging this lazy 
government along into the present day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Lee Iaccoca used to say, lead, follow or get out of the way. 
That is certainly not the motto of this government.  It does not 
get out of the way.  It certainly does not lead but it is pretty 
good at following.  Liberals just sit back, wait, follow and then 
when they get embarrassed they sneak it into the middle of a 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's delay is inexcusable.  During debate on the 
bill by the member for Wild Rose the government's lethargy was 
exposed.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice 
said:  “While there is little doubt that change ought to occur, 
it may be premature to support this bill at this time”.  How 
often do we hear that?  Whether it is in committee or in this 
House, it is premature to do it at this time because it is not 
the government's idea.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A great example of this is a private member's bill that passed 
in the House the other day because members on the other side on 
the back benches are maybe getting a little restless when certain 
people are getting fired and moved around.  So to show a little 
independence they pass a private member's bill.  Wait until it 
gets to committee and they pull the whips out.  A good bill will 
die and that is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can anyone believe the parliamentary secretary?  What more proof 
did she need?  She and her government could not bring themselves 
to support this initiative and we had to wait until they got 
around to drafting their own amendment.  This was not only 
insecure and petty on their part, it was also negligent for them 
to allow this issue to drag on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not a lot to support in this dog's breakfast of 
amendments.  A lot of it could have been done incrementally over 
the years if the government were not so lazy.  The important part 
is that we will be ready to scrutinize the other aspects of this 
legislation and prepared to deal with substantive amendments as 
we proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many support a triple E Senate.  How about a triple E justice

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to be able to speak to Bill C-51 today.  This is a bill 
that makes at least 12 amendments to the Criminal Code 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give you examples of some of the amendments, in order to 
demonstrate what a catchall it is.  One could call it a 
tutti-frutti bill.  It tries to cover all the bases.  I would 
like to list some of the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to widen the scope of the offence of 
obtaining the services of a prostitute under eighteen years old; 
to modernize the provisions concerning the offence of making 
likenesses of bank notes; and to bring deceptive telemarketing 
offences against the Competition Act under the forfeiture 
provisions for the proceeds of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are but a few of the amendments, and I have listed them to 
demonstrate how impossible it is to seriously address all of 
these aspects—scattered as they are—in the time allotted me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, however, like to point out that this bill marks a great 
victory for the Bloc Quebecois.  The section in question is the 
one on cruise ship casinos.  This will have a definite economic 
impact on the Quebec City region, my riding in particular.  I 
will come back to this later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to mention the Bloc Quebecois' partial victory 
concerning amendments to the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act that exclude those convicted of organized-crime offences from 
eligibility for accelerated parole review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments to the Criminal Code are a result of the 
pressure brought to bear by the Bloc Quebecois, which introduced 
private members' bills in the House.  They are certainly the 
result of the many questions put by the members with 
responsibility for these files. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, as I have already mentioned, I will be focusing on the 
Criminal Code amendment that permits the operation of casinos on 
international cruise ships that are Canadian or in Canadian 
waters.  If time permits, I would also like to speak to the 
amendment having to do with eligibility for accelerated parole 
review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois therefore supports the bill introduced by the 
Minister of Justice yesterday, which we are discussing today, 
all the more so as it is the response to a request that goes 
back more than 10 years.  Ten years ago, Port of Quebec 
authorities made a request, which has had the strong support of 
the Bloc Quebecois since we arrived on the federal political 
scene in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 10 years, these harbour authorities have been asking for an 
amendment to the Criminal Code.  It is a small amendment, but 
one which has deprived the entire Quebec City area of important 
economic benefits in various sectors of the tourism industry.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore like to take a few moments to look at the 
existing legislation, so as to shed some light on the proposed 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Games of chance, including casinos, come under federal 
jurisdiction, and are prohibited under the Criminal Code except 
where authorized by a competent provincial authority under 
section 207 of the Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because casinos on board ship fall under the Criminal Code 
definition of gaming houses, enforcement of the federal 
legislation falls under the jurisdiction of the provinces as 
soon as a ship arrives in one of the ports on their territory, 
if the ship has committed an offence at any point since it 
entered Canadian territorial waters 12 miles off the coast line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not much of a disadvantage for international cruise 
ships headed for ports in British Columbia or the maritimes. 
Why?  Because those ports are just 12 miles away from 
international waters, all gambling activities are shut down just 
before docking, which is not the case for the St. Lawrence 
ports.  When ships enter the St. Lawrence, they come under the 
Criminal Code as soon as they are 12 miles off the eastern tip 
of Anticosti Island. 
This means that gaming tables have to be shut down as soon as 
they pass that strategic point and remain shut down until they 
sail out of Canadian territorial waters, which takes two to 
three days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When tourists pay for cruises that have casinos, it is because 
they want to be able to gamble. The Quebec City region was 
penalized because all casino activity had to be shut down as 
soon as they were off Anticosti Island.  This meant that, for 
two or three days before arrival at the Quebec City and other 
St. Lawrence ports, passengers could not use the casino.  It is 
therefore quite clear how much Quebec City was at a 
disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, under section 207 of the Criminal Code, casino 
activities in Canada were legal only if directly operated by a 
provincial government, or under provincial licence by a 
religious or charitable organization or the board of a fair or 
exhibition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only an amendment to the Criminal Code could settle the question 
of casinos aboard cruise ships, and today I can state that, as 
the MP for the riding of Québec, I am pleased the government has 
finally been able to make this amendment to the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now look at how the proposed legislative amendment will 
remedy the situation.  Clause 7 of Bill C-51 proposes an 
amendment to the Criminal Code which will make it possible for 
casinos to operate on board ship provided they are not within 
five nautical miles of a Canadian port at which the ship calls 
or is scheduled to call. 
Unless I am mistaken, a distance of five nautical miles means 
about 12 kilometres before arriving to the port. So, we are very 
pleased with that provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly, one of the positive aspects of these amendments 
is that they only change in a minor way the legislation 
prohibiting the operation of casinos in Canada, except for 
section 207 of the Criminal Code. In spite of its minor 
importance, this legislative amendment will have a major impact 
for the province of Quebec. Because of Bill C-51, the St. 
Lawrence River will finally be on the same footing as the other 
Canadian maritime regions, such as Vancouver and Halifax, to 
name but two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And this fair balance will be restored without having to change 
the spirit of the law, and without affecting in any way the 
plans that some provincial governments may have about operating 
casinos. 
Indeed, this legislation does not seek to compete with casinos 
operated by the Government of Quebec or by other provinces. The 
gambling rooms will be closed when the ship is in a port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we stress the fairness that the new legislation will bring 
about, we should not forget the major economic spinoffs that it 
will provide for the Quebec City area. The cruise industry has 
an economic impact of several millions of dollars for the Quebec 
City region. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies indicate that each tourist spends $110 when a ship calls 
at a port. Since the provision of the Criminal Code currently in 
effect prevents about 25 ships with an average of 1,000 to 1,500 
passengers from coming to Quebec City, the resulting shortfall 
is huge. It totals $2.5 million per year, and we have been 
asking for that change for 10 years. It is pretty easy to figure 
out that an annual shortfall of $2.5 million over a 10 year 
period represents a considerable amount of money for the Quebec 
City region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Supposing that more cruise ships—and everyone knows that the 
industry is growing—stayed longer, what economic impact would 
this have on the tourism industry in the greater Quebec City 
region? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly put, the new legislation will have a major economic 
impact on our region, lengthening the tourism season and 
increasing activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision will have an effect on the life of Quebec City and 
bring in even more tourists.  It could even cause tourists 
caught in the charm of Quebec City during a stop there to return 
to visit our region and to promote it within their own 
communities.  We are delighted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remind those watching us and our colleagues in this 
House that the Quebec National Assembly passed a bill quite 
similar to Bill C-51, and that was in 1995.  The Bloc Quebecois 
has been very active since its arrival in Ottawa in an attempt 
to correct this inequity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans introduced 
a bill in the House in February 1997 with the full support of 
the members in the caucus from the Quebec City region.  Because 
of the election in 1997, he had to start all over, as he did in 
June.  A number of press conferences followed the tabling of 
these two bills.  The Bloc Quebecois was persistent in this 
matter, because of the economic benefits for the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I remind you that the request from the Quebec City port 
authorities is 10 years old and that many stakeholders were 
steadfast in their support of our action to have the Criminal 
Code amended.  They include the Quebec City Urban Community, the 
Quebec City Region Tourist and Convention Bureau, the 
Secrétariat à la mise en valeur du St. Lawrence, the Corporation 
of the Lower St. Lawrence Pilots, the Société de développement 
économique du Saint-Laurent, the Quebec department of tourism, 
and representatives of the business community.  They were all 
behind us to have the legislation changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are delighted Bill C-51 has been changed to permit the 
operation of casinos on cruise ships, but we regret the slowness 
of the federal government and its lack of flexibility. 
Bloc members had to press hard for this bill before our efforts 
finally paid off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we relate this issue to other issues, it seems paradoxical 
that a controversial bill like Bill C-36 establishing the 
millennium scholarships, for example, would be adopted as 
quickly as it was. I sat on the committee. A few weeks is all it 
took to change the legislation and establish the scholarships. 
The consensus in Quebec was against this legislation, unlike the 
one concerning cruise ships. We were against the establishment 
of a millennium scholarship foundation and we find the federal 
government's logic lacking when it comes to legislation that 
could favour Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Bill C-36 establishing the millennium scholarships that no 
one in Quebec supported, the Liberal government managed to find 
$2.5 billion in two weeks. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But a minor change to the Criminal Code, with a major economic 
impact, took 10 years. The logic of this government still eludes 
us, when it is quick to act on issues that serve its interests 
and drags its feet on those serving Quebec's economic interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I have a few minutes left, I would like to address the part 
of Bill C-51 dealing with eligibility for accelerated parole 
review. Here again, we feel the government is not going far 
enough. Granted, this would be a major change. It would give 
teeth to our legislation dealing with certain drug traffickers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use the few minutes I have left to try to explain how 
this amendment could prove worthwhile and be improved upon by 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August 1997, we learned of the Lagana affair from newspaper 
reports. A lawyer had been sentenced in 1995 to 13 years in 
prison for importing cocaine and laundering $47.4 million. As we 
know, Mr. Lagana was released after serving only 26 months, or 
one-sixth of his sentence, because he had become eligible for 
accelerated parole review. After serving just one-sixth of his or 
her sentence, any non-violent criminal who has never done time 
before may apply for parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response, the Bloc Quebecois, through the member for 
Charlesbourg, introduced a private member's bill to eliminate 
this accelerated procedure for those found guilty of money 
laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In  Bill C-51, the government wants to correct this situation. 
It is proposing to exclude those convicted of organized crime 
offences from eligibility for accelerated parole review.  This 
amendment is a step in the right direction, but it is limited to 
the provision of the Criminal Code dealing with organized crime. 
It does not affect bankers, individuals or lawyers convicted of 
money laundering who are not part of organized crime.  Such 
individuals may therefore continue to launder millions of 
dollars and serve only one sixth of their sentence in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have liked to see this amendment extended to include 
lawyers and bankers who launder money. 
This is a completely unacceptable state of affairs.  We in the 
Bloc Quebecois will not stand for another case like that of 
Lagana.  We will introduce amendments to make up for the Liberal 
government's lack of courage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also have liked to see $1,000 bank notes taken out of 
circulation, because we know that it is easier to launder that 
denomination.  We are one of the only countries in the world 
with this denomination in circulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also like financial institutions to be permitted to 
alert the police about suspicious transactions of $10,000 and 
over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not be able to address all the other items. 
Since there are a good dozen amendments in Bill C-51, it is 
difficult to give them the attention they deserve in a mere 
fifteen or twenty minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, as I mentioned, we are very happy with the 
Criminal Code amendment having to do with cruise ships.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-51 this afternoon, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code, the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have been waiting for many, many months to finally see 
legislation from our Minister of Justice.  One would almost think 
that justice reform is not a very high priority with this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-51 is an omnibus bill which will make amendments to the 
criminal law.  It is an attempt to respond to the changing 
conditions within our society.  Much of what is being proposed is 
long overdue.  Many of the proposals within this bill make sense 
and cause very little concern.  Canadians must wonder why these 
issues have not been addressed before now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that this minister and this government 
continue to lurch ahead with half measures because of politics. 
Canadians continue to be shortchanged when it comes to 
improvements to our criminal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I have a brief comment on the bill's proposal to amend 
section 186 of the Criminal Code.  It concerns invasion of 
privacy under part VI of the code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1970s the federal government introduced a whole scheme to 
permit police to legally intercept private communications to 
assist them in their investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law permitted authorized personnel to install, maintain and 
monitor communications through the installation of devices such 
as bugs or wiretaps.  It has taken over 20 years for the 
government to amend the legislation to also permit the authorized 
removal of those bugs and wiretaps.  I suppose this falls into 
the category of “better late than never”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-51 proposes to permit the operation of casinos on 
international cruise ships that are Canadian or operating in 
Canadian waters.  Dice games will now be permitted and will be 
managed by the provinces and territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it can be argued that casinos and dice games will improve 
the competitive nature of Canadian assets, there is significant 
opposition to gambling of any form in many parts of the country. 
I will be interested in the justice committee review of this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that international cruise ships which operate 
within the Canadian inside passage route to Alaska already 
operate casinos within Canadian waters.  It will be interesting 
to see just how this has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another proposal would eliminate the requirement for a victim to 
die within a year and a day of an assault in order that a charge 
of murder, manslaughter or causing death by criminal negligence 
can be brought.  With modern medical advancements it has become 
much easier to maintain victims on life support for extended 
periods of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charges and convictions were often based merely on when the life 
support machines were turned off.  Individuals who cause the 
death of others must be accountable for their actions, no matter 
how long the victims manage to hang on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems impossible, but this government and its predecessors 
have been permitting killers to walk free just because their 
victims have managed to survive, often in a comatose or 
vegetative state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can only begin to imagine the anguish foisted on a family 
when they learn that the perpetrator has escaped justice because 
their loved one lived too long.  This problem was first discussed 
12 years ago and, as I have stated, some provisions are long 
overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill contains a proposal to amend the offence section for 
the prostitution of a person under 18 years of age.  It is 
amendments such as this that illustrate why it appears to take 
forever for this government to bring forth much needed 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-51 proposes to amend section 212(4) of the code.  I note 
that just last year Bill C-27 amended the same section.  A number 
of thoughts cross my mind when I look at this.  I wonder whether 
the previous Minister of Justice did not know what he was doing 
the first time around.  I wonder whether this government even has 
a plan to address juvenile prostitution.  I wonder why they 
refuse to consider increasing the penalty for engaging the 
services of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will they not legislate an increase in the age of consent 
from 14 to 16 years for sexual activity between a young person 
and an adult? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago, while in my constituency, I attended a function 
at which Diane Sowden, the courageous mother of one of these 
sexually exploited young people, was honoured with an award from 
the attorney general of British Columbia for her tireless 
devotion to these issues.  I have presented numerous petitions in 
this House on her behalf, but still nothing from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have similar concerns over amending section 742.6 of the code. 
Again I wonder whether the previous Minister of Justice got 
anything right during his term in the position.  Section 742.6 
came into being through Bill C-41 in 1995.  It concerns the very 
controversial conditional sentencing provision whereby criminals 
are permitted to serve their sentences at home to avoid the costs 
of incarceration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of Reform Party proposals to limit conditional 
sentencing to non-violent and non-drug offenders, the former 
minister maintained that he knew better and made it quite clear 
that he was not open to changes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless there was soon public outrage over the weakness of 
the legislation.  Violent criminals were being released back into 
the community almost every day without serving any time in jail 
for their crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former minister of justice appears to be joining in the 
Prime Minister's mantra of don't worry, be happy.  Perhaps he 
was auditioning for the role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eventually pressures became so great that he was compelled to 
amend his conditional sentencing legislation.  But did he limit 
it to non-violent, non-drug offenders?  No, he cranked up the 
spin machine to con Canadians into thinking that he was making 
major improvements when in reality he was only tinkering, again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-17, which was passed in 1997, he tried to persuade our 
courts to pay more attention to community safety when considering 
conditional sentencing.  But even today we find hardened and 
dangerous criminals still receiving this Liberal perk of serving 
a sentence in the comfort of their own home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we have recently seen police raising serious 
concerns over losing the battle against organized crime. 
Canadians have witnessed vastly increased violence among biker 
gangs as they fight over control of criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general has been quick to board the political 
bandwagon to announce a strategic partnership with the provinces, 
the police and customs officials.  I wonder what he must think 
and what he can say when recently a member of the Hell's Angels 
was convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to serve his time 
in the comfort of his own home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is once again amending the conditional 
sentencing legislation but as usual it is failing to properly 
address one of its most fundamental flaws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last but not least, the minister wants to change the accelerated 
parole provisions.  They messed with sections in Bill C-45 in 
1995 and that same year in Bill C-55 they reduced parole 
eligibility to one sixth of the sentence.  They had another go at 
it with Bill C-95 in 1997 and now they want to change the section 
again to exempt organized criminals from receiving such lenient 
early parole eligibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their rush to reduce prison populations they changed the law 
to permit the release at one sixth but now realizing that 
organized gang members are not very nice people, they say they 
should serve a little more time than that.  Reality, what a 
concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps they should consider truth in sentencing.  Many citizens 
are disillusioned with our justice system just because of 
instances such as this whereby the government acts irrationally, 
without forethought and with purely political motives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If criminals were properly sentenced and served those sentences 
citizens would be much more inclined to understand and support 
that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the funding problems of the RCMP we are 
having in B.C.  RCMP boats are tied up, helicopters are grounded, 
and there have been overtime bans.  My riding is in the city of 
Surrey, a large city of over 300,000.  It is the largest 
detachment of the RCMP in Canada.  Frontline officers have 
serious concerns about their abilities to provide adequate 
services and protection to the public.  My constituents would 
like some answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attorney general of British Columbia is now talking about 
getting rid of the RCMP altogether and forming a provincial 
police force.  He has been requesting a meeting with the 
solicitor general to discuss these funding problems.  Maybe they 
could meet on an airplane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have asked the solicitor general what he is doing about the 
problems with the violent crimes linkage analysis system in B.C. 
I have not received any answers.  I see today in newspaper 
reports that the Minister of Justice is now concerned that her 
youth justice proposals may be in jeopardy unless she can pry 
some money out of the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She did not seem so concerned about that last spring when she 
unveiled her proposals amid much fanfare and glossy brochures.  I 
have to wonder if this is just another example of a whole lot of 
talk and no action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now instead citizens are told that murderers are to receive life 
in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years only to learn 
later that there is a chance of parole in as early as 15 years. 
They are told that the government is getting touch on crime by 
increasing sentences only to discover the same government is 
reducing the period of eligibility for parole to only one sixth 
of the sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are told that the government is seriously interested in 
attacking organized crime.  Then they see drug dealing gang 
members serve their sentences at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have serious reservations over some provisions of this bill. 
Some elements are long overdue and that is a travesty in itself. 
Other aspects are a result of this government's again changing 
its own legislation within months because instead of getting it 
right the first time it waits until there is a public backlash. 
And in some cases this government once again only goes half way 
toward addressing the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless this legislation is amended in the areas of juvenile 
prostitution and conditional sentencing I will be opposing it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask my hon. colleague and friend this 
question.  Would he not deny that when we see the cutback in 
police forces across Canada, not just in his area but across the 
prairies as well, while at the same time we see a massive 
increase according to the newspapers in the amount of organized 
criminal activity, we are going in the wrong direction?  We 
should be building up our police forces, not cutting them back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would certainly agree 
with that.  We are certainly going in the wrong direction. All 
across the country people are asking for more public safety, more 
police on the streets and more protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The surge in gang organized crime on the west coast is 
phenomenal.  It is completely out of control. With the shutting 
down of the port police in Vancouver, with the problems at the 
airport, with the problems of drugs coming in, with the biker 
gang problems in Quebec, we are certainly going the wrong way. I 
think it is about time the solicitor general and the Minister of 
Justice got this through their heads and start doing what 
Canadians are asking for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to hear the member from the Reform Party 
speak because he speaks with compassion from what he knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member knows, we spend a lot of money in this 
country defending ourselves against the importation of contraband 
i.e. drugs and everything else. As I asked my question earlier to 
the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, I would now like 
to ask this member as well.  Would the member not agree that part 
of the solution would be to increase our foreign aid to third 
world countries that make this contraband we are talking about? 
We should hit it right at the source.  Would that not alleviate 
some of the problems we are facing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the question.  I would have to agree to a certain extent 
about what the member says but I would also agree with the member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough that we have to take care of 
the problems here at home first.  We have to do something about 
the importation of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is an international problem and I do not think we 
are going to solve it by ourselves by spending a lot of money on 
foreign aid.  I think it has to be a concerted attack on the 
international scene.  We have to deal with it more seriously at 
home and we have to start to address the importation and the 
major importers. We have to start looking at things such as 
possible life sentences for major importers with no parole for 25 
years and total confiscation of drug assets.  We have to start at 
the top. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that what the member is suggesting could be part of the 
solution but we have to deal with the problems here at home 
first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is the House ready for the question?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to say a few things on the Tobacco Act and the resolution of the 
government to make some changes to the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of years ago when I was an instructor at a technical 
institute, I remember having a number of students who took up the 
habit of smoking.  We all know that it is a habit that is very 
addictive.  In fact, of all the people I have spoken to over the 
years, and I am old enough to have spoken to a number of them who 
got hooked on this habit, a number of them have said to me that 
they wish they had never started because once you are hooked it 
is very difficult to stop.  It is almost as bad as eating.  Once 
you start eating it is very difficult to quit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over all the years I have spoken to people who smoke, I have 
never once encountered a single individual who suggested to me 
that I should start.  It is such a devastating thing for health 
reasons and also for costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On several occasions as a mathematics instructor I was able to 
persuade some of my students to stop smoking.  I did that by 
utilizing part of my curriculum in the math department.  Whether 
I was teaching computing and how to set up functions on a 
computer or whether I was teaching exponential functions, one of 
the things we did in the realm of math or finance was to talk 
about the future value of a deposit annuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I specifically remember one student who admitted to me that he 
smoked about one and half packs of cigarettes a day and that his 
wife smoked well over a pack a day.  Between the two of them they 
were putting almost three packs a day away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very costly to do this.  A lot of people look at the price 
of a package of cigarettes and think only of the present value of 
that.  However, as anyone who has ever sold RRSPs or anything 
else in terms of accumulating value can attest, value is greatly 
enhanced exponentially as one makes deposits over a long period 
of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not remember the exact numbers nor do I remember at the 
time what the prevailing interest rates were, but I remember my 
students when they were learning to use their electronic 
calculators, learning exponential functions and learning computer 
programming. I had the students compute the function 365 
multiplied by 5, if that was the price of cigarettes, multiplied 
by the nominal interest rate, say .1 because in those days it 
would have been around 10%, divide by, in big square brackets, 1 
minus 1.1 to the power of say 45, that number of course 
representing the number of years a student would work from age 20 
after finishing his or her degree and working until age 65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The students as part of their exercise computed the accumulated 
value of their cigarette money. If instead of putting the money 
into cigarettes they had put it into an RRSP, it came to, as I 
recall, $1.3 million with the assumptions that I used. I had a 
number of students tell me they were going to change. They said 
that instead of smoking and having nothing when they retire, they 
were going to put their $5 a day into a little box and once a 
month they were going to run it down to their RRSP agent and when 
they retired they would have $1.3 million on which to retire. 
That is the financial cost of smoking. 
We all know of the human and health costs.  There is absolutely 
no justification for people who get hooked on cigarettes.  They 
cannot justify it from a health point of view, not for themselves 
and not for those around them in their own household or in their 
office.  As a result we have seen in the last number of years a 
great increase in the number of buildings which have become 
non-smoking buildings because of the devastating health effects. 
One could probably see in the future a massive lawsuit against 
cigarette manufacturers.  They will be held legally responsible 
for the devastation they have caused, the early deaths that have 
been caused and the problems this has caused, not only to the 
lives of smokers, but also to the lives of their family members.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether it is going to come to that or not, but we 
have certainly had lawsuits of great magnitude in recent years on 
different issues.  Maybe that is going to come.  Maybe the 
cigarette companies are going to have to tally up one of these 
days and admit that they have caused a lot of devastation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the Liberal government that ever since we came to the 
House in 1993 this has been an issue.  Very little has been done. 
As a matter of fact, shortly after we arrived the government 
took the unusual step of reducing the tax on cigarettes.  Its 
claim was that this would reduce the criminal act of smuggling 
illegal cigarettes into the country.  If the price of cigarettes 
sold at the counter was reduced, then the motivation for 
smuggling would decrease and that would reduce smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that is a good principle.  If we were to take the 
logic of that principle and apply it to other areas I suppose we 
could legalize bank robberies, prostitution, theft, embezzlement 
and other things and, lo and behold, there would be no more 
crime.  It would be a wonderful way of fighting crime, just by 
declaring that everything we do that is wrong is not a crime any 
more.  Our jails would be empty and we could proclaim ourselves 
to be the most wonderful country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years successive governments have tried to reduce the 
amount of smoking by increasing taxes and, to a degree, they were 
effective.  I personally know people who, when the next tax 
increase kicked in, said “That is it for me.  That pushes the 
straw onto the camel's back.  That breaks his legs and I am not 
going to smoke any more”.  Increased costs in fact do act as a 
deterrent.  I believe that it was a total act of wimpishness on 
the part of the government.  Instead of enforcing the laws, it 
simply reduced the price so the criminals would of their own 
accord lose their profit motive and quit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not certain whether the whole act of smoking should be 
illegal.  This is a question one really needs to ask.  As long as 
cigarette smoking is legal in the country it is incredible that 
we should pass laws that would prevent a corporation from 
advertising a product which is legal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we have people advertising certain foods.  Maybe 
looking at me sideways, Mr. Speaker, you can tell how much weight 
I have lost.  I have tried to say no to food lately.  I do not 
want to do any free advertising, but that slim trim diet is 
working.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many products which may be harmful, but we do not take 
draconian measures to say they cannot be advertised.  If the 
government were really honest with Canadians, looking at the 
scientific evidence about the harmful effects of smoking on 
health, it would declare tobacco as a dangerous substance.  Then 
it would have moral and legal grounds for reducing and 
restricting the advertising of the product.  As long as it is a 
fully legal product, from the point of view of freedom of 
citizens and the freedom of companies to work in Canada, we have 
to ask that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time I recognize the vulnerability, especially of 
young teens, to the pressures of advertising.  As long as 
advertisers are able to make a product look exciting and 
youthful, as if all young people are doing it, as if all of our 
heroes are doing the smoking thing, it will look attractive and 
will draw more people in.  I think that more people begin smoking 
because of peer pressure than because of advertising.  That is 
just a guess that I am making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-42 is an attempt to solve the problem or at least to 
reduce the amount of smoking, by young people in particular.  The 
government is looking at a five year transition period on 
restrictions to advertising.  It has never been proven beyond a 
shadow of a doubt that advertising causes people to take up the 
habit of smoking, but this is what the government proposes to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This must be true confession time on nationwide television.  I 
have to blushingly admit to all people here and to anyone who 
happens to be listening out there that I did at one time smoke a 
cigarette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Did you inhale? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  I don't remember.  All I remember is that I 
found a package of cigarettes that was not completely empty.  Of 
course I never spent my hard earned money on them.  For some 
reason I felt an obligation to try it.  I did so all alone.  I do 
not believe I finished the cigarette that I took out of the 
package because it caused me to cough and wheeze and choke. 
Being a person who all my life had been somewhat given to an 
intelligent process of thought and analysis, I stopped and said 
this to myself:  Self, I think this is stupid.  It does not make 
any sense at all to take into one's body that which the body by 
natural means seems to so violently reject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think I finished that cigarette, although I do not 
really recall.  I am fairly old now and that probably happened 
about 50 years ago.  I do not recall what exactly happened, but I 
do know that I made the decision that I would not smoke 
cigarettes.  It had nothing to do with advertising.  It had 
nothing to do with peer pressure.  It had to do simply with an 
intelligent decision.  To this day I am very grateful that I made 
that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should take account of the fact that tobacco companies make a 
large amount of money.  One of the ironies that I find in 
government operations is that while on the one hand we are 
talking about the increased costs of health, on the other hand we 
are talking about the dangers to our young people and the need 
for us to protect each other and ourselves from ourselves, 
according to the Liberal government's philosophy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we are subsidizing and assisting farmers who 
produce tobacco products.  To be pushing and pulling on the same 
object at the same time seems rather schizophrenic, to say the 
least, and does not clearly show where one is headed.  The 
subject of assistance to the farmers who produce the product is a 
whole subject for another day.  It seems to me that we ought to 
rationalize this and at least be consistent in the various arms 
of government with respect to what we are trying to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not like to use the word hypocritical.  I know that it is 
against the rules to apply that term to any individual member of 
parliament.  I suppose that to collectively lay it on the feet of 
the governing party today is on the verge of being incorrect. 
But it is the only word that I really know.  If we look at the 
dictionary definition of hypocrite, from the root word it means 
that you are wearing a mask.  You are trying to pretend that you 
are something you really are not.  That is the definition of a 
hypocrite.  I hear the Liberal government say over and over that 
it is concerned about the health of Canadians and that it is 
concerned about the social impact of smoking, but at the same 
time it pours resources into the production of the product.  To 
me that it is hypocritical.  That is doing one thing with the 
hands while the face and the mouth are trying to give a different 
message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that we ought to approve this particular bill. 
We should be opposing it because of its lack of clarity.  It does 
not show a clear direction in terms of where this government is 
going on this particular issue.  It does not, in my opinion, have 
much hope of significantly changing what is happening in the 
world of smoking these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to see more and more is a really solid 
education component for all of our young people beginning in 
junior high. This should include actual visits to hospitals.  I 
have heard of young people who had relatives who got lung cancer. 
They had to visit those relatives.  They saw how they were 
breathing through a tracheal tube.  They saw how they were unable 
to speak because of throat cancer.  They saw firsthand the 
devastation.  Although I am not proposing that we try to shock 
our young people into an action or a decision, I believe that 
should be a part of the education process.  It should be a part 
of the experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government not undertake to produce some films that 
make some sense?  Quite often we hear criticisms of the National 
Film Board and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation about some 
of the garbage they produce using taxpayers' money.  Why do they 
not undertake to do a good, solid, medically based analysis on 
film and make it available at a cost that school boards can 
easily afford?  Make it available to the school boards.  Show it 
to children.  Maybe show it repeatedly to them.  I would like to 
include the health benefits of not smoking.  I would like to 
include the financial costs of taking up the habit versus 
entering into a savings program.  If all of the Liberal members 
when they were youths had learned how to save money maybe we 
would not have a $580 billion debt today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to stop thinking that way.  We need to start thinking in 
terms of saving our money instead of spending it on a habit which 
is statistically a proven killer. 
I certainly urge the government to not promote this type of 
action but to promote an action that will in reality affect our 
habits. For goodness sake, let us stop subsidizing the production 
of tobacco products.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, again I take great delight in listening to the the 
Reform Party member speak about his trials and tribulations when 
it comes to tobacco.   Although I cannot verify the actuality of 
it, the member mentioned subsidization for tobacco farmers. Every 
time I hear that I think of the Stompin' Tom Connors song and 
“my back still hurts when I hear that word, Tillsonburg”, a 
great tobacco growing area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member and his party not agree that if that were so, 
we would have to assist these farmers in the production of 
another crop?  Of course what is making the rounds these days and 
becoming popular is industrialized hemp which is non-cannabis. It 
would enable these farmers to grow an alternate crop which, as we 
know, is very good for the environment and very useful in various 
products such as paper and clothing.  Would the hon. member not 
agree that it would be an alternative for these farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to my knowledge the government 
has had a policy for a number of years, if not decades of 
assisting farmers who want to make the transition out of 
producing tobacco into producing other food crops.  If the same 
amount of money were made available, one could achieve the same 
goal and help the taxpayer at the same time by phasing out the 
subsidy for tobacco on a rational basis, perhaps cut it back 10% 
to 15% per year until it is gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had a decent competitive marketing system, these farmers 
should be able to thrive on the world markets with very superior 
Canadian products which we are producing.  Of course it would 
include things like a wheat board which is accountable and which 
allows some freedom for an individual farmer to grow and to sell 
the crop of his or her choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the subsidization of farmers growing tobacco I 
firmly believe that should be phased out relatively rapidly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-42 is an act to amend the Tobacco Act to provide a five year 
phased in transition period toward a total prohibition of tobacco 
sponsorship promotions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original Tobacco Act was assented to in April 1997.  I was 
one of the members in the House at the time.  I was pretty 
appalled by what was being done because it just was not tough 
enough even at that time.  Here we are a year and a half 
downstream and we are watering the whole thing down completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing is that under the original Tobacco Act the 
provisions were supposed to go into effect on October 1.  I noted 
last week when we were having a debate on this subject my 
colleague from the NDP, the hon. member for Winnipeg North 
Centre, raised the question at the end of her speech about what 
would happen if we had not passed this bill by October 1. To my 
knowledge the government still has not answered that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think any hon. person would think that until the bill is 
passed, we really should be enforcing the provisions of the act 
as it was passed before.  I hope there are people taking steps to 
do exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that it is a little bit silly, stupid in fact, 
for the government to continue to play fast and loose with the 
health of Canadians on this issue when there is already a 
shortage of money in the system for the sorts of diseases which 
are caused by smoking and are well known to be caused by smoking, 
such as heart disease and lung cancer.  Everyone knows there is 
simply not enough money in the system to treat these diseases 
already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime we have governments pandering to the tobacco 
industry.  Frankly, the average person cannot help but wonder how 
many of these decisions are based actually on the very close 
connections of the Prime Minister and the finance minister to 
people in the tobacco industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked a question of the finance minister in the House four 
years ago because of his association, having been on the board of 
directors of Imperial Tobacco.  For my level of comfort there is 
just a little bit too much of a close connection between the 
major Liberals on the front bench and the people in the tobacco 
industry.  It is well known that the Prime Minister plays golf 
with people from the tobacco industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this government is busy playing fast and loose with 
Canadians' health, other governments throughout the United States 
and Canada are getting tough on the tobacco companies.  In my own 
province of B.C., our attorney general Ujjal Dosanjh just 
recently announced, and I have a newspaper clipping here from 
September 28, that B.C. was monitoring the U.S. lawsuits down in 
Washington state against the tobacco companies with a view to 
using the same argument in the lawsuit which B.C. has taken 
against tobacco companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the tobacco companies argue that they contribute a lot 
to the coffers of the country in taxes and that is true.  However, 
the B.C. health minister on August 21 stated “It is no secret 
that B.C. receives $483 million a year in taxes from cigarettes, 
taxes that are paid by the consumers.  This amount comes nowhere 
near to covering the true costs to B.C.'s economy, an estimated 
$1.3 billion a year, to pay for the direct and indirect health 
and social costs paid by smokers and non-smokers alike”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an enormous burden upon the taxpayers and upon the 
health care system when we think of it.  There really is no 
excuse for pursuing this track of giving the cigarette companies 
carte blanche to continue to advertise and promote their product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 when I was first elected, the law that was in place and 
which was subsequently struck down by challenge from the tobacco 
companies restricted the advertising of tobacco at places of 
sale.  For example, corner stores could not put out signs 
advertising cigarettes and neither could gas stations.  I would 
often get calls at my riding office.  People who saw that a 
tobacco advertisement had appeared on the sidewalk in front of a 
corner store would call me.  I was in a position to call the 
owner of the store, explain the regulations and get that tobacco 
advertising taken inside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the tobacco companies were successful in striking 
down those provisions. Subsequent to that, we now see the 
proliferation of tobacco advertising on sidewalks and at gas 
stations. There has absolutely been an increase in the amount of 
smoking by young people since that time. It is beyond me 
completely that the government can pursue a policy that results 
in an increase in smoking by young people.  It simply does not 
make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tobacco of course is harmful in more ways than if we just smoke it. We 
know of a certain high profile person who used a cigar for a most 
unusual purpose.  Then of course there is chewing tobacco, which 
some people might choose to chew.  There has been promotion of 
this certainly at the corner stores in the Vancouver area. There 
are display stands of chewing tobacco.  There has been no 
promotion of cigars yet for the purposes mentioned earlier, but 
certainly chewing tobacco is on display. The advertisements make 
it a sexy, really upbeat sort of yuppie thing to do to chew 
tobacco.  It is disgusting to see people spitting out their wads 
of chewing tobacco on the sidewalks.  It is well known that 
chewing tobacco causes cancer of the mouth and the larynx. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is simply moving the problem around within the human body. 
We really should be moving toward the total banning of 
advertising as suggested by the Canadian Cancer Society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my colleagues from the PC Party last week read from a 
letter from the Canadian Cancer Society. He talked about several 
of the amendments and points that were suggested.  It is 
worthwhile reviewing some of those points. I will summarize the 
points that came from the Canadian Cancer Society which said that 
amendments were needed to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One, there should be a ceiling on tobacco company sponsorship 
promotion expenditures during the delay period.  In other words, 
if we absolutely have to have this delay period, please put a 
ceiling on the amount that the tobacco companies can spend so 
they cannot just blow away the bank, get all the nice tax 
deductions and get a whole bunch more young people addicted to 
the habit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two, during the first two year delay period, sponsorship 
promotion should be prohibited on the inside and outside of 
stores where tobacco is sold. 
That would take us back to before the 1995-96 era when there was 
a prohibition on that type of advertising.  It is a perfectly 
reasonable request.  It would not be imposing something that had 
not already been there before.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three, the Canadian Cancer Society suggests that the bill should 
be amended so that the two year and five year delay periods begin 
on October 1, 1998, which was a few days ago, and end on October 
1, 2000 and October 1, 2003, respectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present the way it is set up cabinet can decide the starting 
date.  If the Prime Minister is out with one of his golfing 
buddies and has a few extras at the 19th hole, he may decide that 
he is going to delay the starting date indefinitely.  Even 
passage of this bill may mean that we never have the ban on 
advertising that we are supposed to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four, the bill should be amended so that only events sponsored 
as of April 25, 1997 when the original bill was passed are 
allowed to continue with tobacco sponsorship promotions during 
the delay period. Why would that be a hardship?  We have already 
had the bill in place for a year and a half.  Let us not expand 
it.  Let us try to keep it as contained as we possibly can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five, the bill should be amended so that the grandfather 
provision applies only to events sponsored in Canada as of April 
25, 1997.  This again places a target date coincident with the 
royal assent of the previous Tobacco Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six, during the delay period, any sponsorship promotion should 
not be allowed to contain images of people, to be misleading, or 
to be conveyed through non-tobacco goods like T-shirts, baseball 
caps and so on. In other words, let us keep the promotion to the 
barest minimum instead of giving carte blanche approval for 
tobacco companies to go hog wild, spending an absolute fortune in 
the next couple of years with tax deductions and blowing their 
budget promoting like crazy and getting as many people addicted 
as they can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven, the bill should be amended so that only international 
auto racing events are able to have tobacco sponsorship during a 
further delay period and not all sponsored events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already know that special interest groups have been able to 
attract support from other companies than tobacco industries in 
the last year in anticipation of the act coming into force on 
October 1.  It really is not necessary to maintain tobacco 
sponsorship for all areas.  It should be reduced significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Cancer Society has put a lot of thought into the 
recommendations.  I did not read out all the details.  I know 
this was read into the record last week. The Canadian Cancer 
Society represents a very well-thought out position on this bill. 
Its representatives obviously do not go golfing with the same 
people as the Prime Minister does.  And neither have they used 
cigars for the purpose that other well-known person did. I would 
urge this House to take note of the provisions suggested by the 
Canadian Cancer Society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving on and associated with this tobacco bill, a few years ago 
we were trying to deal with the amount of tobacco smuggling that 
was occurring. A lot of the criminal activity surrounding drugs, 
tobacco and so on relates entirely to the porous nature of 
Canada's borders.  Our borders are so porous criminals can come 
and go at any time they like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the attorney general's own admission, about 18,000 criminals 
entered Canada last year under false documentation and were able 
to carry on criminal activities which would have included 
everything from the smuggling of tobacco, drugs and arms, to you 
name it. We should be dealing with these really serious problems 
rather than pandering to tobacco companies to allow them to make 
profits over the next couple of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Vancouver area, the head of the fraud investigations at 
Immigration Canada, Sergeant Rockwell, says that the problem of 
passport fraud in the Vancouver area is mind boggling.  He used 
the term mind boggling.  He estimates that the worst areas in the 
country are North Vancouver, which is my own riding, Surrey and 
Richmond. He estimates that the amount of passport fraud, 
allowing criminals into our country, is so large in those three 
areas that the communities have become blasé about it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just yesterday the <I>North Shore News</I>, my local newspaper, 
had a front page story saying it will no longer carry 
advertisements of lost passports because for eight years now it 
has been carrying advertisements of lost Iranian passports.  It 
identified them as Iranian passports.  There have been three or 
four per issue and there are three issues per week.  We are 
talking about 10 to 12 passports a week being advertised as lost 
in North Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason they are advertised as lost is those people 
sell the passports complete with the T-1000 form, is a 
landed immigrant form, so that they can be sent back to Iran to 
have a new photograph put in them and somebody can come here as a 
landed immigrant without any authority whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sgt. Rockwell tells me that on average these passports can go 
around 10 times before they are picked up.  When an illegal 
immigrant comes in using a false passport, looking like a legal 
landed immigrant, he goes immediately to the forger and sells the 
passport again to recover some of the money he paid in Iran and 
then the forger sends the passport back to Iran again so that 
another photograph can be put in it and it can do the circuit one 
more time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes on up to 10 times before the passport is so damaged 
that the immigration officials pick it up at the border.  Then of 
course they say let us check on this person whose name is in this 
passport and on this T-1000 form.  How did this passport get 
here? They visit the person concerned who says they lost that 
passport two years ago.  It is advertised in the <I>North Shore 
News</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the <I>North Shore News</I> carried the story 
yesterday.  It will no longer advertise these passports lost 
because it does not want to be party to this fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every single passport, it is right there in the story, that has 
been advertised lost in North Vancouver in eight years was 
Iranian.  Does it not strike anyone in the immigration department 
opposite a bit strange that in eight years the only people who 
ever lose their passports are legally landed Iranian immigrants? 
How strange. But in the meantime in Surrey it is mostly East 
Indian passports that are advertised lost, and in Richmond it is 
Chinese passports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This immigration minister would do very well to start getting on 
top of the problem because it is those people, those 18,000 
people a year coming into this country as criminals, who are 
getting involved in the sort of crime that smuggles tobacco that 
ends up on the black market, pandering and catering to this 
expansion of the use of tobacco that we talk about, getting our 
young people hooked and increasing criminal activity in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a disgrace that while we spend time in this House, hours 
and hours debating a piece of legislation to give tobacco 
companies carte blanche to spend money, to get people on to their 
addictive products, we have serious problems in Toronto, Montreal 
and Vancouver of criminals every day getting into this country 
through our porous borders with nothing we can do to stop them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am embarrassed that one of the main problem areas is my own 
riding and that I have been unable to do anything about it, the 
number of criminals, and that so easily it could be fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the immigration minister would have to do is make sure that 
when a new immigrant like me becomes a Canadian citizen the 
T-1000 form is taken out of the passport.  That is all she needs 
to do. It is so simple.  As soon as that is done the forger's 
power to send a genuine landed immigrant passport back to Iran, 
India or China is taken away.  That is all it would take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the minister says that for sentimental reasons we cannot do 
that, we might upset somebody.  They like to have the T-1000 form 
in there.  I say too bad. If somebody really has to have that 
form in there they could have a photocopy with a big red stamp on 
it saying invalid or something like to take care of the problem. 
Really it comes down to political will.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was political will to address the problem it would be 
addressed.  There is no political will on that side of the House 
to address an appalling situation just as there is no political 
will to address the appalling situation represented by this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People can openly cause our young people to be addicted to 
tobacco.  Because of this, we know that in 20 or 30 years from 
now there will be an increasing burden on our health care system 
and a lack of productivity as they come out of the workforce and 
have to be dealt with for heart disease and lung cancer that are 
direct results of this addiction to tobacco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been said many times before, I realize the sad fact that 
in this place we know how the votes will turn out long before the 
debates begin.  In fact, everything said here is almost 
irrelevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How sad that for all the work that was put into the 
recommendations of the Canadian Cancer Society, here in a letter 
to all MPs, not a word will be listened to, not one word will be 
taken any notice of because we already know how the vote will 
turn out on this bill.  How appalling that those people on that 
other side can sit there. I would say a goodly portion of them 
are sorry that this bill is going to go through but they will 
stand up and vote for it because they will not have the ability 
to vote against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame to see the amount of work that has gone into this 
by health professionals across the country, by people who can see 
the dangers in the passage of this bill, to be rejected outright 
by a dictatorial government that will force this issue through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close with one last appeal to people here.  If this would 
be just the first time ever that they would seriously consider 
this on the government side, please speak with the minister to 
get her to hold this bill up just a bit longer so we can consider 
it a bit more, so we can have the Canadian Cancer Society again, 
so we can have concerned professionals here to convince us that 
we should hold it off and incorporate many of the suggestions 
they have made. I urge all members to vote against this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this bill 
is one I felt had weakened previous tobacco legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wondered if the member could make a comment on the fact that 
the government collects $2,000 million in taxes from cigarettes 
and has promised to spend $20 million per year on measures that 
would reduce tobacco input by our youth; $2,000 million taken in 
and $20 million per year promised for interdiction for our kids. 
This year it looks like it has only spent $6 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member could make a comment about that in terms 
of priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member's question 
actually relates to the statement I made earlier about the 
statement made by the health minister in B.C. when she said that 
B.C. receives about $480 million a year in taxes from cigarettes 
but it costs about $1.3 billion in health care costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is applying in every province, the fact that the federal 
government collects $2,000 million in taxes really becomes almost 
irrelevant when one thinks of the enormous health costs which 
would be several times that.  If we used the same sorts of 
proportions, we are talking about several billion dollars in 
health care costs annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that tobacco still kills approximately three million 
people a year worldwide.  It is a major killer and we really 
should not be facilitating the use of this product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Montreal <I>Gazette</I> had a story on August 30 concerning 
this bill.  It said let's say a kid smokes, fresh young lungs 
headed for the long dirty road.  Why a young person smokes may 
involve a number of factors, to be part of a peer group, 
rebellion against parents and authority figures, striving for 
independence, the excitement of risk taking behaviour, weight 
control, stress relief, and the list goes on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So what do you do about that?  If parental guidance will not 
work, if the slick guys at the ad agencies are a lot better at 
selling cigarettes than selling clean living, how do we give our 
young people a chance to avoid the kind of addiction that is 
killing 40,000 Canadians a year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to pour some money into contradicting the advertising of 
the tobacco companies. The tobacco companies say they are not out 
to entice young customers to replace the ones who are dying off. 
I do not know how many exactly believe that, but they have said 
publicly that they want to help discourage that very thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may well laugh at that and I admit it makes me laugh but 
there is a way of making those companies put their money where 
their mouths pretend to be.  I know that Bill S-13 has been 
floating around this House and there has been a lot of support 
for that type of approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada collects about $l,000 in tobacco taxes 
for every dollar it puts into anti-tobacco initiatives.  Frankly, 
that is an insult. California's proposition 99 applied a 25 cent 
tax to every package of cigarettes sold and used in California 
and it used the money for inventive anti-tobacco programs. As a 
result young persons and adult smoking in California has dropped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a proven fact that where money has been put into 
advertising that discourages smoking it works and it really is a 
very sad commentary on the attitude of this government that it 
would put such a small amount of money into contradicting the 
tobacco advertising.

television network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Founded in 1984, TV5 is one of the world's leading satellite 
broadcasting networks and can reach nearly 68 million homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year, we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of TV5 Québec 
Canada. 
More than a mere celebration, it is the realization that TV5 
Québec Canada is becoming more and more important not only 
across this continent but also throughout the Francophonie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>TV5 is a new milestone in the cultural development of 
French-speaking countries and one of the Francophonie's greatest 
accomplishments. The Government of Canada supports the crucial 
role that our international network, TV5, plays and must 
continue to play.

acknowledge the efforts and many years of consistent work by 
Alain Bellerive, of Cap-de-la-Madeleine, a doctor in particle 
physics whose thesis has earned him a two-year contract with the 
European centre for particle physics research, the CERN, in 
Geneva. This centre brings together the finest scholars in the 
world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I take this opportunity to commend one of the smaller communities 
in my riding of Nunavut on it initiative and action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The residents of Whale Cove, numbering just over 300, are 
speaking out about violence against women.  More than 50 
concerned people marched the roads of Whale Cove to create 
awareness of the issue, carrying posters that were made by 
children.  This is a fine example of what can be done if the 
community as a whole takes on an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes this action even more notable is Whale Cove does not 
have the protective services of the RCMP.  It is served by the 
detachment in Rankin Inlet 100 kilometres away.  Sometimes Whale 
Cove has to wait for a response to its calls, depending on the 
seriousness of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to stop violence against women, and I am proud that even 
the small communities in Nunavut are taking a stand against this 
terrible crime in society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Canada pension plan is a key pillar of retirement 
income for many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To head off an approaching fiscal crisis in the plan the Liberal 
government is increasing payroll taxes by 73%.  Many interested 
parties including the Alberta Chamber of Commerce are convinced 
the CPP should include an option to invest mandatory 
contributions into individual retirement savings plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a media conference scheduled for later today I understand the 
Alberta Chamber of Commerce will call on the Alberta government 
to immediately commit to a provincial consultative process on 
options to the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An increasing percentage of the population is losing faith in 
the CPP and want the option of opting out in favour of their own 
mandatory retirement savings account, an option Reform has 
proposed.

Measures Act in 1970.  Those of us who regard Tommy as our mentor 
stand up now against the arrogance and the undemocratic spirit 
that pervade the government from its handling of APEC to the many 
other ways in which it seeks to crush dissent within its own 
ranks and within the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister should spend less time misusing the name of

the example of people like Tommy Douglas.

security conscious members of the cabinet, as does the Minister 
of Justice.  He needs to be trusted by our police, our

solicitor general destroyed that trust. He spoke of APEC, Frank 
Moores and a pork barrel project in his riding.  He cannot 
separate the private from the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is inappropriate behaviour on his part.  It is a firing 
offence. When will the solicitor general resign?

substantiated that those allegations were inaccurate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really wish that every member of the government was in their 
place right now to examine what they are about to do with this 
bill.  This five year phase-in on tobacco advertising will 
probably kill thousands of people and start thousands of more 
teenagers into an addiction habit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members opposite and those who want to support this bill 
would just sit for a moment.  Never mind the tobacco tax they are 
going to receive because they are going to lose all of it in 
extra health care.  Never mind the grant they are going to get or 
political patronage from the tobacco companies.  Let us just sit 
down for a moment this afternoon and ask ourselves is it worth 
it.  Is it worth it to see thousands of young people become 
addicted to the still massive advertising of the tobacco 
companies? The bill should not be phased in over five years.  The 
bill should come in now and everybody in the House would support 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Elk Island did not want to use the word 
hypocrisy.  I have to use that word for this reason.  When the 
government was faced with massive smuggling, what did it do? 
Instead of dealing with the smuggling, it said to the teenagers 
of Ontario and Quebec mainly we are going to drop the tax, we are 
going to lower the price of cigarettes, go ahead and smoke, you 
will not have to work a full hour on the lowest pay scale for one 
package of cigarettes, you can now get two or three packages.  So 
the in thing was to smoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government created the highest teenage level of smoking in 
Canada in years by its inability to look at an issue and say we 
are going to put our money into stopping the smuggling of 
cigarettes back into Canada. It did not want to do that. It 
created a double standard.  The rule of law did not apply in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Dryden, Ontario people could buy cigarettes for less than 
half of what they could a few miles away in Manitoba.  The 
government continues to justify that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member that we should have an educational 
program, taking all the money, all the revenue and putting 
programs into our schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell members about an incident in my life.  My brother 
was 49 years old.  I was 35 miles out of the office when the call 
came to go back to the office.  The message was that a 49 year 
old prince of a man had just died of lung cancer. Today I have 
another family member who is in serious trouble health wise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just think how many people in the next five years are going to 
become addicted because the government has more concerns about 
the filthy lucre it is going to get and the political patronage 
grants it is going to get from the tobacco companies than to face 
this issue square on.  Think about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government failed to recognize what the cancer societies 
said. It failed to recognize what the Health Association of 
Canada said.  No, the government has to do it its way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat in on a lung operation.  I sat in on a smoker's lung being 
removed.  A high tech camera should show that picture in every 
high school classroom in this country.  Watch them take out a 
gross lung, completely ruined by tar and nicotine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a bill that is not going to curb but will be phased 
in.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing the record of the government, it will never get truly 
phased in as long as there is kick-in under the table on 
political patronage and grants.  All people in Canada know that. 
The Canadian Cancer Society knows it.  Members on the government 
side know it and all hon. members know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tobacco has many defenders but, no matter what, nobody can come 
up with a defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immediately the government has shied away from what it promised. 
This is not what it promised.  It promised it would bring about 
an immediate change in encouraging the use of tobacco and it 
would stop this.  The hypocrisy continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-42 is the height of hypocrisy.  No matter what hon. 
members want to say, no matter what gestures they make, the 
public knows that this is hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government zealously defends health by publicly attacking 
tobacco companies verbally, but not so realistically.  It is 
still going to take the tax and the political donations and it is 
still going to be the cause of hundreds of young people becoming 
addicted to cigarettes in the next five years.  The government 
and the Minister of Health cannot deny that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health is in a very uncomfortable position with 
this bill.  Go ahead and collect the large revenues and spend 
less than 1% on public advertising for our youth not to become 
addicted.  That in itself is an act of hypocrisy of the highest 
degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health can tell us that the revenue they take in 
from tobacco does not even cover the cost of the medical problems 
caused by tobacco, let alone providing any educational material 
to put into our schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hypocrisy in this bill, in not dealing with one of the 
biggest problems facing the health of Canadians, is to phase it 
in over five years.  Even if 10% of those kids who are now 12 
years of age become addicted simply because of the inability of 
this bill to do what Canada wants it to do, then the fault will 
surely fall on the government opposite.  It has to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is phasing this in over a five year period and is 
still allowing limited advertising and the whole bit.  However, 
when it needs more money, does anyone know what it will do? 
Canadians know what it will do.  It will make amendments down the 
road in about three or four years and will go over the whole 
process again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have lost relatives to tobacco.  I have seen many young people 
destroy their lives with tobacco.  I have seen an adult of only 
30-some years of age, addicted in his teens, laying in a hospital 
bed.  How can hon. members opposite sit there and support a bill 
that is going to be phased in?  I cannot understand it and I do 
not think they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know they say they received a letter on their desk which told 
them to support the bill, but let each member examine themselves. 
Let every member who votes in this House examine themselves. 
Let them take a look at a brother dying of throat cancer at 49 
years of age because there was no program.  They are not 
justifying it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to have a twin brother.  The same fate awaits him 
because we did not have the medical knowledge that the hon. 
Minister of Health has now.  We did not have all of the medical 
knowledge from the Canadian Cancer Society. 
We did not have thousands of people who were deadly against this 
bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member has certainly spoken in very strong terms about this bill. 
It is clear that he feels very emotional about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member elaborate on why he believes that not just this 
government but governments over the past several years have 
refused to take a tough stand on this issue when we have known 
for some time through scientific evidence that this addiction is 
deadly and that children are taking up the addiction because of 
advertising? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also ask the member to elaborate on the comments he made 
surrounding his belief that there are several people on the 
government side who would vote against this bill if they were 
given the chance to do so.  I would like him to explain clearly 
what he means by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will respond to the latter 
part of the hon. member's question first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that people on that side of the House, as well as on 
this side, if they are given the opportunity to do some soul 
searching, and if that soul searching is strong enough and rises 
above the party's position, will vote this bill down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect hon. members on the other side of the House and I know 
how many of them want to vote.  They have told me how they want 
to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the other part of the question, it has been 
proven beyond a doubt that more advertising, more accessibility 
and a cheaper product increases consumption.  All it does is 
bring about more death.  It brings about more addiction.  The 
fault, as we look at the five year phase in period, will hang 
very heavily on some people's shoulders.  It will be on the 
shoulders of the people who vote yes for this tobacco bill.  Make 
no mistake about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Abraham Lincoln said about liquor, it has many defenders, 
but so far nobody has come up with a defence.  I would challenge 
anyone on either side of this House to realistically study Bill 
C-42 and come up with one good defence as to why we should 
continue to advertise tobacco products and make them available 
over the counter.  I know they have taken strong action, but the 
fact is that I cannot go to any high school in my riding and not 
see youth smoking, despite what they are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this phase in period, all they are doing is asking them to 
continue in dribbles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My conscience, and I am sure the conscience of many members, 
both in the back and front rows, will say that Bill C-42 is a 
mistake.  Take it back to the drawing board and come up with 
something that is saleable to Canadians and to all the health 
organizations in Canada who do not think kindly of this bill 
being passed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member made another comment that I would like him to 
elaborate on, and that is that he believes that the portion of 
this bill that is supposed to be phased in will never happen.  I 
have heard others in the debate make that comment as well.  They 
believe that the phase in will never happen, that the government 
will back off on this once again, as it did on the original piece 
of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the 
question.  As long as the profits from the tobacco industry 
contribute to the revenue of this government, or of any 
government, without going directly to health care or directly to 
education, then it is going to be wiggled around forever because 
it likes to get its hands on money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, as long as the tobacco tycoons are able every four 
years to shovel a whole bunch of money into the coffers of this 
party or any other party, this bill will never become a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure members from experience that this bill will never 
become a reality because the government always wants money and it 
just loves political patronage from tycoons in the tobacco 
industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
to respond to the hon. member for Souris—Moose Mountain, it is 
clear that his emotional involvement in this issue has clouded 
his usual judgment and has led him to speak excessively, 
inappropriately and inaccurately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put aside the inappropriate and excessive remarks, some 
of which were clearly out of order.  But let me deal with the 
inaccuracies because it is important that the record be set 
straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before the House strengthens the Tobacco Act which 
already is the toughest in the western world.  When I was in 
Geneva last June at the World Health Organization a number of 
countries asked me for a copy of our legislation.  They want to 
copy it.  This is the most intelligent and effective anti-tobacco 
legislation in the western world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-71, which as passed by this House a year and a half ago, 
provided for promotion by tobacco companies forever, although it 
was limited.  This bill goes further.  It prohibits sponsorship 
and promotion by tobacco companies altogether within five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Medical Association said “We are pleased that 
health minister Rock has recognized the need for a full ban”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Cancer Society, through its spokesperson Rob Cunningham, said 
“A total ban on sponsorships is an important improvement to the 
act, one that we strongly support”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Garfield Mahood of the Non-Smokers' Rights Association said “We 
are pleased the government has finally recognized the need for a 
complete sponsorship ban”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary <I>Herald</I> wrote “The new legislation is workable 
and defensible”.  I could go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public, the spokespersons, the informed members of the public 
in this country support the government.  The step we have taken 
will end sponsorship by tobacco companies within five years and 
that is very much in the interests of the health of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad the minister has 
come into this debate saying that it is most progressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister not agree, and I know that he will, that 
phasing in something of this nature does not work?  It has never 
worked in this country and it is not going to work now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is a good thing to bring about a total ban on cigarette 
and tobacco advertising in the year 2003, what is wrong with a 
total ban in 1998?  That is what Canadians are asking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the Minister of Health that a lot of people will lose 
their lives to cancer during those five years and the guilt is 
going to lie on those people who support this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will respond to that. 
The member speaks as though the bill is the only step we are 
taking in relation to tobacco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill represents a few sections in a statute which is 
elaborate, comprehensive and powerful.  It empowers the 
government to regulate tobacco as a product.  It makes it an 
offence to sell tobacco to kids under age 18.  It puts the 
tightest restrictions on advertising as well as dealing with 
sponsorship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member ought not to pretend that Bill C-42 is the only step 
we are taking against tobacco.  It is a small part of a large 
strategy.  I remind the member that the government will also be 
spending $100 million and enormous energy over the next five 
years to persuade young children not to smoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a 13 year old daughter and two 11 year old sons and I am 
as concerned as anyone that they not become addicted to tobacco. 
I will take every step I can to ensure that they do not.  I want 
the help of governments across the country in achieving that 
objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want the member to pretend that this is all, because it 
is only part of a very large strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. minister 
has spoken.  He said that they will spend $100 million on 
education programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I come from people have an expression “Put your money 
where your mouth is”.  How much money will the government take 
in revenue every time it spends $100 million in five years?  The 
problem is that a very small percentage of the revenue taken is 
being spent on educational purposes to prevent smoking.  Yet they 
are filling the coffers of the government on the backs of healthy 
young people and are spending a mere percentage of what is taken 
in.  That is why— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Just like question 
period, when your 35 seconds are up your time is up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That last exchange was getting fairly close to innuendo which 
was not strictly parliamentary.  I was listening to it, but I 
want to make the point that at no time were any comments made 
that were specifically directed to specific individuals.  In the 
opinion of the Chair there was nothing in any of the exchanges 
which was out of order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise today after the recent exchange.  It is nice to 
have a minister in the House.  He is looking rather relaxed and 
cool these days.  We have not been after him very much, but that 
too will change.  He can obviously pose a question as well.  It 
was nice to see that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here to talk about Bill C-42, the bill to amend the 
Tobacco Act.  It provides a five year phased in transition period 
toward a prohibition of tobacco sponsorship promotion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents in Lethbridge have talked to me about the bill. 
They are concerned with keeping harmful products, particularly 
tobacco, away from youth.  I received a number of letters, phone 
calls and visits to my office indicating that we have to keep our 
kids away from this stuff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tobacco comes in many forms.  Chewing tobacco has become 
popular.  When I think back to when I was a youth I smoked for a 
number of years.  I do not smoke now.  I have not smoked for 12 
or 15 years.  Some days around here I am about half an hour away 
from starting again, but I hope I never do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still remember the flashy full colour ads on the back of 
magazines and billboards such as the Marlboro man.  More and more 
the advertising was scoped to youth.  Tobacco companies saw where 
their future was and they targeted them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance when the bill was introduced we felt it was 
good, that the bill would restrict advertising to young people 
and help protect the youth of Canada.  As we started to study it 
and see the phase in part of it and the fact that there is no 
firm date to start, it began to lose some of its lustre. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains that tobacco companies are huge, powerful 
forces in the world. They have lots of money.  They can crank up 
advertising agencies across North America to target whomever they 
wish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it has been said that advertising on Formula One race 
cars is one of the most highly visible places in the world to 
advertise.  It attracts young people.  The fact that the bill was 
introduced was great, but on the one hand the government is 
trying to show that it cares about health and about young people 
and on the other hand is still taking tax money from the sale of 
tobacco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has slowed down the process so that it could keep 
the revenue flow going while still looking like it is championing 
this act.  As originally intended it was good and it would have 
done what we wanted.  Slowly it has looked to us like the 
government is dragging its feet and will not move on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked with people in convenience stores and corner 
markets who sell cigarettes.  They do not have a problem with any 
legislation.  Some good legislation has been brought in so that 
they cannot sell tobacco to minors.  The other day a person 
indicated that it was an offence if young people asked for the 
price of cigarettes and it was given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lots of things have been done.  To do that on one end and still 
allow the phase in time for advertising just does not add  up. If 
we are serious about keeping these products away from our young 
people and if we are serious about the health of Canadians, let 
us start as soon as we can.  Let us not extend this phase in 
program and let us do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding education, the minister said that $100 million over 
the next period of time would be spent to educate young people on 
the hazards of smoking.  The hon. member who spoke before me 
referred to the personal tragedy he saw because of cigarette 
smoking in his family.  I think we can relate to that.  We have 
all had family, friends or neighbours who have suffered because 
of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Smoking is an addiction and something not to expose our children 
to, but it is a product that can be legally bought when someone 
becomes 18.  I guess there are ways of getting them before then. 
To allow the advertising, to encourage it to happen, is wrong. We 
should work very hard in our approach to changing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party certainly would support protection for youth 
from being targeted for tobacco products.  We would encourage the 
government to have another look at it and to implement its 
policies as quickly as it can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the whole public relations aspect of what is happening 
whereby the government has legislation before us that would keep 
tobacco out of the hands of children.  It is making a lot of 
noise about the subject, but it is taking a long time to 
implement it.  In the meantime it is still reaping benefits from 
the sale of tobacco.  We would like to see this aspect changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister were serious about the legislation, he would put 
it into motion.  Let us not move the deadline to start 
implementation further and further away.  Let us get it into law 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the whole sponsorship agreement, advertising can be 
targeted to any sector of society.  We can target young people. 
We can target the baby boomers, whomever we wish. There are ways 
to poll people to find out what people are interested in.  The 
agencies can design advertising to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as adults are concerned, if I choose to start smoking 
tomorrow, who will stop me besides my own personal thoughts? 
However we have to help our young people today realize that 
smoking is causing problems.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I go to quite a few rodeo events during the summer and I see 
young people with a round can of chewing tobacco in their back 
pocket.  It gets to become a trademark: if you have one of those 
you are macho.  Where does the idea come from that chewing 
tobacco is cool?  It comes from advertising.  We saw a few years 
ago the different forms in which this product was packaged to 
appeal to young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a picture of a cancerous lip or a young man or woman 
with throat cancer or stomach cancer from this stuff.  Let us 
make them aware that aside from the glorified side that is 
advertised and portrayed there is a side that is dangerous and 
can harm them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that if the legislation moves forward and prohibits 
advertising directed at youth the answer would be to do it 
quickly.  The phased in program leaves it open to interpretation. 
While the government is holding off from implementing the 
legislation it continues to reap the benefits of tobacco sales. 
Let us stop that aspect of it.  Let us truly target advertising 
directed at young people and get on with the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the comments of my hon. colleague and would like to ask him a 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the speech I made earlier I indicated that the government was 
cowardly in bringing in legislation which limits the advertising 
of cigarettes.  It is something that I agree with in principle. I 
do not think we should be allowing a process that encourages 
young people to start smoking.  However, the government is 
cowardly in doing that without also declaring that tobacco is a 
dangerous substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By labelling it so, the government would then have the moral and 
legal right to actually limit that advertising.  Otherwise it 
runs into the question of being challenged under the human rights 
protection act or whatever in terms of limiting freedom of speech 
when it says to a company that produces and markets a legitimate 
product that it cannot advertise its product.  Presumably the 
product is 100% legitimate.  It is even subsidized by the 
Government of Canada.  It seems to me that there is an anomaly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member for Lethbridge comment on that?  Would he also 
favour declaring it a dangerous substance and going all out to 
stop this cancer on our society, with a pun intended there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Elk Island.  It is a dangerous substance.  We can call it 
whatever we wish, but the proof is in that it does cause disease. 
It causes all kinds of problems, lung problems and cancer.  I 
believe most of the product is labelled today to indicate that 
smoking cause lungs cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one hand to label the product and try to discourage the use 
of it but on the other hand to allow glitzy advertising through 
any means possible to get the word out that it is there and is to 
be used is a conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is right.  We say it is a dangerous product and 
label it as such because it contains all things that will hurt 
people.  There are warnings on the packages that pregnant women 
should not smoke and that it will cause lung cancer.  Then let us 
realize that and not allow advertising of a dangerous product.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier we heard the Minister of Health speak on this bill. He 
talked about how good it was, how people from other countries are 
singing the praises of this bill and how it is to be duplicated, 
replicated by other nations, that they are clamouring at the 
doors for this piece of legislation.  While perhaps well 
intentioned, I do not agree with the premise in his argument that 
this bill goes far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former teacher I taught grade seven students for a number 
of years.  Sadly, a number of them did start smoking at the very 
young ages of 10, 11 and 12 years old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague think this bill goes far enough and quickly 
enough to make the necessary changes to stop young people from 
getting involved in this habit which is so devastating? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I might have alluded to 
that somewhat in my presentation.  When we first saw this 
legislation come through we felt that this would stop the 
advertising.  As we got into it, we realized that there was a 
phase-in period. The time when it will start has not been set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to move quickly.  Every day that goes by is a day lost 
to stop this practice.  We should do it, but we should it now. 
This phase-in time is not necessary.  If we are serious about 
protecting young people, then let us get serious and do it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to the 
debate. Frankly anyone watching this debate would wonder whether 
or not the members who have been speaking actually understand 
what this legislation is intended to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It amends the most progressive legislation in the western world 
and it creates an ultimate ban on sponsorship promotion within 
five years.  That is applauded and lauded by all of those who 
know that Canada has had an enviable record worldwide.  That 
should be acknowledged by the members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will they not stand and acknowledge the progressive record 
of this government in dealing with these important issues of 
public policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, something that will 
probably not happen is for us to stand in this place and 
congratulate the government on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made the point previously. If we are going to be serious about 
the health situation, if we want to be the big leaders in the 
world, and the government claims it is, then let us get serious 
about it.  Let us not say that we are going to have a five year 
phase-in period.  From when?  It should have started years ago. 
It should be in effect right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe it is the most progressive bill, but it is progressing 
further and further down the line.  If the government wants to be 
the guardian of all that is righteous, it should start doing that 
right now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have been involved in the business of education for a 
number of years.  I am surprised with the advertising and the 
means by which young people are getting tobacco products. Does my 
hon. colleague not see that there are more and more young people, 
particularly young girls, smoking cigarettes now than there was 
during my time in the field of education? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes there is.  It is 
obvious from the stats, and it is especially young girls. It is 
all part of the strategy that has been put in place to attract 
certain sectors of our society to smoke. We have seen this 
increase recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation should be implemented as quickly as possible. 
Had the five year phase-in program started a year ago, we would 
have been into it.  We should not have the phase-in period. 
There is no firm date established by the government as to when 
that five years will start. It is important that we start as soon 
as we can.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder why the government is so reluctant to take a 
strong stand on tobacco use.  Why does it not bring forward 
legislation that is really progressive in the idea of not only 
preventing smoking, but to absolutely outlaw advertising totally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose industry giants, corporations are influencing the 
government.  I think this is one issue where the average Canadian 
would stand behind the government and say that this time the 
corporations do not get their way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tobacco farmers of southern Ontario can grow tremendous 
crops, healthy crops such as vegetables and grains that do some 
good for Canadians.  In the hon. member's opinion, should the 
government choose the health of Canadians over the corporations 
in this case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before the member 
for Lethbridge responds, I remind everyone to please address 
questions and comments to each other through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, absolutely, the average 
Canadian relies on the government for those types of things.  Far 
too many times the government is worried about getting into other 
areas, but basic health, basic protection are things Canadians 
should expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we are facing a crisis in the agricultural sector.  My 
colleague from Selkirk—Interlake is very well aware of that. We 
have had discussions in our caucus over the last few days about 
exactly what can be done. The government needs to be involved in 
some areas and it does not need to be involved in other areas. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
going to make a very short intervention on this bill.  We have 
heard debate on the bill.  I was very pleased earlier to see the 
Minister of Health get involved in the debate.  I am going to ask 
the minister to get involved again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health 
say that this legislation will eventually lead to an ultimate 
ban.  She used those terms.  I have a concern, because while the 
government is talking tough, we have seen absolutely nothing from 
the government.  We do not know whether it is going to carry 
through.  I think it is accurate to say that this is the first 
time in Canadian history we have seen a government actually back 
off and get weaker in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see the minister's real commitment on this 
issue.  I really want to test the minister's commitment and ask 
him two questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister direct all revenue from tobacco, or at least 
any extra revenue that his government will receive as a result of 
the phase-in as opposed to immediate implementation, not to 
general revenue but to prevention and health care?  That is the 
first question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question I would like the minister to respond to is 
will the minister pledge that his party and all candidates in the 
next federal election and any byelection will not take a penny 
from the tobacco lobby or individuals involved in the tobacco 
lobby? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  This is certainly an 
interesting twist on debate.  Before we get too far into it, I 
would ask members again to address each other through the chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member is terribly wrong.  He said that this government has 
done nothing, yet when the Supreme Court of Canada invalidated 
the old Tobacco Act, struck it down, said it was invalid, the 
former Minister of Health, the one who preceded me, introduced 
the Tobacco Act.

the hands of kids.  In addition, the Tobacco Act that was passed 
in this place in April 1997 permitted tobacco companies to 
continue sponsoring events and putting their names in front of 
the public.  It would have allowed them to do that forever, 
although only on the bottom 10% of signs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member suggested that the bill now before the House weakens 
that act.  It does anything but.  It strengthens the act by 
introducing the notion that in five years tobacco companies will 
have to stop altogether sponsoring and promoting events.  The 
member has it wrong.  We are doing the right thing.  He should 
support this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know this is not 
question period.  I know the minister does not have to answer but 
I appreciate his getting up on questions and comments to make 
some comments.  I asked two questions.  If the minister is going 
to respond, he should answer those questions.  Canadians would 
really appreciate hearing his response to those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister commit any extra revenue his government will 
get as a result of the phase-in as opposed to immediate full 
implementation to prevention and health care to deal with the 
problem?  Will he commit that any candidate running for the 
Liberal Party at the time of the next election or any candidate 
running in a byelection will not take one penny from the tobacco 
lobby?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have been listening to this debate and noting the great passion 
expressed by the members on the other side in their concern for 
children's health.  This is somewhat contradictory and puzzling 
in relation to their positions on other issues that affect 
children's health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, many experts say that climate change will have a 
greater impact on children's health than it will have on any 
other demographic age group. Yet members opposite seem to have 
the official stand on climate change that it does not exist.  I 
wonder how on one issue they can be concerned about the health of 
children, yet on another very important issue on which there is a 
consensus by people around the globe the member's party seems to 
object. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate this 
question and I mean that so sincerely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We stood here in the House in the last session when the Kyoto 
deal was being talked about and we asked the environment minister 
time after time, day after day to show the study the government 
is basing Canada's position on that indicates man plays any role 
in climate change and to bring that evidence forward. We wanted 
to see it and we still want to see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about the harm from climate change.  We know 
that climate change has happened throughout history. We know from 
records that have been left that climate change has happened. 
However, when it comes to evidence that man plays a significant 
role in any way in climate change, I would like the member to 
cite her sources so I can look into this evidence as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I apologize 
sincerely to this House for heckling but as I indicated in my 
heckling I find it rather disturbing that the members of the 
Reform Party can choose the issues they feel are important in 
terms of children's health while they ignore a whole pile of 
other issues that affect children's health.  They can be quite 
happy about regulating on certain kinds of issues that affect 
children's health but they choose to ignore a whole pile of other 
issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be more than happy to drown the member on the opposite 
side with volumes and volumes of evidence on the effects of 
climate change and how it would impact on children and our 
grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I could suggest that the hon. member contact the 
Canadian Institute of Children's Health and it could provide all 
kinds of detail for that member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by 
asking the member who did not respond by giving me even one 
single source— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, with 
all due respect, this is not question period, this is debate. The 
member opposite has inappropriately— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is not a point 
of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, of course the member 
does not have to respond.  It is not question period.  We do not 
get responses in question period anyway, quite frankly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made a point that climate change would do this and 
that.  Is the climate change she is anticipating global warming 
or global cooling?  The sources are pretty evenly matched on that 
issue.  They do not know whether the climate change is likely to 
be global warming or global cooling.  I asked her to cite just 
one solid reference, one source for this information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we asked this in question period dozens of times and during 
the debate on Kyoto before and after Canada took its position. 
Again, she has refused to give even one reference.  I guess that 
shows where this debate is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. 
member was not listening.  As I said, I am more than happy to 
drown the hon. member in paper.  There is one very good source, 
the Canadian Institute of Children's Health. There is not just a 
single source but a whole network of people working on children's 
health issues and environmental health issues and showing a link 
between those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be more than happy to give the member hundreds of 
sources on this issue.  I point something out to the member 
opposite. I said climate change.  I know that for some members in 
this House this is a very difficult and complex issue to 
understand.  Climate change means climate change.  It means that 
in some parts of our country it will be cooler and in some parts 
of our country it will be a lot warmer and hotter.  It is called 
climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the climate heats up out west, because the Reform Party 
refuses to acknowledge the fact of global climate change, it will 
find that its votes have all burned up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, she really does not know 
which way this climate change is going.  I certainly acknowledge 
the climate will change, it has changed throughout history. I 
have no problem acknowledging that at all nor do I believe any 
member of the Reform Party would have any problem acknowledging 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that is happening and will continue to happen.  What is 
important is to get some good evidence as to man's impact.  I 
welcome very seriously her offer to send some good documentation 
that this is happening.

am pleased to rise in the House today to speak to Bill C-40. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill overhauls extradition laws in Canada and creates a 
modern, effective system for extradition appropriate for the 21st 
century.  It will help us to better meet our international 
commitments and ensure that Canada is not a safe haven for 
criminals seeking to avoid justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Extradition Act, which is of general application, and the 
Fugitive Offenders Act, which applies to the extradition process 
between Commonwealth countries referred to as rendition, both 
date from the late 1800s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from amendments to the extradition appeal process enacted 
in 1992, these statutes have remained essentially unchanged from 
the last century. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Extradition laws as they now stand cause serious problems, as we 
are unable to turn over criminals to countries with which we do 
not have extradition agreements or treaties; to entities other 
than a state, such as United Nations tribunals for war crimes; 
or to countries where extradition treaties are in force but 
where an outdated list of offences does not include modern 
offences like drug trafficking, money laundering and computer 
crimes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current extradition process places onerous evidentiary 
requirements on foreign states and the legislation does not set 
out clear and adequate procedural and human rights safeguards for 
persons whose extradition is being sought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the increasing ease of international travel, the 
advancement of technology and the global economy, major crime and 
criminals are no longer local in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transnational crime and criminals are now the norm, not the 
exception. 
Canada's laws must be modernized in recognition of that reality.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen in the last few years a number of cases where 
Canada's extradition laws have not been sufficient to enable 
Canada to fulfill its international obligation and expeditiously 
extradite fugitives to other countries in order to face justice. 
The problem has been most acute in respect of countries of a 
different legal tradition such as those in Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of a number of requests from countries other than 
the United States extradition proceedings cannot be instituted. 
In other instances states are so discouraged by the different 
hurdles imposed by our current extradition law that they do not 
even initiate an extradition request. The primary problem is that 
the current legislation mandates that the foreign states submit 
evidence in support of their request in a form which meets the 
complicated requirements of Canadian evidentiary rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For countries which do not have a common law system, and for 
which concepts such as hearsay are unknown, this requirement 
makes the preparation of a request for extradition a tremendously 
difficult task, and in some instances an impossible one.  Even 
with countries with a similar legal tradition such as the United 
States, we have heard on numerous occasions how difficult it is 
to obtain extradition from Canada. In the context of our other 
common law jurisdictions such as Great Britain and Australia, 
Canada's system is viewed as one fraught with difficulties due to 
the antiquity of our legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With global crime becoming a significant concern at home and 
internationally, we know that the deficiencies in our legislation 
will continue to be questioned.  Within the G-7 P-8 forum for 
example, states have been requested to modernize their 
extradition laws in order to be responsive to the challenges of 
today's transnational crimes and criminals.  All the fora which 
have considered the serious problem of transnational organized 
crime have identified extradition as a critical tool to combat 
this growing threat to world order.  In the P-8, the United 
Nation and within the Commonwealth there have been calls for 
countries to put in place a comprehensive, effective and modern 
process for extradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of Canada's antiquated extradition laws and the 
magnitude of the changes necessary to modernize our current 
process for extradition, an entirely new proposed extradition act 
was drafted, amalgamating and substantially adding to the 
provisions of the current Extradition Act and the Fugitive 
Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important feature of this bill is that it will allow for 
extradition not just to states but to the United Nations war 
crimes tribunal and any future entities of this nature, including 
the proposed international criminal court, the statute for which 
was recently adopted by the United Nations diplomatic conference 
in Rome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will enable us to fulfill our international 
obligations to comply with the United Nations security council 
resolution establishing the international criminal tribunals for 
Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.  According to these resolutions 
we have to provide assistance and surrender fugitives to the 
tribunals if so requested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our law now stands, we could be in breach of our obligations 
as members of the United Nations if persons sought by either 
tribunal were located in Canada and we were not able to 
extradite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to allowing for extradition to the international 
criminal courts or tribunals, Bill C-40 will apply to all 
requests for extradition made to Canada.  Unlike our current 
limited extradition regime, the new scheme allows for extradition 
on the basis of bilateral and multilateral treaties, or where the 
state or entity making the request is designated as an 
extradition partner in a schedule to the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It also permits the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister 
for International Trade to enter into a specific agreement for 
extradition with any state or entity on a case by case basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will also apply to all requests for extradition made by 
Canada to a foreign state. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize three particular aspects of the bill, 
as they mark the most significant step toward modernizing our 
extradition procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, one of the worst problems with the current 
extradition process in Canada has to do with the complexity of 
the evidentiary requirements imposed on foreign countries filing 
requests for extradition with Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many countries, especially those with a legal tradition 
different from ours, it is extremely difficult to collect all 
the extradition documents required under Canadian rules of 
evidence. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new bill the legal standard for extradition would be 
retained.  That is, a Canadian judge will still have to be 
satisfied that there is sufficient evidence before her or him of 
the conduct underlying the request for extradition which, if it 
occurred in Canada, would justify a trial for a criminal offence. 
Lawyers like to refer to this as the prima facie test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would be modified is the form of evidence that could be 
presented to the extradition judge.  This approach addresses the 
current difficult evidentiary requirement for first person 
affidavits devoid of hearsay, which is the main problem 
encountered by states requesting extradition from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experience tells us that it is already extremely difficult for 
states to meet the prima facie case standard through the use of 
first person affidavits in relation to certain types of modern 
day crime; for example, complicated fraud.  With the increasing 
complexity of transborder and international crime, it will be 
more so in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said earlier, under the current system some countries 
simply decide not to seek the extradition of fugitives because 
they cannot comply with our current legal requirements.  Those 
fugitives, therefore, remain at large in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new legislation the judge would admit into evidence 
documentation contained in a record of the case.  The record 
would contain evidence gathered according to the rules and 
procedures followed in the requesting state.  It may contain a 
summary of the evidence available prepared by the appropriate 
foreign judge or official.  The evidence may not be in the form 
of an affidavit and may be unsworn.  The objective is to accept 
the evidence in the form used by the foreign state, provided it 
is sufficient according to a Canadian extradition judge to 
demonstrate criminal conduct under Canadian law and to require a 
trial in the requesting state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This record of the case would be certified by appropriate 
authorities in the requesting state and accompanied by certain 
assurances in relation to issues such as the availability of the 
evidence, its sufficiency for prosecution purposes or its 
accuracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion of a record of the case is consistent with the recent 
Supreme Court of Canada decision on hearsay in which the supreme 
court abandoned the strict formalism of the hearsay rule to adopt 
a more flexible standard based on necessity and circumstantial 
guarantee of trustworthiness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some respects, therefore, the existent evidentiary 
requirements for a Canadian extradition hearing are more 
formalistic and onerous than those for a Canadian trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following a careful consideration of other options, we concluded 
that the record of the case should be available to all foreign 
states irrespective of their legal system.  The minister believes 
that the “record of the case for all states option” is the best 
compromise between the present impractical evidentiary 
requirements and the absence of any judicial assessment of the 
evidence, as is presently the procedure followed in Australia and 
the United Kingdom in respect of its European partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this option the legal test would not change.  What would 
change, however, is the form in which that evidence would be 
acceptable in a Canadian court. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-40 also includes a number of improvements and safeguards. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT69"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT69"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1620

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, when he submits an extradition request so that the person 
sought can be tried, the competent prosecutor will have to 
certify in Canada that the summarized evidence is available for 
the trial and is sufficient, in a common law system for example, 
for prosecution purposes in that country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the person sought will receive a summary of the case 
rather than just affidavits on particular elements.  These will 
provide a clearer picture in our opinion of the evidence 
supporting the request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the Minister of Justice may decline to issue an authority 
to proceed with an extradition hearing if the minister is not 
satisfied with the content of the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, as noted above, the extradition judge will order 
committal of the person into custody to await surrender only if 
evidence would justify committal for trial in Canada if the 
offence was committed here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the second important feature of this reform. 
The extradition law, as it currently stands, does not provide for 
a code of procedure.  If one were to consult the Extradition Act 
or the Fugitive Offenders Act, one would be hard pressed to 
understand how proceedings commence, whether the fugitive is 
entitled to bail, how someone is to be arrested, how one can 
waive proceedings, whether temporary surrender is possible, et 
cetera.  In other words, there is a clear need to spell out the 
procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important at a time when transborder crime is becoming 
more prevalent to have an extradition process which is effective 
on a practical level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, it is equally important that the process be a 
clear one and that the written statute detail the nature of that 
process and the protections accorded to those who are the subject 
of extradition proceedings.  We simply cannot afford to be in the 
position where we will be criticized by Canadians for having let 
the country become a haven for criminals by not evolving with our 
times.  Yet we must also produce a reform which addresses the 
basic procedural requirements needed for a fair extradition 
process in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me briefly go through the main procedural features included 
in the extradition law reform.  The first point, which is clearly 
related to the evidentiary requirements that I just spoke about, 
concerns the respective roles of the courts and the executive 
branch in extradition cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current two-track system will be maintained.  The judicial 
track will continue to ensure that the underlying conduct would 
be criminal in Canada and there is a case against the person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice, on the other hand, will have the 
responsibility for assessing the foreign legal system to ensure 
that human rights are respected and a fair trial will be provided 
in the requesting state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill outlines the mandatory and discretionary grounds for 
the refusal of surrender by the minister, such as political 
offence, lack of jurisdiction, death penalty, humanitarian 
considerations, previous acquittal or conviction and trial in 
absentia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Minister of Justice will continue to have 
discretion to decide in each particular case whether or not to 
seek assurances from the requesting state that the death penalty 
will not be imposed or carried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that under no circumstances shall the 
minister make a surrender order if he or she is satisfied that 
the surrender would be unjust or oppressive or that extradition 
has been sought for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing the 
person by reason of race, religion, sex or other similar grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where a person could face prosecution or punishment because of a 
prohibited ground of discrimination, the clause we chose was 
directly taken from the United Nations model treaty on 
extradition.  The UN treaty provides greater protection than 
exists in most bilateral treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am aware that the list of grounds could be considered 
under-inclusive and, as a result, the minister is asking the 
committee to analyse this clause in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, the safeguards referred to in the legislation are 
provided in addition to any protection under the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms which the person sought may have.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the decisions to be made by the extradition judge or by 
the Minister of Justice will be subject to appeal or review by 
provincial courts of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the proposed legislation also seeks to harmonize the 
extradition and refugee processes, as conflict may arise when 
someone subject to an extradition request makes a claim for 
refugee status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, Bill C-40 modifies the Extradition Act and the Immigration 
Act in order to avoid duplication of decision making and to limit 
delay in the extradition process.  The legislation also provides 
a means for consultation between the Minister of Justice and the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration in such matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, the Immigration Act would be modified to 
provide that if extradition proceedings have been initiated for 
an offence punishable in Canada by a maximum of 10 years' 
imprisonment or more and that person has claimed refugee status, 
a hearing by the convention refugee determination division of the 
Immigration and Refugee Board shall not be commenced or shall be 
adjourned until a final decision on extradition is rendered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the decision is made not to extradite the person, the 
convention refugee determination division hearing may commence or 
resume. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the person is committed for extradition by an extradition 
judge and ordered surrendered by the Minister of Justice, the 
order of surrender is deemed to be a decision by the CRDD that 
the person is not a convention refugee because of the evidentiary 
grounds presented in the extradition case of a serious 
non-political offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is in keeping with the exclusion on grounds of serious 
non-political crimes provided by article 1F(b) of the Refugee 
Convention to which Canada is bound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot end my overview of Bill C-40 without mentioning the 
important modifications to the Criminal Code, the Mutual Legal 
Assistance in Criminal Matters Act and the Canada Evidence Act 
which allow for the use of video and audio-link technology to 
gather evidence and provide testimony from witnesses in Canada or 
abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although these modifications will contribute to a more efficient 
extradition process in specific cases, their aim is much broader 
as they will allow the use of such technology in criminal and 
other proceedings as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an age of amazing technological development it is critical 
that our laws and justice system are flexible enough to permit 
the use of that technology where possible, appropriate and 
beneficial to proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When globalization of new technologies is expanding the reach of 
organized crime we must ensure that our justice system also uses 
new technologies to capture and prosecute criminals.  Where 
witnesses cannot be brought before the court because they are 
outside Canada or they are in another part of Canada and 
circumstances preclude their attendance, the use of video or 
audio-link technology is a much better alternative than the 
written statement or the taking of evidence by a foreign court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that these modifications represent a major, possibly 
revolutionary, change in testimonial evidence which takes into 
account modern day realities and the rights of the accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides that, in respect of video and audio-link 
evidence from Canada to a foreign state, the laws relating to 
evidence and procedure of a foreign state would apply as though 
the person testifying in Canada was physically before the court 
outside Canada, but only if the evidence would not disclose 
information otherwise protected by the Canadian law of 
non-disclosure of information or privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill also provides that the Canadian law relating 
to contempt of court, perjury and contradictory evidence would 
apply to these persons, parties or witnesses, whether they are 
testifying from Canada to a foreign state or from outside Canada 
to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of evidence given by the video or audio-link in 
Canada by a witness elsewhere in Canada, the bill amends the 
Criminal Code so that the court could order that such evidence be 
provided by such means if it is appropriate considering all the 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court shall receive evidence given by video-link by a 
witness outside of Canada unless one of the parties satisfies the 
court that the reception of such testimony would be contrary to 
the principles of fundamental justice in this country. 
The court may receive evidence given by audio links from a 
witness outside Canada, if it would be appropriate considering 
all the circumstances.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wish to once again stress the importance of 
that legislation for Canada and its partners. It brings about a 
comprehensive review of Canada's extradition provisions, so as 
to provide law enforcement authorities and prosecutors with the 
tools they need to co-operate with other states and entities, in 
order to counteract the threat of transborder crime and ensure 
that Canada never becomes a haven for fugitives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Sackville—Eastern Shore, Automotive Industry; the hon. 
member for Tobique—Mactaquac, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill 
C-40.  It is noble to modernize the Extradition Act and in fact 
is long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's current policies are outdated, slow and complex.  As a 
consequence we have members of genocidal regimes, killers and 
illegals by the thousands in Canada living off Canadian society. 
We do not know how many or where they are.  Maybe Bill C-40 will 
not be of much use until we devise a more efficient screening and 
monitoring system for illegal refugees in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform supports extraditing these individuals to face 
international criminal courts like Rwanda and Yugoslavia war 
crimes tribunals.  We believe in justice.  These tribunals and 
the concept of an international court with independent powers to 
prosecute war criminals is a 50 year dream and is laudable. The 
process to establish such a court has been a very difficult road. 
Canada can take some solace in knowing that it has played such a 
pivotal role in getting members to the table in the last minute 
negotiations and in the hesitancy of some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new international criminal court will have power to 
investigate, prosecute, indict and try persons for the most 
serious crimes of international concern, including genocide, 
crimes against humanity and crimes of aggression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is one of the 119 signatories to this historic event.  By 
the Canadian government's own admission Canada has been a refuge 
for war criminals and former members of genocidal regimes.  Due 
to our ineffectual immigration screening, removal and enforcement 
system the problem is out of hand.  Now at least if we can find 
these illegals we have somewhere to send them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general keeps promising a crackdown on Canadian 
organizations that are fronts for foreign terrorists.  He says 
that this is a serious problem.  The auditor general agrees and 
says that Canada has been negligent in dealing with it.  We all 
respect what the auditor general says because it is his group 
that is independent and tells us what is going on in the 
government of the day, no matter who it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not comforting to hear the solicitor general say that 
Canada had become a haven for every known terrorist group in the 
world.  It is a sobering thought and it is about time we did 
something about it.  I repeat that because it is not too often 
the solicitor general of any government would say that.  He said 
that Canada had become a haven for every known terrorist group in 
the world.  The bill is a small part of solving some of that 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We not only have terrorists groups in Canada.  We have some 324 
modern day war criminals and another 62 suspected war criminals 
in Canada.  Those are the ones we know about.  We have among us 
death squad members, torturers, individuals accused of genocide 
and officials from corrupt regimes in Somalia, Bosnia, Iraq, 
Afghanistan, Haiti, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Rwanda and El Salvador, 
a virtual cornucopia of the world's worst.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a pathetic statement about the pathetic immigration 
system in Canada.  We would not be here today debating Bill C-40 
if we had an immigration system that really worked.  Our 
immigration system has played the refugee game with these 
individuals for too long.  War criminals are not refugees just 
because they arrive at the border and say that they are refugees. 
They are war criminals and we have to take a very tough stand on 
that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-40 changes a 120 year old law.  There are not too many 
members who will ever get to debate a bill that old in the House. 
The present statute allows Canada to extradite criminal suspects 
to other countries but not to the tribunal set up by the United 
Nations to prosecute war criminals from the former Yugoslavia and 
Rwanda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-40 will now allow Canada to send suspects to a permanent 
international court.  For years Canada pressed for such courts 
but ironically our law would not allow us to extradite the 
suspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-40 will modernize extradition proceedings by allowing 
extradition to face international criminal court like Rwanda and 
Yugoslavia war crimes tribunals, by broadening the grounds for 
extradition but removing the list of indictable offences and 
replacing it with the requirements that the conduct be an offence 
in both countries, and by permitting the temporary surrender of a 
convict who is serving time in Canada to another state to face 
trial there.  Is it not interesting that they use the phrase 
“the temporary surrender of a convict who is serving time” to 
somewhere else to face a trial there?  I will discuss that later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-40 will modernize extradition proceedings by permitting 
the use of video and audio technology to conduct hearings.  It is 
nice to know we are getting into the modern age. It will link the 
extradition and refugee appeals process where a person has sought 
to avoid extradition by claiming to be a refugee.  The law had to 
be changed to save Canada from the embarrassment it is facing on 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is not without its reservations regarding some 
elements of Bill C-40 despite what it purports to do.  Bill C-40 
is meant to streamline the extradition process by rolling two 
existing bills, the Fugitive Offenders Act of 1882 and the 
Extradition Act of 1877, into one bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the system be less complex?  We do not know that.  These 
two old bills have not worked and now we have one new bill.  Will 
it be less complex?  Will it allow Canadians to know that the 
people arrested for these offences can be extradited, tried 
somewhere else and removed from Canada in a very expeditious 
manner? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clause in Bill C-40 which would effectively broaden the 
grounds for extradition by abandoning what is known as the list 
approach to offences is a welcome change.  The current system, 
which only allows for extradition of the criminal when the act is 
part of an official list, is outdated and cumbersome.  The list 
of offences varies from country to country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-40 an extraditable offence will be a crime in both 
countries.  This will not just happen.  I sense a lot of 
co-ordination will have to take place to get the system working 
properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-40 will ease the rules that dictate the sort of evidence 
that must be presented by a nation seeking the extradition of an 
alleged offender.  Canada has been criticized in the past for its 
narrow approach to what can be used as evidence. This is new 
territory. In fact it is a quantum change.  I suspect much 
preparatory work will have to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-40 will allow the flexibility to deal on a case by case 
basis with extradition requests where no treaty is in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the two war crimes tribunals established in The 
Hague and in Tanzania, this is the first time in 50 years since 
Nuremberg that the world community has acted to create an 
international jurisdiction to hold individuals responsible for 
international crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Rwanda situation alone 32 people indicted by the tribunal 
are facing charges for the slaughter of an estimated 800,000 
people during a three month rampage in 1994.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before, there are some concerns with the bill.  Bill 
C-40, despite removing many layers of appeals in the extradition 
process, involved courts to minister, to refugee board, back to 
minister and then back to court.  It would be naive to believe 
that Bill C-40 makes extradition immediate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Delays have always favoured the accused because witnesses die. 
The supreme court in the Askov case asked that trials be held 
within a six month period to ensure that justice be done.  That 
does not happen very often.  Six months is a very short period of 
time for most of these cases.  As Justice Gibson of the federal 
court ruled, Canada cannot deport people without a fair and just 
assessment of whether they would face the risk of torture if 
returned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this means to me is court challenges and charter defences 
right up to the supreme court.  Bill C-40 will be tested.  Is it 
watertight?  We have to produce bills in the House that can meet 
the test of the supreme court.  We cannot be using the supreme 
court as a judge of what the people who were elected to govern 
Canada should be doing.  I am afraid the bill does not meet that 
test.  The supreme court may have asked for hearings within a six 
month period, but as we all know extradition routinely takes many 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about charter appeals and provide four examples of 
delay and why I am fearful Bill C-40 will not conclude this 
charter madness.  Charter appeals on the grounds of cruel and 
unusual punishment allow multiple appeals as highlighted by the 
following:  Rafay and Burns.  Murder was committed in 1994 by 
this pair.  The case will be heard in the supreme court in 
November.  The B.C. Court of Appeal found that the minister had 
to refuse extradition because they faced execution for 
bludgeoning Rafay's parents to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierino and Miachael Divito are Mafia figures wanted in the U.S. 
for conspiracy to import 300 kilos of cocaine.  It goes to court 
because of a much harsher drug sentence handed out in the U.S. 
Their lawyers vow that they will go all the way to the supreme 
court.  Why are they going to the Supreme Court?  They do not 
want to be tried in the United States because they will go to 
jail for a long time.  They want to stay in Canada.  Does this 
law solve that problem?  I do not think it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Salavatore Cazzetta, leader of the Rock Machine biker gang, 
wanted in the U.S. for drug trafficking charges, was delayed 
extradition for four years with arguments taken all the way to 
the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Michael Gwynne, a fugitive serving a 120 year sentence, was 
apprehended in 1993.  He has argued his case for five years all 
the way to the Supreme Court of Canada.  In short, Bill C-40 does 
nothing to preclude these types of appeals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read from a July 29, 1997 article by Jeffrey 
Simpson in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>.  It has to do with the Rafay 
case and what he calls charter madness.  I believe this article 
represents what an overwhelming majority of Canadians think.  He 
wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 12, 1994, the parents of Atif Rafay were bludgeoned to 
death with a baseball bat at their home in Bellevue, Wash.  Local 
police suspected the murderers were Atif Rafay and a friend, Glen 
Burns.  Lacking enough evidence, however, the police asked for 
and received undercover co-operation from the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, since the two suspects lived in Canada and were 
Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Courtesy of the undercover operation, Atif and Glen admitted 
they had killed Mr. Rafay's parents for life insurance and the 
value of the parents' home.  These admissions were voluntary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Case closed.  But hold on.  We live in the Age of the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms, which gives the ruling of judges greater 
impact on criminal law than anything done by a mere minister of 
justice or group of parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, in the Rafay-Burns case, the B.C. Court of Appeal relied on 
the Charter to block the extradition of the two men wanted for 
murder in the United States. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  It was because Canada had abolished the death penalty.  He 
continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were the two men found guilty in Washington and put to death, as 
that state's laws allow, then their charter rights would be 
violated, including the one that any Canadian citizen is allowed 
to return home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, of course, always waxes indignant when the United States 
or any other country tries to impose its laws on others.  Nothing 
gets Canadians to sit more upright on their white charger of 
morality than denouncing the “extraterritorial” application of 
U.S. laws.  But if Canadian laws, as in this charter case, are 
being applied in an extraterritorial sense, that is, our charter 
must protect even those accused of first degree murder, then 
everything is fine because we just have to believe our sense of 
justice is superior to that of the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these had been U.S. citizens, the extraditions would have 
proceeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But because the two are Canadians and therefore entitled, in the 
opinion of the court, to the full protection of the charter 
wherever they are, including for acts possibly committed in 
another country, they cannot be extradited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is charter madness, of which plenty is going around. When 
foreigners travel in this country, they obey Canadian laws and 
pay the penalty if they break them.  They may not like our 
penalties, they may think their system of justice back home is 
superior, but that's one of the risks people take when 
travelling, let alone committing first degree murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, when Canadians are on U.S. soil, U.S. laws apply.  If 
we break those laws and flee back across the border to escape 
punishment, an extradition treaty properly clicks into place so 
that Canada is not a “safe haven” for criminals of whatever 
nationality, Canadian or otherwise.  That we might not favour 
capital punishment (and I don't) doesn't mean we impose our sense 
of what is right for Canadian citizens accused of first degree 
murder somewhere where the death penalty applies.  But of course, 
in the age of the charter, this sort of common sense, community 
protecting sort of reasoning is out the window of judicial policy 
making.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That story alone should let us know there is a serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard debates in this House over the last couple of weeks 
that sometimes members on this side do not listen to what the 
public wants.  There is a quote on the gun control bill, why do 
you not listen to what the public wants. In this case, 85% of 
Canadians would vote for capital punishment if there was a 
referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we have two young people who murdered one of the fellow's 
parents in a terrible crime and should have to face that penalty. 
But here they are sitting in a Canadian jail at Canadian expense 
just because of where they were born. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of us would respect that.  None of us expect that we can 
run across the border, rob a bank and head back home because 
perhaps our laws are better. That is what is happening with our 
laws in this country.  That is why we are becoming one of the 
biggest import-export areas for drugs in the world.  Our 
sentences are too weak and one cannot be extradited if caught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is not going solve those problems. We are going to 
have a lot of interesting times in committee asking questions of 
those who drafted this bill to see if it really gets to where it 
has to get.  The people in the House right here get to make the 
laws, not those people sitting a couple of blocks away in the 
supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another objection to Bill C-40.  The bill preserves the 
minister's discretion in cases.  This is part of the delay 
problem.  It injects the minister into a judicial process.  It is 
wrong and we will not support that aspect of the bill.  This 
should not be the minister's role.  This is a judicial role, an 
independent role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot have any tinge of political interference when it comes 
to extradition for criminal offences. The minister should have no 
discretion to seek assurances on sentences, period. What it does 
is it imposes standards which necessarily vary from one minister 
to the next, or from one country to the next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the court should be simple in these extradition 
cases. The conduct complained of is a crime in Canada, a very 
simple rule.  The person sought is in fact the person accused. 
Again it is very simple. There is a valid extradition treaty. The 
bottom line is that the severity of the punishment in the other 
country should be irrelevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I  have another concern.  Extradition is costly.  I have some 
questions about the mechanics and the logistics of Bill C-40. We 
have called a number of government departments and have read the 
bill very thoroughly ourselves.  These questions are not answered 
in the bill.

court.  Who pays for the legal defence before the tribunal?  It 
had better not be Canada that is on the hook.  Why should we pay 
to get rid of someone wanted by someone else? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not unlike the process right now.  When someone comes to 
this country and says the word refugee at the border, we accept 
them.  We pay their health costs and their legal costs, all the

people are just trying to jump the queue which is not acceptable 
to most Canadians.  To an overwhelming majority of Canadians that 
is just not acceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Before getting into the thick of things, I would like, with your

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now turn our attention to Bill C-40. This is an important 
piece of legislation, because extradition must be viewed with 
two realities in mind. The first one is of course the movement 
of people between countries. We are well aware that one of the 
reasons for this bill is that 100 years ago, the means of 
communication were not what they are now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that, 100 years ago, people traveled by train. 
A hundred years ago, there was no Internet.  A hundred years 
ago, the whole issue of telemarketing did not exist.  A hundred 
years ago, the burning issues were railroads and electrical 
energy.  Those were the days of Sigmund Freud, with whose name 
people will be familiar.  I myself am an admirer of Freud, the 
father of psychoanalysis, a man who left his mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A hundred years later, we realize that the question of 
population flows—the word itself suggests mobility—is connected 
with crime.  There are all sorts of new types of crime one must 
think about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going into Bill C-40 in detail, let us think about money 
laundering alone. 
If any one member in this House has raised this matter, it is 
the very one who speaks to you now, because money laundering is 
connected with the most troubling threat, the parallel economy. 
If I asked you to bet on the figures involved in money 
laundering, I am sure you could not hit on the figure.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I will promptly provide you with that figure: 
somewhere in the order of $20 billion involved in money 
laundering.  Not a figure to be sneezed at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The merit of the bill lies in its desire to bring the 
legislation up to date, to simplify it.  For this reason, it 
must be understood right off the bat that, in reality, two 
pieces of legislation are involved when we are discussing Bill 
C-40: the Extradition Act, for there is such a piece of 
legislation, and the Fugitive Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until very recently, Canada was not in a position to honour its 
obligations on the international level.  The parliamentary 
secretary has said so, eloquently moreover, and I must 
congratulate her on this. 
She reminded us that this hundred-year-old legislation was 
completely unsuited to the realities of modern extradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing an international consciousness, in which the Bloc 
Quebecois is playing a large role, and an increasing interest in 
the concept of international tribunals.  As we speak, there are 
97 conflicts going on in the world.  Amazingly, of this number, 
94 are intra-state, meaning that they do not extend beyond a 
country's borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In such conflicts, there are people who commit crimes and leave 
their own country for another, hence the need for extradition 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have forgotten to mention the two lawyers who briefed me.  I 
am thinking of Mr. Lemire, and of Mr. Roy.  I wish to thank 
them. I think they are seated nearby. 
I thank them for the serious and professional manner in which 
they shared their knowledge with me.  I cannot claim to have 
attained their level of expertise, but I did my best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we are discussing, Bill C-40, will combine two statutes. 
It will amend the principle of extradition, producing a 
completely modern bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In times gone by, extradition was associated with a list of 
offences for which an individual was sought, here and in other 
countries.  This posed a problem because there were certain acts 
that were considered offences in Canada, that were not 
necessarily viewed that way in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, I understand that, with this bill, there is less 
interest in maintaining lists, which necessitated legislative 
amendment to make the changes; we are now going with the legal 
concept of comparable offences.  The offence we are talking 
about must carry with it a sentence of a minimum of two years. I 
think we will find this flexibility very useful in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very important aspect of the bill is that it clarifies 
the roles of the department, that is, the minister, and the 
various courts.  We are talking about a regular court of law 
here, if my notions of law are correct.  This in fact was one of 
the exam questions when I was interested in such things. 
The difference between a court of law and an administrative 
tribunal—I imagine all my colleagues could slip me the answer, 
but I am going to continue with my own theory—is that a court 
of law does not administer a specific law, but responds to a set 
of laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my example of an administrative tribunal, I cite the Régie du 
logement and the CSSTs.  The Immigration and Refugee Board is an 
administrative tribunal, which administers a law, and therefore 
may develop a certain specialization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It establishes a division of labour, a specialization under 
which the law establishes very specific and defined roles for 
the judges whose prime responsibility will be to ensure that an 
offence against Canada has truly occurred.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will also have to assess the evidence, and that is 
extremely important.  As you know, justice is not served if the 
evidence cannot be objectively, intelligently and impartially 
assessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the Department of Justice.  Our fine and 
attractive Minister of Justice will, under all circumstances, 
have to make a decision on the extradition process.  She will 
have to ratify—I say ratify, but members will understand that 
in each case that is submitted to her— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised to learn of the level of intimacy in 
the process.  I thought it was automatic, until Mr. Lemire and 
Mr. Roy told me otherwise.  In a way this is reassuring, because 
it means that political authority is more than just political 
authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human authority must take a look at the extradition 
issue. Why? First, to make sure that when a state asks for the 
extradition of an individual who is guilty of an offence both in 
Canada and in his country of origin, his extradition will not 
expose that individual to abuse or to violations of his rights 
as a human being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very pleased to learn during a briefing that a provision 
of the bill specifically provides that when human rights are 
violated, when the individual committed a punishable offence 
that carries a two-year jail term, and when it is feared that the 
individual will be discriminated against for motives that are 
prohibited under the Canadian law and charter, then the minister 
can reject the request for extradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are, referring to possible violations based on 
political beliefs or marital status. 
One's sexual orientation is not included in the legislation, but 
I know we can count on the parliamentary secretary to agree to 
an amendment that the Bloc Quebecois will table in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will have the option, when she is concerned 
about the conditions surrounding the extradition of an 
individual detained in Canada, to oppose such extradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the great merit of this bill is, of course, that it 
updates a century old act that was rarely amended, but it is 
also that it targets the new forms of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crime is a national reality, but it is also an international one. 
This is something that reaches across borders. In fact, until 
recently, and I am not sure it is not still the case to some 
extent, Canada was considered a haven for organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you know—not from personal experience but from what 
you heard—how organized crime works. There are usually three 
phases. I had this explained to me at the time when I was taking 
a special interest in this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, the late Daniel Desrochers, a 13-year old boy, was the 
innocent victim of a car bombing a few feet away from my 
constituency office in Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. This incident 
reminded us of the battle going on in the underworld, especially 
between two biker gangs, namely the Hell's Angels and the Rock 
Machines, for control over the drug market. 
Following this incident, many of my fellows citizens and I felt 
the urge to find out more about organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then came to realize that it is not only a national but also 
an international phenomenon. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also came to realize that organized crime works in stages or 
phases. The first stage consists in taking control over a 
territory. That makes sense. Members of criminal organization 
need a place to operate. These places meet very specific 
criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no organized crime to speak of in the third world. 
There is a lot of corruption of course. There are drug 
traffickers, and several countries come to mind. But organized 
crime as we know it in Canada and Quebec is only possible in a 
country of plenty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of prerequisites for organized crime to 
flourish. 
First, this requires a state with a highly complex legal system. 
We already know how many people hold that the charter of rights 
adopted in 1982, without the consent of Quebec, constitutes a 
hindrance in the battle against organized crime, because in a 
bureaucratized state with a highly complex legal system there 
are fundamental guarantees, over and above sections 7 through 14 
of the charter, which slow down the judiciary process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, like my colleagues on the other side of the House, we 
in the Bloc Quebecois would not like to go back to a time when 
there were no judiciary guarantees and a person could fall 
victim to wrongful acts by the judiciary without much hope of 
redress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A brief aside: some of my colleagues, militants from way back, 
who lived through the 1970 October Crisis, when habeas corpus 
was suspended, know what it is to live with discretionary 
imprisonment, hateful as that is, and other judiciary abuses. 
This is why it is so important to have judiciary guarantees in a 
constitutional state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, back to the bread and butter of the issue, or perhaps I 
should speak instead of sheep and lambs, to please the hon. 
member for Louis-Hébert.  Our thanks to her, incidentally, for 
the excellent lamb she offered us this morning.  I wish our 
Liberal colleagues could have been there too.  It brought our 
thoughts back to the battle this hon. member has been waging, 
along with some of her colleagues, for instance the hon. member 
for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques. 
The excellent lamb served reminds us of the Department of 
Agriculture's need to review its policy on scrapie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, back to organized crime.  Organized crime runs in 
stages, and this is a national reality.  With cross-border trade, 
the figure of $20 million laundered has become an international 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first stage of organized crime is gaining control over a 
territory, and the second, almost inevitably, is money 
laundering.  I do not wish to go too far off-topic, but what does 
it take to convince this government— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the parliamentary secretary to look up and take 
note when I ask her to work very hard within her caucus to 
convince the Minister of Justice—a woman who is generally easy to 
get along with, except when she is speaking about constitutional 
law and can get carried away—to take $1,000 bank notes out of 
circulation, because it leads directly to money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to do a little informal survey of our colleagues, of 
those in the gallery, of listeners, and ask how many of them had 
a $1,000 bill on them, with the notable exception of yourself, 
Mr. Speaker, there would be very few.  That is why the $1,000 
bank note lends itself to money laundering.  Canada is the only 
country to have this denomination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first phase, therefore, is taking over an area.  The second 
is money laundering. 
The third, and most important, is the phase which, according to 
a certain number of analysts, Canada is well into, in which the 
underworld invests in legal and illegal activities.  This is a 
cause for concern. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT79"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT79"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1710

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a cause for concern because, without strong legislation, 
and of course Bill C-40 is a step in the right direction, legal 
and illegal activities can cover quite a range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the underworld is now investing in luxury items 
such as jewels and fur coats, and, we have to be honest, 
casinos.  And of course, the drug culture provides it with its 
main source of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crime is a very real concern. 
Just recently, perhaps a year and a half ago, I believe we 
passed an extremely memorable milestone, providing our society 
with more weapons for the battle we must wage against those on 
the other side of the law.  That milestone was the passage of 
legislation on gangs, and I believe I made a modest contribution 
to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, it will always be the government that gets credit for 
its enactment, but I believe that, without the political 
pressure brought to bear and the arguments made daily by myself 
and my Bloc Quebecois colleagues from Montreal and other 
regions, there would not have been such early awareness of the 
necessity of legislation against organized crime.  That 
legislation created a new criminal offence, and provided both 
police forces and judges with additional tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who may have just joined us, Bill C-40 is a bill which 
combines two existing laws with the intent of bringing the 
extradition process into the present day. not only bringing it 
into the present day, but also simplifying it, by not only 
listing the criminal offences but also including the concept of 
offences punishable in both states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, Canada has extradition agreements with 49 states, as 
well as being a signatory of eight multilateral conventions.  If 
there should happen not to be a treaty with the states 
concerned, it will be possible to proceed on a case-specific base 
and the law will allow extradition without a treaty, using the 
process of a designation or agreement specific to a particular 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another quite interesting clause in the bill concerns the 
Immigration and Refugee Board, which comes under the 
jurisdiction of the Minister of Immigration, the hon. member for 
Westmount—Ville-Marie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may happen within the extradition process that the person 
involved is also claiming political refugee status.  We know how 
the refugee status determination process works.  It is a pretty 
rotten, petty and patronage-ridden system, in my opinion. 
Essentially, however, how it works is that it allows a person 
from another country to come into Canadian territory and apply 
for political refugee status under the Geneva Convention, asking 
for asylum in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally, it is because we have reasons to believe that, in his 
or her country of origin, the person could be persecuted on the 
basis of political or religious beliefs. It is also increasingly 
frequent to grant refugee status to people because we fear for 
their physical integrity and are concerned that they might 
suffer some kind of reprisals because of their sexual 
orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Canada is a signatory to the Geneva convention,  refugee 
status is determined by first accepting a person into the 
country. An officer meets the person, who fills out a personal 
information card. The officer then determines if there is a 
credible basis for the claim.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If so, the person is allowed to continue the process. The file 
is then referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board, more 
specifically to the Convention Refugee Determination Division. 
The board makes decisions. It makes its decisions through an 
accelerated process, or with two board members being present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope, of course, that the process will change. It must 
change, if only because, on average, it takes three years to 
reach a decision. This is rather unbelievable, considering that 
if a person comes here as a political refugee, it is because 
that person is in trouble. The process should be a lot faster 
than it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens when a decision takes a long time, when it takes 
three years? As the member for Jonquière pointed out, people get 
used to being here. They learn the language, they find a job, 
they develop relationships with their neighbours and they become 
part of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes, after having been here two or three years and having 
integrated themselves to the Canadian society, they are told 
they are not recognized as political refugees. They must then 
leave the country. Some will argue there are ways to appeal the 
decision. It is true, particularly through the federal court. 
But in reality, the decisions made by the Immigration and 
Refugee Board are very rarely overturned at the appeal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process is somewhat inefficient, but with Bill C-40, it will 
be possible to consider that a decision made by the justice 
department on refugee status determination will also apply for 
the purposes of the Immigration and Refugee Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may construe this as interference. I for one think it is a 
sensible approach and that it makes sense, for the sake of 
consistency, that a decision made by the justice department on 
refugee status determination be binding and apply to the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that we will dispose quickly of Bill C-40, which is not a 
very controversial bill. I heard our colleagues from the Reform 
Party express a number of grievances, and there is nothing wrong 
with that. They probably had more to do with the cost of 
implementing the legislation. 
This is a concern—I was about to say an obsession—but I 
personally believe that the real challenge, as events will show, 
should lead us to consider and thoroughly review the Immigration 
Act. We can agree that twho here is work to be done in that 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the Minister of Immigration, a woman always perfectly 
in control of her faculties, who is not prone to anger and 
verbal abuse and always speaks in a soft voice whether the 
moment is grave and solemn or festive, told us “We will be 
tabling legislation shortly”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not enough. We must know when legislation will be 
tabled. It is especially important since the Trempe commission, 
masterfully presided by the former deputy minister of 
immigration in Quebec, concluded in its report that the 
immigration system did not make any sense. If there is one 
priority we must raise as members of parliament, that is it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Trempe report asked that a distinction be made between 
people who come here as immigrants, who chose Quebec or Canada 
often on the basis of professional skills, and those who come 
here because of hardship due to the international situation or 
to problems inherent to their country of origin and seek 
political asylum. The Trempe report suggested that a distinction 
be made and that a protection agency be established.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem that must be mentioned, that I think people 
should be aware of.  I am sure the parliamentary secretary knows 
what I am referring to.  The Immigration and Refugee Board is a 
patronage haven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could give examples.  I do not know whether it parliamentary to 
do so?  I will take a chance.  There is Mrs. Robic, the former 
Minister of Immigration for Quebec, for instance.  That is a good 
appointment, because she was the Minister of Immigration.  She 
was a Liberal, of course, but nobody is perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were other appointments to this Immigration and Refugee 
Board, including the president of Alliance Quebec. 
We are hearing a lot about Alliance Quebec.  The shock waves can 
surly be felt all the way out in Edmonton. He was appointed.  Is 
there anyone that can say to the House that the former president 
of Alliance Quebec was familiar with international law? Was he 
interested in immigration?  Of course not.  That has nothing to 
do with his ability to learn.  I would agree, but could we not 
leave patronage behind, and follow the example of the Parti 
Quebecois, which will have an objective procedure and where the 
candidates chosen will be career public servants? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was what the Trempe report called for.  It recommended that 
there be a process whereby people with an interest in immigration 
law and international law and who would make it their career 
would be appointed to the public service, by competition.  Is 
there anything nobler than a career in the public service of 
one's country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the direction that should be taken.  For my part, as a 
member of parliament, I hope that we move rapidly to adopt such a 
process.  Let me say right off that the government will be able 
to rely on the enthusiastic, not to say ardent, support of the 
opposition, particularly yours truly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are my comments.  I will conclude by saying that we will 
support the general philosophy behind the bill, as well as its 
economic impact.  Certainly, there will be a few amendments, 
because we have a dual objective. 
First, we want to attain sovereignty, as everyone knows, but our 
more immediate goal is to improve government.  That is what the 
opposition is all about.  It is arduous work, with no end in 
sight.  We will work in committee to improve the bill.  We will 
move a few amendments but, on the whole, this is a worthy bill 
that we will support.

glad to rise on behalf of the NDP caucus and address Bill C-40 at 
second reading.  On behalf of our justice critic, the member for 
Sydney—Victoria, I would like to announce that our caucus is 
supportive of Bill C-40.  We are pleased to see many of the 
changes being introduced in terms of trying to harmonize a piece 
of legislation that was spread out over many other pieces of 
legislation in the past which made it very cumbersome and 
complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have nearly as much to say about this as the previous 
speaker from the Bloc.  This is not my area of expertise.  I will 
stick to the very limited, narrow subject matter here, the 
proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is intended to bring our extradition procedures 
more in line and closer to those of other countries to prevent 
Canada from becoming some kind of safe haven for international 
criminals, those who do not benefit our country. 
We want the international co-operation and the tools at our 
disposal to send these people where justice will be served.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major problems with the current legislation, as 
pointed out by the parliamentary secretary, is the difficulty for 
Canada to meet its international obligations in any kind of an 
international criminal court or tribunal.  It is ironic that 
Canada has been one of the most outspoken countries in trying to 
create such an international court and to oblige people to serve 
or to attend that international court, but under the current 
system we cannot extradite a fugitive to such a body. Obviously 
that is a limitation that needs to be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that Bill C-40 is necessary and beneficial because the 
current legislation does not deal with things like the newer 
high tech crimes and is not flexible enough to accommodate changes 
arising from the globalization of criminal activity, for instance 
the drug trade, organized and transborder crimes.  The increased 
mobility of individuals makes the need for effective extradition 
relations with other countries more important than it ever has 
been in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the two acts that covered extradition in the 
past, the Fugitive Offenders Act and the Extradition Act, both 
were enacted in the 1800s, 1877 and 1882.  That kind of 
legislation is even older than my colleague from 
Sackville—Eastern Shore and obviously needs to be revisited, 
updated, reviewed and amended.  We are glad to see Bill C-40 
coming in to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP caucus is in support of measures to prevent Canada from 
becoming a safe haven for fugitives, as I mentioned.  We are in 
favour of enhanced human rights protections and safeguards for 
persons who are the subject of an extradition request.  I believe 
Bill C-40 will further enhance those human rights issues 
associated with the extradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP caucus is in favour of provisions for extradition of 
persons to international tribunals and courts, as mentioned.  We 
feel that is one of the big benefits.  Obviously we are in favour 
of modernizing the act to deal with high tech and organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we have reservations and concerns about is 
with the changes being proposed that would permit the 
admissibility of a broader range of types of evidence in cases of 
extradition hearings.  We have some serious reservations and 
concerns with the powers to exclude certain persons from 
extraditions hearings.  We believe Bill C-40 will augment the 
ability to exclude certain types. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The non-publication of evidence provisions has been dealt with 
in Bill C-40.  We have some serious concerns about that. Most 
fundamentally, the NDP has a very grave concern that safeguards 
regarding the imposition of the death penalty are not really made 
binding.  We have not really ever addressed whether Canada is 
going to promote or allow the extradition of criminals to places 
where they could stand and be executed where the death penalty 
still exists.  We do not believe Bill C-40 has really addressed 
that adequately and that is one of the serious reservations we 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add a small anecdotal piece of information.  I 
do not know a great deal about the legislation and the history of 
extradition, but I know in my own riding of one case that I have 
been working on at great length trying to get a woman extradited 
to the United States so that she can stand trial for the murder 
of her husband, a Canadian citizen and a member of the Canadian 
military who was murdered in Florida.  The grand jury of the 
United States stood for eight minutes before indicting this 
person that there are probable grounds for this person's standing 
trial.  I can attest to how frustrating it is to try to get a 
person extradited from this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, before I start I would like to seek the 
unanimous consent of the House to pass over to my colleague, the 
hon. member for St. John's West, the closing five minutes that I 
have available to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel privileged to be able to 
raise an issue that is particularly close to my heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion I am putting forward today reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
overhaul all its programs for young people in order to evaluate 
their impact and performance, and in order to ensure that all 
funds for such programs maximize young people's chances of 
joining the labour force. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the coming minutes, I will explain my reasoning on the merits 
of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all agree that the government is already paying out a 
significant amount of money in various programs for young 
people.  According to government documents, the Youth Employment 
Strategy alone “makes effective use of investments of over $2 
billion the Government of Canada has set up for young people”. 
That is quite a sum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Youth Employment Strategy combines 250 programs.  Funding 
for these initiatives comes from some 12 departments, including 
Human Resources Development Canada, Industry Canada, Heritage 
Canada and a number of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes several departments share in the funding of a program. 
This can create an accountability problem.  There can be a 
whole slew of programs, but they have to be effective, and the 
resources must not be wasted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since there is no central body controlling all these programs, 
they are not readily available to young people.  There is a web 
site, but the government must make it much better known.  A 
number of young people simply do not know about all these 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure all the members of this House that my motion 
does not arise from a preconceived idea that all the programs 
are bad and useless.  Far from it.  My aim is to ask the 
government to ensure that the money intended for young people is 
spent on effective and useful programs.  Young people deserve 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, our duty is to insist on an accounting and 
to ensure that Canadian taxpayers' money is put to good use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to focus today's debate, let us take the Canada student 
loans program as an example. 
I am sure all MPs are aware of this program, which affects 
nearly 60% of post-secondary students.  The Canada student loan 
program, or CSLP, represents a huge investment by the 
government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Human Resources Development estimates that the 
CSLP has given out loans of some $15 billion to over 2.7 million 
Canadians since its inception in 1964.  Also according to the 
department, the average debt load in 1990 of a student in a 
four-year program was $8,700.  In 1998, they expect the debt load 
to be some $25,000.  In other words, student debt has grown by 
187% in Canada in only eight years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we talk of effective investment when so many Canadians are 
struggling under the weight of overpowering debt even before 
they start their career? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has taken a number of steps to try to ease young 
people's passage from their studies to the workplace. 
I am sure its intentions are good, but the results are sometimes 
dismal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at the current youth employment situation. In 
August, youth unemployment was at 14.5%, almost double the 
Canadian rate. In my province of New Brunswick, youth 
unemployment is close to 25%. In 1996, 17.7% of welfare cases in 
Canada were single parents under the age of 24. These figures 
certainly suggest there is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the problem is that, in recent years, the transition 
between school and work has been made more difficult by the 
limited job creation that had taken place since the 1990-91 
recession. 
This has particular impact on those who do not have the training 
or skills currently in demand on the job market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people in the high risk group, those who did not complete 
their secondary education, are particularly affected. There are 
simply no jobs for them. Most of the jobs available for low 
skilled workers before them have been made obsolete by 
technological innovation or have moved to a third world country 
where labour is cheap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for young people in the average risk groups, those with 
secondary education but no post-secondary education, they have 
seen their diploma lose much of its worth. 
More and more employers are looking for people with 
post-secondary education for positions that, less than one 
generation ago, would have gone to high school graduates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And young people at low risk, those with post-secondary degrees, 
need something to help them make the transition to the labour 
force, to help them get their first job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally, the unemployment rate among young people goes up 
when the economy is weak. However, what we are now seeing is 
that young people are not taking advantage of the benefits 
created when the situation improves.  During the last economic 
recovery, the gap between the unemployment rate of young people 
and that of adult workers did not close as much as in earlier 
cycles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether they are studying or not, young people are 
over-represented in atypical jobs, that is to say part time, 
temporary, fixed rate, piecework, or occasional jobs, most of 
which are low paying and require few skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If society turns a blind eye to the problem, it will have to pay 
increased costs because of the number of unemployed workers and 
welfare recipients, as well as the inevitable social problems in 
a polarized society.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies show that long periods of unemployment result in a loss 
of skills and permanently alter potential employers' opinions of 
young people.  Unemployment therefore has an impact on the 
present and future contribution of young workers to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is so important to ensure that we supply all the 
winning conditions that will help young people join the labour 
force quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important not to focus exclusively on the 
government's role.  Businesses have also produced good results 
in the fight to help young people find jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce published, with 
the Canadian Youth Foundation, studies and profiles of very 
successful programs. I invite members to take a look at these 
documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote a few excerpts from one of these publications, 
which I find particularly relevant to our discussion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Big numbers encourage big responses, including massive 
government-let “wars” against the latest social scourge. Even in 
these times of fiscal restraint, the first response to a big number is 
still to throw some money at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the youth employment crisis is seen in terms of people 
rather than statistics, the response changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Programs become humanized and 
flexible when it's understood that real people never fit into 
the categories of those oh-so-precise charts and graphs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Programs also become more unassuming without the illusion that 
there is true path, one best solution for all young Canadians or 
for the nation. Together, these elements help make these 
people-centred programs particularly effective. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government often announces with great fanfare its 
initiatives for young people. Just think of the millennium 
foundation announced in the last budget. In spite of a $2.5 
billion budget, only 7% of Canadian students will benefit from 
millennium scholarships. Is this a really good investment? I 
doubt it, particularly when you consider that this government 
cut $17.3 billion from transfer payments for health and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the money not have been made better use of by the 
provinces, who have had to cut funding to colleges and 
universities, thus forcing them to raise tuition fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without these cuts to the transfer payments, perhaps students 
would be less in debt and less in need of these millennium 
scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will have figured out that these are hypothetical 
questions I am asking.  I have not done enough research to 
assess the impact of all these measures.  That is why I moved 
the motion now before the House, moreover.  If we do not have 
the means as individuals to assess the need for, and 
effectiveness of, over 250 government programs involving 
billions of dollars, it is absolutely necessary for someone to 
do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, youth unemployment and underemployment rank 
foremost amongst the major social and economic questions facing 
Canadians as this century draws to a close. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also realize that these matters cannot rest solely in the 
hands of governments.  The private sector must also determine 
what it can contribute to solving these problems, and what 
approach it must take to give today's and tomorrow's young 
people the chance to play an active role in the Canada of today 
and tomorrow.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what we can do today is to urge the government to take 
the first step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government absolutely wants to help improve the situation 
for our young people, then it will not mind reviewing the 
existing programs. Nor will it mind sharing the results of these 
reviews with members of parliament and the general public . 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, the government will not hesitate to consult and involve 
all stakeholders, including young Canadians themselves, and to 
take advice from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young Canadians are waiting for us to show some leadership. Let 
us not disappoint them. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to enter this debate on this very important subject. 
I am especially happy to have a chance to outline the efficiency 
and the effectiveness of the Government of Canada's youth 
programming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question Canadians have a right to expect the 
best possible performance from Government of Canada 
investments.  Certainly young Canadians are looking for results. 
They deserve and expect results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the member for Madawaska—Restigouche that the 
monitoring and evaluation of the Government of Canada's youth 
programs is already underway.  When it launched the youth 
employment strategy the Government of Canada instituted a 
comprehensive strategy to monitor the performance of its programs 
for youth and to evaluate their impacts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more assuring, our youth employment initiatives are 
producing concrete results.  Thousands of Canadian youth know 
from their own experience that the Government of Canada's youth 
employment strategy is working to help them find work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to explore these two important points one issue at time. 
The first is a matter of program monitoring.  As I mentioned, the 
Government of Canada's youth employment strategy has a built-in 
system to measure the strategy's success.  This system includes 
participant follow-up surveys, longitudinal studies and 
individual program evaluations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will do a quick review of some of our key findings to date.  I 
think they will be found very important.  Youth internship 
Canada, a program that provides wage subsidies to employers who 
create work experience opportunities at home and abroad for 
youth, has a stellar record.  This program will create 25,000 
internships in the current fiscal year.  Each year Human 
Resources Development Canada conducts follow-up surveys with 
former youth internship Canada participants to assess the results 
of the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent survey was in November 1997.  That indicated 
that 88% of former project participants are now employed or have 
returned to school.  The youth service Canada program has an 
equally impressive record.  This initiative provides funds to 
community organizations to help higher risk youth find their 
place in the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year some 5,000 young people will receive youth service 
Canada support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 survey of the youth service Canada program found that 6 
to 12 months after taking part in a youth service Canada project 
85% of the youth are employed or have returned to school, and 
that is very impressive.  Incidentally, this year Human Resources 
Development Canada will be going ahead with an in-depth 
evaluation of youth service Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada student summer job action has enjoyed 
similarly positive results.  Like other youth programs, this 
initiative is reviewed periodically through follow-up surveys 
with young Canadians.  The 1996 survey found that 55% of 
placements provided work experience in the student's area of 
study and, just as important, we discovered that 69% of employers 
would not have hired a student without the Government of Canada 
subsidy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Findings like these demonstrate that we are on the right track. 
But let me assure my hon. colleague this government is not about 
to rest on its laurels in this matter.  In addition to the 
measures I have already outlined, all federal departments and 
agencies involved in all our 250 youth programs under the youth 
employment strategy are required to conduct and report on the 
evaluation of their youth employment strategy initiatives. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT87"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT87"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1750

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give members some sense of our commitment to quality of this 
program let me profile just one department. Human Resources 
Development Canada alone is conducting an interim formative 
evaluation as well as a final summary evaluation of its youth 
employment strategy initiatives.  The formative evaluation is 
already in progress.  We should be able to report back to this 
House on its findings by the fall of next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equally valuable, all these review activities are being 
incorporated into longer term evaluations of the Government of 
Canada's youth initiatives.  Human Resource Development Canada 
has developed an evaluation framework to integrate the results of 
individual departmental evaluations into an overall evaluation of 
the youth employment strategy.  This massive undertaking will be 
completed within two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the newest initiatives such as those developed for youth at 
risk are going under the microscope.  These initiatives which 
provide work experience and assistance to young people facing 
multiple barriers to employment are currently being assessed as 
part of the comprehensive evaluation of the youth employment 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that all the major initiatives under the youth 
employment strategy grew out of our experience with early youth 
programs such as youth internship Canada and youth service 
Canada.  Our new programs are built around feedback and 
refinements to these pioneering programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly there is no shortage of opportunities to identify any 
program weaknesses, nor is there any lack of willingness to 
address them properly should problems be found.  That is 
important to note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that our youth programs enjoy such remarkable ratings, 
however, reinforces that Canada's youth employment strategy is 
meeting is commitment to help young Canadians find their way in 
the world of the job market.  Yet we are still not content that 
enough is being done.  That is why this year we added the 
Canadian opportunities strategy as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunities strategy provides Canada study 
grants, Canada education savings grants, the Canadian millennium 
scholarship fund, tax measures for interest on Canadian student 
loans, part time student and child care expenses as well as more 
funding to university granting councils.  We are making these 
investments in young Canadians because we know there is no better 
investment in the future.  Learning is the absolute best 
guarantee for better jobs in the new millennium and the new 
economy. I was happy to hear the hon. member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche acknowledge in his speech early on that 
the government is making an enormous investment in our young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is any lingering doubt about this government's ability 
to maximize young people's chances of joining the labour force 
let me bring my fellow parliamentarians up to date on our overall 
success.  I point out that youth service Canada has helped 12,000 
young Canadians in three years.  Youth internship Canada has 
given work experience to more than 89,000 young people since 
1994.  I also point out that student summer job action had over 
75,000 participants this last summer.  I finally point out that 
approximately 100,000 work experience opportunities are provided 
each and every year. Anyone looking for evidence of the 
effectiveness of the Government of Canada's youth employment 
initiatives need look no further than these figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not get me wrong. This government is always receptive to new 
ideas about ways to improve our youth programs.  We regularly 
consult with our public and private sector partners who help us 
to implement the youth employment strategy.  Partnerships and 
collaboration form the cornerstone of our approach to youth 
programs and are the primary reason for the strategy's 
overwhelming success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want the hon. member to conclude that we are not open 
to his input and support.  We are.  I hope he will recognize that 
his motion is not necessary.  This government is already doing 
its job of ensuring that our programs to put young people into 
jobs are fulfilling their mandates.  That is in the best 
interests of young Canadians and all Canadians and in the best 
interests of this great country of ours.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the new youth 
critic for the Bloc Quebecois, I am pleased to speak today on 
the important issue of young Quebeckers' access to the labour 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today will shed some light on the two 
injustices the federal government is committing with its overall 
program for young people. 
First of all, the Liberal government is unfair to young 
Canadians because its first goal is not to maximize the 
efficiency of its youth programs, but to maximize its visibility 
in the eyes of young people. The government is also unfair to 
Quebec and young Quebeckers, because of the unfair distribution 
of money among the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the motion will demonstrate the lack of openness shown by 
the Liberal government, which will once again object to any 
public review of its programs in order to conceal their 
unfairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before explaining my point of view any further, I will read the 
motion by the member for Madawaska—Restigouche we are debating 
today: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
overhaul all its programs for young people, in order to evaluate 
their impact and performance, and in order to ensure that all 
funds for such programs maximize young people's chances of 
joining the labour force. 
</UL>
<First of all, I would like to stress that we, in the Bloc 
Quebecois, totally agree with this motion. Such a performance 
review of the Liberal government's youth programs would compel 
it to be more transparent. To measure the performance of a new 
program, its goals must be clearly stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In theory, youth programs are aimed at creating jobs. Granted, 
but how many? 
Nobody knows. What everybody knows though is that these programs 
are a blatant intrusion into the provinces' jurisdiction. They 
create more duplication, which is bound to harm our young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion brings to mind one of the basic rules the auditor 
general quotes every year. In order to assess the effectiveness 
of government programs, we must know what their total budget and 
measurable goals are, and be able to measure progress in the 
field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these requirements are not met, taxpayers cannot know whether 
their money is wisely invested. This is a situation common to 
young people in Quebec and Canada as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, if the Liberal government is refusing to assess the 
impact of these programs, it is not because it ignores basic 
accounting rules. 
It is because the first objective of the government's youth 
strategy has nothing to do with employment for young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Minister of Human Resources Development 
himself, the ultimate objective of that program is to, and I 
quote “continue to work to keep our country strong and united”. 
He said that in the House of Commons last year on October 2, 
1997, in a formal speech in response to the Speech from the 
Throne. It is now clear that the strong and united country he is 
trying to impose on Quebeckers will be brought about by 
attractive and highly visible programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarship fund is a very good example of a 
program that completely disregards the real needs of the young 
people of Quebec, of a program where visibility is the priority. 
First, it duplicates the Quebec loans and bursaries program. On 
average, Quebec students already have a smaller debt load than 
their counterparts in the rest of Canada: $11,000 compared to 
$25,000. In Quebec, tuition fees are about half what they are in 
the rest of Canada: $1,700 compared to 3,200$. Moreover, Quebec 
is the only province to award bursaries on the basis of 
financial need. The others only give loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, as the prime minister said in this House, the visibility of 
the program is not negotiable, no matter what choices Quebeckers 
made collectively concerning their education system. This is a 
totally unacceptable situation, but there is worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the money to finance such encroachments in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction coming from? 
The budget surplus was reached by robbing the provinces of 
transfer payments, for education in particular. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government must now impose cuts of several hundred 
million dollars on its education system. This is one of the 
tangible results of federal budget cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the federal government takes the money from one 
pocket and puts it in the other one, after stamping it with the 
Canadian flag. It has absolutely no concern for the provinces, 
which are responsible for consistently managing their education 
system as a whole, or for young people who gain nothing from 
being used by a government willing to do anything to promote its 
strong and united nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money for these highly visible programs also comes from 
employment insurance reform. 
The fund surplus, which will reach $20 billion by the end of the 
year, was achieved mainly by excluding many young people from 
entitlement to benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, since these limitations have 
been imposed, thousands of young Quebeckers have had to go on 
welfare. The numbers speak from themselves: the 
recipient-unemployed ratio went down from 72% in 1990 to 26% in 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, more young people than ever before pay premiums, while only 
one young person out of four is entitled to benefits if faced 
with unemployment. But do they receive this money back in the 
form of active measures, as the government claims? 
Let us compare the amounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to spend as it pleases the $20 billion 
surplus that will accumulate this year in the employment 
insurance fund whereas, for the same year, it plans on spending 
$391 million for all youth programs, which is less than 2% of 
the amount taken from workers and businesses who pay EI 
premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the federal government is hindering the academic 
training of our young people by contributing to the 
deterioration of the education system in Quebec. It makes our 
young people poorer by forcing them to go on welfare instead of 
making them eligible for EI benefits. And, to make itself look 
good and to promote a strong and united Canada, it fills 
university and city newspapers with ads praising its youth 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As suggested in today's motion, it is high time the House of 
Commons as well as Canadians and Quebeckers examine the real 
objectives of the Liberal government's cynical youth strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures are just as disturbing with regard to Quebec's fair 
share. Of the $391 million earmarked for federal youth programs, 
Quebec gets only $63 million. That is only 16% of the allocated 
funds, even though we represent 25% of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, effectiveness is not the ultimate goal for these 
programs. The federal government has already recognized that the 
provinces are in a better position to meet this type of need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what led the Liberals to give Quebec full responsibility 
for manpower training before the last federal election. 
If it was fine just before the election, why is the federal 
government now rejecting any opting out by the provinces, which 
could then keep on working in close co-operation with those 
affected by these programs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, a significant reduction in EI premiums would 
result in the creation of tens of thousands of jobs. As it 
stands now, small and medium size businesses are penalized by 
the regressive payroll taxes of the federal government. The end 
result is that the way we are financing the EI system not only 
kills jobs by increasing the cost of labour, but kills a great 
deal of them in the businesses that tend to create most jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used a few examples to show that a good youth strategy is not 
necessarily a strategy that will give the most visibility to the 
federal government. 
I support motion M-213 because it would help us make a clear 
distinction between these two fundamentally different goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a review would demonstrate once and for all that the 
federal government has lost touch with the young, because of its 
obsession with visibility.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the problem of youth unemployment has been one of the more 
persistent difficulties in Canada in recent times.  Though I have 
problems with the motion before us, I commend the member for his 
attention to a very pressing need in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin by saying that my overall concern with the 
motion introduced by my colleague from the Progressive 
Conservative Party is that it seems to share the Liberal Party 
assumption that the problem of youth unemployment can be fixed by 
improved government programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we are talking about increasing the size of government 
programs or merely restructuring and re-focusing those programs, 
the motion as it stands assumes that specific government programs 
are the answer rather than focusing on government policies across 
a much broader front, policies that would create an environment 
in which the problem could be solved by young people, by 
educational institutions and by employers themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That such a broader view of this problem is needed was confirmed 
last week by the study entitled “Hire Expectations”, released 
September 30 by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. 
In that survey young people did not view government programs as 
the key to solving this problem.  This was from the mouths of the 
young people themselves.  They did not regard government programs 
as the key. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, of the various groups regarded as being 
responsible for addressing the youth employment issue, government 
ranked lower than the self-reliance of youth themselves, the 
efforts of schools and also behind job referrals from family and 
friends.  In other words, job help by way of government programs 
was way down on the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of youth surveyed, almost 60%, said that finding 
work is primarily their own responsibility.  Less than 10% of the 
respondents said that it is the government's responsibility to 
make sure they have work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is not that students should be left to fend for 
themselves, but rather that our students are smart enough to know 
that direct intervention by the government as urged by the 
present motion is not the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These young people in this extensive study were clearly saying 
that they do not expect the government to be directly—and I 
underline that word—involved in the job creation or job search 
process.  Rather, in their view the government's task is to 
create an environment in which young people have the best chance 
possible of finding meaningful work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians would say that the government has failed on this 
score.  As the authors of the study “Hire Expectations” put it, 
“Despite numerous programs targeting young workers, youth 
employment rates have not significantly dropped in the last 20 
years, which suggests the need for new approaches to the issue”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where should the government focus its approach?  The government 
needs to lower payroll taxes, as a beginning, on small business 
and create a more tax friendly environment for small and medium 
size businesses.  Incidentally, a reduction in employment 
insurance premiums would be a good place to start.  Instead of 
raiding the EI surplus, as the Minister of Finance has intended 
to do, a reduction for these small businesses would be of great 
assistance to the problem of youth employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study also revealed a genuine willingness on the part of 
small businesses to hire young people.  Business owners 
emphasized that they were not looking simply for skills, but also 
for enthusiasm and a willingness to learn.  This willingness to 
hire young people is especially true of new firms which are 
likely to have twice the proportion of young employees compared 
to older businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that tells us something very significant.  It tells us 
that if the government could bring itself to create an 
environment in which business start-ups are attractive, this 
would have a tremendous positive effect upon employment 
opportunities for youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But 40% of these small businesses also said that payroll taxes, 
which are a barrier to hiring, are far too high.  Small business 
is not presently confident that the government is intent on 
lowering the costs associated with hiring someone.  They do not 
believe there is any genuine effort to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the study “Hire Expectations” had to say about 
the broader economic environment in which jobs are created for 
young people.  It also had some needed advice for governments. 
At the most basic level this study warned that government should 
avoid make-work programs.  Such schemes, they said, affect only a 
small minority of youth and have more political value than actual 
substantive value for young Canadians looking for work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The level at which government has a genuine contribution to make 
is in the role of facilitator, encouraging communication among 
educators, employers and youth.  I want to emphasize again in the 
context of the present discussion that this must-read study, 
“Higher Expectations”, urges greater facilitation by 
government, not direct intervention by government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good example of an area in which facilitation is needed is in 
the area of education.  The study revealed a lack of interaction 
between schools and businesses, and youth feel that school does 
not prepare them for the transition into the workplace.  They 
report experiencing a form of culture shock when they begin their 
working life.  They indicated that they wanted a better 
understanding of the workplace before they leave school, 
university or college.  This suggests that a greater role could 
and should be played by co-op education in Canada.  We could talk 
about apprenticeship programs as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-op education and other kinds of measures have proven to be an 
effective means of smoothing the transition from school to the 
workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I cannot support the motion as stated, I thank the member 
for raising this very important issue in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to rise in the House today to speak in support of 
this motion.  I would like to congratulate the member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche for bringing forward what I think is a 
very thoughtful and reflective motion which needs to be seriously 
addressed by this House and certainly by the Government of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was surprising to hear the government member across the way 
say earlier that this motion is not necessary.  I was very 
surprised to hear that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it possible that they believe the motion is not necessary 
because it would actually be an embarrassment for the Liberal 
government to go forward and, as this motion states, overhaul all 
of its programs for young people in order to evaluate their 
impact and performance and in order to ensure that all funds for 
such programs maximize young people's chances of joining the 
labour force?  Who could disagree with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very surprising to hear the Reform member and the Liberal 
member actually speak against this motion, which I think is 
something that could well be done and from which we would get a 
lot of benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In looking at this motion I think it is incumbent upon us to 
actually look at what is the situation for young people in Canada 
today.  Unfortunately, the facts present a very gloomy picture 
for young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government announced its youth employment strategy in 
February 1996 there were 2,065,000 youth who were employed.  But 
the StatsCan figures for November 1997 show that there were 
2,039,700 young people who were employed.  That is a drop of over 
26,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact youth unemployment is at 16.8%, up from 15.7% in 
February 1996.  As we all know, those are only the official 
numbers.  The real numbers are much higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since February 1996 when the government first announced its 
major youth employment strategy, and we heard today a very rosy 
picture about that, the reality is that 48,300 more young 
Canadians are out of work.  It is not a rosy picture at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even according to the CIBC, one of the major banks in Canada, 
about one in four youth, aged 15 to 24, has never held a job. 
That is more than double the rate in 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can government members stand here today and tell us that we 
do not have a crisis?  This motion should be supported today 
because there is a crisis in this country for young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1997 the proportion of the youth labour force with 
no job experience was 24%.  That is up from 9.8% in December of 
1989.  There are so many statistics that it is just 
mind-boggling.  What the trend really shows is that throughout 
this decade there has been a continuing drop in the participation 
of young people in the labour market.  There is persistent high 
youth unemployment.  There is just no getting away from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, there has been growth in involuntary part time 
employment.  At the same time there has been a decline in real 
wages.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has often been characterized as the recovery from the 1990s 
has basically bypassed young people.  They are still, to a great 
extent, very marginalized and do not have the kinds of 
opportunities that we hear in the rhetoric and the propaganda 
coming from government members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask the question of how we address youth 
unemployment.  We in the NDP believe that two key issues need to 
be addressed.  One is through education and the second one is 
through a comprehensive youth employment strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we agree—I think all members would agree—that education is 
the key for our young people then we also have to ask why the 
government is attacking post-secondary education.  As my 
colleague from the PC who presented this motion pointed out, the 
attack and the assault on post-secondary education is simply 
unprecedented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal youth strategy must be seen in the context of the 
massive cuts to post-secondary education in Canada.  It becomes 
just an empty promise for the government to say that it wants 
young people to get jobs.  It knows they have to go on to 
post-secondary education to obtain jobs, but it does not really 
care that tuition fees have skyrocketed, that student debt has 
gone up and that university and colleges are less and less 
accessible.  That is the reality facing young people when it 
comes to education today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even Human Resources Development Canada tells us that 45% of new 
jobs by the year 2000 will require post-secondary education.  The 
reality is that the ability of young people to get into 
post-secondary education is more and more limited, particularly 
for low income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1995 the federal Liberals have cut $1.5 billion from 
federal funding for post-secondary education.  Since 1980 the 
Liberal and Conservative governments—we have to put this on 
record and look at the historical context—have cut federal 
funding from $6.44 for each dollar of student fees to less than 
$3.  We see the real decline in support for post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tuition fees over the last 10 years climbed by 240%. What an 
absolutely shocking statistic. Tuition fees in Canada have 
reached a national average of $3,100.  That is higher than the 
average tuition fees of publicly funded universities in the 
United States.  The story goes on and on.  Student debt is up 
from $13,000 in 1993 when the Liberals took power to $25,000 now. 
Student bankruptcies have increased 700% since 1989.  The picture 
is very grim.  Given this situation, one would hope that the 
government would be assessing and reviewing its commitment to 
support post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did we have yesterday?  The Minister for International 
Trade attended the second annual Canadian education industry 
summit and actually talked about further industrialization and 
privatization of post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is quoted in the Toronto <I>Star</I> today is the minister 
saying that education is an industry and that Canada needs to 
improve its marketing.  This is how the government sees education 
now.  It does not see it as a social investment, not as something 
that we provide as a societal responsibility to our young people, 
but simply as a marketing strategy, as something that the private 
sector wants to get its hands on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that we need to identify our markets, develop 
and promote our products, differentiate them from those of our 
competition, and create business plans to bring all those 
elements together.  Does this sound like we are talking about 
post-secondary education?  It sounds like we are talking about 
the private sector to me, but that is what one of our cabinet 
ministers is saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of a comprehensive strategy is a youth 
employment strategy.  We have to point out that $129 million of 
the $345 million allocated to youth job creation programs go to 
short term summer jobs.  There is no emphasis on the long term 
investment that needs to be made for young people.  Virtually 
none of these programs are targeted at economically and socially 
disadvantaged youth. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research has shown that to help such young people the programs 
must be targeted specifically and be designed to meet their very 
unique needs.  Unfortunately these programs do not exist.  Most 
of the Liberal youth programs benefit the most highly educated 
young people, which cynics say is more about cheap labour than 
real opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should be done?  We can learn by example from my province 
of British Columbia where our premier, Premier Clark, has made a 
personal commitment to make youth a priority. We have an 
extensive summer job program.  We have environmental youth teams 
and environmental youth groups.  We provide first jobs to 
graduates in science and technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is entrepreneurial training for young people.  There are 
thousands of jobs that have been created in B.C. crown 
corporations.  In fact the B.C. government's record when it comes 
to supporting post-secondary education has been superlative in 
comparison to what the Liberal government has done.  In fact our 
B.C. minister has called for a national tuition freeze on 
national grants program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I say that this is a very good motion.  It 
deserves our support.  We need to make that commitment to the 
young people of Canada, to evaluate the Liberal programs and to 
expose the fact that they are not helping the young people of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have about three 
minutes remaining in the debate.  The hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Louis has three minutes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in the three minutes that you have granted me I would 
like to address some remarks related to those of the MP for 
Rosemont.  I heard his diatribe.  I do not know how long he 
spoke.  It seemed endless.  All of it was laced with the usual 
contempt for everything federal:  all the faults in Quebec are as 
a result of the federal government.  It is due to the federal 
government that unemployment is very high in Quebec.  It is due 
to the federal government that the economy is so bad and so many 
youth have to find work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amazingly enough, I never hear a word about the provincial 
Government of Quebec.  I never hear a word about the problems 
caused by wanting to have one referendum after another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Referendum fever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  Referendum fever.  In October 1995 
we went through a searing referendum, a divisive issue which put 
Quebec on hold for months at a time before, after and certainly 
during. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  It scares business away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  It scares business away like 
nothing else.  What does the Quebec government, the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois have for a solution for young 
people and for older people?  It is:  “Let us have another 
referendum”.  Then when they lose the next one, the third one in 
a row, they will say that is not enough, that the people have not 
spoken, and they want to have another one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has the cheek to come here, paid by federal taxes 
supplied by people in the maritimes, British Columbia, Alberta 
and throughout Canada to give him a platform to rain on the 
federal parade and blame everything under the sun on the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent nine years in the National Assembly of Quebec and I 
remember the debates.  It is almost like a time warp.  It is the 
same old thing.  Everything under the sun in Quebec that was 
going wrong was due to the federal government.  If it rained it 
was federal rain.  If it was cloudy it was a federal cloud. 
Anything that happened was federal.  If one was sick it was due 
to the federal government.  If people were not employed it was 
due to the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sick and tired of this diatribe.  What we need in Quebec is 
another climate to realize that a lot of people want to take 
their time to accent quality of life and the things that matter 
to them such as education, social issues and work. If more accent 
is put on those things in Quebec rather than referendums and the 
separation of Quebec, we would all be better off.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We are down to the 
last five minutes of Private Members' Business and the mover of 
the motion, the hon. member for Madawaska—Restigouche, has given 
the hon. member for St. John's West his last five minutes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Madawaska—Restigouche for giving me this 
five minutes to address an issue which is probably the most 
serious one that faces the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, 
and probably all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resolution simply asks in a very non-partisan way to allow 
the House of Commons to assess, to evaluate and to appraise the 
250 different programs to help young people get involved in the 
labour force in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the NDP member for Vancouver East who had some 
excellent suggestions on how we should go about this.  Obviously 
education is key to what any of us would understand as creating a 
higher employment rate in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for the Reform is a little misguided and could easily 
support this resolution.  We believe, as does the Reform member, 
that there are better ways.  Probably we could in a non-partisan 
way finds ways to help young people in Canada.  The Liberal 
member obviously thinks that everything they are doing is 
absolutely perfect.  That is just simply not the truth or the 
reality in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of good programs.  I read a memo from the 
Minister for Human Resources Development the other day.  It 
mentioned a whole range of programs and some with success ratios 
that are very high, like the youth internship program.  Some 88% 
of the people who took part in that program are either presently 
working or are back in studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very successful program, but we wonder if all the 250 
programs handled by several different departments are as equally 
successful.  We believe a review should be done.  The review 
could be very simple.  It could be done by an all party 
parliamentary committee of the House, or it could be done by an 
outside person who is non-partisan, just to find out if these 
programs are getting to the people who really deserve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the programs are excellent.  There is no question that 
in St. John's West this summer we had over 1,200 students working 
in student programs.  The Government of Canada saw it as a high 
priority to make sure there was student employment so that some 
students could actually save money toward their education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The training allowances for adults and young adults are very 
meaningful.  In our office in Newfoundland the highest ratio of 
phone calls that we get is from people trying to get assistance 
in training and to get back to school.  They have come to the 
realization that without better education there is not much 
chance of a better job or a better life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know what is the success rate of all the other 
programs.  We would like to know and the Government of Canada 
should want to know.  If we have 250 programs obviously some 
might not be as productive and some might not be targeted to the 
right groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern in our caucus is that if there is 250 programs 
spread over six or seven different government departments, what 
are the administration costs?  If $2 billion is being spent on 
250 programs with several government departments, what are the 
administrative costs?  Is it 10% or $200 million?  Is it 30% or 
$600 million?  We want a review to find out how much money is 
spent on administration and to make sure that as much money as 
possible is directed to the three groups of Canadians the 
programs are designed for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the labour force basically there are three 
groups in Canada.  The first is young Canadians working within 
Canada who are contributing to our country, their provinces and 
their family.  Many of these workers were assisted by programs 
such as the Canada student loans program and training allowances. 
Many are also so heavily in debt that for many years they cannot 
contribute fully to the Canadian economy.  They will not be able 
to buy homes and new cars and start their own businesses. Maybe 
there is a better way to set up the student loan system to allow 
Canadians to get an education, to work here and not be so heavily 
in debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another group of young Canadians are those who are working 
outside the country.  Why are they working outside the country? 
It is because of the lack of opportunities in Canada, the high 
tax rate and those kinds of problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another group I want to touch on, especially in Newfoundland, is 
the vast number of young Canadians who are living unemployed in 
Canada.  Often they are undereducated and living on temporary 
assistance programs from the government which really become 
permanent assistance programs from their parents and family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a call today from one of my constituents who contributed 
to the EI surplus and is now on welfare.  That EI surplus could 
be used to help get Canadians back to work, which was the 
original intent of the EI program.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very proud, on behalf of my hon. colleague for 
Halifax West, to speak on behalf of the 223 Volvo workers and 
their families in Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day in this House the Minister of Industry said the 
closure of the Volvo plant has nothing to do with Bill C-11, the 
auto tariff reduction bill, and that the plant is not moving to 
Mexico.  Obviously a memory lapse seems to have happened on the 
cabinet side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote some editorial sections.  They are very true. 
The company plans to assemble S70 and V70 model automobiles, the 
same automobiles currently built in Halifax, at a plant at its 
bus division that it recently purchased for $70 million in the 
U.S. and Mexico.  There is a sense from everybody in Nova Scotia, 
especially those workers and families, that Ottawa played a key 
role in sacrificing the Halifax plant's future when it decided in 
the last round of world trade talks to lower auto tariffs from 
18% down to just over 6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, the Halifax small plant was valuable to Volvo 
because it gave the firm the right to import cars to Canada under 
duty free under the auto pact.  Yet Ottawa made no contingency 
plans for the possible impact of a tariff reduction on a major 
employer here.  All we ask is that someone go down there and 
assist those workers in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Volvo states the Halifax plant is too small for the 8,000 car 
units it builds every year, yet it wants to start up a 1,000 car 
operation in Mexico.  It does not make any sense, but that is 
what it is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Volvo states that it is going to build buses in Mexico.  It just 
purchased a bus plant.  I ask Volvo and I ask the minister what 
does that do to Prevost Car Inc. and Novabus in Quebec?  What 
happens to the 1,400 workers in Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Volvo plant workers are very disappointed with the federal and 
provincial government response to their crisis. Right now the CAW 
union along with members of the board of commerce and whoever 
else will go are planning a trip to Sweden to try to get Volvo to 
change its mind and do something for the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all Canadians know, after the recent Swissair fatal crash off 
the coast of Peggy's Cove in Nova Scotia, the world got to know 
exactly what Nova Scotians are made of.  We are compassionate. 
We are caring.  We are giving.  We are salt of the earth people, 
as all Atlantic Canadians are. Why would a profitable company not 
want to stay here and utilize that valuable workforce to meet its 
needs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The workers and I are very disappointed with a memo I received 
from sources within Volvo about the severance package given to 
these workers. It says anybody who criticises this measly 
severance will be terminated from the severance package.  They 
will have no access at all.  What kind of a democracy do we live 
in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak on behalf 
of the 223 great, hardworking workers of Nova Scotia and their 
families.  I only wish that this government would think before it 
enacts laws that destroy the jobs and the economy of Nova 
Scotians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on September 9 Volvo announced 
it was shutting down its vehicle assembly plant in Halifax on 
December 18, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is acutely aware of the importance of 
this plant to Halifax. On October 5 the Minister of Industry 
wrote to Volvo to express the disappointment and regret of the 
Government of Canada with its decision and the loss of the 223 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The closure is part of Volvo's worldwide restructuring strategy 
and the plant is not being moved to Mexico as the NDP questioner 
implies.  Volvo has acquired a Mexican bus and coach manufacture 
which will be the primary business.  I understand it will also 
produce a limited number of vehicles, around 1,000 for the local 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Volvo's Halifax plant built vehicles for the Canadian market and 
never sold those vehicles in Mexico.  Volvo's plans for Mexico 
are completely unrelated to the closing of the Halifax plant. 
Closing of the Volvo plant has absolutely nothing to do with Bill 
C-11 and obviously the member does not understand what is in 
C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to point out that the federal government has done its 
part by ensuring that the business climate in Canada is 
favourable and conducive to the continued prosperity of the 
automotive assembly industry.  The fact is that Canada remains a 
very competitive location for vehicle manufacturing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Volvo itself remains a major transportation company in Canada 
with $1.8 billion in annual sales and more than 4,600 employees 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada will continue to work with the local 
organizations in the Halifax region, with Volvo and with the 
Canadian Auto Workers, CAW, to find a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Walter Fitzgerald, the mayor of the Halifax Regional 
Municipality, has formed a task force which includes the province 
of Nova Scotia, the Greater Halifax Partnership group, the CAW, 
and the federal government through ACOA to explore alternative 
uses for the facility and to ensure that the port of Halifax is 
in Volvo's future transshipment plans in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to support all stakeholders seeking a positive 
solution to this announced closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly 
this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.37 p.m.)
