Serge Marcil (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege today to speak at third reading of the bill that amends the Canada National Parks Act to withdraw lands from Riding Mountain National Park of Canada and Pacific Rim National Park Reserve of Canada for the purpose of Indian reserves. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes relating to the withdrawal of lands are for the purpose of alleviating serious problems of housing shortage on the Esowista reserve of the Tla-o-qui-aht first nation. In the case of the Riding Mountain National Park, they will correct an error in the wording of the legal description of the ceded lands, in compliance with a specific land claim.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to reiterate that Bill C-28 will not create a precedent for other national parks. These are unique circumstances we must collectively consider. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Pacific Rim National Park Reserve was created in 1970, it completely surrounded the seven-hectare parcel of land occupied by the Esowista reserve of the Tla-o-qui-aht first nation since 1889. At the time, Esowista was changing from a seasonal fishing camp to a permanent residential community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada recognized that a larger site would eventually be required to meet the needs of the Esowista community, and it committed to finding a long-term solution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The removal of the 86.4 hectares of land from Pacific Rim National Park Reserve will help   address the acute overcrowding problem in the Esowista reserve, improve infrastructures to remedy sewage disposal and water quality concerns, and support the development of a model community that will exist in harmony with the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This land represents less than 1% of the park’s total land base. Withdrawing this land from the territory now occupied by the park will only slightly impact the ecological integrity of the park and will allow us to meet the needs of the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1929, when Riding Mountain National Park was created, it took in most of Indian Reserve No. 61A. The Ojibway Keeseekoowenin First Nation was relocated to another site outside the national park. In 1994, an agreement for the settlement of the specific land claim was signed between the Ojibway Keeseekoowenin and Canada and Reserve No. 61A was restored. In 2000, most of the lands in question were removed from the Riding Mountain site when the Canada National Parks Act was enacted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, because of a mistake made during the preparation of the official instrument removing the lands in question, a five-hectare tract of land was omitted and remained within the park's boundaries. Therefore, the Canada National Parks Act will be amended to restore Reserve No. 61A of the Ojibway Keeseekoowenin First Nation in its entirety, and to correct the mistake made at the time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about environmental considerations? Removing 86.4 hectares from Pacific Rim National Park Reserve will not unduly detract from the objectives of ecological integrity for the park because the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation has promised to cooperate with Parks Canada to ensure long-term protection for the natural and cultural resources of the lands in the park surrounding the Esowista reserve.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation and the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development have committed to use the land in a way that would respect the ecological integrity of the park. Also, several measures will be taken to help promote the sustainable development of the park.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management of the lands to be withdrawn from the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve will be based on the guidelines for model communities developed by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parks Canada will review the master plan for the site and then submit it for approval to the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. Also, each individual project will be subject to an assessment pursuant to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure proper protection to the lands adjacent to the park, a $2.5 million mitigation fund will be provided to Parks Canada by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.</p>


	<A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also point out that the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development will not require additional funding for the Esowista expansion. It is expected that 160 housing units will be needed, 35 of them in the short term.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the five hectares to be withdrawn from Riding Mountain Park, this is a requirement from the 1994 specific land claim agreement. I can reassure Canadians that this amendment to the Canada National Parks Act has no environmental impact.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultations on these initiatives indicate wide public support. Several stakeholders have expressed their support for the withdrawal of land from Pacific Rim Park. Among these are the first nations involved, first nations provincial groups, local, regional and provincial levels of government, as well as non-government environmental organizations, for example, Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, the Western Canada Wilderness Committee, the Friends of Clayoquot Sound and the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All parties concerned view Esowista as a unique situation, and they support the need to make sure that members of the community stay together, and to provide lands for residential and similar purposes. I thank them for their support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the priorities in Parks Canada's recent ministerial plans has been to strengthen relations with native communities. Our accomplishments in Pacific Rim Park clearly demonstrate our commitment to them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pacific Rim National Park Reserve has taken significant strides in recent years to promote aboriginal initiatives, forging relationships and making significant efforts toward the meaningful involvement of aboriginal  people in the cooperative management of the national park reserve. The results have been remarkable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of illustration I would like to highlight a few of these accomplishments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pacific Rim National Park Reserve worked with the Ucluelet First Nation to develop the Nuu-chah-nulth Trail inside the national park. Opened in 2003, this interpretive trail provides extensive on site interpretation of regional first nations' culture, history and language.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 23, 2004, the Ucluelet First Nation will again honour the opening of the trail by erecting the first totem pole to be carved and raised in traditional territory of this first nation in 104 years, a source of great pride for this first nation community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This “welcoming” pole will greet Canadians and international visitors to the trail and to Ucluelet First Nation and Nuu-chah-nulth traditional territory. It will symbolize the long history and continuing presence of first nations peoples in the region and in the national park in particular.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the West Coast Trail unit of Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, Parks Canada funds an initiative called Quu'as West Coast Trail Society. A not-for-profit group, this society is a training and mentoring program for three first nations along the famous West Coast Trail, one of the world's great recreational hiking routes.    </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By engaging in the cooperative management of the west coast trail with Parks Canada, young first nations members are exposed to the full gamut of park management issues and training related to public safety, resource conservation, monitoring and public interpretation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this program, first nations graduates have gone on to secure full-time employment with Parks Canada, other agencies and industry.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong community relations are the basis for a wide range of formal and informal agreements that can advance our common interests. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that this transfer of park lands for the purpose of an Indian reserve will help meet the needs of treaty negotiations and will create a better working climate with native communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to warmly salute the Government of British Columbia for its support of this initiative regarding the expansion of Esowista. This collaboration is key to the withdrawal of lands from Pacific Rim and their transfer to the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development for the needs of Indian reserves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge all members of the House to join me in supporting Bill C-28.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, Esowista is in Pacific Rim National Park, which is in my riding.  We certainly support the initiative.  However the big disappointment   is the fact that when the  memorandum of understanding, which  was worked out between the  Tla-o-qui-aht  Band and parks officials  with a lot of hard work, was signed back in June,  nobody bothered to inform the local MP, myself, or our party about this  agreement being reached until     on the eve of our last break when  there was no time for our party to discuss this issue.  I know the local band was really upset about this because now we are trying to get this bill through quickly on the eve of an election.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   want to ask the parliamentary secretary why his government does not see fit to involve the local MP, especially once an agreement is signed.  Does he think this is a good way to establish a collaboration of doing what is right for Canadians and advancing good work that has been done by Parks Canada?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for consulting, I know that several attempts were made to meet with the opposition critic. The director of the Parks Canada Agency had also offered to meet him to discuss the project  and give him some  information. There might have been some shortcomings in that regard and we apologize for that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this bill is in no way partisan. All this is done  in order to solve a longstanding problem. Of course, it took a while for the whole consultation process with the communities to help us solve the problem. It was more a humanitarian and logic gesture that  had to be made by the government in this regard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the surrounding communities, everybody agreed. There is no land taken away from those people. Nobody lost anything. We are giving part of the park back to an Indian community who is suffering from a major demographic problem, in order to help that community expand a little. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was listening to my colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot yesterday when he was talking about the housing problem in the aboriginal communities. This is a good example. This bill will help them go forward with the construction of new housing units. It will also allow an aboriginal community to enjoy a better quality of life. </p>

	Mr. Speaker,   things seem to change  very rapidly in the House and this being a Friday it is expected that things get juggled around. However I was a  little disappointed with Bill C-30, which  was listed first and dealt with the budget, because I wanted to address the concerns of some  people   in Saskatchewan who were  hurt by an audit that  took place on  amateur sports and which was not addressed in the budget. I brought this matter to the House two years ago and nothing has been done since then.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though this will probably be my last day in the House and last activity, I will not be done with that infraction against the province of Saskatchewan.  I will have to take that up in public life.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first looked at Bill C-28 I could see nothing wrong with it.  I could see that the bill, as it was presented to me, was to take some land from a park and   add it to a reserve, mainly on the west side of Vancouver Island, to provide for additional housing and the growth of that particular community.  That in itself I do not think any Canadian would deny.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill  also deals with the Riding Mountain National Park in the province of Manitoba. There was an error there but I think that can be corrected.   I do not think we will find any opposition to that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I look at the map of this area  I see  a number of little pieces of land which are listed as being Indian reserve land, IR, but nobody lives on them.  They are not a place to live, even though they are on reserve, but what the bill would do  for these 10 reserves is to provide that these people have additional land, as my hon. colleague mentioned, for the building of houses and so on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What bothers me about this is that we have not heard anyone in the House talk about it.   However  I have not had this assignment long enough to know if indeed there has been any other action or opposition to the bill.  I have never had the opportunity, and maybe that is my fault, to know if any environmental groups are opposed to it.  I have not had the opportunity to know if all the other politically elected people, including in the province of British Columbia and the local municipal people, are totally in agreement with it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems   we have with the bill  is that we are being asked to support the bill on the eve of an election and yet I, for instance,  do not have all  the information that I would like to have.  I understand that access to the ocean and the beach will remain public but that point is one of the points that is under the memorandum of understanding and a memorandum of understanding is not a legal document.  It  can be cancelled at the snap of a finger. That  causes me concern because, not only does that national park belong to the first nations who live there, but it belongs to everybody. Therefore, a memorandum of understanding, in my opinion, is not sufficient.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do know that  the Canadian Parks, the  Wilderness Society and other groups have supported this but the Province of British Columbia has interest in the lands and I do not know for sure if it has totally given us the green light to go ahead with it.   It concerns me a great deal when a piece of property within the province of British Columbia does not have the total okay of the provincial government.  I think we should stop for a moment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, I know a family who lives just miles away from the Grasslands National Park in southern Saskatchewan.  If there were to  be a change or alteration, that would affect them a great deal.</p>


	<A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the first people who would be affected and consulted would be the RMs of Mankota and Glen McPherson,  and then it would go on to affect the provincial government. I cannot find if it has the total consent of the province of British Columbia. That concerns me.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there are also concerns with the land use agreement. To bring the land use agreement up at the eleventh hour, which we are in now, bothers me a great deal.  We have only heard from the groups supporting the agreement. We have not heard from any groups who are opposed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no groups who are opposed, that would be great.  However, I have been around this place long enough to know that there is always someone opposed and always someone from which the committee and the House should hear. from.  We have not done that and that makes me walk very gingerly on this  bill.  We have not heard from those who are in opposition. I have not and I understand that others have not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, hidden in this beautiful piece of legislation about a beautiful part of Canada, with a great idea for expansion for native housing, that I do not pick up the paper five years from now or even two years from now and see that the bill had a bit of a cynical trick to it. I have concerns that this bill is coming before the House  at the eleventh hour.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its own, I can assure the House that I would have no reason to object to this, nor would my party.  However, the procedure is questionable and I worry about that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This could be one of my last speeches in the House and I would not want to dare say that I suspect there is something wrong on the other side. Do not clap yet, because I will come back, even as a ghost, to haunt the House if this changes. I will be like MacArthur.  I will be back because the bill is too important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill will go through the Senate.  Knowing what the Senate did with Bill C-250, I do not trust it  either.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a report of the Auditor General it states, “To promote accountability for implementation measures, we support the annual reporting of treaties and land claims consistent with the recommendations of chapter 9”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does not do that and therein lies my concerns.  Does the bill have to pass right now?  Is it really necessary for the next election? I cannot see any reason.  I do not know any reason why I should not support it, but we have some very deep concerns. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On comes the bill with very little discussion. I have not been assigned to this long enough to even know if it has been discussed in committee, let alone having the opportunity to invite people so we could have this discussion in committee.  We have not had that.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I hope, as I have said, that I do not have to come back here, even as a member to appear before the committee.     I hope the government does not deceive me, or the House or my party,  on any of the things  I have mentioned, including taking away access to the beaches. If that portion of a beautiful national park is destroyed, all on the basis of a memorandum  of understanding, that is not good enough for me, and I do not believe it is good enough for the people of British Columbia or the people of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it possible to hold the bill for a short time until it goes through the legal process?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I simply want to reassure my colleague that, indeed, the government of British Columbia has been consulted, since it even signed the agreement. It is a major partner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also told you earlier that we have already met all the major groups that we would have probably invited to appear before the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development. Parks Canada has discussed with them, as well as Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, the Western Canada Wilderness Committee, the Friends of Clayoquot Sound, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, federal and provincial governments, regional and district administrations, as well as all provincial groups of first nations members. They were all involved in this negotiation or consultation process. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must always keep in mind that this is a national park and that the reserve is in the national park. Thus, this is only a transfer of lands from the national park to the Indian reserve that is also in this national park.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not taking anything from outside the park. We are not getting anything from anybody. We are simply allowing an aboriginal community to get back some quality of life and to improve its living conditions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I simply want to reassure the member that, indeed, all these people have been met. They unanimously endorsed this project. The government of British Columbia also endorsed it. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the information I have, the province of British Columbia  holds some interests in the lands proposed for the expansion.  Senior members have agreed to deal with this issue as the project moves forward.  My understanding is the British Columbia government signed a memorandum of understanding. I do not think that signature is a rubber stamp that says everything is all well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make my last plea to the member opposite. Why do we not let this take its proper course and see an invitation go out to anyone who could be opposed to the bill so we can hear from them?

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud, generally speaking, of what Parks Canada has done.  I am proud of the procedure that it took in my province with the addition of Grasslands National Park, albeit in two sections.  What Parks Canada did there was far more in the way of an attempt to satisfy everybody than maybe this one.  Therein lies my concern, not against the parks.

	Mr. Speaker, I think the House is back next week, but I am not sure the member for Souris--Moose Mountain will be speaking then.   I want to take this opportunity to wish him well when he retires from this place and to say publicly that he is a very decent human being.  He has become a very good friend over the last number of years, and is one of those people we can learn a lot from. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes there are those of us in politics who are very partisan and let that partisanship affect our friendships.  The member for Souris--Moose Mountain is a partisan Conservative politician, but that has never affected his friendships.  He has become a very good friend over the years. I wish him all the best.  I will miss him around this place.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, my colleague echoed the words I wanted to say.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to the hon. member's speech and  while I do not agree with the entire content of his speech, I want to comment on the individual as opposed to the material that he presented to us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Souris--Moose Mountain is someone I would like to consider as a friend.  We have known each other for a long time.  I had the pleasure of leading a delegation only a few days ago of which he was member.  Actually it is the only time he ever accompanied me on a delegation. I have nothing but excellent memories, not only of sharing that time together, but all the other occasions we had the opportunity to meet here  on Parliament Hill, including receiving delegations from his constituency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was leader of the government in the House,  from time to time he would bring his constituents to my office, which was very ornately decorated.  The hon. member would bring his constituents to see it.  We would sit and chat every now and then, and meet with his constituents.  I know he served them well.  I wish him the very best.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next few days or weeks, however long it is between now and the next election, he intends to tour post offices and community centres in his constituency to thank his constituents. That is a fitting way to end one's career around here.  It is an easier rite of passage than the one that some people are subjected to, which is to leave involuntarily.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know he will have an excellent time meeting his constituents. I know they will show their appreciation to him over the next few days, which is what I am doing now, not only on my own behalf but I am convinced on behalf of all my colleagues as well.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak briefly on Bill C-28.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I too want to salute my colleague from Souris—Moose Mountain and tell him how much I enjoyed making his acquaintance. Even if we did not often have the opportunity to work together, we crossed paths numerous times in the lobby, and he was always truly kind to us. He always had a smile on his face. So I want to wish him a wonderful retirement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, we support Bill C-28, first because it corrects a past error with regard to land transfer agreements. Furthermore, I also salute the initiative to expand the land base of the first nations in question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population growth among the first nations is nearly double that of non-natives. So their need for space and housing is also growing. As my colleague from  Beauharnois—Salaberry indicated, I consider housing for aboriginals to be a top priority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill appears to have the support of all the parties. When a group such as Greenpeace supports a plan, with regard to the environment, that says it all. It means that, environmentally speaking,  there is almost unanimous support for this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was listening earlier to my colleague from Souris—Moose Mountain ask if the non-aboriginal communities in the surrounding areas were consulted. I have another perspective on this plan to transfer lands and negotiate for lands and shared lands, as under the draft agreement with the Innu in Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Europeans first settled here, they did not ask the first nations for permission. When the aboriginals were parked on reserves, 130 years ago, they did not give up their rights to their  lands. However, non-natives thought they  had and exploited those lands without asking for their permission.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when we talk about this kind of agreement and other negotiated land claim agreements and aboriginal land use agreements, we need to keep an open mind and be prepared to make reparations. Legislation like this one is an example.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this alone will not suffice. It is nice to make the reserves larger but, fundamentally, reserves as such are concepts that should be completely eliminated, and negotiations on self-government, along with a valuable land base for aboriginal communities in the future, should be accelerated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is called the inherent right to self-government, also known as ancestral treaty rights, which clearly established, for the most part, the lands that belonged to the first nations when the Europeans first arrived in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in favour of this bill.  It is a step in the right direction as far as an agreement on housing is concerned but I would remind the government that aboriginal housing is in a crisis situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again are the statistics I have been bringing up virtually every day for the past month.  There are 93,000 housing units on the reserves of Quebec and Canada, and a large number of them have problems with major construction defects or generalized mildew and mould.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only do most of the 93,000 units have potential problems, but they have to house 113,000 households.  So there is a shortfall of 20,000 housing units at this time.  On some of the reserves I visited with my colleague from Saint-Maurice—Champlain, there are close to two whole families living in one two-bedroom house.  It is, for example, not unusual to see twelve to fifteen people under one roof.  This makes no sense at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If memory serves, my colleague from Beauharnois—Salaberry has just referred to a project to construct 160 housing units and said that 36 units were needed in the very short term. </p>


	<A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time, thousands of units are urgently needed, so there is an absolute necessity to draw up an emergency plan for the construction of new housing for aboriginal peoples. In Quebec and Labrador along, there would have to be 8,700 built this year, and the plan is for only 450.  The situation is becoming desperate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be readily seen that the Bloc Quebecois is not here just for the sake of opposition.  Despite what they say on the government side, when good government bills are introduced we support them.   This has happened on a number of occasions.  When, on the other hand, they are bad bills and do a disservice to the first nations, or to the population in general, naturally we come down heavily on the government.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people do not clearly understand the role of the opposition, and that includes people like Jean Lapierre, who goes around saying that we must vote on the right side, that is the side of the government, the side of power.   Despite his great experience, he still does not get what the role of the opposition is.  Our role is, basically, to make governments better. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no opposition in a parliamentary system, there is bad government.   Dictatorships is what they are then called.  If Jean Lapierre sides with dictatorial regimes, then he has a problem.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same for the President of the Treasury Board. He says, “Vote for the right party. Vote for the government. The opposition has nothing to offer”. That means he does not understand either and does not grasp the role of the opposition, which is to make much better governments and to reflect views that are slightly different from the government's, but that nonetheless represent the views of people who put their trust in us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even those who do not vote for us expect a strong opposition in order to avoid having a puppet government, a banana republic government that greases its own palm, or the palms of its friends.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the sponsorship scandal. We did a public service. Had it not been for the Bloc Quebecois, no one would have known about the scandal. It would have been covered up. No government Liberal MP, no backbencher—not even a Liberal MP from Quebec—ever once stood up to denounce the sponsorship problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet on the opposition side, we have been talking about it for years. We have asked the government hundreds of questions. If it had not been for the opposition, we never would have known about the nearly $1 billion that was spent to promote Canadian unity and to steal the 1995 referendum from us.  For that was what they did. It was a miscarriage of democracy. Nearly three and a half times more was spent than either camp was allowed to spend under Quebec's Referendum Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This did not bother the federal government. In this case we could say that the government was above the law. It took away Quebec's right to a referendum on sovereignty. Money from taxpayers in Quebec and Canada was used to skew  the referendum in Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any doubt that we lost the referendum by 30,000 votes because the federal government stole it from us? It used our taxes to deliver a hard punch, to thwart democracy and Quebeckers' freedom of choice. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even federalists in  Quebec should be upset because of what happened in 1995. Indeed, these people willingly took part in this democratic exercise. They wanted to debate the issue of Quebec's  political and constitutional future, but the federal government came from behind, totally foiled this democratic debate and stole the referendum. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that we are sovereign in fact, but that the federal government has covered up the result that we should have had in 1995. This is a shame. I am saying this calmly, but I   am enraged. This rage will help me beat Liberal candidates in Quebec. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This aspect alone of what they did in 1995 is an incredible disgrace. It was an act of dishonesty, it was robbery, it was a denial of democracy and it was very reprehensible. They will pay dearly for that. In any case, I am making a commitment today to achieve sovereignty for Quebec and to work very hard in the coming years, regardless of their darn millions. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak this morning on Bill C-28.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An allegation was made a bit earlier today that this bill, somehow, was brought back to the House in a manner that some have felt was premature. Of course, this is not true. In fact, this bill was introduced at first reading, went to second reading and was referred to a committee, which tabled its report on April 27.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am convinced that members remember, as do I, Sessional Paper 8510-373-41, with which we are all very familiar and which states that the committee, in its meetings, made no amendments to the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, parliamentarians who are not members of that committee  have the opportunity to move amendments at report stage, the relevancy of which, amongst other things,  is then considered by the Chair. Since no amendments were introduced in the House, it is quite proper this morning to move forward with this legislation and send it to third reading, debate and then refer it to the other place, which will pass it in due course.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The context of the bill is as follows. On the one hand, as was mentioned earlier, it concerns withdrawing the 86.37 hectares  from the Pacific Rim National ParkReserve in order to increase the Esowista Indian Reserve land base and remedy a serious housing problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the parliamentary secretary for his excellent speech a bit earlier this morning. In passing, he always does a wonderful job in the House, as we all know. His constituents in Beauharnois—Salaberry are well represented, and he will no doubt be re-elected by a healthy majority. He told the House this morning that the changes are being made, not to the park perimeter but to the lands within that perimeter, meaning the lands that will be inside or outside the reserve. That is the sole issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take a few minutes to address this treasure called the Pacific Rim National Park. Every year at Christmas, parliamentarians receive calendars from Western Canada Wilderness Foundation, I believe, which have probably helped us, better  than anything else, to get to know this park. These calendars contain beautiful pictures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the opportunity to visit a very small portion of the park.  It is not, of course, fully accessible to people using conventional means of transport. Some  parts have only water access, for instance.  I have seen part of the park, however, and it is absolutely extraordinary.  In my opinion, all Canadians ought to make this pilgrimage—I would call  it that—to Pacific Rim National Park.  That region of our country, with its mammoth trees and its ecosystem, is absolutely amazing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then—and this of course relates to another park—there is the removal from Riding Mountain National Park of a small parcel of land, 4.75 hectares—which, as a member representing a rural riding, I do consider a small parcel.   The reason for this is merely to correct an administrative error that occurred in the implementation of a 1994 settlement of a specific land claim.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there is the withdrawal of lands, which can be done only by amending the National Parks Act. In other words, this is the only tool available to us to correct that anomaly. </p>


	<A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1055)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The support for this initiative is fairly broad, particularly from the first nations concerned, the provincial  first nations coalitions, the local, regional and provincial administrations, and NGOs concerned with the ecology.  There seem, therefore, to be very little concern about negative impacts on the parks from adjustments to their borders as set out in this bill.  Such groups are always the first to let us know when they think we are doing anything to spoil a park.  This is not the case in this instance. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as environmental impact is concerned, the removal of this small parcel of land will not unduly compromise the ecological integrity of Pacific RIm.  There is no impact at all as far as Riding Mounting is concerned. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I see your signal that it is 11 a.m., so I am prepared to come back after oral question period to continue my explanation of the merits of this bill to my colleagues.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, this government knows no bounds when intruding into the personal lives of Canadians.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider a couple who are separated and divorced but unable to afford separate living quarters. She lives on one floor and he on another in the same house. Revenue Canada reverses their status and treats them as a couple.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, on Sunday as I was waiting for my flight at the Montreal airport, I happened to meet soldiers who were on their way back from Afghanistan for a three-week break at home. One of them was Daniel Dupuis, from the Gaspé and the other Ben Gale, from Cape Breton. Daniel phoned home and his little girl Marie-Christine said, “Daddy, I put on my pretty dress to come meet you at the Quebec City airport later”, and Daniel, this brave solider, had tears in his eyes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours later when I arrived in Ottawa on the same flight as Ben, I saw him on the floor with his two and a half year old son in his arms and I saw his less than six month old baby in mother's arms. This was the first time this family had been together in many weeks because of the father's service in Afghanistan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is when it became very clear to me what sacrifices military families make when their loved ones serve abroad in the name of peace and the fight against terrorism, just as these brave soldiers are doing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of my colleagues in this House, I thank these soldiers and today I also thank their families for the sacrifices they make that far too often go unrecognized. I also thank the nearly 1,900 Canadian soldiers who are deployed to Afghanistan.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. and Mrs. Day were married on April 23, 1929 by Father Henry Barry in the original St. Joseph's Church in Little Bras d'Or, Cape Breton. They have 10 children, 44 grandchildren, 61 great grandchildren, 4 great-great grandchildren and 4 more on the way. That is a total of 119 offspring.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was fortunate to be able to visit Mr. and Mrs. Day at their home to wish them a happy anniversary last Saturday, and what a pleasure it was. They shared a few stories and a few jokes, but in all seriousness, it is obvious why their marriage has lasted 75 years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very rare that we have the opportunity to recognize such a wonderful, long-lasting marriage. Today in the House of Commons I would like to offer congratulations to Mr. and Mrs. Day in celebration of their 75th anniversary.  Along with the community, their family and friends, I wish for  Walter and Regis many more years of continued happiness.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, there is an old baseball saying,  “you can't hit what you can't see”, but  when it comes to trains, one most certainly can.  Fewer than one in four Canadian train cars has proper reflectors and Canadians are killed in preventable car-train collisions regularly because they simply did not see the trains.  The railway companies like to blame driver error, but cars, trucks and  farm implements have had to have reflectors for years, why not trains?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My urban colleagues need to understand that the rural crossings where most of these accidents occur are not equipped with flashing lights, with bells, with whistles, or with guard arms.  The fact is no one in the Conservative Party is asking the government to equip each of the 50,000 uncontrolled crossings in such a manner.  What we are asking for is that reflectors  be placed on all trains.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want the minister to immediately implement a rule which requires the immediate implementation of reflectors.  The United States is planning a reflector program that will be phased in over 10 years.  That is not acceptable to the Conservative Party.  We--</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it appears that the 37th Parliament of Canada will soon come to an end. Many MPs will return to their homes in the various provinces with  memories of having served their constituents here in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My memories are many. I am grateful for the many friends I have on both sides of the House, but the friendships extend beyond that. What about the pages, the security staff, the personnel who help on committees, the  people in the cafeterias and at   the post office, and the bus drivers? The list goes on. They are all wonderful people who  greet us daily with cheerfulness. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will leave behind many wonderful people. As the  MP of  a huge rural constituency, I want to say thanks to them for their great support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say goodbye, I offer my  best wishes to all those people. I hope that perchance we will meet again somewhere, some time. If not, they will be part of my memories for the rest of my life.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday we  unanimously adopted a motion by the member for West Nova declaring 2004 the Year of Acadia. It is appropriate to make such a solemn gesture, in this the 400th anniversary year of the founding of Acadia. My colleague benefited  from the enthusiastic support of the Bloc Quebecois members, “separatist” though they are. We would have liked to have the same kind of support from him at the time of the debate on Motion M-382, following the royal proclamation last December.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is appropriate to recognize the arrival of Samuel de Champlain in the Americas, 400 years ago, I believe we would also render justice to history by also pointing out the determining role played by Pierre Du Gua, Sieur de Mons, in the founding of Acadia.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curiously, the Liberals have chosen the end of April, with an election looming, to make this gesture. I had put forward the proposal by the general assembly  of the Société nationale de l'Acadie here in this House on June 12, 2003. As in the case of the motion recognizing National Acadian Day, this manoeuvre appears to have been carried out with the sole purpose of trying to make the public forget the Liberal government's dubious role in the debate on acknowledging the deportation.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals are habitual offenders when it comes to lowballing federal spending.  The skepticism of Canadians about what their own government tells them has turned into downright disbelief.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the government has doctored the figures to conceal the approximately $800 million for the hidden fund, the existence of which the Prime Minister denied.

	Mr. Speaker, Canadians are wondering where the cabinet ministers went, the ministers who used to protect publicly delivered health care in Canada. There was no new base funding for health care in the budget and  no commitment to any of the recommendations of the Romanow report.  Now we have a health minister calling public delivery of health care a slogan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the minister now rise and give us a guarantee that the Liberals will provide publicly funded and delivered  health care in Canada?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, first, let me make the observation that the budget did indeed include funding for health care: the $2 billion that had been committed to the provinces, plus an incremental $500 million approximately to advance our public health care system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government believes in a publicly funded, publicly delivered, publicly administered single payer health system.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, Canadians know that the Liberal government wants to turn health care over to private industries; after all, the Prime Minister brought an advocate for P3 into his cabinet. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference between the Liberal government's plan for health care and the Conservative  plan is how quickly it will  hand it over to the big corporations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the minister stand up and tell us exactly what the Liberals consider publicly delivered health care to be? Is it public money paying for private profits?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  government is profoundly committed to the principles of the Canada Health Act. We took that experiment in Saskatchewan that was so successful and made it a national reality that is one of the defining characteristics of this country, and we will not see it diminished.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe what the hon. member just said in the House. It is one thing to ask a question  but to make a statement that this government has the attitude toward the people of British Columbia as he just said is   absolutely wrong. His question does not even deserve an answer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are as equally concerned. My department in forestry and research and development is just as interested in solving the problem with the pine beetle in British Columbia as the hon. member is.

	Mr. Speaker, that is nonsense. The province of British Columbia came to the federal government well over a year ago with a five year plan to fight the beetle infestation. It has been waiting and waiting for the federal  government to live up to its responsibility and respect the billions of dollars that have come into its coffers from the forest industry in our province but it  has done nothing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will  ask my question  once again. When will the government stop playing politics with the lives of British Columbians and join in the province's five year pine beetle plan? When will it do this?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, Manitoba's NDP government is trying to stop non-unionized construction companies from participating in the construction of the Red River diversion around the city of Winnipeg. Now the effect of this ideological misadventure will be to raise the cost of the project, some estimates say by as much as $65 million. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the federal government is a fifty-fifty partner in this project  that will  cost $700 million, could   the minister assure the House today that the federal government will not be party to any exercise in forced unionization of Manitoba construction workers?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this is a big issue in Manitoba right now. I have met with the premier and have  had discussions with him about the possible effects of these decisions that were taken after the agreements were signed. I have his assurance that we are working toward a solution.

	Mr. Speaker, that will not  satisfy anybody. Those are just weasel words. The fact is that on the table right now is a proposal that will require forced unionization of Manitoba workers. Workers should decide whether they are unionized or not without the assistance of the federal and provincial governments. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 95% of Manitoba's construction industry is non-unionized. The federal government's silence makes it complicit in the forced unionization of construction workers that is going to increase costs.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, three years after the tabling of the unanimous report of the human resources committee proposing a true reform of the employment insurance program, we are still waiting for the Liberal government to take concrete action and do the right thing by the unemployed and seasonal workers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the government finally stop talking and start acting, and will it commit to voting in favour of EI reform before the elections?  Will it support the motion I will be introducing shortly to that effect?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I do not accept the premise of the hon. member's question.  In fact, we have responded and made changes to employment insurance in the past  three years.  We have invested in excess of $500 million in Quebec for that very purpose.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made changes relating to the small weeks, enabling people to take part time jobs.  The intensity rule has been abolished, the length of the benefit period increased, and the average weekly benefits raised by about 9%.  We continue to make changes, as the minister has already said here in the House.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The House resumed  consideration of the motion that Bill C-28, an act to amend the Canada National Parks Act, be read the third time and passed.
</p>


	<A NAME="Int-914991"></A><a HREF="#Int-914995"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-915016"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill C-28, the amendments to the Canada National Parks Act.  These amendments would allow for the removal of lands from the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve of Canada in British Columbia and the Riding Mountain National Park of Canada in Manitoba, for the purposes of Indian reserves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments to the Canada National Parks Act will serve to respond to a long recognized need in the Pacific Rim and rectify a past error in Riding Mountain positioning these first nations to meet the needs of their communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments seek the removal of 84.4 hectares of land from Pacific Rim National Park Reserve and would allow the Tla-o-qui-aht Reserve to address the critical infrastructure programs that it now faces.  In addition, the amendments to the act would fully re-establish the Keeseekoowenin Ojibway First Nation Reserve 61A on the north shore of Clear Lake in Riding Mountain National Park.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be supporting the bill.  When the bill first came along, it was the view of some of us in the NDP that we would be in opposition to the erosion of the national parks in any way, even if it would satisfy the legitimate claims of a first nation that had an historic right to the property by virtue of traditional use of land or a specific land claim dealing with what was in fact an error made in the survey of assessment of the first nation lands affected, as in the case of the Riding Mountain National Park.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have changed our views since then, after extensive consultation.  I would like to speak just briefly about this issue and how it has evolved.   I will speak mainly about the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve of Canada in the context of the debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to strip away the situation and to see it in its most basic form, we believe that the debate is about section 35 of the Constitution.  Some members may wonder how we would arrive at that, but quite simply, section 35 of the Constitution Act,  1982 deals with aboriginal and treaty rights, but fails to give any definition to those rights.  That is why the Government of Canada has spent the last 22 years in court, since 1982, to give meaning and definition to section 35 of the Constitution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the constitution recognizes aboriginal and treaty rights, it does not say what those aboriginal and treaty rights are.  It is the position of first nations that aboriginal and treaty rights mean some rights, some legitimate claims, to some sharing of land and resources on their traditional land base, not just the narrow finite boundaries of reserve which are not in any way traditional or naturally occurring.They are constructs of the federal government and the Indian Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am talking about the traditional area of land use as demonstrated through traditional land use maps.  From time immemorial, the aboriginal people up and down the west coast, whether it is in the coast Salish or the any number of Tsimshian west coast Salish tribes up and down the west coast of Vancouver Island, have used the area for hunting, gathering, settlement and traditional uses.  They never ceded that territory through the Douglas treaties which predated the rest of the treaties throughout Canada, and certainly not through the treaty areas of Treaties Nos. 1 through 8 in the rest of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their aboriginal and treaty rights were never ceded and signed away in any formal agreement with the Crown, and they remain intact.  Therefore, it is fitting and appropriate, and we feel proud to support this claim today, that this area of the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve of Canada should rightfully be under the direct holding and title of first nations making that claim.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, there is vested interest on many claims.  However, people are satisfied that there has been adequate consultation with local landowners, municipalities, town councils and rural municipalities in the immediate area and that their concerns have been taken into account.     I do not know that anyone has strongly held views about recognizing the aboriginal and treaty rights in these cases.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we deal with the bill, it is a lesson for us all that the Government of Canada and therefore the people of Canada could save themselves an enormous amount of grief, aggravation and cost in the future if we would simply take one step back and get our minds around giving meaning and definition to section 35 of the Constitution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, the Government of Canada is not faring too well in its court challenges in this regard. Virtually every time aboriginal people make claims for recognition of those rights, they are denied by the federal government. First nations have no avenue of recourse but to go to the courts.  They go to the Federal Court and  to the Supreme Court ultimately and they always win. Court cases have been going on for 10 years, 15 years and 20 years, but they are finally concluding in favour of aboriginal people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are letting the courts do the work of Parliament.  It should be up to Parliament to give meaning and definition to section 35.  We have been afraid to or reluctant to do so. I do not know what the reasoning is on the federal government's part in this, but it has never tackled this very thorny issue. It has never embraced it as a priority and conceded that aboriginal people have a right to mud, clay, gravel and sand as much as they want. They can develop it in any way they want to, resourceful as they are.  We have that broad range here in interpretation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that we have to bring forward a special bill dealing with national parks is very sensitive in that it affects aboriginal people and their rights.  The Government of Canada could spend less time seized of this issue if it would dedicate the time, resources and energy to define what aboriginal and treaty rights actually are.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that there is generosity and goodwill among Canadian people.  I think that Canadians are finally ready to recognize that 140 years of social tragedy as it has pertained to aboriginal people is enough.  Our  relationship with aboriginal people in Canada is our greatest failure, and some would say Canada's greatest shame, in that we have allowed these third world conditions to foster within our midst knowing full well that it was all unnecessary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People on the west coast have to be ever cognizant of traditional aboriginal and treaty rights, unceded yet to be finally defined.  In this case, my colleagues and I in the NDP will support this bill.  We would like to see this move forward. It is a step in the right direction, but needs to supplemented with solid action on the issues of treaty resolution, housing on reserves, native children at risk, and many more issues that we know are facing aboriginal people in this country today.</p>

Serge Marcil (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank my colleague from Dartmouth for her intervention and, also, for the short note that she sent me earlier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is quite an important bill. I am proud to be able to sponsor it and to see that members unanimously support it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the park on Vancouver Island, you know that it is a backbencher  who worked extremely hard to make it a national park. This member is now Minister of the Environment and is responsible for parks. This shows clearly that a member does  not have to be a minister to get things changed When he wants to  get involved in an issue and move it forward, he can always do so; he has all the tools to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said earlier that the public  and all the groups have been consulted on this issue. I had told my colleague that the Government of British Columbia had also signed an agreement on this transfer. I also want to point out that the issue is not to transfer a portion of land outside the national park. The reserve is in the national park; it is a part of the park that we would transfer to a reserve in the national park. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will then enrich this aboriginal community. It will improve its living conditions and allow its youth to have access to a certain quality of life. I often talk about the fact that the aboriginal communities have the right to protect their interests. Governments must ensure that they respect and respond as positively as possible to the demands of aboriginal communities that have inherent rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case that my colleague from Dartmouth has raised, it is the whole problem of the demography of this aboriginal community that is involved. It needs more space to develop and to have access to housing. We were talking about 130 new units, including about thirty right away. It is important that this House recognize this legislation as a major change, as a very positive response to an aboriginal community. Aboriginal communities make many claims, often in connection with their rights.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am a member of the youth at risk committee which  has spent a great deal of time studying the issues around the problems facing native children.  Housing on reserves is an extremely important one.  A sense of entitlement, having land, having rights, although abstract, are issues that impact on children strongly.  This movement toward giving more recognition of native land is a start, and I am happy to support it.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased  to address Bill C-28 which is an act to amend the National Parks Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest anyone misunderstands, the bill is about transferring land out of two national parks. They are small amounts of land and both involve aboriginal bands and communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one that concerns me the most is Pacific Rim National Park.  It is in my riding of Nanaimo—Alberni.  The other one is a small piece of land attached to Riding Mountain National Park that I understand was simply an error in surveying. A small piece of land along Clear Lake will be added to the Clear Lake Band, correcting a historical and factual error in the actual boundaries of the reserve adjacent to the lake. We have no problem with correcting a historical error.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue that had potential for a lot consideration and dialogue is about transferring land from Pacific Rim National Park out of the park to meet the needs of the band.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been said by other members, the small piece of reserve land known as Esowista is about eight hectares.  It is  the main housing area for the Tla-o-qui-aht Band. Although the band has about 10 small reserve areas in the coastal area, the only other one that is really inhabited is Opitsat which is on Meares Island across from the main dock in Tofino. It is a small community but of course people have  the hassle of going by water taxi to join up with Vancouver Island in order to relate to the broader community and to have the advantages of the amenities of roads, grocery stores and things that are necessary for successful living in today's society. At Opitsat they have to cross by water taxi in a very rapid moving channel  in Clayoquot Sound and the Tofino Inlet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only real place to expand housing where people want to live is in the small piece of land known as Esowista which existed before the creation of the park in 1970.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been on the reserve lands and have walked around the community.  It is crowded.  There is no question that the community's housing needs need to be addressed.  The existing reserve is hemmed in by the park. There literally is no room to store boats and  trailers, or to expand the population.  The existing housing is overcrowded.  There is a definite need for the young people growing up there to have a place of their own and to live in a more reasonable environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of concerns related to this. It has been quite an exercise.  Parks Canada and  the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development have been working on this for some time with the band. The Government of British Columbia, as has been pointed out by the parliamentary secretary, is on side with the transfer of the land. A wide range of  environmental groups, as was mentioned also by the parliamentary secretary, have  agreed to the transfer, as have  the local communities, the mayors with whom I have spoken  in Tofino and Ucluelet, and the Alberni Clayoquot Regional Council.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is pretty well on board with the transfer of this small amount of land.  It is about 82 hectares and it will provide for housing needs for about 200 people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need to speak about the park. Pacific Rim National Park is one of Canada's most famous national parks. It has a reputation worldwide. Many visitors come from around the world,  particularly from Europe, to visit Pacific Rim National Park.  It is such an area of natural beauty. It is a thin strip of land on the southwest coast of Vancouver Island. I will borrow some of the language from the Parks Canada website:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People come from across the world to hike along the West Coast Trail. We did it ourselves a number of years ago. A marathoner might do it in three days. We did it in eight days. It is a rugged area of coastline, up and down wadis and valleys, creek beds, cable cars riding over creek beds, and rope ladders up and down the cliffs.  There is camping on the beach at night and people carry their own food.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This park attracts people from around the world that come to enjoy nature.  Off the coast of Tofino and Clayoquot Sound there is a wide range of wildlife: California sea lions, seals, sea otters, all kinds of fish and whales, and grey whales that migrate up and down the coast, particularly in the spring. Right about now, the whale festival is going on in Tofino, with the grey whales migrating along the coast. Of course, there are also the orcas, transients that visit the area from time to time, or  killer whales as they are known.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This park is a beautiful area. There are long stretches, kilometres, of beautiful beach. The park comprises a total area of about 500 square kilometres stretching across 125 kilometres from Tofino in the north to Port Renfrew in the south. The larger portion of that is in my riding and some of it is in the neighbouring riding of Nanaimo--Cowichan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it came to taking land out of the park, there were a lot of concerns about where this land would be? How were we going to expand the reserve, where would the land be located, and would it respect the environmental concerns in the neighbouring area?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having looked into this, the officials from Parks Canada and the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs have done due diligence in working with this project. I want to commend the chief and the band members. They butted heads for some time over exactly where this land would be located. In talking to the chief, to the park officials, and to Alex Zellermeyer, the park superintendent, these discussions went on for some time over a period of approximately two years, assisted by David Nairne and Associates, a company that assisted in the development process of how this community would look.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sensitive issues about removing the expansion from the waterfront have been addressed. The band made concessions. It did not get exactly what it wanted and everybody had to work together collaboratively to come up with an agreement that would work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual area is adjacent to the small Esowista reserve as it exists now, about eight hectares, and is going to be separated from the addition by an area because adjacent to it is an access to a parking area.  The park has built quite an elaborate access out to Schooner Cove. That is a popular area for people to hike out to, go up and down boardwalks, and visit the beautiful beaches.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to preserve the integrity of the park's infrastructure, the band agreed to take reserve land beyond the Schooner Beach Trail access and leave the access intact. That involves a connector road that is not on the main road.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the environmental aspects of looking at where they would choose the exact piece of land, if we look at the boundary that was chosen, it respects the geographical landmarks and the natural landforms that are there. It was developed and designed for the housing improvements with the environment in mind by preserving the local drainage and the local bog that slows the water from rushing immediately out to the ocean and onto the beaches. The bog  filters the water and the local drainage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is actually a model community that has been designed here. The thing that caused us the most concern and caused me the most angst was when I heard that this was coming up, and it was to be debated and fast-tracked in the House. It was just before our last break a few weeks ago. The House was on recess and I heard that when we were to return, we were going to be moving very quickly to get this through.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize that the needs in the community are great and we do not want to see this held up by a recess or by an election. It could be a year before this is advanced if it is not put through before an election, if indeed an election call comes in the next few weeks, or a few days.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I look at the memorandum of understanding, when I first heard of this I happened to be on the west coast. I went immediately to the chief who was not present, so I did visit with one of the elders who walked me over to the reserve. I looked at the housing and the needs on the reserve. I met with Tom Curley who is a longtime resident of that area. It was obvious that the expansion needed to take place and that the housing needed to be addressed.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when I met with the chief later and looked at the memorandum of understanding, I recognized that the parks people had done due diligence.  The department had done a very thorough job in addressing this issue. The attitude of the aboriginal people toward environment can be summarized by one word. They have an expression called “hishukishtsawak” which means everything is one. It is a traditional recognition that we are part of nature and nature is part of us, and we had better respect nature if we want to benefit from a longstanding and successful relationship.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also use the term “isaak” which means respect. The aboriginal people understand that. The Tla-o-qui-aht band has lived on and around the land, and off the resources for as long as any history has been recording it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read through the memorandum of understanding, I found very good clauses through it, all about where the land would be located, the village connector road, and the limitations of further transfers. There is another parcel in the memorandum of understanding. Frankly, I have not heard anybody address the memorandum of understanding and that is why I wanted to address it here today. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we get to clause 9, suddenly we run into an obstacle. It states under “Legal Nature of this Understanding”:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>This Understanding does not create legally binding obligations on the Parties.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, it seems that  this is the kind of legal language that is sewn into all memoranda of understanding. It seems to me that lawyers sew in enough loopholes to these agreements to keep them busy for another 100 years. My concern is, if Bill C-28 were to pass, the land would come out of the park. That would be a certainty. How the land will be used needs to be addressed as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I met with the chief, councillor Simon Tom, and officials from David Nairne and Associates, we had quite an extensive meeting relating to this with the superintendent for the parks, Alex Zellermeyer. We thrashed through our concerns about this issue. The chief agreed with me that the band wanted certainty in the language as well. The band was committed to using the land for residential purposes only. It was not about a commercial development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an agreement in the memorandum for another parcel to be located later outside of the park that would be used for commercial purposes. The band agreed that it would abide by the terms in the memorandum. Because of our concerns for this loose language that says it is not legally binding, the parties came to an agreement with a lot of effort.  We were meeting on the west coast and they called back to Ottawa on a Friday afternoon.  The justice officials and the department officials worked rather hard over the weekend to establish an amendment to the memorandum of understanding for greater clarity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to refer to that briefly because it was a lot of work and we appreciate them doing that. After the appropriate introductory remarks, it recognizes what we are addressing here.  It states: </p>

<td width="15" align="right">

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that. It makes it perfectly clear that the chief of the band was willing to put his hand to that agreement. Department officials were willing to do that and we want to see this go ahead. We do not want to see the community held up. We want to see that development begin as soon as possible so the housing needs of the young people and the community can be addressed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to mention the concerns we had with regard to that and to the loose nature of these things. If it has no legal binding, what is to say that five years from now a new chief, a young chief that we do not know, and some slick developer who now recognizes this land is worth millions and millions of dollars in the middle of a national park, would  not try to convince the new young band members to develop a resort condominium or put a casino right in the middle of the park.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the kind of thing that concerns people. I saw something recently, when I was on the west coast, I had never seen before. Just out of the park on another beach that is very much like Long Beach--and I was up early in the morning--I saw somebody on a personal watercraft, one of those high speed things, buzzing the beach. I had never seen that before.</p>


	<A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It raises some concerns that we do not have some certainty in this agreement.  What would happen if some enterprising or development minded person tried to talk the band into putting a marina down there with jet skis and watercraft for the people on the beach in the middle of the park, or a liquor store, a candy store, and stuff up and down the beach with candy wrappers? Frankly, that is not what people want to see.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we expressed these concerns to the chief and his councillors, and the officials present, they agreed that nobody wanted to see that happen.  I do not believe that is the chief's vision.  They want to do the right thing.  They have a model community planned and we certainly want to support it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the work that officials did at the last minute.  My objection has to be, frankly, with the arrogance of the government in not including us to give us time to address this without creating angst among all parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement was signed back in June.  I know the chief and his councillors asked if they should be talking to anyone else, as did David Nairne and Associates, the people who worked so hard on coming to this agreement?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volume of work that was done is very impressive.  The work done on the land assessments, the land use, and the analysis of where the stream and water flows go, and the diligence that was done is very impressive.  It was not a fly by night or an overnight suggestion.  It was two years of very hard work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would have appreciated it on our side if someone had given us a little bit more time to look at it, so that the committee could go through a proper process.  I know that the parliamentary secretary mentioned that the parks had consulted the environment groups and so on.  Frankly, it is the duty of the opposition and the environment committee to ensure that we have indeed heard from all groups.  I think the members heard some concerns being expressed by the member for Souris—Moose Mountain because we did not have time to be satisfied that those groups had been heard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am satisfied because, as the member for the riding, I made a point of calling the local mayors and the parks people in order to come up to speed, and to ensure that consultations had been done.  We wish that we had a chance to be involved with that, so everyone's blood pressure would not have gone up about whether we would see this come through the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very hopeful we will see it come through the House.  I want to see the community advance.  It is obvious that the needs of the community are there.  We want to see this go ahead.  I am hopeful, frankly, that out of the process we worked through that we might see something happen with the Tla-o-qui-aht band. I am hopeful that we can come to final agreements and final treaties with a measure of certainty that will see everyone go ahead.  Perhaps this could be a step toward a final treaty situation for this band, which is progressive.  It wants to see its young people have an opportunity to be successful in the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a win for the community.  The sewage treatment will involve development in the airport lands opposite the expansion.  That will tie in with the Tofino water and sewage system.  It will benefit the community as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is win-win built into this arrangement.  It is a very good deal for the community.  We want to acknowledge that and we certainly want to see it go forward.  I am hopeful that all members will have this pass in time for progress to go ahead as quickly as possible.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I very much appreciate the comments by the member for Nanaimo—Alberni. When you saw someone on a jet ski I hope it was not the member for Okanagan—Coquihalla. During the last election campaign he would go around on a jet ski. I am just joking.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-28 concerns two parks. In one of those instances, it is only to  rectify a problem with the wording, an administrative problem. The one heard about most is Pacific Rim Park.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mentioned a lot of good things about the work of Parks Canada. Its officials, namely its CEO Mr. Latourelle and his whole team have done a tremendous job on this file, as did  the team at the Department of the Environment, which was the lead department.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes a long time to reconstitute or enlarge a new territory. Some might think that all that is needed is a notarial deed transferring a land register number to a new landowner. It is a lot more than that. As a matter of fact, it is the whole future of a native community that is at stake. That was indeed the issue. Lands are not transferred just for the fun of it. There has to be a good reason to do so, a particular objective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was first and foremost to enable a native community to have a better quality of life, have access to more land and improve housing conditions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that the Government of Canada is responsible. Collectively we are responsible for improving the quality of life of native peoples,  who are Canadians nevertheless.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that he  has all the information, except for some small details, can my colleague give us his word that his colleagues in the Conservative Party of Canada   as a whole will support the bill at this stage?</p>

	Mr. Speaker,    I have seen the extensive amount of work that went into the program and I  want to acknowledge that work. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only say that representatives of David Nairne and Associates  spoke  to us about this because they were concerned that after all the long work it might be held up for as long as a year. They were also disappointed that the government had not advised them that they should have spoken to at least  the local member of Parliament and to his caucus.  If  we are trying to make things happen quickly, we need all members to participate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to give credit to Jeannie Kanakos   and Michael Kloppenburg representing David Nairne, who worked with the band.  I think everybody, along with the chief, who  I found  to be a very open and honest individual,  had  a measure of angst about whether we could do this in such a short period.  The chief  is very transparent and quite clear about the band's intention to follow through to see the community advance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know there were some very serious concerns about  the opposition to this  because usually there is somebody who does not agree. It is our obligation as members of Parliament to hear from opposing views and make sure decisions that are made are the right ones, especially when we are dealing with something as close to the hearts of many as a national park.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say that members opposite, with all due respect, put us in a tough spot and put a lot of pressure on me, personally, and our caucus to do due diligence with this. I had a bit of work to do to convince some of my colleagues. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure how the vote will be done on this but  I believe that a majority of my  party will support this because it is the right thing to do for the community. However we have to do it under  a little bit of protest. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the balance of power after the next election, I hope, as we are working through these processes, that when we want to bring this  into the parliamentary process we will respect that we need a measure of collaboration to assure that due diligence is done in the parliamentary process and that the communities are not held up just because of partisan concerns and the parliamentary process. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could stick our heels in here and say that we want due diligence and that we want to  hear from all these groups in committee but, as we all know, if we  an election us called in the next few days  there would be no  time for that to happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very hopeful that we will see the bill pass speedily with the support of all parties.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the people of   Esowista have been involved with the local community in Tofino.  They live off the land and but most of them live off the sea and are very involved with the fishermen in the area.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first arrived on Vancouver Island,  in going out to Tofino, one of the first things I wanted to do for a good friend of mine who was with me and who is an avid fisherman, was to go out on a  fishing charter. Our guide,  Tom Curley, a member  of  the Tla-o-qui-aht Band,  took us out on his own boat. I am pleased to say that we were successful even though the weather was bad.  Tom brought us in with a nice 11 pound salmon, much to the delight of my friend, who  unfortunately was rather seasick from the rough elements, and  I had to help him bring in that fish.  The first fish I landed was in a boat owned by someone from the Esowista reserve. Chief Moses Martin is also a charter boat operator. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to see Tla-o-qui-aht Band do well in the community.    I would like to see that second parcel of land move ahead quickly to give the band an economic foothold so that it can provide the occupational advantages its people need in order  to have a stable future.  This  is in the community's interests.  This could be a model development that would help see treaties  advance and be finalized.  It could be a model for many others to follow.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to   participate today in the third reading debate on Bill C-28, an act to amend the Canada National Parks Act to remove lands from the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve of Canada and Riding Mountain National Park of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this bill first came before the House, I guess in my own inexperience I would have thought it would have been done by an executive council order.  However, upon reflection, I can see the importance of legislation dealing with our national parks and any transfer of lands out of our national parks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As other speakers have perhaps said better than I can say, our national parks system is  a jewel.  A lot of the exit  surveys  of  both  domestic tourists and international tourists  indicate very clearly that the reason  they came to   Canada and   the most enjoyable parts of their visit to Canada were their visits to the national parks.  Something we have to bear in mind as we go forward as a society is  the importance of our national parks system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very pleased earlier this year   when this government announced that our national parks system would be expanding by the addition of five national parks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a particular interest in this as I come from a province  that has,  not a large national park, but   a well-travelled national park.  We have the  Cavendish, Brackley and Stanhope areas, and now  the new extension in Greenwich.  However, compared to these national parks, it is a tiny park but   one of the highest travelled parks in Canada.  This of course  leads to new challenges and issues that the employees of   Parks Canada   have to deal with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been said by other speakers, the national parks of Canada represent not only Canada's heritage of magnificent physical landscapes but they also represent ancient cultural landscapes.  Many of our renowned national parks are the traditional territories of aboriginal communities with  living histories that predate Canada by several millennia.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way that non-aboriginal Canadians take exceptional pride in their national parks, aboriginal Canadians also want to feel that national parks are important and relevant institutions for their people and their cultures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As do Canadians in general, aboriginal communities want to be meaningfully consulted and to participate in our national parks planning and in their national parks management.  They want to see their ancient and present day cultures accurately and respectfully portrayed in park information and in some of the interpretative programs. They want to see that sacred sites are protected and that traditional ecological knowledge is reflected in resource conservation and in management decisions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to point out that Parks Canada has worked hard to improve relationships with aboriginal communities, especially aboriginal communities that we have seen in this particular case that live near the national parks system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This effort is focused on two main points: making national parks relevant to aboriginal Canadians and making the cultural landscapes of national parks known to all Canadians, giving all Canadians the opportunity to learn about and to appreciate the people and the cultures they are visiting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pacific Rim National Park Reserve has taken significant strides in recent years to promote aboriginal initiatives, forging relationships and making significant efforts toward the meaningful involvement of aboriginal people in the cooperative management of the national park reserve.  The results have been remarkable.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of illustration, I would like to highlight a few of these most noteworthy accomplishments.  Pacific Rim National Park Reserve worked with the Ucluelet First Nation  to develop the Nuu-chah-nulth Trail inside the national park.  Opened in 2003, this interpretive trail provides extensive, on-site interpretation of regional first nations culture, history and language.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June, the Ucluelet First Nation will again honour the opening of the trail by erecting the first totem pole to be carved and raised in the traditional territory of this first nation in 104 years.  That is a source of great pride for this first nation community. This “welcoming” pole will greet Canadians and other international visitors to the trail and to the Ucluelet  First Nation and the Nuu-chah-nulth traditional territory.  It will symbolize the long history and continuing presence of the first nations peoples in this region and in the national park in particular.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the West Coast Trail unit of the Pacific Rim National Park, Parks Canada funds an initiative called Quu'as West Coast Trail Society. A not for profit group, this society is a training and mentoring program for the three first nations along the famous West Coast Trail, one of the world's great recreational hiking routes.  I believe the previous speaker gave a very detailed, illustrative description of this trail and how it is used both by Canadians from all parts of Canada  and by our international visitors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By engaging in the cooperative management of the West Coast Trail with Parks Canada, young first nations members are exposed to the full gamut of park management issues and training related to public safety, resource conservation, monitoring, and public interpretation. As a result of this program, first nations graduates have gone on to secure full time employment with Parks Canada, with other agencies and with industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out that there are seven first nations within the area encompassed by the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. A manager of aboriginal programs sits at the park management table and directs cooperative programs such as the promotion of first nations languages, cooperative training, the establishment of aboriginal national historic sites, and the development of aboriginal tourism opportunities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of contrast, in 1997 there was no representation of first nations in the workforce of Pacific Rim National Park Reserve.  Today, first nations represent some 18% of park staff in virtually every aspect and level of park management. This represents the approximate representation of the aboriginal people within the general area of that park.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no better indicator of the relevance of the Parks Canada program to first nations than their willingness to participate in the protection and preservation of one of Canada's great national parks. I believe this  and certainly the two speakers who have gone before me have pointed this out. Parks Canada has placed particular focus on its relationship with the aboriginal people, and the record in Pacific Rim clearly indicates this action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-28, which will withdraw lands from Pacific Rim in order to expand the Esowista Indian reserve of the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation will further strengthen those relationships.  It will also improve the quality of life for aboriginal people, a government priority identified in the recent Speech from the Throne.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out two additional facts that have been indicated by other speakers. This legislation has received broad support from the other parties.  It has received support from the native bands that it affects.  It has received broad support from the provincial government and other local governments.  I believe that the people involved, the chiefs and the senior management of Parks Canada, deserve a lot of credit for the way this legislation was brought forward before the House.  First I want to congratulate them and then I want to thank them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, as has been stated, this allows some housing developments to go up on the adjoining first nations reserve, and also, before the land was authorized to be transferred, all the environmental concerns were addressed and mitigated, which I am glad to report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask all members of the House to support the quick passage of Bill C-28.</p>

Serge Marcil (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I very much appreciated the speech by my colleague, who comes from an area where there are beautiful national parks that  I have had the opportunity to visit on several occasions. The whole Canadian east coast is graced with national parks. We are trying to develop more of them in Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve of Canada is one of the most beautiful parks in Canada. It is a jewel in the Canadian crown. It is said that what happens outside the park has an impact on the park itself. Members of the reserve always say that it is one entity. It is multi-dimensional.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Native peoples are actively involved in managing the park. The Parks Canada Agency cannot do everything on its own, and cannot protect everything. Our responsibility, our main concern, is to protect the ecological integrity so that the community can play an active, healthy and effective role inside our parks. In this case the understanding that exists  between Parks Canada and the native community has made it possible to solve the problem as a team, in partnership.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also makes it  possible for  this community to be involved in managing the park, welcoming the many visitors and ensuring the complete respect   of the fauna and the flora in the park.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank my colleague for his remarks. I would like to ask him how he sees the role of Parks Canada across our great country. Since he has had the opportunity to visit several areas  in his region that  belong to Parks Canada, how does he see it?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, Parks Canada has a very significant role in protecting, enhancing and expanding our national parks system, which, as I have stated, is a matter of  considerable pride for all Canadians.  I have mentioned the exit surveys taken of the tourists who visit our country and our national parks and the complimentary statistics toward our national parks system that come out of these surveys. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, though, the point I want to make is that we cannot take our national parks system for granted. A lot of parks, including the one in my province as well as Banff, are getting a lot of traffic, so there is stress.  We cannot take these parks for granted.  I understand that Parks Canada is aware of the problem and is being careful.  We have to be very cautious as we go forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to see that the government is expanding our national parks system. This is something for our children, our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren.  It is something that I urge this government and provincial governments to continue.  This is a matter of trust.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the growing areas of the tourist industry is the area of cultural tourism, and these relationships that Parks Canada has formed with our aboriginal communities have hit the nail right on the head. When people visit our national parks they can see the interpretive centres that interpret the people who lived in this country before we lived here.  I think it is tremendous.  Not only will this be  a good relationship with aboriginal communities, but I think  it will be very beneficial for this country's tourism industry.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members can see, this report is far  reaching. It looks at the long term. It places an enormous emphasis on ecological integrity because this term runs through the entire content of those reports. As I mentioned to Parks Canada, it probably makes the Parks Canada system unique in the world in that it is a fantastic approach. It commands a lot of attention and respect.  Also, the chair of this panel, Jacques Gérin, was a deputy minister of the environment in the eighties and a very loyal and devoted public servant.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a passage in the first volume which is interesting.  It offers an example of what is happening because of growth of population and other factors.  It is devoted to the species loss in Point Pelee National Park, which as we know is at the very tip of Ontario along the shore of Lake Ontario. This is what it says:</p>

Factors in species loss include:area and isolation-- the park is too small to support viable populations of some species. Point Pelee is isolated by intensive agriculture, roads and housing that surround the park. It is the only island of Carolinian forest protected within a national park.</small></td>

Excessive nutrients in some areas may be a direct result of past cottage development, high visitation and the associated high density of sewage facilities depositing nutrients into the groundwater via outdated sceptic systems.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought members might find it interesting to hear these quotations from volume I, “A Call to Action”, by the panel which I mentioned in this intervention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an important document and it seems to me appropriate that it would be good timing to put this information on the record and bring it to the attention of hon. members. Because of the high quality of our parks in the country and because  the ecological protection, significance and integrity of these parks,  future generations of Canadians may want to pay attention to them to preserve their unique characters, be they in highly or nearby highly inhabited parts of the country or in remote parts of the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have  a network that is of unique beauty.  It seems to me that the debate on Bill C-28 makes room for an intervention of this kind in order to bring these considerations to the attention of the House.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments by the member for Davenport about the environment and the parks.  We know this has been a longstanding passion for him.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Pacific Rim National Park, very briefly let me say that they have really done due diligence on the ecological integrity,  the land development, roads design, housing, location and site drainage.  All these things have been done with due study and detailed mapping.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to say this about that member.  He has been really a voice for environment for the term that I have been here and  long before that.  I am not sure how many years he was the chair of the environment committee, but for many years he has stood for environmental issues in the House.  The story we understand is that it is possible the member will not run again.  I simply want to acknowledge the contribution he has made in the House to environmental issues, and as chair of that committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure all members, indeed in all parties, recognize the contribution not only to the debates in the House, but to the character of the House, and I dare say that his presence here will be missed.  I am sure he will find a way to make his presence known.  As another hon. member mentioned, he may come back as a ghost, but I am sure this one will be around in some capacity or another to influence the affairs, particularly related to environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to congratulate the member for his longstanding efforts on this behalf.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed from February 27 consideration of the motion that Bill C-393, an act to amend the Criminal Code (breaking and entering), be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to support the bill of my colleague from Calgary on this very important issue; that of home invasions, break and enters involving people's homes and residences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just cannot resist prefacing my statements on the bill today by simply stating how jealous I am of this member and indeed of all the other members who in the last 10 years have been able to put forward private members' bills, have them debated and in some instances voted on in this place.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 10 and half years, and I cry in my soup again, I have never once been drawn.  It seems so incredibly unfair to me because I have such excellent private members' bills, which resonate well with Canadians across the country because of some of the work I have done on them.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one on standardizing the date format is an example.  What does two, three, four mean?  Is it 2002, March 4, or whatever?  I had one that would at least standardize it for legal purposes and hopefully move Canadians toward some consistency on how they expressed dates in numerical format.  I never got a chance to have it debated in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have another very excellent bill on EI, pertaining to students to ensure that they do not have to pay premiums on an insurance policy that they cannot possibly ever collect.  Yet it never was drawn, and did not have the opportunity to have that debated in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have yet another bill on property taxes.  We know that we are overtaxed in this country.  Families are having a hard time making ends meet.  Yet my very excellent private member's bill, which would exempt property taxes from income tax, the principle being a Canadian should not have to pay taxes on money earned for the sole purpose of paying taxes, never got a chance to be debated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I am  after 10 and half years, and I expect to be re-elected.  However, in the event that changes, this will be my last opportunity to talk about my private member's bills, which I never got to talk about in a meaningful way in this place.  There we go.  I thank  everyone in the House for all the sympathy I am getting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having used two minutes of the time on this bill to promote my own, at least I got it off my chest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is a most important one.  We have somehow in our society increasingly lost the fabric of ethical and moral behaviour.  It has become fashionable nowadays, and to our regret even within the high levels of government, to take things which are not our own.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I helped write the handbook for our private Christian school, of which I was the chairman when we started out.  We had a little section in there which we copied from others that said that students should not bring valuables to school, the intent being that then they would not be subject to being stolen.  I could not resist, working on that,   inserting another statement in there that said, “Notwithstanding this, that students should not bring valuables to school, we still expect our students to not take things that do not belong to them”.    Even if there is something there that is valuable, one should not be able to take it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, when I was youngster, my mother taught me a very important lesson.  It was in a different language so the idiom does not fit at all.  Basically the message was, “You cannot steal even so much as a thimble”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I imagine many people here do not even know what a thimble is.  A thimble was a little device, usually metal in those days.  It was put on the finger of a person sewing so that if the needle went astray, it would prevent the finger from being injured.  That was a thimble.   It was a very small, almost worthless, device.  However, she taught us, “You do not  steal even a thimble”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember also, when I was youngster, that our home on the prairies in Saskatchewan was never locked.  In fact I do not remember if we even had a lock on the door.  I remember my dad asking why we should lock the doors.  He said that perhaps when we were not home, someone would come by who needed to use the phone.    </p>


	<A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1335)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the kind of trust we had among one another in rural Saskatchewan when I was growing up. We were taught both by word and by example, by our parents, by our schools and by our churches, that we did not take stuff that did not belong to us. It was just unthought of.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a sharp contrast that is to what we are seeing in government these days.  I find it despicable. A reporter back home asked me if I was not happy with everything happening here because, she said, we now have an excellent chance of forming the government. Surely Canadians will punish these Liberals for taking a whole bunch of money, she said, for  misappropriating it and spending it in ways for which it was not intended--except that she used much stronger language.  I have changed her language so that it is parliamentary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I responded to her by saying, “No, as a matter of fact, it makes me incredibly sad”.  It makes me incredibly sad that in our government this type of thing can be done.  Where is it that people get the idea they can spend taxpayers' money, which is to be held there in trust?  Where do they get the idea that they can just take it and use it for whatever personal purposes they have, with or without accounting and with or without justification?  That should be so far from our thinking that it should just never happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have digressed.  We are talking about a bill that says there should be a harsher sentence imposed on people who engage in the act of breaking into people's homes and taking their things.  Of course, one of the reasons for this, one of the large reasons, is that the invasion of one's personal space is such a violation of the person himself or herself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have talked with many people who have had their homes broken into.  They have all said that they are not as concerned about the television or whatever because that can be replaced.  In fact, the insurance company, after a deduction, will replace the things that are taken.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What people are really concerned about is the fact that they have had their personal space violated.  We used to say that a man's home is his castle; it is one of the places where we have the privacy of our home, our families, and we do not expect it to be invaded by a stranger with all sorts of intents that could be very devastating.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will never forget the case of Barb Danelesko in Edmonton.  It is now a fairly old case from probably seven or eight years ago.  Three young offenders broke into her house.  She thought it was the dog that wanted to go out, as dogs sometimes do in the middle of the night.  She left her husband in his bed, the children upstairs, and she went downstairs to let the dog out, she thought.  Unfortunately, these three young thugs grabbed a knife from the kitchen cupboard and they murdered her.  This happened because they were in the process of breaking in.  They were young offenders.  We were not even permitted to know their names.  I believe they are no longer serving a sentence for this crime.  In essence, they got away with it.  This is the type of thing that can happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill has as its primary goal to put a large deterrence on breaking and entering into homes.  It would require a minimum mandatory sentence of at least two years for individuals who have been found guilty of a second or subsequent offence. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still letting them get away with the first offence, so let the Liberals vote in favour of this bill because they are always the ones who want to be soft on crime.  We are being soft on the first offence, but we hope that after the first offence for which a person is convicted that person would learn the lesson and never do it again.  If people have not learned the lesson and do it again, hence the subsequent or the second offence, then we say a minimum of two years.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will do two things.  First, it will act as a deterrent. Second, it will prevent that individual from continuing this activity for at least two years.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-915152"></A><a HREF="#Int-915154"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-915120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, CPC): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, at the outset I would like to remind my hon. colleague who has just spoken that another prairie boy recalls a time when it was illegal to lock a rural church or school simply because in blizzards and storms those were places one could get into. Things have changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not find one police force across Canada, including the RCMP, that will not support this bill, not one. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell members very quickly what is happening now. In the rural areas where I come from, break and entry is now so common that when the RCMP are called, people are told, “Sorry, but  we won't be getting there because we're three days behind in looking at breaks and enters”.  That is what it is like.  It is a common thing.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now another thing has developed. Some of the insurance companies now are asking, “Was your property properly secured? Did you have the right locks and buzzers?”  I do not know.   Then the insurance companies are saying, “You must have done something wrong because you were broken into before”. Again it is the victim who takes the rap.  Again it is the victim who has to pay for everything.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Canada are not helping young people one little bit unless we have legislation like this.  That is not going to stop them. I have a nephew on the police force and many good friends on the police force who are dealing with the same person up to five times on break and enter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Regina and other cities, we have another terminology: home invasion. It happens every night.  Groups of three or four people get together and go into someone's home. And it is not what they take: it is the collateral damage. We have people who move to another area. The value of their house goes down.  They lose thousands of dollars because the same gang that has already served terms for break and enter moves about. It is home invasion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only these young people would follow the law, if only they were forced to know the law and if only the judicial system would follow this bill: what have we got to lose? What does society have to lose by adopting my hon. colleague's private member's bill? What loss is it to society? Society has nothing at all to lose and everything to gain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the government to stop playing around with these issues, pass the bill and show Canadians once and for all that it can adopt a bill from this nasty party over here which the government claims wants to get tough on crime. Let us see the government get tough on crime and bring some law and order to this country on breaking and entering.</p>

I have been very privileged to have worked with him during the last seven years I have been in Parliament. I would like to thank him and his wife for all of their contributions to the Canadian public.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first introduced my bill, I was amazed at the amount of support that I received from citizens, from the provincial government  and from police forces right across the country.  I have given numerous interviews on radio stations and television stations across the country specifically talking about Bill C-393 and its importance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Toronto chief of police  captured the whole debate on this issue as to why the bill is necessary and important when he said: </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That statement was made by  the chief of police of the largest city in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that if  government members were to go back to their ridings and talk with their citizens   they would be told to support Bill C-393.   I hope that when the bill comes up for a vote, people will know which of the members on the other side did not take this issue seriously and voted against it.   I look forward to the upcoming vote.</p>
