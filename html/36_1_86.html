dissenting opinion says a lot about the difference of opinion on 
this issue existing between the opposition and government members

also feel that the government should take every step possible to 
avoid receiving another qualified opinion from Parliament's

<A NAME="LINK30">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 26 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-28, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, the Income Tax 
Application Rules, the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, the Canada 
Pension Plan, the Children's Special Allowances Act, the 
Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, the Cultural Property 
Export and Import Act, the Customs Act, the Customs Tariff, the 
Employment Insurance Act, the Excise Tax Act, the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, the Income Tax 
Conventions Interpretation Act, the Old Age Security Act, the 
Tax Court of Canada Act, the Tax Rebate Discounting Act, the 
Unemployment Insurance Act, the Western Grain Transition 
Payments Act and certain Acts related to the Income Tax Act, be 
read the third time and passed; and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak again to the bill before us today, Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of things wrong with this bill.  There are 
the measures that supposedly demonstrate the government's 
concern  with respect to social programs and the deterioration 
of health care, which it brought about itself by cutting 
provincial transfer payments in the health, social services and 
education sectors over the last three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is an attempt to make us think the government has 
invested in social programs, especially health.  The reality is 
that the government has put no new money into transfers, 
particularly not for health.  The $48 billion in unilateral cuts 
announced have now dropped to $42 billion. We are told that the 
government is investing the $6 billion difference, but in 
reality no new money is being invested; the government is 
cutting $6 billion less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that health is a priority.  We feel it is arrogant 
of the government to try to persuade the public that it is 
investing heavily in social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As things stand now, the provinces have been cut so many times 
by the federal government, particularly in the health sector, 
that they are running out of steam and are having a great deal 
of trouble maintaining the existing level of health care and 
keeping  the whole system from falling apart.  And the federal 
government remains indifferent to what the provinces are going 
through. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, on top of cutting transfers to the provinces, the 
government is set to interfere in health, which is a provincial 
jurisdiction. We are told that, instead of rushing into 
restructuring, the government is investing; it is investing, 
however, by cutting less than originally forecast and dropping a 
little money into new programs that really fall under provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to enhance its visibility by giving 
everyone the impression that it is good to the people; it comes 
up with programs like medicare and home care, when such programs 
already exist in several provinces, including Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, after vowing to avoid duplication and overlap, the 
federal government projects an image of itself as saviour while 
it interferes in jurisdictions that are none of its business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Management of health, social programs, education and social 
assistance comes under provincial jurisdiction. Normally, the 
government should transfer their share back to the provinces 
instead of interfering in an area that is not under its 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not seem to realize that no one has waited 
for it to take action. What the provinces need today is not more 
talks but the financial means to implement solutions designed to 
meet their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, I would like to quote from the Quebec finance 
minister's last budget speech, which sums up well the mess the 
federal government has left the provinces, and Quebec in 
particular: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we took power in 1994, the federal government has 
unilaterally deprived us of $7 billion for health care, $3 
billion for education, and $1 billion for asocial assistance. 
This adds up to $11 billion. The figure does not include the $2 
billion that Ottawa has refused to pay for the harmonization of 
the QST and the GST, although the three Atlantic Provinces were 
granted $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were it not for these depredations, we would already have 
achieved a zero deficit and avoided many of the painful, 
sweeping spending cutbacks that some observers are trying to 
ascribe to our wishes alone. The health and education 
departments are not located in Ottawa, but it is there and 
without our input that the cutbacks have in the main been 
decided. 
That is how absurd the system has become... The latest budget 
confirms the federal government's complete insensitivity to a 
number of our needs, notably in the health sector. Ottawa 
prefers to distribute cheques to the population, emblazoned with 
the maple leaf. Lacking vision, Ottawa is investing in 
visibility. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we have to live with in Quebec and how we view the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to share another concern regarding Bill C-28. 
There is an apparent conflict of interest. Through Bill C-28, 
the Minister of Finance is trying to have legislation passed 
that is likely to give his shipping company, Canada Steamship 
Lines Inc., of which he is the sole owner, certain tax 
advantages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 241 of Bill C-28 would amend section 250 of the Income 
Tax Act. 
In this 464-page omnibus bill, clause 241 is only two paragraphs 
long and deals exclusively with international shipping; 
moreover, the Minister of Finance himself is the bill's sponsor. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT5"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT5"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1025
<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Minister of Finance sponsor a bill which includes 
tax provisions that could benefit his own company, while 
continuing to suggest that these measures will not apply to him 
and to his shipping holding company? There is indeed an apparent 
conflict of interest and, given the importance of the minister's 
position and the integrity he must show while managing the 
country's finances, there should not be any suspicions 
whatsoever about him. However, with Bill C-28, his personal name 
as a shipowner and that of his holding are directly linked to 
the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the minister is defending himself by saying that his 
company has been held in a blind trust since he assumed his 
current position, he will not be a minister all his life and he 
will eventually benefit from that tax amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very first day that we questioned the Minister of Finance 
about this issue, he advised us to talk to Len Farber, director 
general of tax legislation at the Department of Finance. We did 
meet Mr. Farber, but he could neither confirm nor deny whether 
the minister might benefit from these changes, thus raising 
serious doubts in our minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our next step was to table five motions before the Standing 
Committee on Finance, asking that various witnesses appear to 
shed light on the issue. The only witness authorized to appear 
before the committee was Mr. Wilson, the government's ethics 
counsellor, who is paid by the government and who is accountable 
only to the government. 
Nevertheless, Mr. Wilson's appearance before the committee 
strengthened our position, since he himself put the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Finance in an embarrassing 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After candidly admitting that he was not an expert on 
international taxation and that he could not adequately answer a 
number of our questions, Mr. Wilson also recognized that, 
indeed, there could be an apparent conflict of interest in this 
case, adding that had he been informed at the very beginning of 
the details relating to clause 241 and its impact, things would 
have been done differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He recognized, as we do, that there were serious problems with 
the way the finance minister was doing things and that the code 
of ethics the government had adopted in 1994 was not observed. 
Indeed, the code of ethics clearly states that public office 
holders must, as soon as they take up their duties, take 
necessary steps to avoid real, potential or apparent conflict of 
interest. Obviously, the code of ethics was not adhered to and 
the finance minister is at fault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the Liberal majority on the finance committee refused to 
agree to our request, the four opposition parties called a press 
conference to demand that the Prime Minister order a special 
committee to be struck to shed light on clause 241 of  Bill C-28. 
As yet our request has remained unanswered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's ethic counsellor, who answers to the Prime 
Minister, claims it is irrelevant to know whether or not CSL, 
owned by the finance minister, may benefit from provisions in 
Bill C-28. 
If so, why did Mr. Wilson get in touch with CSL management, the 
very first day this became an issue, and ask if it was making 
use or was planning to make use of these provisions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, Mr. Wilson admitted he was no financial planning 
expert. And yet he seems to accept without questioning or 
seeking an outside second opinion CSL's statement that it does 
not intend to make use of Bill C-28's provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For weeks now the government has been denying the finance 
minister is at the very least in an apparent conflict of 
interest because he is not the one who was in charge of the 
shipping provisions.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the ethics counsellor contradicted the government when 
he admitted that the finance minister's sponsoring of Bill C-28 
gave the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Wilson stated in this regard that procedural problems within 
the finance department had put the finance minister in an 
awkward situation, and that things would have been done 
differently had he been contacted, as he should have been, 
before Bill C-28 was introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the ethics counsellor admits the finance minister is in an 
apparent conflict of interest, how should the June 1994 federal 
government code of ethics apply in this particular case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Wilson also suggests that the finance minister was not aware 
of the contents of Bill C-28 before the Bloc Quebecois raised 
these issues in the House a few weeks ago. On the one hand, can 
the minister responsible for the Income Tax Act so easily avoid 
his responsibilities toward a bill that he is sponsoring and, on 
the other hand, what must the people be thinking about a finance 
minister who does not know the contents of his own bills? Is 
ministerial accountability not a fundamental principle of our 
parliamentary system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, there are many issues and these issues are 
serious enough that we should take the time to address them. So 
long as the government continues to ignore the requests of all 
opposition parties regarding Bill C-28, we will continue to put 
pressure in all possible and imaginable ways until finally, in 
the interest of transparency, someone answers our questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased today to talk about Bill C-28. I think this bill 
addresses several issues that are very important for Canadians 
today, and I believe it is important to discuss them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It deals with taxes, health care, education, social services and 
social assistance. We have to say that this is a rather 
complicated bill, and this is probably intentional, to ensure 
that all kinds of things will go unnoticed, as my colleagues 
from the Bloc Quebecois pointed out. There are certainly some 
questionable clauses in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that it is very important that Canadians understand 
that this bill is extremely complicated, but in another way it 
is also quite simple. The bottom line is that we in this country 
still have problems with health care, education and employment, 
and nothing in this bill will solve these problems. 
It is important to talk about these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the flight to Ottawa this week, I was sitting beside a lady 
from the Fredericton area and I asked her where she was going. 
She was coming here to Ottawa for an eye operation. The waiting 
period in Halifax was 15 months, but she could have this 
operation right away in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask myself the question: What is the difference from one 
province to another in terms of waiting lists? I know that, in 
the Atlantic provinces, there are very serious problems with 
hospital services, as well as with health care in senior homes 
such as the Villa Providence in Shediac. Seniors certainly do 
not have the services they need in these institutions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are short-staffed. Their employees are totally exhausted. As 
in many other seniors home, several staff members are on 
extended sick leave because they are exhausted. There is just so 
much a person can do between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Too much is being 
asked of these workers and our relatives in these places are 
suffering because of it. It is important that this be pointed 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that money is being reinvested in health care, but 
that is not true. Transfers were cut drastically and people have 
to be reminded of that. That is the truth. The only thing the 
government did was not cut the $1.5 billion they had said they 
would cut. That is the only thing they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are getting even less money than we did previously and there 
is nothing in this bill to reassure the people who have to wait 
four or five hours before they can see a doctor or the children 
who have to wait hours before someone can take care of their 
broken limbs. These are not imaginary problems; they are real 
and we keep hearing about them every day. We often hear about 
people who have to wait or even pay to get a cyst removed, etc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the television program <I>This Hour Has 22 Minutes</I>, there was a 
very good sketch where they said that if you are diagnosed with 
cancer, you will get your $100 back. That is so sad. How many 
people will not get their first $100 back and will still get 
cancer? Why? Because we have a government that took the word 
care out of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also saddened to hear the opposition parties say that the 
United States have a better health system than we do. 
We should be careful with this kind of statement, because people 
in the United States do not have medicare. Health care is for 
people with money only. This should be taken into consideration 
when comparing health care in both countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if I do find fault with our present system, we still have a 
system which NDP members are striving to preserve because it is 
important and it should remain as a national system so that the 
same standard of health care should be available to all 
Canadians. The ability to pay should not be a consideration as 
far as health care is concerned. A patient who may have cancer 
should not have to pay for surgery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about time we take a hard look at where we are headed in 
this country, because we are in a sad situation. Many people 
cannot get an appointment because doctors are overworked. 
We have the same situation in hospitals. The number of beds is 
down, but people still get sick. And the less health care we 
have, the sicker they will get, and the more beds and the more 
nurses we will need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Moncton area, right now, 300 nurses work only part time. 
This is a problem. We should be realistic about this situation. 
First of all, people deserve a little bit of security. Bill C-28 
does not deal with these issues. We have 730,000 people on 
welfare, and the government is telling us it has put in the 
system $1.5 billion more. It has not. It has simply cancelled 
cuts that were supposed to be made. This is the important thing 
to remember. The government has been cutting right and left for 
a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen in the last few weeks that if we have 730,000 
people on welfare, it is largely because of the cuts in 
employment insurance. In high unemployment areas, we should be 
aware that there are no jobs, and that whatever jobs there are 
are part time jobs at $5.50 an hour.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I meet women who have worked for 25 years in fish processing 
plants and who earn $5.75 an hour.  That is sad.  How many of us 
could live on just $5.75 an hour?  Not many, I think. And yet 
this is what we expect the poor in Canada to live on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The places where there are paying jobs, like the employment 
centre in Bouctouche, where at least three or four full time 
employees were earning $13 or $14 an hour, they close.  These 
are jobs our children might have had eventually.  They are also 
services that are no longer available to the public. Now people 
come to my office because they no longer have access to the 
employment centre. Members of Parliament who want to look after 
their constituents are the ones who have to deal with these 
cases and settle the problems. 
That is what we see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad to see them continually closing down businesses in a 
region where the unemployment rate this winter was 50% and where 
jobs are replaced by seasonal employment, which pays $5.50 or 
$6.25 an hour.  And the provincial maximum is $6.25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people cannot live on $5.50 an hour anymore than I can.  I 
cannot expect them to either.  This is the sort of thing we have 
to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no different in education.  There is a problem here, too. 
Sure, our young people can borrow.  I have visits from young 
people who are $40,000 in debt.  They have been out of 
university for two years and they are still looking for work. 
They move.  They leave.  As I was saying the other day, half of 
the people in Calgary are from New Brunswick.  It is sad, but 
that is what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we have to look carefully at just what bills like C-28 have to 
offer. 
It is not very useful indeed. It may be beneficial to some 
Liberal members, but it does nothing for those who suffer, for 
the sick, for the growing number of children who live in poverty 
because of the cuts made by the Liberals and the Conservatives 
before them—sometimes we have a tendency to put all the blame 
on the Liberals, but the party that was in power before them did 
not do anything good either. It certainly made its share of 
cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social assistance is a serious problem in our region. Sometimes 
we do not want to talk about it, but in our part of the country, 
it is a reality. Those who do not have jobs live on welfare. 
Sometimes, when they are not eligible for welfare, they tell us 
they want to kill themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is money in this country. Lots of money. 
It is not true that there is no money. The problem is that 
governments have decided they will no longer help the poor in 
our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics are clear: the poor are poorer than ever and the 
rich are richer than ever. And the middle class is paying for 
both. The middle class is beginning to disappear. I think the 
rich were sick and tired of seeing middle class people sitting 
next to them in the same restaurants. It was becoming a problem, 
a threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The middle class and the small and medium size business sector 
are constantly under attack. The ACOA, for instance, will lose 
one third of its funding. The government is cutting social 
programs in Atlantic Canada and it is also taking away the only 
agency that can help small and medium size businesses. 
We are beginning to wonder. Will the government totally abandon 
Atlantic Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of us were elected and we will see to it that Atlantic 
Canada is not abandoned. There is no job creation, and that is 
the main problem in our country. If the government did its job 
and made sure that Canadians had decent jobs with decent 
salaries, we would not have the problems we are experiencing 
today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are being replaced by machines, well-paying jobs are being 
destroyed, and then we wonder why there is a high level of 
unemployment. Do you want to see what high unemployment is? Come 
live in the Atlantic provinces, or in any rural area in the 
country.  Then you will see what high unemployment is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not true that the figure is 9% for Kent county, for Albert 
county, for Cap-Pelé or Port Elgin.  I am sure it is the same in 
many places throughout the country, in all provinces.  We will 
have to start by going to see how things are in the regions and 
then doing some long term planning.  That is what I would like 
to see in this House, a government that says “OK. 
We will have to go to the rural regions to find our why there is 
such high unemployment.  What is not being done right?  What 
have we done wrong?  What needs to be done?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are factories in our region that need a five to seven year 
program to ensure that people can be self-supporting.  There is 
no such program.  Programs must be created in this country to 
fit these regions, instead of waiting for us in the regions to 
change to fit the programs.  That is not how it is done.  We are 
serious about addressing the problem of lack of work in the 
rural communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding people are, again this year, having to live for 
three months without any income whatsoever.  And why is that? 
Because they cannot draw employment insurance.  This is serious. 
Nobody in our region can survive for three months with no money 
coming in without the danger of getting into a real bind. 
There is a surplus of close to $20 billion in the employment 
insurance fund, and yet these people are expected to survive 
with no income.  Ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a great pity. All this is a real eye opener for a 
newcomer to this place like myself, as we see bills appear that 
can work to the advantage of certain companies in this country. 
That is a sad thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have met with young people and I have asked them “Is there any 
tax reform that can help you?” They tell me no.  I have a young 
fellow working for me who is way over his head in debt. There 
was nothing in the last budget, or the one before that, to help 
him out.  Nothing at all. In fact things are getting worse.  For 
10 years our students will get some assistance, but only 7% of 
them, while 90% of them will be left out, and there is nothing 
at all for them between now and the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government does not start introducing bills and promising 
to make job creation the number one priority in this country, we 
will keep on having this problem of young people  graduating and 
unable to find work.  There are people who had jobs but lost 
them.  Money is no longer circulating.  It is a problem 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not true that the economy is so wonderful.  Come and live 
in my riding for a while and you will see that things are not 
that rosy.  Our SMBs are trying, however.  We are trying to 
develop them, but we need help.  They cannot simply be told that 
they will have to go it alone now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians should have the same rights, whether they are rich 
or poor, men, women or children.  Everyone has the right to food 
on the table, a roof over their head, clothes to wear, and an 
education.  These are not privileges, although it is starting to 
look like it. 
The way governments are operating, a post-secondary education is 
becoming a privilege.  Imagine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then they have the nerve to say that companies cannot find 
trained students to work for them.  Something is not right. 
Once again, I think it is a lack of planning.  One has only to 
think of how many people are on unemployment insurance, which is 
now called employment insurance.  They have tried to change how 
we think of it, but it is not employment insurance.  When people 
go to an employment centre for unemployment insurance, they are 
not offered a job.  That is not what happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has tried to convince Canadians otherwise, but I 
am sorry.  And I will not call it employment insurance till 
people go to employment centres with their little pink slip to 
find a job there. There would go to these employment centres in 
search of a job. 
It is not the case at the moment. People get unemployment 
insurance because there are no jobs.

convince me or the people that this is employment insurance, 
because this is not true. We must endeavour to put these people 
back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also be realistic. We have to recognize the impact this 
reform will have in areas with a high unemployment rate. It is 
sad to see the situation young people are in. There is no 
planning. We need long term planning. We need financial 
assistance for groups willing to invest their time developing 
our natural resources, whether in fisheries or forestry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is potential in our region, hard working people. There are 
hard working people throughout the country, in regions where the 
unemployment rate is high. Professionals are supposed to be 
working to help these people. Where are they? Who is listening 
when we say we need these programs? I must say that we do not 
hear much, because I read in the newspaper that ACOA will lose 
one third of its funding. The government is cutting on both 
ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing is happening in the fisheries. We know that we 
must ask ourselves some questions about the conservation of 
lobster and cod. Who are the people who are making decisions 
that are causing so many problems? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the New Democratic Party opposes Bill C-28. I look 
forward to having the opportunity to debate in the House 
something that will help people. 
Perhaps, for once, the Liberal Party will finally give priority 
to the poor and the destitute and the small businesses that are 
hurting in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask my 
colleague from the NDP to elaborate on her view of the way the 
federal government is treating the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said in her speech that everybody in this great country 
should be entitled to food, shelter and clothing, and I believe 
she is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Quebec, while we agree, express it 
differently because we believe it is more meaningful for people. 
Instead of feeding them we prefer to give them the opportunity 
to earn what they need to buy food and clothes, and put a roof 
over their heads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old Chinese saying I believe goes like this: “Give a 
man a fish, you feed him for a day, teach him how to fish, you 
feed him for a lifetime.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the federal government is doing with its subsidies and its 
encroachment into fields of provincial jurisdiction is feeding 
individuals and giving them something for clothing and housing. 
It is helping them in every area, while provinces would rather 
educate them and show them how to earn those things and become 
self-sufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By making the provinces poorer, the federal government can then 
boast to private citizens: “Look, what the provinces are unable 
to give you, we are giving to you now. We are putting food on 
your table.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is a lot more meaningful for people to be able to earn 
their keep than to have the federal government provide for them 
and make them dependent on its largesse. 
Would fishermen in New Brunswick and the other Atlantic 
provinces and their children not rather have the money to 
improve their fishing methods than be given subsidies to be able 
to put food on the table and a roof over their heads? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the member's point of view on this to know 
if people in the Atlantic provinces and people in Quebec are on 
the same wavelength.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the problem is they are handing money out but without 
any planning. Does this mean the planning should be up to the 
provinces? This would be a problem in New Brunswick because the 
money does not always go where it should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I come from, we were always afraid to give Frank McKenna 
money because all of it might be used on roads, while health 
care would be left out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the problem: how the money will be managed once in the 
province. I feel there is not enough control and I think it is 
also the case federally. That is why I say we need programs that 
accommodate people, and not programs where people have to 
accommodate the programs. That is why nothing is working and 
there are so many bankruptcies. No one wants to listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes loans are denied to small businesses or organizations 
looking to create year round work because they do not meet the 
criteria. Look what that does. A $45,000 loan might create 25 
permanent jobs but the bank has to go by the criteria. That is a 
problem and it is one at every level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the expression bottom up suggests. Does it mean 
that the province will be in charge of managing the money? 
Will the Kent economic commission manage the whole thing? 
Someone has to do it, but first we need to have programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about prevention. People would rather earn a living than 
to always take money from the government, because, at some 
point, they no longer know why they should get up in the 
morning. People get depressed in winter when they are out of 
work. They always look forward to spring when they can resume 
working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since the Liberals were elected, they have gone after 
seasonal workers as if they were all lazy people. When the Prime 
Minister came to my riding to get elected, he said he was going 
to take care of everything. He would help the unemployed. He 
came back here and said: “They all live in shacks, they are 
drunk all the time and unemployed”. That is what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are the ones who elected him. But even worse, we believed 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it sad that the Prime Minister, who chose to run in a 
region with the worst unemployment rate in Canada and made 
promises to the voters, came back here, to Ottawa, and said, as 
we found out later by reading the newspaper, that everyone was 
living in shacks, drunk all the time and on the dole. What an 
insult! Believe me, the next time they tried to get one of 
theirs elected, voters were more wary. That era is over. The 
people back home will not put up with this any longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is time for the Liberals to start thinking about 
this. Nova Scotia has sent them a message and I am sure New 
Brunswick will do the same. I hope this will keep up, because we 
have a problem in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise and address once again Bill C-28.  We are 
speaking to the amendment in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first priority or perhaps at least a very important priority 
of any legislator is to ensure that we do our best along with our 
colleagues to create a foundation on which we can build a strong 
economy in this country.  I know colleagues would agree with 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have an obligation to ensure that the legislation 
that passes through this House does indeed do that and 
contributes in some way to doing that.  Sadly I do not believe 
that Bill C-28 really does that, certainly not in the current 
context.  I think Canada's economic foundation is crumbling and 
cracking for a number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all we believe very strongly that Canada's $583.2 
billion debt is just about out of control. 
We know that our taxes are far too high.  We also know that we 
spend billions on wasteful programs and that spending is largely 
unfocused.  It does not go to the things that are priorities with 
Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the reasons we oppose not only this 
legislation but a number of the initiatives of the government. It 
simply is not focusing on the things that are most important or 
doing the things that will prepare a foundation upon which to 
build a strong, healthy, sustainable economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me speak specifically to some of these concerns.  I 
mentioned a minute ago that our foundation was crumbling and 
cracking.  One of the reasons for that is the situation we had 
with our debt of $583.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What hon. colleagues around the House will know is that we spend 
about $45 billion a year just to pay the interest on the debt. It 
is an unbelievable amount of money.  It is the largest cheque the 
finance minister will write every year.  It is a lot more than we 
spend on employment insurance and old age security combined.  It 
is far bigger than that amount.  It is a tremendous amount of 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that for average families it means they have to pay 
taxes that are $6,000 higher than they would be if they did not 
have pay that interest.  Average families have to pay $6,000 in 
taxes just to pay their share of interest on the debt.  It is an 
unbelievable amount of money. If we compare that with our friends 
south of the border, their debt, as huge as it is, is about 40% 
less per capita than the Canadian debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a staggering amount.  That is about 70% of the gross 
domestic product.  If we combine it with what the debt of the 
provinces it is close to 100% of the gross domestic product.  It 
is one of the worst levels of debt in the world.  It is a huge 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-28 does nothing to address it.  Nor did the budget which 
recently came done.  Not only are we saddling the present 
generation and all the people who are struggling to make the 
economy move with this debt but we are saddling the next 
generation, the people who are yet to be born.  It is wrong.  It 
is immoral to cast a huge burden of debt on to their shoulders 
before they are even born.  These people will not get a chance to 
benefit from the goods and services that were purchased with that 
credit.  However they will be saddled with the debt.  Reformers 
oppose Bill C-28 for that reason.  We think the lack of a plan to 
deal with debt is a very serious omission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make an argument that is maybe a little less academic, 
a little less abstract, a little more practical and important in 
present terms with respect to the need to deal with the problem 
of debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not very long ago in Asia we saw a dramatic meltdown of its 
economies.  Some of the currencies saw a devaluation in the order 
of 55%, a tremendous devaluation.  There are tremendous economic 
problems in Asia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result was that area of the world, which represents about 
one-third of the entire economy of the world, saw money flee from 
there to get away from the uncertain economic conditions and go 
to other parts of the world.  It went to the places where the 
countries had strong foundations, which is precisely what we are 
talking about, a strong economic foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did it come to Canada, one of the countries that should be one 
of the richest in the world given our vast array of natural 
resources?  No, it did not.  It went to the United States. That 
money went to the United States, our biggest trading partner, 
with the result that we saw our dollar fall relative to the 
American dollar, which meant that we had to pay more for all 
kinds of imports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the Bank of Canada reacted to it also hurt Canadians. 
The Bank of Canada, in a effort to shore up the dollar, raised 
interest rates which hurt all Canadians.  That is a direct impact 
of high levels of debt on ordinary Canadians.  When that kind of 
situation exists, in a sense it is a form of taxation on 
Canadians. 
It means they have less money for the things they care about 
doing, the things most people and families consider to be 
important like buying groceries, paying the mortgage, paying the 
rent, paying the car loan and setting aside some money for 
retirement and putting the kids through university.  However, we 
were denied that to some degree because of what happened as a 
direct result of having a high level of debt.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me again say that Bill C-28 does not deal with debt or 
present any plan to deal with the debt at a time when Canada is 
in a very precarious situation with respect to its debt. 
Therefore we oppose the bill for that reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me speak a bit more directly to the amendment moved by the 
Bloc Quebecois which deals with the issue of taxes.  Bill C-28 is 
an omnibus bill which deals with a number of things that have to 
do with the Income Tax Act.  However it concerns Reformers any 
time a bill amending the Income Tax Act does not do anything on 
one hand to simplify taxation or on the other hand to lower the 
level of taxes Canadians have to pay.  Sadly Bill C-28 does not 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically in Bill C-28 is a clause that could potentially 
confer some benefits on Canadian shipping companies.  The Bloc 
Quebecois has raised this amendment because it is concerned the 
finance minister, who sponsored the bill and who has interests in 
a shipping company, could potentially have some benefit from 
clause 241 in Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister and some Liberal members have suggested 
that although the finance minister may have sponsored the bill he 
did so unwittingly and did not seek to profit from the 
legislation.  I accept that because I think it is correct.  I do 
not think he would do that on purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to set that whole argument aside for a moment.  I think 
there is a more important principle at stake when we talk about a 
situation where Canada's finance minister has to shelter assets 
offshore because taxes in Canada are too high.  It is one of the 
great ironies in the country today and it is almost unremarked 
upon by the media.  Truly it is a great irony when the finance 
minister of the Government of Canada, through completely legal 
means, has done very well for himself.  In order to do some of 
the things he has done, he had to have his assets registered 
offshore in other regimes where taxes are more favourable.  He is 
not alone in doing this.  Many other companies do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House should reflect on why it is necessary for 
companies in Canada to do that if they want to succeed.  It 
raises some questions.  It raises a very important question that 
is brought home to regular Canadians every day when they sit down 
to do their books.  Taxes are simply too high in Canada today. 
They are staggering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have personal income taxes in Canada today that are 56% 
higher than the G-7 average.  It is much higher than the 
Americans, the Japanese, the British, the Germans and even the 
French.  We have staggering levels of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government proposed in the recent budget did little to 
help.  All it did was slow down the rate of growth in taxes. When 
the government brought in its budget, it brought in some measures 
that introduced tax relief which it talked about in the budget. 
However, it did not talk about the fact that in the last few 
months it had raised taxes far more than any tax relief would 
benefit Canadians through the measures in the budget. Through the 
Canada pension plan premium increase we will see the largest tax 
hike in Canadian history.  We will see those premiums rise by 
73%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, we know that every year a silent tax increase 
occurs that not many Canadians are aware of.  I refer to the 
phenomenon of bracket creep, a situation where because of the 
deindexation of the tax system many Canadians automatically are 
pushed into higher tax brackets every year as a result of cost of 
living increases that essentially leave them worse off.  In fact, 
bracket creep alone this year will wipe out all the benefit given 
to people through any of the tax measures introduced in the 
budget. 
The tax measures, according to the government's own 1998-99 
budget documents, will lower taxes by about $880 million, but 
bracket creep alone will increase taxes by more than $1 billion. 
With that measure alone Canadians are worse off.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this do to the ordinary Canadian?  I want to relate a 
story.  I was in my office on Friday talking with a constituent, 
a man who is on disability.  He is receiving Canada pension plan 
disability.  His name is Lawrence Weston.  Mr. Weston said 
“Please use my example in the House if it suits you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has an income of just over $13,000.  He gets a bit of money 
from workers' compensation as well.  He has literally thousands 
of dollars in expenses because of his medical problems.  He is 
diabetic.  He has had a number of surgical operations on his eyes 
and he is slowly going blind.  He cannot work.  If he goes to 
work, if he tries to do anything, his disability income 
disappears immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is in a situation where he makes just over $13,000.  He still 
pays about $400 a year in personal income tax in Canada today, 
even with all his medical expenses.  He cannot, believe it or 
not, take advantage of the disability credit in the income tax 
system.  One almost has to be dead to take advantage of that 
credit.  One probably has to be in the morgue for three days to 
be able to take advantage of that credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how many people have come into my office, people 
who are severely disabled and have tried to apply for it but 
cannot get it.  It is virtually impossible to get.  Mr. Weston 
could not get it so he is in a situation now where he has to come 
up with $400 and does not know how he will do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my friends across the way are truly concerned about people 
who are simply not making it today, they should start to lower 
taxes in a meaningful way.  Not everybody can, like the finance 
minister, find tax relief by moving assets offshore.  It is not 
something the rest of us can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not just end with people like Lawrence Weston.  Many 
other people are in exactly the same position. I received an 
e-mail the other day from a woman who had just retired as a 
nurse.  It is the same sort of situation.  She is complaining 
about the high level of taxes that she has to pay, a staggering 
level of taxes.  We receive mail all the time.  Often in this 
place I have quoted from letters we have received from people who 
are just barely making it but still paying all kinds of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider for a moment some of the businesses out there. 
For example, a Canadian Tire franchisee who is trying to make it 
cannot avoid taxes by all of a sudden flying a flag over the 
business saying that it is now Bahamian Tire or Panamanian Tire 
simply to avoid the high level of taxes in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That cannot be done.  People would like to do it; donut shop 
owners would like to be able to do that but cannot.  That is left 
to a few people and luckily the finance minister was able to do 
that.  I do not blame him one bit.  He is doing exactly what 
business people will do if they have a chance to do it.  They are 
trying to find a way to shelter their income.  They do not want 
to pay taxes.  Everybody does it.  People take advantage of 
loopholes in the tax system all the time.  If we can, we use 
RRSPs.  If they can, they shelter income offshore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we not have a tax regime that draws investment to the 
country?  Should we not have a tax regime that encourages people 
to come and invest in Canada?  My friend, the member for Peace 
River, pointed out the other day that for the first time ever in 
the history of Canada Canadians are investing more money outside 
Canada than foreigners are investing inside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  I wonder why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  “I wonder why”, says my friend in 
the back.  It is not a mystery to me.  Staggering levels of 
taxation, staggering levels of debt and spending that is 
unfocused and not priorized are the reasons why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must get back to a situation where we shore up the foundation 
that is crumbling and cracking, and we can do that in a number of 
ways. 
First, we start the process of priorizing our spending.  We do 
not waste those precious dollars given to us by taxpayers.  We 
dedicate that money to the things that are important to 
Canadians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say with all honesty what people in my riding say.  Mr. 
Weston came in the other day and said “we don't want to spend a 
whole bunch more money but let us focus on the things that are 
important like health care and higher education”.   The 
government has failed to do that.  It is quick to point out with 
Bill C-28 that it will not cut as much as it initially said it 
would in areas like health care and higher education.  Instead of 
cutting seven and a half billion dollars it will cut only six 
billion dollars.  I guess we should be thankful for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If our friends across the way are doing those things, if they 
are cutting dramatically in health care, how do they justify 
increasing spending on things like a television production fund? 
Is that a priority for Canadians?  I do not think so.  How do we 
justify the change of the health minister with respect to tobacco 
and the hundred million dollars it will cost taxpayers? That sort 
of money should be used to help people who cannot help 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not believe in taking the shotgun approach.   We say focus 
that spending where it does the most good.  We think those 
priorities should be things like health care, higher education, 
research and development.  We think we should have lower taxes. 
We advocate sweeping tax relief.  We believe we should take half 
of all the surpluses we run after we freeze spending at the 
current level of $103.5 billion and dedicate it to lowering taxes 
which will help all Canadians. It will lift 1.3 million low 
income Canadians right off the income tax rolls.  They would not 
have to pay income tax anymore.   I think that is the correct 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe there must be a program for debt repayment.  The 
government has no program.  It says that if there is a little 
money left over, it will dedicate a little money to paying down 
the debt.  That is not an approach or a plan, it is a whim, a 
wish.  We need a plan.  The Reform Party has presented a plan 
that would pay down the debt substantially over the next 20 
years.  It would take the debt to GDP ratio down from 70% to 20% 
and would save $20 billion a year in interest payments.  We do 
have a plan.  We have an approach to dealing with this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers believe the private sector does a tremendous amount to 
produce the wealth in this country.  The private sector produces 
the golden eggs that we see the government scoop up in ever 
increasing numbers only to turn around and have them bronzed. It 
has bronzed the golden eggs.  It has used them very 
inefficiently.  It takes that money which is better left in the 
hands of taxpayers and the wealth producers and it uses that 
money very inefficiently.  We say leave that money in the hands 
of taxpayers.  They will do a far better job than politicians and 
bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all those reasons I urge my colleagues to vote in favour of 
this amendment and also to vote against Bill C-28. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
do not know whether the chicken or the egg came first but in any 
case I thank the hon. member for Medicine Hat. He spoke to the 
integrity of the Minister of Finance.  His views on this issue 
speak well of the integrity the minister enjoys in this House and 
among Canadians.  One of his colleagues, the member for 
Battlefords—Lloydminster, said:  “Personally I don't believe 
so.  I think Mr. Martin is a man of integrity. I really do”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member noted in his speech that we are not doing enough 
about the debt.  Where has he been during the whole debate we had 
on the budget?  Does he not know we will be lowering the debt in 
terms of the percentage of GNP and in absolute terms?  Is that 
not how we dealt with the deficit?  We have taken measures in the 
budget to address the issue of the debt.  Why does he feel we 
have not addressed that issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I advise the House 
that we do not use members' names, not in a positive or a 
negative sense.  We do not use them at all in the House.  We 
refer to each other by either ministry or riding.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is fairly evident who 
the member will be supporting in the leadership race of the 
Liberal Party in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say simply that my quarrel is not with the finance 
minister's integrity.  I do not question that at all but I think 
members would acknowledge that the finance department did make a 
mistake in not following the procedures, the tradition I guess, 
of not putting the finance minister in a potential conflict of 
interest position which is sadly what happened when this 
legislation was introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said the debt would be reduced in terms of the 
percentage of GDP.  While that may look good on paper, it does 
nothing to help people who are paying $6,000 in taxes just for 
their share of the interest on the debt.  Reducing the debt as a 
percentage of GDP will not lighten their tax burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance committee is dominated by the Liberal Party. The 
recommendations the Liberals made on the finance committee were 
to set some absolute targets in terms of debt to GDP ratios for 
the government, something it failed to do when it brought down 
the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There needs to be a very aggressive program to start to pay down 
debt.  I would simply point out that in recent days the Business 
Council on National Issues came forward and said it was 
ridiculous, we need to have a much more aggressive plan than the 
government currently has for paying down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not, we leave all Canadians vulnerable in the event of 
not only international shocks like the Asian crisis but also the 
impact of a possible cessation crisis that we could face from 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I do not remember making reference to a member's name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is no problem. We 
passed it.  We will go on to questions and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that I have developed a 
communication tool with my constituents.  I am extremely pleased 
that now what seems to be happening is not only are the parents 
and adults responding with comments but also young people are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share with the House and with my hon. colleague from 
Medicine Hat some comments by a young man, a grade 12 student, 
who attended the forum for young Canadians in Ottawa in March. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: “As for the millennium fund, I believe it is a good 
idea but it reaches so few young Canadians.  That money should be 
put toward eliminating the national debt.  The government should 
not undertake any new major projects, the millennium fund, until 
the financial situation is resolved.  This means that until 
Canada's debt is gone, no new major projects should be started”. 
This is from a young man who is going to be faced with taxes.  I 
thought this was unique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point was put before me by another young person, 17 
years old.  This person would like an answer even though they are 
not of voting age: “How come the millennium scholarship fund 
will only help out 6% of post-secondary students and with only 
$3,000 per year?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my hon. colleague if he is also experiencing 
this concern by young people when they look at the debt that our 
generation and the generation before us are leaving them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
question.  It is something I failed to touch on during my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed I have heard from young people who are very concerned 
about the structure of the millennium scholarship fund because it 
does not treat all students equally.  It does not seem to 
recognize that many students will come out of school with 
staggering levels of debt, some of them $25,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen debt levels go ever upward in the last several 
years.  I think the young man is very level headed when he says 
that money should be used toward paying down debt. I think that 
is an excellent suggestion, recognizing that perhaps the real 
fiscal dividend will be the interest saving when we do actually 
start the process of paying down debt. That is the real fiscal 
dividend.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things the government does not address in terms of 
education is that when people benefit from a program like a 
millennium scholarship fund, so many of them just disappear to 
the United States.  We have a situation where the millennium 
scholarship fund turns out to be a subsidy for companies like 
Microsoft that come along and scoop up a third of the graduating 
class at Waterloo University.  So we have to do something about 
that side of it.  We need to ensure there are jobs in this 
country, that they are well paying jobs and that they are ones 
where taxes are not so high that they drive away the brightest 
and the best.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I commend 
my colleague from Medicine Hat on the excellent address he has 
given on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He referred to the $45 billion we are paying each year on this 
huge debt that has been amassed.  When we have emergencies like 
the ice storm, floods and other emergencies, of course those 
people suffering should be able to turn to the rest of Canada for 
the assistance that the charitable people of this country are 
always ready with and standing by to give. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the member to respond to the latest crisis we are seeing 
with regard to the many people who are sick and dying as a result 
of hepatitis C.  It seems we do not have funding available to 
help those people when they need help while we are spending $45 
billion to pay the interest on a debt.  Will he relate the whole 
history of the accumulation of the debt and the demand on the 
revenue dollar to pay the interest to our ability to respond to 
emergencies such as the hepatitis C emergency facing us today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
from the hon. member for Crowfoot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have a debt of $583.2 billion and as I mentioned in my 
address it is one of the largest debts in the entire world today 
in terms of per capita indebtedness, second only to Italy among 
industrialized countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is that we do not have the money often necessary to 
put toward programs that are vitally important.  A third of every 
tax dollar today goes to pay just the interest on the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine if we did not have to pay the debt. We would be able to 
lower personal income taxes by 71%. Or could dedicate the money 
to things that are vitally important like helping people who, 
through no fault of their own, have been victimized by a 
federally regulated blood system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need $4 billion to help out all those people who have been 
victimized.  We could do that today if the government would take 
the approach that the priorities are to start to pay down debt, 
focus spending on things that are most important and start the 
process of lowering taxes.  That is the approach that will help 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Pursuant to Standing 
Order 74 we are now in that period of the debate which is 10 
minutes per intervention with no questions and comments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I rise today to speak on Bill C-28.  Nothing 
would make me happier than to stand here today and announce to 
the House how pleased my PC colleagues and I are with the 
implementation bill.  However, due to the many serious shortfalls 
in Bill C-28 I am unable to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has shown its true colours with both the 
budget and Bill C-28.  This is not a government concerned with 
the needs and pains of all Canadians.  Instead, this is a 
government that believes in crisis management, big government 
intervention politics and damage control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At times it appears that the government has the delusion of 
adequacy.  What we know for certain is that this is a government 
without a vision.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that all members of this House pick up a copy of 
Bill C-28 and glance over it.  Then they would ask themselves: 
Is this document from a government with a plan or is this a 
document of hope?  Does this bill provide leadership that 
Canadians so desperately crave?  When we are honest with 
ourselves the answer is emphatically no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead we have a piecemeal reactionary bill that reflects the 
desires of the Liberals' favourite collective, the collective of 
special interest groups that represent only the needs of a 
fraction of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Four more years”.  This used to be the rallying cry of 
parties seeking re-election, but not this Liberal government.  To 
the Liberals it is the time span between announcements of 
proposals and their implementation.  This clearly contradicts the 
Liberals' 1993 promise to end the credibility-stretching 
tradition of not passing tax changes until months after they are 
announced, which is another broken red book commitment.  One is 
left to believe that the Liberals have had their gag reflexes 
surgically removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I rose in the House on Monday to speak to Bill C-223 I made 
a point which pertains equally to Bill C-28.  Canada needs a 
comprehensive national tax relief plan today.  If the finance 
minister will table such a plan with objectives for all Canadians 
it will have the support of our party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no monopoly on good economic ideas.  The GST needed to 
be implemented and Canada has a balanced budget because of it. 
The NAFTA remains an integral tool for economic growth.  Just as 
my party has always been willing to share its good ideas, we do 
so again today.  Tax relief is essential to our future prosperity 
and the PC Party does not mind if the Liberals want to borrow 
this plank from our platform as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance should know that the model in Bill C-28 
would never achieve sustainable growth.  Meeting with lobbyists 
and coming up with their pet initiatives might assist leadership 
bids, but it certainly does not help the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a lot about brain drain.  It devastates Canada's 
sustainability as a technology leader.  It deprives Canadian 
industries of the ability to remain competitive.  Above all, and 
what we can never forget, is that brain drain rips the heart and 
soul out of Canada and its families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am well aware that on this issue the industry minister has 
agreed with me, because his own departmental study entitled 
“Canada in an Integrated North America” shows this to be the 
case.  This study points to high taxation as the major cause of 
brain drain.  The study goes on to say that a married taxpayer 
working in Toronto with a salary of $100,000 could add over 
$20,000 to after tax income, an increase of close to 40%, if he 
or she were to earn the same income in New York or Chicago.  It 
is no wonder that our best and our brightest are leaving for the 
U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same visionary leadership that Canada needs on tax relief 
is also required on education.  This bill has taken the same 
lackadaisical approach to education that it takes to taxes. 
There are four targeted education components to Bill C-28.  As 
with tax relief, specific targeting will not be the answer.  The 
approach must be one of fairness for all, greater efficiency 
toward benchmark goals, and above all else it must be 
comprehensive in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much of Canada's future hinges on our national education 
agenda.  It is time to stop paying lip service to our citizens as 
Canada's greatest natural resources.  Instead we must begin 
backing this up with our actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very simple.  It is just like the Dutch boy with his 
finger in the dike.  Stopgap measures might make you popular, but 
you need the engineer who came up with the permanent solution. 
Guess what?  Where is that engineer?  The engineer is in the 
United States because he is getting a better tax break and, 
unfortunately, making $10,000 more a year and retaining 40% more 
of those wages after tax.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By enacting over 15 favourable changes to the tax code for 
selected groups the Minister of Finance has shown he knows there 
is a problem.  The hon. member for Medicine Hat mentioned that 
the finance minister has found out what the problem is because he 
has taken his assets and put them in a blind trust offshore.  Why 
did he do that?  Because he pays no taxes or very little taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the finance minister wants to become Prime Minister of this 
country he should realize that we have to be competitive on a tax 
basis with the United Stated or we are going to continue to lose 
our best and brightest to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the finance minister to go all the way by 
implementing broad based tax relief for all Canadians.  For 
example, an increase in personal income tax exemptions to $10,000 
would immediately remove two million low income Canadians from 
the tax rolls and reward all hard working Canadians.  Even though 
it is a Progressive Conservative idea we do not mind lending it 
to the minister for the good of our fellow Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, let us undertake a national education plan which 
ensures that we will produce the highest skilled individuals our 
industry requires.  Once we have the high skilled workforce, let 
us make sure they choose to remain in Canada by reducing the 
crushing tax burden.  Industry will be supportive of such a move, 
taxpayers will welcome this and families that do not have to 
export their children to the United States will be overjoyed. 
When the PC Party is presented with such an implementation bill 
we will resoundingly endorse it.  That day is not here.  Bill 
C-28 is not such a bill and the PC Party will be voting no.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Saint-Eustache—Sainte-Thérèse, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to Bill C-28, the 
catch all bill.  It  is in fact a humungous volume of 464 pages 
covering so many subjects that it is easy to play a game of hide 
and seek with and slip in unnoticed amendments that could 
benefit certain individuals or groups of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What had to happen happened.  The vigilance of my colleague from 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot led to the discovery on page 414, at the end 
of the volume, which everyone skips over, clause 241 amending 
paragraphs 250(6)(<I>a</I>) and (<I>b</I>) of the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this clause concern?  It concerns shipping, 
exclusively. 
The amendment, if passed, would permit international shipping 
companies to enjoy certain tax advantages.  We all know that the 
Minister of Finance of Canada is sponsoring Bill C-28 and that he 
is also the sole owner of Canada Steamship Lines Inc., a 
shipping company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the following questions.  Is the Minister of Finance in 
an apparent or a real conflict of interest?  In the light of his 
position, why is the Minister of Finance sponsoring this bill? 
Why, in his own words, is he unable to speak on the matter so as 
to avoid a conflict of interest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since February 5, 1998, my colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot 
and colleagues from all the opposition parties have been trying 
to get the facts on this bill and asking questions in this 
House, without success. 
The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister direct the 
member and the opposition critics to the Standing Committee on 
Finance.  As we know, the committee is under Liberal control. 
They do not want to hear the experts, witnesses who are likely 
to help the committee to get to the bottom of clause of 241 of 
Bill C-28, sponsored, I repeat, by the Minister of Finance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tactic helped me understand a lot of things. Yes, the 
finance minister was too busy with Bill C-28 to prepare a more 
realistic budget. He was more preoccupied with the tax benefits 
his company would get under this bill. Instead of indexing tax 
tables, helping small and medium size businesses to create jobs, 
reducing EI premiums and adjusting transfers to the provinces, 
our dear minister was busy with Bill C-28. Of course, his budget 
contained a proposal to promote Canadian unity, namely the 
millennium scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want people to misunderstand our position with regard 
to the millennium scholarship fund. 
We, in the Bloc Quebecois, support the millennium scholarship 
fund as long as Quebec can withdraw from that program and is 
fully compensated so it can administer its own scholarship 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I fail to understand why this government and the 
Standing Committee on Finance persist in refusing to hear 
witnesses. Do they have anything to hide? What kind of tricks do 
government members have up their sleeves? We want clear and 
precise answers to these and a lot of other questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation must be clarified for the sake of our integrity 
as members of this House, and that is why I am asking my 
colleagues to join me in supporting the motion brought forward 
by the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot.

<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today to address my serious concerns regarding 
Bill C-28.  Just as a refresher, this bill amends at least 18 
separate pieces of legislation, all pertaining to the income tax 
measures announced in the February 1998 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, the bill would amend provisions dealing with 
charitable donations, tax shelters, registered education savings 
plans, film and video production services, tax credits, the tax 
status of corporations, treatment of RRIFs, family farm 
corporations and many, many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be very clear.  The Reform Party opposes the use of tax 
concessions as an instrument for manipulating investment 
behaviour and the industrial structure.  These amendments add to 
the already convoluted, overly complicated and confusing tax 
code, a tax code which already contradicts our commitment to a 
fair and visible simple tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, these amendments do nothing to deal with the real 
problem of excessive spending, high taxes and escalating debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is typical of a Liberal-Tory approach to fiscal 
policy.  The Tories are as much to blame as the Liberals because 
we have experienced tax increases under both of these regimes and 
there is very little difference in the policies they have adopted 
over the years.  This bill offers no tax relief to cash strapped 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the defence critic for my party I noted with interest that 
the military received a pay increase.  It was well documented.  A 
press release issued by the government indicated that the lower 
ranks would be getting somewhere in the neighbourhood of a 3.2% 
increase.  How does that translate into the dollars and cents 
that will go into the pockets of those military personnel?  There 
are many who fall within the same earning range in this country.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the master corporal was so elated to have a $100 
pay increase. That is the gross amount. After taxes, after EI 
premiums, after CPP deductions which will be the biggest hit he 
will have to accommodate in that increase, this man will end up 
with $53 clear a month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of National Defence decided that was not 
satisfactory.  It decided that it would also boost his rent by 
$30 more a month.  Without even taking into consideration whether 
the master corporal is going to be in another tax bracket and 
subject to tax bracket creep as an additional hit on his wage, he 
realizes a net increase of somewhere in the neighbourhood of $23 
a month.  That is a crying shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that he has moved up from one tax bracket 
into another given the fact that he had very minor increases the 
previous year.  Here he sits in another tax bracket and he is 
going to be literally whacked. If he realizes an increase of $20 
a month out of that $100 gross, he will be lucky.  Many Canadians 
fall into that same category. They are barely making ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does nothing to help him, nothing whatsoever.  In 
fact, it gives him a greater burden and certainly not a sense of 
security.  It did not take him long to figure out that he was not 
much further ahead than he was before.  He will not be able to 
accommodate any emergency that creeps into his home and his life 
with any form of benefit from the wage increase he received. That 
is one aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel for him.  I feel for many other families who are subject 
to the same heavy tax burden. This government has failed to live 
up to its responsibility to those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also reflect back to some of the points that Reform has stated 
it would like to see.  Under the Liberal tax bill, that gentleman 
will obviously fall into a category somewhere around $2,000 to 
$3,000.  If we look at our last election platform, that master 
corporal and his family would only pay $520 as opposed to $2,189. 
That is quite a substantial difference.  It is almost $1,600 
back into his pocket.  I am sure he would be able to find ample 
opportunity to spend that on other areas which would benefit him 
and his family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does nothing to address the enormous public debt which 
the government and the Tory government before it are responsible 
for. Some of these social costs are nothing but staggering.  The 
total interest-bearing debt sits at around $600 billion.  Of 
that, $120 billion is held by foreign entities, non-residents. 
One-third of that 25% is American held.  The remainder is divided 
between Europe, Asia and elsewhere.  Undoubtedly it will have 
some effect if the markets are as uneasy as they are in Asia. 
That matter is far from settled.  It could definitely have an 
effect here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we prepared with the massive debt and the interest payments? 
We still have to go outside this country. There is not enough 
money to pay and hold that debt by investors in this country.  We 
have to go outside to borrow the money.  Why should we as an 
industrialized country be in that position?  It would be nice to 
be independent but unfortunately that is not the case.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one point dealing with the debt. The government also 
owes $3.7 billion to the Canada pension plan and $114 billion to 
the public sector pension plans.  Again this further complicates 
our debt picture and the burden on Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debt interest is $45 billion.  What would it be equal to if we 
had the capability of spending that $45 billion on things other 
than the interest on the debt? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be two full years of Canada pension or Quebec pension 
plan benefits.  It would amount to two and a half years of GST 
revenues.  It would amount to 71% of all PIT revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would amount to the entire annual budgets of the four western 
provinces, which is a substantial amount of money.  It would 
amount to the entire annual budgets of Quebec, Prince Edward 
Island and Newfoundland.  It would amount to the entire net debts 
of all of the provinces combined, excluding B.C., Ontario and 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This probably more than anything would be of greater impact:  it 
would be enough to pay for all Canadian hospitals, physicians and 
drug costs for an entire year. Our health care problem could 
easily be resolved if it was not for the interest that we are 
paying on our massive debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be enough to cut taxes an average of $3,200 a year for 
the average taxpayer.  Just think of what they could do with that 
money if it were in their pockets. In 1997 the average Canadian 
taxpayer paid $3,285 a year in taxes just to pay the interest on 
that debt.  This works out to $275 a month or just over $9 each 
and every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform has a much better plan. We will cut personal income taxes 
by $12 billion or $2,000 per family by the year 2000.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
address once again Bill C-28, which is sponsored by the Minister 
of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could examine several provisions, since this is an omnibus 
bill, but I am primarily concerned with clause 241. The reason 
is that the situation is not at all clear. Before me, several 
Bloc Quebecois members asked again that this issue, which leaves 
the impression there may be an apparent or real conflict of 
interest, be resolved, since it tarnishes somewhat the 
government's credibility when it comes to finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not normal to leave the impression that the Minister of 
Finance may be sponsoring a bill that could benefit a shipping 
company he fully owns, namely Canada Steamship Lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent the riding of Lévis, where we have a big shipyard. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT23"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT23"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1155

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member of Parliament for Lévis, I, like all my 
constituents, want to have the largest possible number of ships 
come through Lévis and the St. Lawrence Seaway. This is very 
important. Why? Because the more ships go through, the greater 
the chances for our shipyard to build ships. In fact, it would 
only be normal if Quebec's largest shipyard could build ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, one of these international shipping companies happens 
to belong to the Minister of Finance. Of course, the minister 
asked someone else to manage his interests, which are currently 
held in trust. 
However, there is cause for concern when we see that even if he 
himself does not make speeches, and does not answer questions in 
the House on shipping, he is sponsoring this bill, and clause 
241 is part and parcel of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois would like to have this bill referred back to 
the finance standing committee so that the whole matter can be 
cleared up, because our questions have not yet been given clear 
answers. Of course, the ethics counsellor of the Prime Minister 
has appeared before the committee, but his testimony has been 
quite vague, and everything went very fast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the Prime Minister's response yesterday. He is 
satisfied with answers such as this “Everything has been cleared 
up, and there is no problem whatsoever since I, the Prime 
Minister of Canada, have full confidence in my finance minister. 
The matter is closed”. We do no think it is that simple. 
That is too easy a way out. We should be hearing arguments, we 
should be dealing with substance and examining all aspects of 
this clause. We should check the legal implications and see who 
is getting tax breaks and under what conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with companies operating in international 
shipping. Canada Steamship Lines is one of these companies. Some 
will say this is quite normal, since we are dealing here with 
shipping and transportation. Ships do travel, just like planes 
do. That reminds me of Mr. Trudeau who said that fish should be 
under federal jurisdiction because they do swim from one place 
to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So ships do in fact travel, and the problem is not international 
shipping. The issue we ware raising is that the finance 
minister, who owns a fleet of ships, although his assets are in 
trust while his is in office, stands to benefit not only now but 
once he no longer is in office. This is a very important issue, 
and the people have a right to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to touch on another aspect. I have tried repeatedly 
to put shipbuilding on the government agenda again. When the 
current Minister of Finance was responsible for the Federal 
Office of Regional Development for Quebec, he systematically 
refused to answer any question either from myself or from any 
other member having anything to do with providing assistance to 
the shipyard in Lévis. 
His response was always that he had business interests in 
shipping. So, he does admit to having interests, but argues that 
they are held in trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is one of the most prominent ministers 
in government, but he hides behind his business interests in 
this area, claiming a conflict of interest, not to act in 
support of the shipbuilding and shipping industries, which are 
in serious difficulty today.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have a debate on this too, but one that would be, as 
suggested by the Liberals in 1993, a real summit on the future 
of shipyards in Canada. We could, for instance, update the study 
conducted more than ten years ago on the condition of the fleet 
at the international level to take a closer look at the 
financial assistance policies most nations have for their 
shipyards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our neighbour to the south is one of the leading shipbuilding 
and shipping countries in the world. The United States want 
nothing to do with OECD agreements regarding subsidies to 
shipyards. 
In Canada, we will not consider such a policy, because it 
appears we have reached an agreement with the other countries of 
the OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the other members of the OECD are not following 
Canada's example and, as they see that the Americans are not 
accepting this agreement to no longer subsidize shipyards, they 
are going about it in other ways.  Some European countries are 
doing like the Americans, waiting until everybody signs the 
agreement. In Canada, we are—if you will excuse the expression—the 
butt end of the joke, since, because we wanted to appear 
virtuous in the matter, we end up with a pretext to do nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I will use this question to point that out, because with 
every opportunity I have, as the member for Lévis and to 
contribute to the future of shipping and shipbuilding, I always 
advocate a real shipping policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that we must—and quickly so—get all 
the facts on clause 241 and the consequences of it, because in 
the interim the effect is to mortgage what might be done to 
further advance the cause of shipping and shipbuilding in 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak at third reading of Bill C-28, 
an act to amend a whole bunch of other acts with respect to tax 
measures.  It is a massive bill containing over 1,000 pages 
including accompanying notes. I wonder how many members of 
Parliament have read those 1,000 pages and know what we are 
getting into.  We do not need greater fiscal and social 
engineering by the government in any bill but that is exactly 
what we are getting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a broad perspective in my critique of this bill 
and of the approach being taken.  The Liberals and the Tories, 
the two parties that have been responsible for managing our 
economic affairs over the past several decades, have brought us 
to this point.  We have a legacy of massive overspending, a 
legacy of 30 years of never balancing our books which has led to 
a legacy of a $600 billion mortgage on our children and a legacy 
of regular and unremitting tax increases. Because of all this the 
federal debt is nearly 70% of GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GDP is the gross domestic product, the value of all the 
goods and services produced in our country over a year. Seventy 
per cent of everything we produce over a year is offset by this 
massive federal debt.  If we add provincial debts, that 
percentage approaches 100% of GDP.  In other words, we owe 
everything we make in a year to our huge national debt. If we 
were to apply it all to the national debt, that would just about 
pay it off. 
Obviously we cannot because people have to live.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What it does mean for people and for the average family of four 
is a share of the national debt of a whopping $77,700.  Every 
family has been put in the hole by past governments to the tune 
of $77,000 plus. This same average family paid $6,000 this year 
just to meet the interest on that debt.  If there were no debt 
presumably each of these families would have an extra $6,000 to 
work with.  Most families could feel the relief if that were the 
case, but of course it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also our income tax burden as a result of this abysmal record of 
fiscal mismanagement is the highest in the G-7 nations.  Of the 
developed nations our income tax burden is the highest.  The 
latest figures available show that between 1989 and 1995 the 
average Canadian family suffered a decline in real income after 
taxes of $2,540.  One of the reasons for the decline in real 
income is the incredible tax burden being placed on regular 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a letter from a regular Canadian that illustrates all too 
clearly the ridiculous lengths to which this tax system punishes 
Canadians: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My son attended Notre Dame school in Saskatchewan on a 
scholarship this past year.  Last week, he received a T41A in the 
mail in the amount of $9,500.  The scholarship represents his 
only income for the year (he does not even have a social 
Insurance number).  He now owes income tax in the amount of $450 
(and of course, our tax burden increases because he was removed 
as a dependant). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have several questions: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1.  How can the Liberals claim that they want to support youth 
education when there is a tax on scholarships?; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2.  Where does the government draw the line in taking money from 
its citizens?  If $9,500 is not below the poverty line, then what 
is? $5,000, or perhaps $2,500; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>3.  Is not the future of our nation, its educated youth, worthy 
of the same tax free allowances as MPs or MLAs?; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>4.  Just what kind of joke is the millennium fund going to be 
given the government's penchant for having its hands in our 
pockets? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife and I are lucky in that the tax owed by my son is 
something we can afford.  But, I can easily imagine families and 
situations where this would not be the case.  Please, if it is 
possible in opposition, point out this ludicrous situation to the 
Liberals and continue your efforts to remove the tax burden from 
those who can least afford it—in this case our students. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of real life tax grab that our income tax 
regime imposes on regular Canadians, the youngest, the hardest 
working Canadians.  This bill does absolutely nothing to address 
that kind of situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time in 30 years the chief financial officer of 
this corporation we call Canada has finally managed to balance 
the books.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from apologizing for the fact that this is the first year of 
doing something every Canadian and every financial institution 
must do routinely, we have a finance minister who acts like this 
is the beginning of easy street for every Canadian.  Of course, 
this is nonsense.  We are not out of the woods by any means as 
Canadians and Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that this one balanced budget has been 
achieved almost 70% through increased tax revenues.  Here we have 
a bill of over 1,000 pages that does not do one thing to reduce 
that horrendous tax burden on Canadians. Yet that is what allows 
the one balanced budget we have had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An additional 16.5% of the measures that balanced our budget 
were through cuts in support to key social services such as 
health and education.  Less than 1% was from actual decreases in 
other government spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government is good at piling the tax load high on everyone but 
very poor at restraining its own appetite for spending those same 
tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the government has adopted some suspect accounting 
policies that allowed it to manipulate budget figures with an eye 
to maximizing a surplus closer to the next federal election. 
This manipulation was so unusual and so blatant that, as members 
know, the Auditor General of Canada felt it necessary to 
challenge the government in a very pointed and public way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is critical that we not only refuse to put additional charges 
on the Canadian credit card but that we have a solid financial 
plan to start paying down the huge debit balance and make the 
kind of prudent budget and lifestyle choices that will ensure our 
future fiscal well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the government has not taken that kind of big 
picture approach.  A detailed study this month by the chief 
economist of Scotiabank says: “Aiming for balanced budgets and 
relying on an unprecedented stretch of solid growth and low 
interest rates to reduce the debt burden is a high risk strategy 
for a debt heavy government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the time has expired and so in closing I would like to say 
we cannot support this tax tinkering by the Liberals.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to Bill C-28 and, more specifically, to clause 
241, which I consider warrants all our attention.  Since 
February 5, everything leads us to believe, as the expression 
puts it so well, that there is something fishy here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know very well how this matter might be of personal 
interest to the Minister of Finance, who, it seems, would have 
every advantage as the sole owner of Canada Steamship Lines if 
the bill were passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the Minister of Finance sponsor a bill that includes 
tax provisions that could benefit his own company, when he is 
not entitled to speak on this matter in order to avoid a 
conflict of interest?  This state of affairs led to the 
presentation before the Standing Committee on Finance of five 
motions that would enable us to get to the bottom of this 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we asked for testimony from the president of the CSL, 
representatives of the trust company, the minister himself and 
Mr. Wilson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The five motions were important, but the most important one 
called for the appearance of any other witness who might help 
the committee understand clause 241.  Four of the five motions 
were rejected. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only witness allowed was Mr. Wilson, the government's ethics 
counsellor, who is employed by the Prime Minister, paid by the 
government and accountable only to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something unexpected happened in that Mr. Wilson's testimony 
reinforced our argument when he admitted that the Minister of 
Finance had not acted properly and that the code of ethics 
adopted by the government in 1994 had not been respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That code of ethics clearly stipulates that public office 
holders must do everything they can to prevent real, potential 
or apparent conflicts of interest from arising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 5, 1998, the government's ethics counsellor said on 
the CBC, and I quote “Canada Steamship Lines has indicated 
clearly to me that it has no intention of using this provision”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, twelve days later, on February 17, this same counsellor 
stated before the Standing Committee on Finance, and again I 
quote “Mr. Martin sponsored this bill and questions have been 
raised by some members that this constitutes an apparent 
conflict of interest. Had I been informed in advance, before 
this bill was introduced, there would have been a discussion on 
how best to handle the introduction of the bill for the Minister 
of Finance, who is responsible for all tax legislation. However, 
this prior consideration of our options did not take place as it 
should have”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This flagrant lack of impartiality by Mr. Wilson is appalling. 
And we are not the only ones to express criticism. 
The Senate is also addressing this issue. In fact, Senator 
Marjory LeBreton stated in the Upper House that there is an 
urgent need to establish new guidelines for the ethics 
counsellor, who should be independent from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a matter I could not overlook, and when the Liberal 
majority on the Standing Committee on Finance denied our 
request, the three other opposition parties saw, just as we did, 
that something fishy was going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, in a press conference held on February 19, 1998, 
the four opposition parties requested that the Prime Minister 
strike a special committee to shed some light on clause 241 of 
Bill C-28. We are still waiting for an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is unacceptable is that the Prime Minister is still 
refusing to clarify this issue for us, and is determined to put 
obstacles in our path at every turn. It is obvious to us, 
unfortunately, that everything is co-ordinated from the Prime 
Minister's office, including the Standing Committee on Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the Liberal government is showing obvious bad faith, 
and wants to protect its Finance Minister at all costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, what is important for people to understand is 
that the Minister of Finance is preparing to get a bill passed 
which he himself sponsored and from which he very likely will be 
able to profit.  And this is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have some serious questions about how available the 
self-same minister is to look after the financial interests of 
Quebec when he has demonstrated without a doubt that what is 
closest to his heart is to have ships plying the waters of the 
world, instead of concentrating his focus on his work and on 
keeping our ship with its fleur-de-lis colours afloat financially.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to rise today to speak on Bill C-28 which is 
described as an omnibus bill dealing with certain technical 
amendments covering a wide variety of acts relating to income 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the amendments are housekeeping and we will not be 
focusing our remarks on them.  We intend to confine our remarks 
to the significant reductions in the Canada health and social 
transfer that we have seen over recent years.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An earlier speaker noted that the bill is very technical and 
wondered how many people had read it and who had picked up a 
copy.  I think it is fair to say that none of the members 
currently sitting in the Liberal benches have looked at the bill. 
I might also say that a member might need two hands to pick up 
the bill because it runs to over 400 pages.  We believe it is 
absolutely ridiculous that parliament or Canadians should be 
expected to deal with such a complex bill which uses language 
that even highly paid tax experts would have difficulty 
deciphering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that Bill C-28 is anti-democratic in its format, its 
language and its content.  It is wrong for a government to 
present legislation steeped in such isolated language and expect 
Canadians to be informed or to have any idea of what their 
government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a story making the rounds that a justice department 
official was removed from the working committee on Bill C-28 
because he raised concerns about introducing such complex 
legislation.  He was most upset with the complexity and the 
incredible volume of amendments contained therein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that one would need to be a highly paid tax 
lawyer to even begin to tackle Bill C-28 in its present format. 
Needless to say, the lawyer's protests were not well received by 
the finance department and he was removed from working on this 
particular file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To turn to the CHST, we noted with some interest that Tom Kent, 
who was recognized as the godfather of Liberal social policy in 
the 1960s and 1970s, delivered a lump of coal to the government 
on December 24 last when he lashed out at the cutbacks that the 
government imposed on our medicare system in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other aspects of the CHST that I will get into in a 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Writing for the Caledon Institute of Social Policy, Mr. Kent 
accused the government of putting the 30 year old social program 
at a critical crossroads by simply neglecting to fund it 
properly.  He wrote “Medicare has been sustained by the public 
will”, and “For this medicare, we owe no thanks to the present 
generation of federal politicians.  It survives despite them”. 
Note the words, “It survives despite them.  Though they pose, 
because of its popularity, as the defenders of medicare, in fact, 
they have destroyed the financial basis on which their 
predecessors created it”.  That is where we are coming from on 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot of talk this morning from folks to my 
right, literally and figuratively, about the financial debt and 
deficit that we face.  There is also a social deficit in this 
country.  It is not only health care which is at risk, we have 
not made much progress in the fight against poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to another article from the Caledon Institute of 
Social Policy that was issued in February 1998.  The writer notes 
that the progress against poverty that Canada managed to achieve 
in the 1960s, the period that Tom Kent talked about, and in the 
early 1970s has stalled over the last 20 years.  Poverty has 
increased since then.  It was at 17.9% in 1996 compared to 14.2% 
in 1975.  That is an increase approaching 3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past Canada could count on economic growth and healthy 
labour markets to fight poverty.  Rising real gross domestic 
production reduced the number and percentage of people with low 
incomes while the faltering economy had the opposite effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is a result not only of the changing labour market which 
we have witnessed over the past couple of decades in this 
country.  It is also linked to household structure and 
demographics.  Gender is a critical demographic factor in the 
poverty story of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women typically have higher poverty rates than men and families 
led by women are more likely to be poor than those headed by men. 
The persisting inequality between the sexes is due basically to 
women's unpaid social and economic roles as homemakers and 
caregivers to children and aging parents.  It is a major factor 
that women have lower incomes and risk higher poverty.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to gender, marital status is a key factor.  Single 
parent families, most of which are led by women, face a high risk 
of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments traditionally have played a major role in combating 
poverty in this country.  Income security programs, also known as 
transfer payments, have supplemented or reduced employment 
earnings.  Major programs such as old age security, the 
guaranteed income supplement, the spousal allowance and the 
Canada and Quebec pension plans have been crucial sources of 
retirement income for most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance and workers' compensation replace 
employment earnings lost due to unemployment, illness and 
accident.  We know as well what has happened there.  I think 
especially about employment insurance and the fact that prior to 
the changes 85% to 95% of people who applied for unemployment 
insurance, as it was previously known, received benefits. Today 
those figures hover around 40%.  That is the reason there is a 
growing gap in this country between the very rich and the people 
at the bottom 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Child poverty as well remains a grave problem in this country, 
as has been noted by our party in particular.  One in five 
children now live in low income families.  Just under 1.5 million 
children, or 21.1% of all children who live in what members 
opposite often refer to as the greatest country in the world, are 
living in poverty.  That risk of course goes up if they are in a 
single parent family, especially one led by a woman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still other demographic factors are linked to poverty. 
Aboriginal Canadians are significantly more likely to be poor 
than the rest of the population.  Canadians with disabilities, as 
other speakers noted earlier today, are another group at risk of 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada health and social transfer that replaced the Canada 
assistance plan in 1996 has retained only the non-resident 
requirement of the Canada Health Act, and the loss of the in-need 
criteria under CAP has opened the door to a very different 
welfare system today than the one we have known over the past 
couple of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, this caucus is opposed to Bill C-28.  We reject 
the Canada health and social transfer which has resulted in steep 
reductions in funding to health and education.  There has been a 
40% reduction in funding to post-secondary.  We are advised that 
when the millennium fund kicks in in the year 2000 this 
government will be spending a full $3 billion per year less on 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are struggling to provide social services.  They 
too have seen their budget allocations slashed from $18.7 billion 
in 1993-94, the last year of CAP, to the projection of just under 
$12.5 billion in 1998-99, the current fiscal year that we are 
debating.  Therefore, this caucus will be opposing Bill C-28.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel obliged 
to speak on Bill C-28 for a number of reasons, the main one being 
that its sponsor, the Minister of Finance, is placing himself in 
a position to benefit from it.  His interests in civilian live, 
outside politics, can benefit from this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are more than 400 clauses in Bill C-28.  It is complex, and 
multi-facetted. 
The clause on shipping companies with foreign holdings takes up 
a half-page, and could easily have gone unnoticed as the pace of 
the House speeds up.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clause puts the finance minister, the sponsor of the bill, 
in an apparent conflict of interest. It is sad and 
incomprehensible that the finance minister himself, or the Prime 
Minister, did not try to put people's minds at rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politicians have questions. All opposition parties unanimously 
requested that the government shed light on the matter. Through 
their MPs, citizens also are involved. They need to know that 
their finance minister is in no way, shape or form in an 
apparent conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget how proud the finance minister is to have 
eliminated the deficit. 
One of the main ways he was able to reduce the deficit was to 
cut not federal spending but transfers to the provinces, the 
Canada social transfer, which replaced the former grants for 
heath, education and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Payments were drastically cut back. The cuts are not over yet, 
they are ongoing. They are cruelly evident in the health care 
problems experienced by every province. They are just as cruelly 
felt in education and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this same minister who was at the origin of the first 
major reform of employment insurance, reducing the duration of 
benefits, benefit levels and accessibility in a major way. 
In fact it is this first reform which is at the origin of the 
spring gap which affects many families, especially those who 
depend on seasonal work. They do not have enough insurable weeks 
to bridge the gap until they can work again in the spring; it is 
not for lack of wanting to work, but there simply is no work to 
be found where they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they own a house or have some savings, they have to spend the 
money they saved, and depending on the value of their house, 
they may not be entitled to any help at all. They are not 
eligible for social assistance. Several families have nothing to 
live on until work starts again. This spring gap has its origin 
in the 1994 reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister needs to be above all suspicion. 
It is difficult for opposition parties to understand why the 
Minister of Finance would not meet this basic requirement, which 
is to demonstrate that he is not in a conflict of interest, not 
even in an apparent conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the minister's reputation, why does he not agree to have a 
special committee struck to shed light on the whole issue? Why 
does he not find another solution of his choice to protect 
himself, once and for all, from such suspicions? It is hard to 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to understand why the Prime Minister, whose interest 
should be to defend the integrity of his finance minister, only 
does so by repeating statements that have not convinced any 
member of the opposition.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone taking a look at the issue can only conclude “but he is 
in an apparent conflict of interest”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the person looking after the minister's company says he 
does not intend to avail himself of the opportunity, it implies 
that he could actually do so. If this is not the case, then we 
should be told about it, because so far we have not received 
such confirmation. Again, the opportunity was provided by the 
same minister, whose reputation had not been tarnished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has been hard on ordinary Canadians 
regarding health, education and social assistance. He has been 
hard on the unemployed. Now, he must shed light on this issue. 
It is not too late. 
As far as I know, the bill will not be passed before April 21. 
The Minister of Finance must, for his own sake, for the sake of 
all politicians and for the sake of the public, shed light on 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-28 will remain a sad episode. There are other clauses in 
this legislation that remind us of policies against which we 
fought hard in the past. It is one thing to have dissenting 
opinions on economic and social policies, but it is another 
thing to see the Minister of Finance in an apparent conflict of 
interest and refusing to shed light on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament, I would have much preferred not to 
have to say these things but, given the facts, I have no choice. 
I would not be carrying out my responsibilities if I did not 
speak out. The Minister of Finance has a duty, which is to shed 
light on the whole issue, for his own sake, but also for the 
sake of the public and for the sake of politics.

should.  Of course, no one has to pay more than the law requires 
but, at the same time, the law should require that everyone make 
a just and reasonable effort.

It affects all sorts of provisions.  It is a bill that, by and 
large, is in the public interest.

problem with and that is clause 241.  Others before me have 
pointed this out, and I am going to look at it as well.  Between 
you and me, we are not going to pull any punches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is this: in accordance with his role and 
responsibility, the Minister of Finance introduced this bill.

suspicion.  There should never be a situation in which anyone

</I></B></P><P align=left>And I most certainly want to believe that the Minister of 
Finance is above any suspicion, and is not trying to derive any 
such benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is a problem with clause 241.  The Minister of Finance 
owns Canada Steamship Lines.  This is a large company, and the 
Minister of Finance is fortunate indeed to be the sole owner of 
this major company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He put the company into a trust so as not to be able to 
intervene directly in its affairs and derive any benefit. 
That is all very well. It is indeed the normal and expected 
procedure to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Minister of Finance knows full well that the 
trustee of the Canada Steamship Lines, the company he owns, has 
not sold the shares to buy some woodlot. He did not sell the 
shares to buy a bus company. The Minister of Finance knows very 
well that he is still, through the trustee, the owner of his 
shipping company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Companies with ships registered offshore stand to benefit 
financially from section 241, through a tax reduction. The 
Minister of Finance, through his trustee, is very much aware of 
the fact that his fleet is partially or totally registered 
offshore. 
The minister or his trustee used to his advantage some of the 
provisions already in the legislation, under which ships 
registered offshore somehow have less tax payable here in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still find it a little strange that the Minister of Finance, 
who is in charge of taxing all Quebeckers and all Canadians, 
corporations and citizens, would shelter his company through 
existing fiscal provisions. It may be ludicrous, but it is 
legal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the plot thickens is when section 241 is amended to allow 
shipping companies that meet specific criteria, just as that of 
the Minister of Finance does—to enjoy additional tax benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mind you, there are not that many shipping companies in Canada. 
If section 241 was giving some tax benefit to convenience stores 
and if the finance minister happened to own one, through a trust 
company, I would say that he will indeed get some benefit, but 
that so many store owners will get it too that he has certainly 
not done this just for his own sake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting here that the finance minister has done this 
just for himself. But it does look kind of odd, and even more so 
because since the beginning of February, the Bloc Quebecois has 
been asking the finance minister, in a respectful way, with 
courtesy but also with determination, to clear up all manner of 
doubt on the risk of conflict of interest as far as section 241 
is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We never got an answer from him. The Prime Minister himself 
jumped to his feet to tell us he trusts his finance minister. I 
should hope so. 
We should not expect anything less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But you have to agree with me that this is not good enough to 
make Canadians believe everything is just fine. If the rules in 
our code of ethics provided that a minister should avoid all 
conflict of interest situations or that he should have the 
confidence of the Prime Minister, it would be all right because 
that is what the rules say.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the real code of ethics does not say that. It says that a 
minister should avoid not only actual but also apparent 
conflicts of interest. That is the rule. What does the Prime 
Minister's confidence in his finance minister have to do with 
this? It is all very fine for him to trust his minister, but it 
would be much better if everybody could trust him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the finance minister refuse to shed light on this? Why 
does he not give us all the facts? Why does he hide behind the 
Prime Minister? Why does he not give all the information to the 
House and the media? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a problem. We asked that clause 241 be withdrawn from 
the bill, which would have allowed us to pass the rest of the 
bill with much less reluctance and then to deal with clause 241 
on its merits. But this was all put in the same package. The 
Liberals put in the whole cake something that looks like a 
rotten fruit. Do they think I will eat this cake? Do they think 
that the Bloc Quebecois will eat this cake? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have to vote against the whole bill because of these few 
lines that let the worst suspicions hang over the finance 
minister. Perhaps he has a good explanation. The Prime Minister 
may be right to have confidence in his finance minister, but why 
not give us the evidence to support this confidence? 
In the absence of such evidence, all bets are off, not only for 
the members of the Bloc Quebecois, not only for the opposition 
members, but also for the members opposite, and especially for 
the people of Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, this kind of thing erodes people's confidence in 
the government machinery, in Parliament itself. Why are the 
Prime Minister and the finance minister not taking the 
opportunity today in this House to clarify the situation and 
restore confidence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not be able to vote in favour of the bill before us 
because of the potentially rotten fruit in this cake poisoned by 
clause 241. 
I will not be able to vote in support of this bill, but I 
strongly hope that the finance minister will shed some light on 
the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he does not, the confidence that the people have in 
Parliament will be eroded and it will be the finance minister's 
fault.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to 
speak in this House on Bill C-28, which is sponsored by the 
finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not read the bill, since it is so thick that it 
discourages most people from conducting a thorough analysis. And 
yet, this did not prevent the Bloc Quebecois from noticing 
clause 241 and its two small paragraphs which will amend 
subsection 250(6) of the Income Tax Act. The possible benefits 
for the finance minister, who is the sole owner of Canada 
Steamship Lines, an international shipping company, are obvious 
and yet do not represent even two pages of this 464-page bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises several questions about the government's and the 
minister of Finance's real interest in supporting this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Quebeckers and Canadians pay for the cuts that the Liberal 
government has been making since 1993, while everyone is 
tightening their belts, while this government continues slashing 
federal transfers to the provinces, thus directly affecting 
people, while the finance minister is boasting about having 
eliminated the deficit in his last budget without saying that he 
did it on the backs of the provinces, the finance ministre, in 
spite of an apparent conflict of interest, is sponsoring a bill 
that will give him some fiscal advantages.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole population should know that some members of the 
government are very generous to themselves.  It is inconceivable 
for a minister to propose a bill which contains tax provisions 
favourable to his company.  This is an apparent conflict of 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance keeps using several arguments to prove 
his supposed non-involvement in Bill C-28.  He argued in this 
House that his company has been in a blind trust ever since his 
appointment to cabinet, and that he would not profit in any way 
from this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may be true, but it only applies to the present. As soon as 
the minister leaves his position, the trust arrangement will 
cease.  Not intending to use a privilege is not the same as not 
having the right to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, we do not know enough about section 241 of this bill. 
The motions introduced in the finance committee by Bloc 
Quebecois members were all defeated by the Liberal majority, 
except one allowing the ethics counsellor to appear before the 
committee.  This counsellor is an employee of the Prime 
Minister, paid by the government and accountable only to his 
employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the testimony of this witness only served to reinforce our 
arguments since he acknowledged that he was not an expert in 
international tax laws and was therefore unable to answer 
several of our questions.  He went as far as saying that there 
might be an apparent conflict of interest and that, had he been 
made aware of the implications of section 241, he might have 
acted differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is clear to the Bloc Quebecois and the whole 
population that the Minister of Finance did not abide by the 
code of ethics approved by his government in 1994, which says 
that anyone holding public office should avoid being in a real, 
potential or apparent conflict of interest.  In this case, there 
is an apparent conflict of interest and this is why I ask, in 
good faith, that the Minister of Finance withdraw section 241 of 
Bill C-28 while there is still time left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, we have a duty to our fellow citizens to 
improve their quality of life and collective well-being, not the 
right to use our power to our own benefit. Surveys show that 
members of Parliament are not well perceived by the public. 
After seeing such ways of doing things, it is easy to understand 
why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister says he is innocent of any intention. 
However, in 1996, he introduced a bill in the House containing 
the same provisions as clause 241; however, that bill died on the 
Order Paper. In 1998, the minister came back and sponsored Bill 
C-28. How could he not be aware, as he would have us believe? How 
can a minister introduce a bill without knowing its content? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How 
could Paul Martin be allowed to sponsor a bill containing tax 
provisions that could be beneficial to his own company, 
considering he is not allowed to speak on the matter so as not to 
be in a situation of conflict of interest? In fact, there is 
appearance of conflict of interest and considering the importance 
of his position and the integrity with which he should manage the 
finances of the country, the finance minister should be clear of 
any suspicion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a warning to the government. We asked the 
finance minister to delete clause 241 of Bill C-28 until the 
matter can be cleared up. He should do so as quickly as possible 
if he wants to preserve the credibility he has left in Quebec and 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot has introduced 
another amendment proposing to refer Bill C-28 to the finance 
committee so witnesses can be questioned and the situation 
clarified. The amendment says that the motion be amended by 
deleting all the words after the word “that” and substituting the 
following: “Bill C-28, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, be 
not now read a third time but be referred back to the Standing 
Committee on Finance for the purpose of reconsidering clause 
241.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the amendment proposed by my colleague from 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot because, in my humble opinion, it answers 
the numerous issues that the opposition has been raising for more 
than a month. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since we are at the 
end of the debate, I would like to try to illustrate the main 
reasons the Bloc will be voting against Bill C-28.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through this bill, the Minister of Finance is trying to pass 
legislation that, in all likelihood, could provide certain tax 
advantages to his company, Canada Steamship Lines, of which he 
is the sole owner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 241 of Bill C-28 would amend section 250 of the Income Tax 
Act.  In this 464 page omnibus bill, clause 241 contains only 
two paragraphs and it concerns shipping exclusively.  The bill 
is sponsored by the Minister of Finance himself. 
These two facts constitute the appearance of a conflict of 
interest, which contravenes the government's code of ethics and 
that is what we have been seeking explanations for since 
February 5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Minister of Finance sponsor a bill containing tax 
provisions that could benefit his own company, when he is not 
entitled to speak on the matter in order to avoid a conflict of 
interest?  There is the appearance of a conflict of interest 
and, given the importance of his position and the requirement 
that he manage government finances honestly, this great Minister 
of Finance must be above suspicion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the minister offers the defence that his company has 
been in a blind trust since he became minister, he will not 
always be a minister and may perhaps draw benefit from this tax 
amendment. 
The minister and the representatives of his company insist that 
Canada Steamship Lines does not intend to take advantage of the 
measures included in clause 241.  They do not intend to, but 
that does not mean they are not entitled to.  This is the point 
we would like to see clarified by the Standing Committee on 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the start we have demanded that light be cast on this in 
the finance committee.  The Prime Minister tells us: “I have 
complete confidence in my Minister of Finance.  He is not 
involved, the legislation cannot provide him with any 
advantages, and if you have any questions, ask them where they 
should be asked, in the finance committee”.  But when we get to 
the Standing Committee on Finance with its Liberal majority, the 
majority response is that they want to hear no more witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the Prime Minister is saying “You may ask 
questions, but you will get no answers”.  We are entitled to ask 
questions, but the committee members, most of whom are Liberals, 
turn around and tell us that they do not want to hear the 
answers, that their confidence in the finance minister is all 
they require to be assured that the bill will not bring him any 
advantages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have three main reasons for doubting the confidence inspired 
by the Minister of Finance.  If we remember back to when the 
Minister of Finance was negotiating the harmonization of the 
provincial sales taxes in the maritime provinces with the 
federal sales tax, the Minister of Finance included $1 billion 
in his financial statements a year before that amount was paid 
to the maritime provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, he pulled out $1 billion with which to inflate 
his deficit for that year.  In order to avoid what? 
In order to avoid having to calm down the people who were 
clamouring for a bit of a break from taxes and budget cuts. It 
was to the Minister of Finance's advantage to have a higher 
deficit showing than there actually was, because this took the 
heat off him, stopped people from demanding more, and from 
begging “Spare us, we cannot bear the tax burden any longer”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister used a strategy that has been denounced by the 
auditor general.  According to the auditor general, “The 
Minister of Finance, in keeping with the accounting principles 
generally recognized for governments, must not proceed in this 
way.  He must allocate to each year the amount of expenditures 
that occur in that year”. 
The Minister of Finance did not do so. He cannot be trusted.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second example. The Minister of Finance decided to establish a 
Canada Foundation for Innovation with an investment of $800 
million. What did the minister do? He budgeted $800 million last 
year, knowing that not a single cheque would be issued to the 
foundation until the following year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the minister allocated $800 million to the 
foundation in his budget, while it had not yet been officially 
established. The auditor general told the Minister of Finance he 
could not do that. 
He said “There must be transparency and continuity in 
accounting, and under the rule of continuity books must be kept 
the same way year after year so that people know where they are 
going. You cannot do it that way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister's answer was “I am in charge here, and I 
will do as I please”. He made sure to inflate expenditures by 
$800 million to avoid, once again, achieving zero deficit too 
quickly. This way, he could keep penalizing the unemployed, 
maintain employment insurance premiums and not give a penny more 
to help children living in poverty. This way, he could keep 
cruising at his own pace to eventually show a surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the fact that he was told by the auditor general 
that he cannot do that, the minister keeps doing as he pleases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third example is the millennium fund. The minister is 
investing $2.5 billion in this fund to grant scholarships to 
students, but the first cheques will not be issued until the 
year 2000. Yet he budgeted this amount in the budget for the 
year that just ended two days ago, on March 31. Not one penny 
has yet been expended by the government, since the first cheques 
will be issued in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance recorded this amount in the budget for 
fiscal year 1997-98. Why? Because, had he not, he would have had 
to report a surplus of nearly $3 billion. He did not want to 
show a surplus, just a zero deficit. Had he reported a surplus, 
he would have had to use this money in accordance with the 
people's wishes. So he did not, preferring to keep doing as he 
pleases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Bloc Quebecois do? We went before the public 
accounts committee. 
Wet denounced this attitude and supported the auditor general's 
recommendations. But the Liberals, who have a majority also on 
this committee, showed up in full strength. They came to say 
that the finance minister was right to behave the way he was 
behaving, and to do his accounting the way he wants and if, in 
another year, it suited his purpose to do otherwise, he would do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the finance minister, whom the Prime Minister 
trusts, does what he wants with numbers, even if it lacks 
transparency, and gives a distorted picture of reality, making 
people believe things that are not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we trust a finance minister who behaves in such a way? We 
say we cannot. So when the minister tells us his company is not 
involved and will not profit from these benefits, can we trust 
him? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister can behave the way he has with financial 
statements, could he not do the same when it comes to two little 
subclauses on tax relief which could possibly benefit his 
company? Can we believe him? Judging by his previous behaviour I 
am not sure we can trust him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are asking him is this, and we are not accusing him of 
being dishonest. But we are saying “There appears to be 
something that might benefit you. Could you put our minds at 
ease and allow the committee to call tax experts who will come 
and tell us categorically that these two subclauses are unlikely 
to give any tax advantage to your shipping companies which are 
registered in Panama?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we want to know and what the Liberal government has 
so far refused to tell us. 
For these reasons, we will not be able to support Bill C-28.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is still not too late, and we are still hoping the government 
will wait to put its bill to a vote, withdraw these two 
subclauses, and come back with it once the committee has 
prepared a decent report after a comprehensive review. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
originally I was not going to speak to the bill.  However I would 
like to inject a bit of information that Canadians should be 
aware of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gist of the Bloc's arguments is appearance, as the member 
just stated.  Canadians will know that when members of Parliament 
are asked to join cabinet there is a requirement that they put 
all their assets into a blind trust.  There is a requirement that 
they also adhere to the provisions of conflict of interest under 
the auspices of the ethics commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue that the members have raised has been talked about 
quite a bit in this place and was before the finance committee. 
The ethics commissioner appeared before the finance committee and 
tabled a report on all the holdings of the finance minister, on 
all matters that had to be put into the blind trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have looked at the report and all the information filed as 
required by the laws of Canada.  I have concluded that very 
little could occur in the country that would not impact on the 
finance minister with regard to his investments or holdings.  If 
interest rates go up, the finance minister will win.  If interest 
rates go down, the finance minister will probably win.  It is the 
same for any change with respect real property, rental property 
or other investments that happens in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we say that anything the finance minister or any other 
cabinet minister has any direct or indirect relationship with 
should be exempt from any legislation that ever occurs in the 
House?  Clearly the answer is no.  That is why there is a blind 
trust and why others take care of the affairs of a minister who 
has responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members brought forth information and made indictments of 
the finance minister.  They have suggested, for instance, that 
the bill was tabled by him when they know that is not the case. 
It is was the Secretary of State for Financial Institutions. They 
said that he brought forward these provisions.  In fact that is 
not true.  Those provisions were actually brought forward by the 
B.C. association responsible for shipping.  The advocacy on its 
behalf was basically to stimulate the shipping industry in 
Canada.  It was the association's advocacy; it was not the 
finance minister, as the members would like to suggest.  As a 
matter of fact it has even put on the record that Canada 
Steamship Lines could not get any advantage presently from this 
provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if a few things were changed and a few other things 
were done there may be some tax advantages.  It is a business and 
business will not be changed simply because of some changes. 
Business decisions are made on much more.  This is not applicable 
only to this company.  It is applicable to the entire shipping 
industry and those who would like to be involved in the shipping 
industry to try to promote shipping within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to raise this point because Canadians should know that 
information is being presented in an eschewed fashion.  It is 
being presented in a way which questions the integrity of the 
finance minister.  The members even suggested that it was 
contrary to the code of ethics.  That is not so.  The ethics 
commissioner came before the finance committee and ruled that it 
was not a conflict of interest.  He had checked it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition then decided to do even more work on it.  There 
is no prohibition for members of Parliament or any committee or 
anybody else to do any further work that they might deem 
necessary, but this basically constituted allegations that were 
unsubstantiated.  There was really nothing to prove. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members want to say there is an appearance or an allegation, 
but I can bet they will not say that outside the door here. 
In here they have parliamentary immunity.  They will not go 
outside the door and accuse the finance minister of bringing in 
provisions for his own benefit.  That would be a slanderous 
statement.  They would be sued.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reaffirm for Canadians that the rules of this place require 
that all of the affairs of a minister be placed in a blind trust. 
The ethics commissioner has made a detailed ruling with regard to 
this matter.  He has answered all questions from all members of 
all parties.  The committee as a whole decided that there was no 
further business to deal with on this issue.  The committee is 
not empowered to deal with witch-hunting or fishing expeditions. 
There was business before the committee and that is exactly what 
was done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the members and, perhaps more important, to 
Canadians that the question before the House is with regard to an 
omnibus bill relating to the budget of 1997.  There are some 
important issues in it, the most important of which is that 
fiscal responsibility has always been demonstrated by the 
government since it took office in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has moved the country away from a $42 billion 
deficit and is now delivering in a fair and responsible fashion 
the balanced budget that Canadians asked for.  It did not do it 
in a meanspirited way.  It was the Liberal way to make sure that 
we dealt first with those who had needs, those with low and 
middle incomes.  This was also reflected in the 1998 budget that 
we have already debated in the House.  Provisions were focused 
and targeted to make sure that Canadians received the benefit of 
the hard work all of them had done to ensure that we got our 
fiscal house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all benefit from the financial health of Canada, from low 
interest rates, from growth in the economy and from growth in 
employment in Canada which will continue.  The commitment of the 
government to be fiscally responsible continues.  The leadership 
of the finance minister has been very prevalent.  He has had to 
make some tough choices, but I believe those choices have been 
fair and in the best interest of all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
a great pleasure to speak to members about Bill S-4, an act to 
amend the Canada Shipping Act (maritime liability) for this third 
reading debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I talk about the bill I have been asked by the Minister 
of Transport to acknowledge the critical role that has been 
played by the members of the House, the senators and the standing 
committees who have undertaken a thorough examination of this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not take a moment to thank members 
from the other side of the House for their support.  We see in 
Bill S-4 a good example of our ability to work together for the 
benefit of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation was first introduced by the former minister of 
transport as Bill C-58 in the last Parliament.  At that time the 
House Standing Committee on Transport held hearings where 
industry groups expressed their general support for Bill C-58. 
Their concerns have been addressed by the standing committee. The 
amendments proposed to the legislation have since been included 
in this bill, Bill S-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank the senators and particularly the 
members of the Senate standing committee on transport and 
communications for their work on the bill.  Of course the bill is 
a Senate bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They adopted an amendment to the legislation to remove from the 
bill a proposed modification to the definition of pollutant which 
raised concerns among industry representatives who appeared 
before the committee on transport and communications. 
This amendment to Bill S-4 will allow more time for discussion 
between the government and the industry on the definition of 
pollutant and whether it should be modified in the future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes to the Canada Shipping Act which I will outline 
would not have been possible without the dedicated efforts of 
government officials, in particular those from Transport Canada 
and the Department of Justice. Throughout the process of this 
legislation, officials from the Department of Transport have 
spoken at length with the industry, including the shipowners, 
passengers, cargo owners, the oil industry, marine insurers and 
the marine legal community.  I take this opportunity to thank 
these industry groups for their participation in this reform and 
for their contribution toward and support for the new 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thoroughly convinced and I am sure every member of the 
House will agree that this new legislation represents an 
important step toward modernizing Canadian maritime liability 
regimes.  It will improve considerably the amount of compensation 
available to claimants for maritime claims in general and for oil 
pollution damage in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation consists of two sets of amendments. 
There are those relating to limitation of liability for maritime 
claims in part IX of the Canada Shipping Act, and those relating 
to liability of compensation for oil pollution damage in part XVI 
of the same act.  In both cases the amendments will provide for 
the implementation of international conventions on maritime 
liability and therefore will harmonize Canadian maritime 
liability legislation with the legislation in other major 
maritime nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key policy objective in respect of global limitation of 
liability is to achieve an equitable balance between the 
interests of the shipowners on the one hand and of potential 
claimants on the other.  Our current legislation concerning 
limitation of liability for maritime claims contained in part IX 
of the Canada Shipping Act is based on an international 
convention adopted in 1957. One can easily imagine that the 
limits of liability set out in that convention and by this very 
fact in our existing legislation are very low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the current limits of liability for ships below 300 
tonnes, which includes most pleasure vessels, is approximately 
$140,000.  We can appreciate that this limit is totally 
inadequate. I can assure the House that this feature does not 
help either the claimants or the shipowners.  The new limits for 
ships below 300 tonnes has been set at $1.5 million which is more 
in line with the liability levels long established in the 
automobile sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For ships over 300 tonnes, the new limits of liability are based 
on the 1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime 
Claims and its protocol adopted in 1996.  The 1996 protocol to 
the convention contains a new procedure for future amendments of 
limits of liability which responds to concerns that the method of 
revision of the limits was too cumbersome and too costly. It will 
now be easier to amend the limits in the international 
convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spirit of this innovative provision has been incorporated 
into Bill S-4 to ensure that the limits of liability in the 
Canada Shipping Act keep their value over the years to come.  It 
will now be feasible to increase the limits in the Canada 
Shipping Act by order in council to keep up to date with any 
increases in the limits adopted under the 1996 protocol in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members probably know, the Minister of Transport signed on 
behalf of Canada the 1996 protocol last September. 
This protocol is a major step toward the modernization of 
international maritime law and we can be proud to be at the 
forefront of this international initiative.  We will be in a 
position to formerly ratify this important treaty when Bill S-4 
is passed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to the second issue contained in Bill S-4, the 
revision of the existing regime of liability and compensation for 
oil pollution damage. This regime was last revised in 1989 when 
Canada implemented and acceded to the 1969 international 
convention on civil liability for oil pollution damage and the 
1971 international fund convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1969 convention established the liability of owners of laden 
tankers for oil pollution damage, while the 1971 fund convention 
provided complementary compensation to the extent the protection 
under the 1969 convention was in adequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to participating in the international oil pollution 
compensation fund, Canada has its own domestic compensation fund 
called the ship source oil pollution fund.  This is a fund of 
first resort for all claimants for oil pollution damage in Canada 
and in waters under Canadian jurisdiction.  Canadian 
contributions to the international fund are paid from the ship 
source oil pollution fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-4 will implement the provisions of the 1992 protocols to 
the 1969 and 1971 conventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the 1992 protocols the amount of compensation available 
for pollution damage caused by oil tankers was increased from 
$122 million per incident to approximately $270 million per 
incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1992 protocols also bring a number of important changes 
including a provision to make it clear that shipowners are 
liable for the costs of reasonable measures of reinstatement 
where oil pollution damage from a ship results in the impairment 
of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation will enable Canada to follow many other 
countries which have terminated their membership in the 1971 
regime and moved to the 1992 regime.  If we do not take the same 
action as others we will continue to be one of the major members 
still under the old regime. While not entitled to any improved 
compensation, Canada would also then be exposed to higher 
contributions to the international fund due to the reduced 
membership of nations under the old regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the passage of Bill S-4 Canada will now be in the position 
to accede to the 1992 protocols. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all my colleagues to join us on the government side and 
lend their support in order to pass this bill so that it can 
receive royal assent as soon as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>

Standing Committee on Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the current standing committee had about as much input 
into this legislation as I will have into the election of the

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an interesting coincidence here that we are debating 
Bill S-4, a bill relating to marine liability, just after the 
signing of a new international agreement on inter-regional action 
to eliminate substandard shipping.  On March 24 and 25 
delegations from 33 marine nations, European commissions, the 
International Maritime Organization and the International Labour 
Organization all gathered in Vancouver to discuss the tightening 
and control of safety, labour and environmental standards of 
merchant vessels

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a remarkable degree of consensus on the need to 
continue stringent inspections and to control vessels, especially 
bulk carriers and tankers when they enter seaports. There was 
also agreement in principle on the international exchange of 
inspection data in order to establish black lists of consistently 
offending vessels which would then be barred from the ports of 
all nationals represented at the conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International control of the safety of ships received its 
greatest impetus just 20 years ago with the grounding and 
break-up of the <I>Amoco Cadiz</I> off the coast of France.  This 
led to stringent European port state control under the Paris 
memorandum of understanding of 1982.  The Paris memorandum of 
understanding provided the pattern for the Tokyo memorandum in 
1993, a memorandum of which Canada was a founding member.  Canada 
subsequently joined the Paris MOU in 1994.  Canada and Russia are 
therefore members of both groups, the only two countries that 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under these memoranda any ship which has not been inspected by a 
co-operating state during the previous six months, most bulk 
carriers and tankers and all passenger vessels are subject to 
inspection upon arrival at a seaport.  The inspection target for 
each country in the Paris memorandum is 25%.  For the Tokyo 
memorandum it is 50% of ships in the entire region with most 
inspections taking place in the wealthier countries, very few in 
the less developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of substandard ships plying the seas is mind 
boggling.  Of 29,700 ships subjected to port inspections in 1996, 
8% had to be detained in port until they remedied deficiencies. 
In Canada the rate of detentions for the last two years has been 
10%.  Deficiencies may range all the way from substandard crew 
accommodations through defective or inadequate firefighting or 
lifesaving equipment to structural defects so severe that a 
vessel is quite literally unseaworthy.  The latter of course are 
disasters waiting to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The names of detained vessels are published quarterly as a 
warning to other port authorities to give them special attention. 
These reports are also available to shippers who might wish to be 
somewhat selective of those to whom they entrust their goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately rogue vessels operating below standards or at the 
thin edge of acceptability may offer rates as much as 15% below 
those of legitimate carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An ongoing problem referred to by almost every national 
delegation at the conference is the failure of flag states to 
enforce adequate standards at their end.  One delegate compared 
flag state control to the fence at the top of a cliff and port 
state control to the ambulance sitting at the bottom.  If states 
offering flags of convenience were diligent or even interested in 
marine safety, receiving ports would not have to be nearly so 
diligent and the necessity to detain vessels for repair would be 
much less common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, with most trading nations now subscribing to port 
control of vessels, it is becoming increasingly difficult for 
unsafe ships to find a berth.  Moreover, the practice of naming 
and shaming ships that have been detained points fingers at the 
flag states with the lowest standards and will tend to discourage 
insurers and responsible shippers from doing business with ships 
carrying those flags. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the whole the conference was one of those rare international 
frolics that actually reached some useful conclusions and which 
should contribute to greater co-operation and information sharing 
to the general benefit of all countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A cursory overview of the new maximum liabilities set out in 
Bill S-4 clearly indicates that the minor costs of port 
inspections compared to the costs of major marine disasters, not 
to mention the preservation of human lives and protection of the 
environment, make inspections one of the world's best 
investments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the ever increasing co-operation between maritime nations 
with respect to safety and marine liability it is important that 
our liability legislation be harmonized with that of other 
countries.  Bill S-4 accomplishes this.  Increased liabilities 
will add a little to the cost of marine insurance but commercial 
vessels insured in mutual protection and indemnity associations 
will probably see no substantive increase in insurance rates 
because coverage already provided by mutual associations is 
unlimited.  Their rates are already proportionately high. 
Pleasure crafts are mostly already insured to the levels of 
liability set forth in Bill S-4, much as private automobiles 
usually have far more coverage than the minimum required by law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that commercial shipowners not covered in 
mutual associations will have increased insurance costs.  The new 
rates based on the size and frequency of claims will be an 
encouragement to commercial shippers to maintain a decent safety 
record.  If all major maritime states subscribe to the new regime 
the costs of insurance which are ultimately borne by shippers 
through higher rates should be evenly and more or less equitably 
distributed among the trading nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important features of this bill is that the 
limit of liability on an oil spill by a tanker not covered by a 
mutual association will be increased from $120 million per 
incident to $270 million.  That may not be too relevant because I 
believe that most tankers are in mutual associations and 
therefore have unlimited liability.  For the few cases where 
there are ships with nothing but their individual insurance 
policies, that very large increase in the limit of liability is 
very significant. The oil spill liability limits for smaller 
ships will also be increased but these increases will be 
proportionate to their gross tonnage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all, Bill S-4 is useful legislation.  The Reform Party 
supports Bill S-4 even though we are going to have hold our noses 
with regard to its origin in hog hollow, that other place down 
the hall.

Quebecois, I am pleased to address Bill S-4, an act to amend the 
Canada Shipping Act (maritime liability). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will support this bill, which is excellent 
since it extends maritime liability to shipowners. We think it 
will allow us to avoid situations such as the case of the <I>Irving 
Whale</I>, where a disaster occurred but maritime liability was 
inadequate. The proposed legislation sets specific limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we support the bill, it should be pointed out that it was 
first introduced in 1996, as Bill C-58. 
Bill C-58 had reached committee stage and had been amended by the 
Standing Committee on Transport which tabled its report to the 
House of Commons on December 11, 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill died on the Order Paper because, members will 
recall, the Prime Minister called an early election in April 
1997, only three and a half years into his first mandate. 
But the legislation followed its course, and has now been sent 
here by the Senate. However, if it had passed third reading in 
the spring of 1997, the bill would already be in effect.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-4 basically seeks to implement old international 
conventions, namely the 1976 Convention on Limitations of 
Liability for Maritime Claims, the 1996 Protocol, the 1992 
Protocol to amend the 1969 International Convention on Civil 
Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, and the 1971 International 
Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for 
Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a period of more than 25 years.  This is 
rather astonishing, given the context.  I remember because I was 
on the Standing Committee on Transport in the fall of 1996.  It 
was urgent and absolutely essential that this bill be passed in 
order to harmonize our legislation with that of other countries. 
This bill, without wishing to detract from it, is only now 
becoming law.  In my opinion, this tells us that the government 
does not view shipping as very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing that should not be forgotten.  During the 
1993 election campaign, the Liberal Party candidates in the 
Quebec City area—including the present Prime Minister's chief of 
staff, who was a Liberal candidate in the riding of 
Québec—promised to hold a summit on the future of shipbuilding. 
Shipbuilding and shipping are related, in my opinion, because 
there cannot be any navigating until ships are built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It happens that my riding is home to the most important shipyard 
in Quebec, the Lévis shipyard, which, in its heyday, had 3,000 
employees, but which now has about 500. The Lévis shipyard is 
not the only shipyard in this situation. Other shipyards 
elsewhere in Canada, including Saint John Shipbuilding, the two 
Great Lakes shipyards and shipyards in western Canada, are also 
in a slump. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal candidates at the time, however, said that, given 
the number of jobs involved, something absolutely had to be 
done. But, one election later, we are still trying to pass a 
bill that will harmonize our legislation with an international 
convention Canada helped negotiate.  But it is one of the last 
of the major nations to pass a bill harmonizing its legislation 
with this convention. 
The Liberal government therefore does not seem to think shipping 
is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to the summit on the future of shipyards, when they 
were in opposition in 1993, the Liberals said that it was 
extremely important that a summit be held the following year, 
but they did not hold one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The years went by, and then, in August of last year, the 
premiers met in St. Andrew's, at the invitation of the former 
premier of New Brunswick, Mr. McKenna.  This bill was on the 
agenda, and all those present adopted the position that 
something had to be done quickly, and this was not just any old 
group, but all the premiers together, who were in agreement on 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the months, a number of stakeholders, such as the 
Shipbuilders' Association of Canada, Canadian shipbuilders and 
shipyard workers, expressed their views.  I want to take this 
opportunity to congratulate Mrs. Verreault, CEO of Les Méchins 
shipyard in the Gaspé, who worked so hard to inform the various 
stakeholders and the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, cabinet is turning a deaf ear, so much so that, 
during their recent convention, Liberal supporters passed a 
resolution, reminding their own government that they absolutely 
have to do something for the shipping industry and especially 
the shipbuiding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all like to watch ships go by. As can be seen from Lévis and 
as many members from ridings located along the St. Lawrence can 
tell you, there are a lot of ships out there, but unfortunately, 
very few of them are built in Canada. 
It is a bit disappointing to see that the Liberal government 
fails to realize that this means of transportation, which is the 
most cost efficient, energy efficient and environmentally 
friendly, is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why members from this side of the House and some members 
from the other opposition parties, including the hon. member for 
Saint John, keep reminding the government that something 
absolutely has to be done for the shipping industry. All 
opposition parties agree on this. As I said before, even 
supporters of the Liberal Party of Canada agree on this. Despite 
this growing consensus, the government refuses to budge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those who should normally address this issue is the 
Minister of Finance, but he does not dare to take part in this 
debate, because he says he is in a conflict of interest. 
He refuses to address the issue, because, as he puts it: “You 
know, I have an interest in Canada Steamship Lines. Even though 
it is held in trust, I cannot talk about it”. He neither defends 
nor promotes this industry, so nothing is being done. Nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member representing a riding where there is a big shipyard, 
every time I hear opposition members talk about this issue, I 
hasten to support them. I try to do everything I can to 
contribute to every debate we have in this House that deals with 
shipping, the Canada Shipping Act and shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been speaking on this subject for five years. But until 
something is done about it, I think it is the duty of a member 
of Parliament to raise this issue in the House during debate to 
show Canadians how important it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote some figures since time allows me to do so. 
Shipping is a vital component of trade. With an annual volume of 
224 million tons, shipping contributes $2 billion to our GDP 
each year. But let us not forget that the vast majority of these 
ships are not Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote more figures. Shipping would allow us to maximize 
the use of fuel—we do have to use fuel for various things—by 
926% compared to other means of transportation. It would also 
allow us to reduce accident risks by 610%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make a comparison, using as an example a ton of goods and 
five litres of fuel. 
Here are some telling figures. By plane, the distance covered 
would be six kilometres only; by truck, it would be 100 
kilometres; by train, 333 kilometres; and by boat, 500 
kilometres. The difference is huge.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These figures were quoted by Mrs. Verreault in a presentation 
she made on shipping. One laker, a ship that sails the Great 
Lakes, can carry 25,000 tons of grain, but it would take 500 
railway cars carrying 50 tons each or 833 trucks carrying 30 
tons each. These figures may seem incredible, but they are real. 
They were verified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I want to say is that we must give more consideration to 
shipping. I invite all my colleagues to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often, just before question period, we see more colleagues from 
different parties return to the House. Therefore, it is just the 
right time to get the attention of those who just came in before 
question period so that members on the government side listen to 
what the opposition has to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also invite them to listen to what their constituents have to 
say. The millennium scholarship fund is fine, but what their 
constituents want for the next millennium is to have means of 
transportation that are more environmentally friendly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International summits were held on that subject. This year, in 
Kyoto, there were discussions on the reduction of greenhouse 
gases, which have a detrimental effect on the ozone layer and 
the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I invite all my colleagues, especially my Liberal 
colleagues, to urge cabinet members to put this issue on the 
agenda and to ask the industry minister to examine this and see 
to it that a shipbuilding policy is finally developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> We will resume debate after question period. The

</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some of the facts.  Fetal alcohol syndrome and its 
milder form of fetal alcohol effects have been called the leading 
cause of mental retardation in the western world.  A recent study 
conducted in British Columbia showed that 23% of its young 
offender population had FAS and a further 12% had a milder form. 
It is estimated that 15% of adult prison populations suffer from 
one or both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>FAS is not reversible.  It is a life sentence.  It would be 
appropriate for the House to act to end this national disaster.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, imagine a world 
where cancer would just be a vague and sad memory. Impossible, 
you say. Yet, thousands of men and women in Canada and in Quebec 
share this dream. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though cancer is not yet a thing of the past, we have to 
realize that great progress has been made these last few 
decades. More and more, we understand and screen early symptoms 
of cancer more quickly and treat them before it is too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put it in concrete terms, let me point out that the survival 
rate of children with leukaemia has jumped from 50% to 83% in 
less than 30 years. 
For testicular cancer, the survival rate has increased from 73% 
to 95%. The recent discovery of the gene responsible for breast 
cancer has revived the research for treatment and prevention of 
this terrible disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fight must go on. This being cancer awareness month, I urge 
all members of this House and Canadians to find the way to 
overcome cancer.

skated their way to victory in the all Ontario championships in

In fact, in recent weeks the local newspapers have carried 
headlines such as “Midget Bulldogs keep on winning” and 
“Bantams poised to take OMHA title”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without question the success of the two teams is a direct result

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>HEPATITIS C 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister assured the House that 13 
governments were solidly behind his decision to abandon thousands 
of hepatitis C victims infected through the government's faulty 
blood system. Today it is starting to unravel.  British Columbia 
Premier Glen Clark has had the courage to say “I am not at all 
comfortable with the compensation package”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Premier Clark is beginning to see that abandoning the sick is 
wrong, why can the Prime Minister not see it too? 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was privileged to be with the premier before his 
meeting with the press.  He did not take that occasion to express 
to me that he was not in agreement with his own minister of 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I can do is repeat that the ministers of health speaking on 
behalf of their governments have all agreed to this deal. Perhaps 
there should be a conversation between the B.C. minister of 
health and his premier. 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a sign of courage to admit when one is wrong. It 
is a sign of leadership to change course when one is doing the 
wrong thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today Quebec is talking about a no fault insurance system for 
victims of tainted blood.  Premier Clark says he is not at all 
comfortable with the compensation package and is beginning to 
rethink his position.  Other premiers and provincial governments 
will likely follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister want to be the last government leader in 
the country to admit he is wrong, or will he start to lead? 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, all governments had many occasions to discuss this. 
There were many meetings between all the ministers of health in 
the land.  All the ministers, including the federal minister, 
submitted a referendum to the cabinet. The federal government put 
$800 million into the deal and the provincial governments only 
$300 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they are not comfortable with this amount, perhaps they 
should match the federal contribution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to read some quotes about the hepatitis C 
tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is one:  “Let's face it, if we are compassionate, we have 
to help these people”. Here is another:  “When people are sick, 
you don't discriminate”.  And this one:  “We'll have to try to 
find a way.  We're responsible”.  Who said these things?  The 
Prime Minister's backbenchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister will not listen to the victims, if he will 
not listen to the premiers who are having second thoughts, if he 
will not listen to us, will he at least listen to his own members 
and change his mind on this decision? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have had discussions on this.  Everybody does not 
always agree with me every time.  I wish they would, but that is 
not always the case.  We have had discussions and we have a 
responsibility.  We are meeting our responsibilities. The 
Minister of Health has given some extremely good reasons why we 
made this decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1986 and 1990 there was a failure on the part of all 
governments concerning tainted blood and we have taken the 
responsible— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Edmonton North. 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is about negligence and responsibility.  Many Canadians got 
AIDS from Canada's tainted blood system.  Those victims were all 
compensated, even those who contracted AIDS before there was a 
screening test available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister agreed with AIDS compensation then and it is 
still being paid out.  In fact, the Liberals demanded that 
compensation for all of them.  However, now he refuses to show 
hepatitis C victims the same compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When did the Prime Minister lose his ability to tell right from 
wrong? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
just to set the record straight, first of all the AIDS package 
did not cover everyone.  In fact, it was left to us in this most 
recent announcement last week to include those who were infected 
by partners or parents. 
We completed what was started 10 years ago.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the AIDS package as I see it from this distance of 10 
years was based on exactly the same principle as the proposal we 
made for the hepatitis C settlement.  Namely, at that time the 
government implicitly acknowledged fault or negligence in not 
having put systems in place to look for HIV contaminants in the 
blood.  Same principle then, same principle now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that is nonsense.  The principle that was in effect then was that 
there was no screening available and they still got that. That 
compensation was fair and we agree with that.  We were glad that 
the government finally came through with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talks about setting the record the straight.  I 
want to set the record straight here today and say that this 
government is wrong.  They know there are problems in its own 
backbenches. The governments of the provinces are now starting to 
come onside and say there is something wrong here and they need 
to have another look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no shame in saying “Maybe we made a mistake and we 
were wrong”.  The decision to abandon these thousands of victims 
is wrong and the Prime Minister knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. Minister of Health. 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
again let me set the record straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of the province of Quebec has reaffirmed as 
recently as an hour ago in a letter I received from Jean Rochon, 
the minister of health, that it fully and unconditionally

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
Tuesday, the Prime Minister told us that the millennium 
scholarship bill was flexible enough to include an eventual 
agreement between Quebec City and Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, however, legal adviser Kristina Knopp told the 
Standing Committee on Finance that the bill should be amended so 
that it could include an agreement with delegation of authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of Ms Knopp's comments, will the Prime Minister agree 
that he should suspend consideration of the provisions of Bill 
C-36, or promise to introduce an amendment providing for a 
mechanism that would allow inclusion of an agreement between 
Quebec City and Ottawa? 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there can always be an administrative agreement and it is not 
necessary to change the bill in order to be able to agree that 
the citizens of Quebec may receive millennium scholarships just 
as other citizens of Canada may receive them.  Mr. Bouchard 
himself said that it was entirely normal for the federal 
government to be able to indicate to students that it was the 
one paying for the scholarships. 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Mr. 
Bouchard showed his open-mindedness at the start of these 
negotiations by saying that there was no problem:  if the 
federal government wanted to be visible, that was fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the question put to the legal adviser this morning is a 
clear indication that the present bill does not allow for an 
administrative agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Prime Minister, who has just said that an 
administrative agreement would be possible, why he does not 
include a provision for an administrative agreement in this bill 
so that negotiations can reach a successful conclusion? 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we were at the meeting and we did not discuss the need to change 
the bill.  I said clearly that the Canadian government had 
decided to have a millennium project that would take the form of 
scholarships to help prepare young people for the 21st century 
and Mr. Bouchard recognized that this was an entirely logical 
goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He then recognized that it was entirely appropriate for the 
Government of Canada to ensure that recipients were made clearly 
aware that what they were receiving were millennium 
scholarships, the Government of Canada's proposed millennium 
project.

the hon. member misses the point.  This is not politics.  This is 
not partisanship.  This is policy.  All governments, New 
Democratic governments, Conservative governments and Liberal 
governments joined together and came to the same conclusion.  In 
the chronology of these events in this awful tragedy there was a 
period during which something could and should have been done. As 
a result we are offering compensation to victims who contracted 
hepatitis C during that period.

most people who look at the facts of this awful tragedy

that separated one stage of history from the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in 1986 that internationally, governments started putting 
in place methods to test blood for contaminants like hepatitis C. 
There was a risk before that but only afterward was there an 
international standard of a test.

commission: “We accept the conclusions contained in Justice 
Krever's report about the federal role in what happened.  We 
accept those conclusions in their entirety and without 
reservation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Justice Krever said compensate all the victims, my question 
is why is this website not worth the paper— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Before the hon. minister answers the 
question, please do not use any props in question period. 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
one of the things that comes through clearly from the conclusions 
of Mr. Justice Krever is that in 1986, commencing in 1986 and 
going forward, there was a time when those responsible for the 
blood system could have and should have acted to prevent 
infections but they did not.  It is as a result of that 
conclusion as to responsibility that the governments of Canada 
have joined together to make an agreement that we will offer 
compensation to those infected during that period.  That result 
flows directly from the conclusions of Mr. Justice Krever on the 
facts of this matter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, I quoted 
the Prime Minister's website.  Let me quote again so that 
everyone can hear what Justice Krever really said.  The first 
recommendation in his report is that: “Without delay the 
provinces and territories devise statutory no fault schemes for 
compensating persons who suffer serious problems with the blood 
supply. Everyone needs compensation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which one of these individuals over here is the frequent flyer

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am not sure that was a question.  If the

do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the conclusions of Mr. Justice Krever were clear, including the 
factual analysis of when governments could have and should have 
acted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made recommendations and in November I spoke on the day his 
report was tabled.  I pledged then to study the recommendations, 
which we did, with provincial ministers to look at the 
recommendation on compensation.  I know he recommended that 
everybody be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We decided the right thing to do for governments was to 
compensate those who were hurt because those responsible had not 
acted.  That is the position.  That is our conclusion.  That is 
the position of all the governments in Canada.

<P><A NAME="LINK147"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday in the House the minister compared the risk of 
infection with hepatitis C to the risks involved with many 
medical treatments.  It is beside the point that heart problems 
and cancers cannot always be treated successfully because when 
people enter the hospital they already have those heart problems 
and cancers.  They are not infected with them by the health 
system.  How can the unsuccessful treatment of an already 
existing disease be equated with the infliction of a new disease 
on an unsuspecting patient? 
<P><A NAME="LINK148"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member must know that for years there has been a very 
broad debate about where individual responsibility ends and when 
governments should pay compensation if someone is harmed in the 
system.  In 1990 or 1991 Robert Prichard, now president of the 
University of Toronto, did a rather complete study on that 
subject for government.  It has been the subject of public debate 
from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case it was up to governments to look at the history of 
this tragedy and decide where it was that governments should step 
up and say they would compensate because there was fault in the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To take another approach— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Wanuskewin. 
<P><A NAME="LINK149"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would be very disappointed if I took my car into a shop to be 
fixed and it could not find the problem but I would be even more 
upset if it not only could not find the problem but banged up the 
doors, ripped the upholstery, cracked the windshield and blew the 
motor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister admit that all those who were infected with 
hepatitis C were better off before they entered the Canadian 
health system than after they were injected with poison blood. 
Were they better off before? 
<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I think the member knows that the medical system, the health care 
system, medical procedures that are carried out in hospitals 
every day carry with them certain risks.  There is a risk-benefit 
ratio in every medical procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that we have not yet approached the point as a 
society where we are prepared to say that any time anything goes 
wrong for whatever reason there will be public compensation.  We 
may get to that point in years ahead but at the moment the public 
policy choice is to compensate where governments had 
responsibility and should have acted.

for the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an interview with the editorial team at the Ottawa <I>Citizen,</I> 
the Minister of Finance is reported as having stated that 
employment insurance premiums did not really kill jobs in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Minister of Finance say today the exact opposite of 
what he stated in his 1994 budget, where he claimed that 
reducing premiums would generate 40,000 jobs? 
<P><A NAME="LINK153"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to all economic analyses, the main thing is not to 
raise employment insurance premiums. We saw what happened during 
the 1989-1992 recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When premiums are maintained at a stable level, businesses are 
free to hire people and they do.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What counts most is the reduction in interest rates, as that is 
what creates jobs. This requires healthy public finances, which 
unfortunately precludes reducing premiums any further. 
<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, analyses must 
have changed very quickly, and the minister has certainly 
forgotten what he told us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the minister cares about job creation and I wonder, as 
Quebec did, why he does not quickly and substantially reduce 
employment insurance premiums especially in light of the huge 
surplus in the employment insurance fund? 
<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
again, the hon. member must be aware of the fact that our 
employment insurance premiums are lower than any similar premium 
in the United States and most European countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the hon. member should know that, when we took 
office, premiums were scheduled to rise to $3.30 under the 
previous government. We reduced them to $2.70, the single 
largest drop ever in such a time frame.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have another quote for the minister and it is from the Krever 
report again.  Justice Krever writes: “Proving fault is a 
formidable task for an individual injured by blood transfusion or 
blood product.  Court proceedings are especially hard on those 
who are seriously ill and dying”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the health minister so intent on putting these Canadians 
through that kind of ordeal? 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the effect of the offer which was made last Friday by the 
territorial, provincial and federal governments was to spare that 
ordeal for 22,000 victims who contracted hepatitis C between 1986 
and 1990.  I want the member to bear that in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Krever report contains a complete and insightful discussion 
of the policy of a no fault system.  It may be in the future that 
provinces and territories will accept his recommendation that in 
the future operation of the blood system there be a no fault 
compensation system.  That is not what is in place at the moment. 
When we gathered as ministers of health, as governments, and 
looked back at the chronology of this— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Nanaimo—Cowichan. 
<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to read another quote from hepatitis C victims: “I don't 
think that those claimants should have to spend their lifetime in 
litigation”.  I will read it again: “I don't think that those 
claimants should have to spend their lifetime in litigation”. 
Who said that? It was not Premier Clark.  It was not a Liberal 
backbencher.  It was the Minister of Health in the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> on November 23, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did this health minister abandon his own principles? 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what this government did, the first government since these 
events, the first government to act, was gather the provincial 
ministers together and produced the best possible result given 
good, responsible government public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We chose the period during which people were injured because 
governments should have acted and did not and we offered 
compensation. By so doing we spared those 22,000 people the 
ordeal of continuous litigation.

it is instructive that the Liberal backbenchers are not asking

it in caucus yesterday and afterwards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government decided 10 years ago to compensate AIDS

<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the contamination of blood with HIV was a national tragedy, just 
like the contamination of blood with hepatitis C.  But what the 
hon. member should understand is that compensation was offered to 
HIV victims in that day on the same principle we are offering 
compensation today for hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government implicitly acknowledged 10 years ago that there 
was not enough done in terms of surveillance, research and taking

<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that is not an answer.  What we are getting is just more and more 
of this kind of stonewalling.  The minister is in the middle of a 
political firestorm because Canadians want the government to show 
compassion, not more rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of repeating the lines he has been given by his health

not just the federal government but provincial governments from 
one side of this country to the other, was to look at the history 
of this matter.  We asked the tough question:  Where is the point 
at which governments and the public, in essence, should accept 
responsibility? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found that there was a four year period during which

parts:  the core funding of ACOA, which basically has not changed 
in about 10 years, and special programs that have a beginning and 
an end, for example, the infrastructure program, base closure 
programs and adjustments for the fixed link. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These programs have a beginning and they have an end.  When they 
end, which is projected to be roughly after the turn of the 
century, the core funding of ACOA will remain basically the same 
as it is now, roughly in the vicinity of a quarter of a billion 
dollars, which will provide hope, opportunity and jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a minister of the crown I applied a simple test to the 
policies I sought to implement.  I would ask myself whether any 
given initiative would be meaningful enough to actually be around 
and withstand the test of time long after I would have departed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As minister of youth I attempted to implement a national youth 
strategy that resulted in two meaningful initiatives:  the stay 
in school program, which was directed at young Canadians who 
needed help and encouragement to pursue their studies; and a 
major youth initiative in the province of New Brunswick. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was Minister of State for Youth our government 
quadrupled funding for co-operative education through what was 
known as the co-operative work education program. We also 
implemented several literacy initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must note that I became concerned with this problem when, as a 
young criminal lawyer I noticed that a lot of young people who 
ended up in court did not know how to read or write. I was 
shocked and told myself that one day we would have to deal 
with this problem. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As minister of sport I assumed the portfolio at a very turbulent 
period.  The Dubin inquiry into the use of drugs in sport had 
become a most significant inquiry in the world of amateur sport. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As minister of amateur sport, there are two initiatives of which 
I am very proud. In 1989 Canada's ministers of sport decided to 
formally include sports for physically handicapped athletes in 
the Canada Games. We also made representations in this regard 
for the Olympic Games and for the Commonwealth Games in 
1990. We were encouraged in this initiative 
by two great Canadians, Rick Hansen and André Viger who is from 
my riding of Sherbrooke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second initiative of which I am very proud is my 
contribution to the first Francophone Games, a sporting and 
cultural event that is different from all others, especially 
since these games are held alternately in the northern and 
southern hemispheres. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As minister of environment I experienced one of the most 
fulfilling mandates of my political life.  I was minister of a 
department that was at the cutting edge of science, law and 
public administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proceeded to implement one of the world's only plans of 
sustainable development, the green plan.  I was also privileged 
to lead Canada's delegation to the earth summit in Rio.  The 
summit was a high point for Canada and for then Prime Minister 
Mulroney whose leadership broke the G-7 logjam on the issue of 
the biodiversity convention and a convention on climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all my endeavours, today if there is one thing I would like 
to say, it is how privileged we are as a country to be served by 
what is undoubtedly the best public service in the world.  In all 
the years I have worked in government, I have been impressed day 
after day. I am sorry to say that there are not enough 
opportunities for us in this House to share with other Canadians 
how the men and women who work in our public service do it with a 
great deal of rigour, with a great deal of energy.  When we 
compare the level of service that we get here in Canada to any 
other country in the world, we are privileged and lucky to have 
what I think is the best public service bar none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my 14 years of service I have had the opportunity to serve 
five prime ministers:  Mr. Turner, Mr. Clark, Mr. Mulroney, Ms. 
Campbell, and the present incumbent, the member from Shawinigan. 
All these prime ministers are, without exception, exceptional 
individuals.  There is no doubt in my mind that they had only one 
goal and that is to serve their country well.  I want to 
recognize that today for all those in this House and for the 
present incumbent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of my years in federal politics were served under former 
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. His government began the difficult 
task, an unrewarding task, of spending restraints and deficit 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policies brought forward between 1984 and 1993 set the stage 
that allowed the current government to attain a balanced budget. 
Canada's influence on the world stage was significant.  I was 
part of a government that fought for free trade and NAFTA. 
I am honoured to have served in a government that I believe 
history will judge as being one of the best.

that I am embarking on this new journey.

want to salute the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party 
and member for Sherbrooke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know today must be extremely difficult for him because, when 
you have been in the House of Commons for 14 years, you 
have learned a lot of things and made a lot of friends. I once 
voluntarily left my seat in the House of Commons and it was 
almost a tragedy for me. I missed it so much that I could not 
stand it and had to come back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to salute the member for Sherbrooke because he is still a 
very young man who has a lot of experience. First he was a young 
MP. Then he held very important positions in the House of 
Commons and in cabinet. Then he became Deputy Prime Minister. He 
took the reins of his party under very difficult circumstances. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last four years must have been very difficult for the 
leader.  He must have been going around the country eating a lot 
of rubber chicken for the good of his party.  He has done very 
well.  Now that he is leaving we are sad to see him go because he 
has made a great contribution to this House.  I know he will 
carry on making a great contribution to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He must be quite an athlete because he likes to give it and he 
can take it.  Many times we have been hot under the collar as 
they say in English.  I admire his great commitment to this 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege during the referendum of 1995 to see his 
commitment to this country. I will always remember talking to him 
in the rain one night in Montreal.  We knew we would have to give 
a last effort to make sure Canada would stick together.  I was 
very impressed by the depth of his commitment to making sure this 
country would carry on.  We do not belong to the same party but 
his commitment to the values of Canada was very evident whenever 
he spoke.  The notions of tolerance, diversity and sharing were 
always present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has touched a lot of Canadians in this land.  He has been a 
great example to young people.  We are members of the House of 
Commons.  It is one of the greatest institutions.  Democracy came 
to Canada a long time ago.  We are one of the first democracies 
where responsible governments were established.  We have managed 
to build a country that is an example to the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member for Sherbrooke is embarking upon a tough 
journey, but he can rely on the support of the members from 
Quebec in this House, for we know that the future of our country 
and our future, our prosperity and our place on the world stage 
depend on our association with Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, the hon. 
member for Sherbrooke, announced that he had chosen Quebec, 
because he wants Quebec to be part of Canada, because Quebeckers 
founded this country and because French speaking Canadians have 
been elected to this House of Commons ever since the birth of 
our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Sherbrooke has set for himself an enormous 
task, but we all are aware of his enthusiasm, of his devotion to 
public life and of his desire to ensure that all Canadians can 
benefit from being citizens of this great country of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell him that we are all very sad to see him go. He 
was an excellent member of Parliament and he worked very hard at 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to pay tribute to his wife, because we often forget 
that the family members of those involved in public life are the 
ones who suffer the most and who have to make all the 
sacrifices. 
I understand how terrible it must be to sell a house one has not 
moved into yet and to set aside all the plans you had made, but 
I think she has understood that her husband is a great Quebecker 
and a great Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole country congratulates him for the initiative he has 
undertaken. We wish him good luck. Long live Quebec and long 
live Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to join the Prime Minister and other members of 
the House in extending best wishes to the hon. member for 
Sherbrooke as he departs the House for his new role in provincial 
politics in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians we tend to look at decisions and changes of 
this nature from a political standpoint.  But as all of us know, 
the people most directly affected by our career choices are our 
spouses and our families.  So we also want to extend our best 
wishes to the hon. member's wife and children, to Michèle, to 
Amélie, Antoine and Alexandra, and to express the hope that this 
decision and change will open up new and exciting possibilities 
for them as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Sherbrooke has sometimes expressed the 
suspicion that Reformers dislike Tories, especially Tories from 
Quebec.  I do not know where he got that idea.  As he departs I 
want to take this opportunity to assure him that this is not the 
case.  In fact, over the next few months we plan to be especially 
kind to Tories no matter where they are from and to inquire after 
their welfare and even to invite them home for dinner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a more serious note, the hon. member is leaving the 
leadership of the federal Progressive Conservative Party to join 
the Quebec Liberal Party for a principled reason.  That reason is 
to create a stronger federalist alternative in Quebec and a 
better future for Quebec within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federalists throughout the country, including the official 
opposition in the House, wish to offer our encouragement and best 
wishes to the hon. member as he undertakes this important task.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Sherbrooke will know, every defender and 
advocate of federalism in Quebec encounters the argument, 
invariably from sovereignists but also from sceptical and weary 
Quebec voters, that no one outside Quebec really wants to 
fundamentally change the federal system to make it work better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it will be of any help to the hon. member in laying that 
argument to rest, I want to assure him on behalf of official 
opposition members, all of whom come from west of the 
Manitoba-Ontario border, that Quebeckers who want to change the 
federal system, in particular to rebalance the powers, will find 
allies in our part of the country.  If he assures Quebeckers that 
changes in the federation are coming he should know that we will 
do our part to ensure that change actually occurs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the hon. member for Sherbrooke, I say thank you, goodbye and 
good luck. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
rather odd for a sovereignist, leader of the Bloc Quebecois to 
boot, to say farewell to the leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party, who is seeking the leadership of the Liberal 
Party of Quebec to fight the Parti Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 14 years in this House, the member for Sherbrooke and 
leader of the Progressive Conservative Party has decided the 
time has come for him to do something else and move on to 
another political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Sherbrooke, who came to Ottawa in 1984 at a very 
young age, is leaving today a seasoned politician. He will be 
remembered as having held several positions in the federal 
government, namely Minister of State for Youth, Fitness and 
Amateur Sports, Minister of the Environment, Minister of 
Industry and Science, and even Deputy Prime Minister during the 
last month of the Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be remembered that, in a sense, he was 
instrumental in the creation of the Bloc Quebecois. Indeed it 
was after the Charest report was tabled that Conservative and 
Liberal members from Quebec left their respective parties to 
create the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, I will remember the member for Sherbrooke as a 
strong political adversary. The leader of the Conservative Party 
has always shown respect and professionalism during our 
exchanges and debates. I am convinced he will still behave the 
same way in his new position in a different political theater. I 
trust he will carry out his new responsibilities with the same 
dignity he has shown here in Ottawa for 14 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, on some fundamental issues, I have appreciated his 
party's support for our position, especially with regard to the 
$2 billion in compensation Quebec is entitled to for harmonizing 
its sales tax with the GST. 
I hope he will keep bringing this up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to mention the support the hon. member for 
Sherbrooke and all members of the Conservative Party in this 
House recently gave the Bloc's motion recognizing that Quebec 
alone should decide its own future. As a result, yesterday's 
enemies and tomorrow's allies, the federal Liberals, found 
themselves isolated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Encouraged by his support on this issue, we are nonetheless 
looking forward to the future leader of the Quebec Liberal Party 
answering a number of fundamental questions in the new political 
arena he is about to jump into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, now that he is leaving for the Quebec National 
Assembly, will he recognize that Quebec is a nation? Will he 
recognize, as the Quebec Liberal Party has always done, the 
territorial integrity of Quebec? 
Does he still believe that the federal government should 
interfere in areas of provincial responsibility such as 
education?

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he still believe that gun control legislation is 
inappropriate, when a consensus to the contrary has developed in 
Quebec on this issue since the tragedy at École Polytechnique? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are but a few of the essential questions the future leader 
of the Quebec Liberal Party will have to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that his career is taking a new direction, I suggest that 
the hon. member for Sherbrooke always keep an eye on Ottawa and 
be on his guard with his new allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inflexibility of the federal Liberals, their inability to 
adjust to new realities and to make the necessary changes to 
bring Quebec and Canada into the next century are likely to 
follow the Conservative leader and soon to become Quebec Liberal 
leader to Quebec like a millstone around his neck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having chosen between remaining leader of the Conservative Party 
and running for the leadership of the Quebec Liberal Party, the 
hon. member for Sherbrooke has another decision to make, the 
implications of which may be much greater for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has to decide whether to adopt the federal Liberals' 
constitutional status quo or to fight their do-nothing attitude 
from within Quebec's Liberal ranks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shall not dwell on this point today, as the Conservative 
leader is leaving and will now have to answer all these 
questions in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore like to pay tribute to the hon. member for 
Sherbrooke for his career in federal politics which is coming to 
an end. As he prepares to embark on a new career with the Quebec 
Liberal Party, I want to wish him good luck, but not of course 
every success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farewell to the hon. member for Sherbrooke.

<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to return to the federalist tone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  It is obvious that some of our 
colleagues are more concerned than others about the return of the 
hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  On behalf of my colleagues and my 
leader I would like to wish the hon. member for Sherbrooke well 
in his new career as a Liberal.  I wish him well more as a 
federalist than as a Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the dilemma that he must have found himself in, but 
I think he did what all good people do in the end.  He responded 
to the call.  He responded to the duty that he saw was his in 
this historical moment.  We congratulate him for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must have been difficult, wondering whether or not the call 
was stronger to go to Quebec to fight the separatists or to stay 
and be a major player in the “unite the right” or whatever it 
is called.  I have to say to him that from our perspective the 
right has been united in the country for along time.  It has 
never been more united than it has under the banner of the 
Liberal Party since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Sherbrooke has said that he needs to enter into 
this new time in his life and this new time in the political life 
in Quebec, knowing as we all should know that no one person can 
save the country by himself or by herself.  We all need to do 
this together.  We need to work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a veteran of many constitutional debates in the House and in 
that context I would specifically like to add the best wishes of 
my colleague from Qu'Appelle, formerly the member for 
Yorkton—Melville, who fought alongside and debated alongside the 
member for Sherbrooke in many of those debates.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a tendency in all those debates and in all those times 
for political parties to hold up one member, a prime minister, a 
leader or someone else, as the one person who could save the 
country.  We will never save the country if anybody is interested 
in getting the credit for saving the country.  We need to save 
the country, no matter who gets the credit, and that I hope is 
the sense that the hon. member will take into the struggle he is 
about to embark upon in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our view is that the country cannot be saved apart from 
recovering the social democratic consensus that has existed for 
a long time.  John Ralston Saul states in his most recent book 
that the success of the partnership between Quebec and the rest 
of Canada has been in part because it was always governed 
somewhat to the left of centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member for Sherbrooke, because he not I 
mentioned first the first trade agreement and NAFTA, to reflect 
on whether or not some of the policies that have been adopted 
over the last 10 to 15 years have not indeed worked to weaken the 
fabric of the country and to weaken the role of government in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was through government that we built the partnership between 
French speaking Canada and English speaking Canada.  It was 
through the power of government that we created this distinct 
society we call Canada, a place very different in North America 
where we have a different set of social and economic values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in recovering those values that I think we will be able to 
once again invite all Quebeckers to abandon the failure of 
imagination that we see here among our Bloc Quebecois colleagues 
and to begin once again to build a great country, not just 
through the marketplace but through the things we do together in 
the public sector and through the power of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Godspeed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I need hardly 
tell you and the members of this House that during the last 
election campaign my colleague and friend, the hon. member for 
Sherbrooke, never told me I would have to make a speech like 
this one today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with a great deal of emotion that I rise to pay tribute 
on behalf of my colleagues in the Progressive Conservative 
Party to a remarkable man and a dynamic leader, the member for 
Sherbrooke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, it is not easy to lose a leader and to see a friend 
go. We have been colleagues since 1984, when we were first 
elected to this place. Over the years we developed a true 
friendship. 
Incidentally I was proud to support him during the 1993 
Conservative leadership race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His political career is impressive. Regardless of the position 
he held, he was faithful to his friends, his voters, his party 
and his country. Following the 1993 election he accepted the 
challenge of the leadership of our party under particularly 
difficult circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He knows Canada and Canadians very well. A number of them 
discovered him during the 1995 referendum campaign. His 
passionate speeches not only moved people but made him the most 
credible spokesperson for national goodwill in Quebec, and this 
is still true today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Sherbrooke was able to find the words to 
say to Quebeckers because he is like them and because of his 
deep convictions. During the referendum campaign he called 
himself the keeper of change. 
He talked about a modern, strong and confident Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Sherbrooke enjoys such credibility is because he 
gave the Progressive Conservative Party a new constitution, a 
new platform. He reconnected it with its grassroots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last election campaign we had a huge gathering in my 
riding of Chicoutimi. People were drawn to his message and to 
his genuineness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Quebeckers trust the member for Sherbrooke because of his 
political opinions and his strong convictions. Last week he told 
me “I am choosing Quebec”. I understand his choice.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could he not answer the call of Quebeckers who, I am sure, 
will answer the challenge he made on May 6 last year in 
Chicoutimi where I come from: “I invite Quebeckers to again 
win the heart and soul of this country, this continent they 
founded, explored and shaped”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First you will become the leader of the Liberal Party of Quebec 
and then, I hope for us, he will become Premier of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In choosing their premier Quebeckers make an important 
decision.  They place their trust in someone who will defend 
their interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know Quebec is profoundly divided and weakened. 
This is why I am hoping he wins for the sake of 
Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He proposed a partnership during the campaign where Quebec 
would participate rather than endure, where it would express its 
opinion and not just its opposition, where it 
would share in discussions instead of opting for confrontation. 
I believe in this sort of partnership.  I believe in his 
ability to bring people together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the Progressive Conservative Party and I want 
to express our deepest gratitude for his years of indefatigable 
service to our party and for having put this party back on the 
road to recovery in these tumultuous and trying times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I failed to mention the sacrifices made by 
his family, his wife, confidant and constant ally and his 
children, Amélie, Antoine and Alexandra. 
I want to thank them for sharing him with us and with all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would especially like to thank the voters of the riding of 
Sherbrooke.  Without them, the Progressive Conservative Party 
would not be here today, in which case we would have been 
deprived of his leadership and his vital contribution to 
democratic life in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Sherbrooke has done much for our party 
and we thank him for it.  We thank him and his family.  He has 
served well, and we offer him our best wishes and the best 
of luck.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

hon. member for Macleod used language which the Chair may find, 
upon reviewing the blues, as being unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw it to the attention of the Chair.  I think the Chair will 
want to review very carefully what was said and the intent behind

fact unparliamentary, recognizing that as usual the Chair has the 
full authority to decide that anything that causes disorder is in 
itself unparliamentary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Sometimes, my colleagues, we try to play 
with words, and it got by me if something was said.  I will have 
a look at the blues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues, when we try to juggle a bit like this sometimes 
the House loses as opposed to anything else.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA SHIPPING ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK231">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill S-4, an 
act to amend the Canada Shipping Act (maritime liability), be 
read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
privilege to rise in the House to speak in favour of Bill S-4, an 
act to amend the Canada Shipping Act.  Bill S-4, introduced in 
the Senate on October 8, 1997, will amend parts of the Canada 
Shipping Act which deal with liability for maritime accidents and 
oil pollution damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-4 reintroduces amendments to the Canada Shipping Act 
first introduced to the House of Commons as Bill C-58 on 
September 19, 1997.  Bill C-58 completed committee stage as 
proposed by the Standing Committee on Transport in its report to 
the House of Commons on December 11, 1996.  The bill died on the 
Order Paper in April 1997 when the election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was introduced through the Senate because it had 
already passed the different stages in the House of Commons 
during the last parliament and the government wanted it to be 
passed in the fastest way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to take this opportunity to mention again, as my New 
Democrat colleague did at second reading, that the NDP does not 
support the practice of introducing bills through the Senate. 
Canadians elected 301 representatives last June.  They are 
sitting in this Chamber, not in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe a majority of Canadians want major reforms to be made 
to the Senate and, although I oppose bills coming through the 
Senate, I will certainly use these opportunities to remind this 
government that it is ignoring Canadians.  Although we do not 
support the practice of introducing bills in the Senate, we are 
in favour of this piece of legislation which is long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-4 is a part of the Canada Shipping Act reform.  Parts of 
the Canada Shipping Act are old and out of date with today's 
reality.  The NDP believes that it is time to modernize the 
Canada Shipping Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The revision of the existing limitation of liability for 
maritime claims is a very important step toward modernizing the 
legislation.  The existing regime with respect to limits for 
general maritime claims in the Canada Shipping Act is largely 
based on the 1957 international convention relating to the 
limitation of liability of owners of sea-going ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The limits on liability set out there have naturally lost value 
as a result of inflation over the years.  As a matter of fact, 
most maritime nations consider the limits of liability set out in 
1957 to be inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1957 convention was replaced by the 1976 convention on 
limitation of liability for maritime claims and its 1996 protocol 
is the global standard for limitation of liability for maritime 
claims. 
Bill S-4 will permit Canada's accession to it.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Shipping Act amendments in Bill S-4 will also 
implement the provisions of the 1992 protocols to the 1969 
convention on civil liability for oil pollution damage and the 
1971 convention on the international fund for compensation for 
oil pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maximum compensation available to claimants in an oil 
pollution incident will increase from $120 million to $270 
million, which consists of the shipowner's liability under the 
civil liability convention and a supplementary amount available 
from the international compensation fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we know that tragedies such as the <I>Exxon Valdez</I> can 
happen, we know it is advisable to increase the liability of 
shipowners for environmental damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few years ago we had the <I>Irving Whale</I> disaster. The 
company, a very large and well known company, did not pay in the 
project to refloat its barge.  It is the Government of Canada, in 
other words the Canadian people, that had to spend millions of 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Large corporations have to be more responsible.  They have to be 
more accountable.  It is our environment that has suffered and we 
must ensure its protection.  We will be supporting the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise on Bill S-4, the Canada Shipping Act 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Few countries in the world have as much interest in this issue 
as we have in Canada because we are virtually surrounded by 
water. We have water east, west and north.  We have the Great 
Lakes and the seaway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has been nurtured through the system for many years. We 
are really pleased to see it and we will be supporting the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will substantially increase the amount of compensation 
available to Canadian claimants for maritime claims in general, 
especially for oil pollution damage as a result of shipwrecked 
oil tankers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Canada Shipping Act provisions dealing with 
limitation of liability of maritime claims are based on the 1957 
international convention relating to limitation of liability of 
owners of seagoing vessels.  Most maritime nations consider 
limits of liability inadequate mainly as inflation has eroded 
their value and it only make sense as those were developed in 
1957. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill began as Bill C-58 in 1996 when it went through the 
committee process and died on the order paper with the election 
call in April 1997.  There are important changes contained in the 
legislation and unfortunately the government did not make it a 
priority to move it ahead quickly enough, but at least it is here 
now.  Now that it is here we are dealing with the bill and I am 
pleased to be here to speak on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will substantially increase the amount of compensation 
available to Canadian claimants for maritime claims, for oil 
pollution damage in particular.  It harmonizes Canadian rules for 
maritime liability with those of other maritime nations and will 
enable Canada to accede to the relevant international 
conventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the limitation of liability for maritime claims, 
Bill S-4 amends part 4 of the shipping act to implement 
provisions of the 1976 convention on limitation of liability for 
maritime claims and its 1996 protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-4 will, first, substantially increase shipowner limits of 
liability, long past due.  Second, it will allow the cabinet on 
recommendation of the transport minister to implement new limits 
of liability to reflect inflation.  Three, it will limit the 
liability of owners of small ships less than 300 tons to $1 
million for loss of life or personal injury and $500,000 for 
other claims.  It will also extend the application of the 
liability regime to all ships operating in Canadian internal and 
inland waters, not just seagoing vessels, which is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it increases the liability limits for owners of docks, 
canals and ports and for property damage claims to the greater of 
$2 million or an amount based on the tonnage of the largest ship 
that has docked in the area in the last five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Atlantic Canada and all Canadians welcome the aspect of the bill 
that relates to oil pollution liability and for compensation for 
oil pollution damage.  Bill S-4 will amend part 16 of the Canada 
Shipping Act to implement provisions of the 1992 protocol to the 
1969 civil liability convention and the 1971 convention on the 
establishment of an international fund for compensation for oil 
pollution damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means it will make shipowners liable for clean-up costs for 
oil pollution damage.  It makes compensation available for 
pollution damage caused by tankers with residues of oil remaining 
from their previous cargo. 
This also makes it possible to recover costs incurred for 
preventive measures taken in anticipation of a spill from a 
tanker.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maximum compensation currently available to claimants in a 
oil pollution incident is approximately $120 million.  As a 
result of Bill S-4, the amount will more than double to $270 
million which is still probably not enough but it is a good 
start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, we are pleased to support this legislation.  It is 
long past overdue and very much needed in the maritime industry 
in Canada.  We are supporting this because it will improve 
compensation for the benefit of all Canadian claimants involved 
in any kind of marine accident in general and certainly for 
purposes related to pollution claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the important harmonization of our laws with other nations 
benefits every participant.  I am speaking about all participants 
involved in the maritime trade, shipowners, cargo owners and 
charters providing consistent internationally recognized and 
accepted rules which deal with the economic consequences of 
unfortunate accidents at sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without these former rules international shipping, which Canada 
relies on to a tremendous extent, would otherwise become 
extremely expensive and unpredictable.  As a result it would have 
negative consequences for the Canadian industry as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we support this legislation and only wish that we could 
have moved it through the system a little more quickly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, being the last to speak on Bill S-4, I am not going to 
go through the bill in any detail, which will be good news for 
everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is long overdue.  It will be welcomed across the 
country and throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was ironic, however, when I was reading the very last of my 
notes.  This is a little humour here.  It is talking about the 
failure to file information with the Minister of Transport 
regarding oil shipments resulting in a summary conviction of $100 
for each day of default.  I know there are members who have paid 
that much of a fine for speeding.  I thought that portion of the 
bill was a little lax.  It could have been more.  However, this 
is a good bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was introduced today by the hon. gentleman from 
the government side, he thanked those people who had worked on 
the bill.  He thanked the Standing Committee on Transport.  I 
appreciated his remarks.  We did have a good round of looking at 
the bill in committee.  We had a great deal of support from all 
the members of the committee.  We had a great deal of support 
from the chairman of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke to the bill on second reading. I totally disagree with a 
bill of this nature originating in the Senate and then coming 
here, even though we can call this a housekeeping bill.  Members 
in my party and other opposition members also disagree.  This is 
not good practice.  We do not think we should have a bill come to 
us to examine amendments made by an unelected body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That may not seem like a very big thing to a lot of people.  I 
picked up the papers the other day.  There were some things in 
there about me because of some of my criticism, some of the 
criticism from my colleagues and some of the criticism from all 
the parties about this practice.  I assume it was a 
generalization that I was being somewhat hypocritical.  No one 
who knows me, who has been on the transport committee with me, 
would say I am hypocritical.  That was the tone, because we 
disagreed fundamentally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good bill. There is nothing wrong with the bill.  Some 
amendments were made and passed. But the opposition claims that 
the last place bills like this should originate is the Senate. 
Bills dealing with huge amounts of penalties, huge amounts of 
fines, huge amounts of liabilities should not originate in the 
Senate and then come here asking the elected people to put our 
stamp on it. 
We deem that incorrect.  I am sure most members do.  If members 
from the government side really looked at it they would also deem 
it incorrect.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege to rise in 
this House in support of Bill C-12, an Act to amend the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill provides RCMP members serving abroad as peackeepers in 
special duty areas with medicare benefits and death benefits. 
This means they will be covered 24 hours a day in case of 
work-related disease, invalidity or death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to pass this bill as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like any other government employees, RCMP members are eligible 
for government benefits if they suffer from a work-related 
disability or injury or if they die as a result of a work-related 
accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to existing agreements, there is a difference between 
work-related incidents and those that are not and that difference 
is usually easy to make: the work-related incidents are defined 
as occurring only during work shifts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in some cases, the distinction we need to make between 
“during working hours” and “outside working hours” is not so 
clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take, for instance, the RCMP members who are currently serving 
abroad as peacekeepers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to the Special Duty Area Pension Order, the governor in 
council can designate as special duty areas any geographic area 
outside Canada where peacekeepers may be exposed to hazardous 
conditions not normally associated with service in peacetime. 
These dangerous areas are called “special duty areas”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill acknowledges that when RCMP peacekeepers are posted in 
special duty areas, they never really stop serving and running 
risks, even when their shift is over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current act, RCMP members who are injured while posted 
in a special duty area must prove their disability is directly 
related to their service or the performance of their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canada started taking part in international peacekeeping 
missions and sending members of the armed forces to areas of 
armed conflict, it was acknowledged that it would be unfair to 
oblige these individuals or their department to prove that 
injury or death was attributable to their work and occurred 
while the individual was on duty. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Special Duty Area Pension Order, any injury, disease 
or disability sustained by a member of the Canadian Forces while 
on a peacekeeping mission in a special duty area is presumed to 
be directly related to the performance of his or her duties. In 
case of death, benefits are transferred to the victim's family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, under this order, military personnel are considered 
to be on duty 24 hours a day for the purpose of employment- or 
service-related benefits. The order also acknowledges that the 
security of these people is always threatened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in dangerous areas, even when serving side by side with 
Canadian Forces personnel, RCMP members are eligible for 
benefits only if the injury or disease occurs during a normally 
scheduled work shift. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>RCMP personnel posted as peacekeepers in special duty areas are 
treated differently from their counterparts in the Canadian 
Forces, even though they face the same risks and circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, for instance, members of both forces are 
deployed in Haiti and the former Yugoslavia , which have both 
been declared special duty areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Special Duty Area Pension Order, members of the 
Canadian Forces are considered to be on duty around the clock, 
if injuries, illness or fatalities occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, RCMP personnel are considered to be on duty 
only during their shift.  In keeping with the purest tradition 
of the RCMP, its members sought out this type of mission and 
volunteered for it.  In so doing, they are perpetuating a 
tradition of which Canadians are proud, and one which has earned 
them their international reputation as major contributors to 
world peace and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has an obligation to ensure that these courageous women 
and men, as well as their family members, are eligible for the 
same benefits as their Canadian Forces counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of today's bill is to remedy this abnormal 
situation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to note that in addition to disability benefits, 
Canadian forces peacekeepers who are injured or taken ill while 
serving in special duty areas are entitled to the benefits 
provided under the veterans independence program.  This program 
provides funds for services necessary to maintain a member in his 
or her own home as an alternative to institutional care. This 
includes housekeeping services and modifications to accommodate 
wheelchair access in a member's residence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These special pension benefits take into account the increased 
risk associated with peacekeeping duties. The amended legislation 
will extend the same kind of program benefits to disabled RCMP 
peacekeepers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation reflects the changing role of peacekeeping in 
general.  Adding to their traditional role as an arbiter of 
conflict, peacekeepers are now contributing to the broader 
reconstruction of society, the peace building phase that follows 
a peaceful settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the volunteered services of RCMP peacekeepers, Canada 
has provided what many countries need most to sustain peace: 
respect for democratic tradition and a method for enforcing the 
rule of law.  A troubled country may be able to build on the 
traditions and expertise demonstrated by the RCMP and Canadian 
forces peacekeepers to establish a new respect for law 
enforcement and respect for the law itself. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passing this bill is the best and fairest action we can take.  I 
am sure I speak for all members of this House in wishing that no 
Canadian peacekeeper, whether a member of the RCMP or a member 
of the armed forces, will ever need to use health insurance 
benefits, disability insurance or death benefits as the result 
of a mission to a special service area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to have been a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police when we were sending members over to dangerous situations 
in foreign countries.  Bosnia and Namibia come to mind. At that 
time we survived on the good graces of the solicitor general and 
the government in that if something did happen to one of us while 
we were over there, the government would stand behind us and our 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my party certainly support Bill C-12. It will ensure that 
members of the force and their families are taken care of in the 
event of a tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can certainly look at the performance and the service the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police has provided to Canada since 1873. 
This year is the 125th anniversary.  The service overseas in 
foreign countries, the latest one being Haiti, is a good example 
of the dedication these men and women from every province provide 
in serving their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today there has been a lot of talk about Quebec and the 
Northwest Territories. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police is well 
positioned and very prominent in those provinces in enforcing 
federal statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no problems with Bill C-12 itself.  There are some 
issues surrounding the peacekeeping and peacemaking role which 
Canada has assumed.  For the members of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, there is always the question if they are injured 
or hurt whether or not the compensation will come automatically 
through the pension and benefit scheme, or whether they will have 
to fight for the rights and the benefits if some disagreement 
arises. This was raised earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member, the member's estate or the family must receive a 
commitment from the government that it will pay the family to 
hire their own lawyer as opposed to being appointed one by the 
Canada pensions benefit scheme. A lawyer who was appointed would 
obviously have a conflict of interest in whether he takes the 
government's side or the member's side. That is definitely a 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue which has been of concern is very evident in the 
case of Haiti.  Our Canadian military pulled out of that country 
by agreement.  Our policemen were left there. The question was 
whether or not they had adequate medical services after the 
Canadian military left. I raised this in question period but I 
did not get a satisfactory answer.  There is no doubt the health 
services officer for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police did go to 
Haiti.  I believe the RCMP will ensure that the government does 
provide proper care for its members.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the problem of members being exposed to strange 
diseases or chemicals. We have seen this happen in countries that 
harbour those kinds of weapons. There is concern that these 
members be taken care for their lifetime. Perhaps this falls 
under the policy but I would have to look further into the 
pension act. I raise this to indicate everything is not as simple 
as a policeman going to a foreign country, coming back home and 
expecting everything to be all right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point the government did not mention today. 
There are police officers from non-RCMP forces such as city 
police forces, and provincial forces from Ontario and Quebec 
going to foreign countries. During our committee hearings we did 
not have anyone attend from these police forces or provincial 
governments to indicate whether or not those officers would have 
adequate benefits, for example compensation and medical care, if 
they were injured or killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are being taken care of but I 
do question whether police from the city of Toronto for example 
have medical benefit coverage for 24 hours a day.  The government 
would be wise to look at this issue.  When a city police officer 
is asked to go to a foreign country, the issue of health benefits 
should be discussed to avoid the government being sued in order 
that non-RCMP officers can get compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police goes overseas 
to one of the specially designated areas, the RCMP detachment 
from which he came is left with a vacant position.  There is no 
backfilling of the position for the period the peacekeeper is 
away, which is usually six months.  It causes a problem in the 
community which is short an officer for that length of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is special funding available under the peacekeeping 
initiatives.  The RCMP is being paid from government funds for 
the cost of the member while he is on peacekeeping duties. The 
question I have for the government is if the position is empty, 
is the budget still receiving the money for that officer's salary 
and benefits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a problem for the RCMP.  I raise it for the 
government to clarify that the Canadian taxpayer is not paying 
for that position twice, once through the peacekeeping initiative 
and again through the budget of the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been occasions in the past when the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police was able to leave positions open in a provincial 
contract.  The way it is worked out financially, there is a cost 
saving. It saves the province money and it saves money in the 
RCMP's budget.  This helps it come in on budget or a little under 
budget, and it certainly is good for the commanding officer when 
he can show the government that we was able to save money in a 
given year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary thing in Bill C-12 and for our communities in Canada 
is the safety of the members who are overseas and compensation if 
they are injured in dangerous situations. That is the paramount 
issue. 
For the people at home, the paramount issue is that we maintain 
safety and security at a reasonable cost.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to Bill C-12. I will use the time I have today to 
explain to the House why the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 would make members of the RCMP eligible for benefits 
under the Pension Act. We want members of the RCMP serving 
abroad to have the same benefits as their counterparts in the 
armed forces in the event of illness, injury or death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to salute the men and women who work as 
peacekeepers in a sometimes very unstable world. 
The international community must show solidarity in the face of 
armed conflicts, famines, droughts and all the other critical 
situations that exist in the world today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in this spirit of co-operation that we frequently send 
contingents abroad to lend a helping hand on a temporary basis. 
Year after year, countries like Haiti, Bosnia and Uganda are 
added to the list of nations that need our help. As a member of 
the international community, Canada must respond to these urgent 
calls for help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the RCMP have played an active role in peacekeeping 
missions. 
Many Canadians and Quebeckers have rolled up their sleeves and 
offered their help to the countries most in need of it.  These 
men and women have crossed oceans to share their knowledge, 
their experience and their hope that they can bring peace to 
this planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a few occasions, the RCMP has been given the difficult task 
of helping set up an entire police force.  The day after the 
fall of the Duvalier regime, for example, it was necessary to 
restore Haiti's self-confidence, and this meant building an 
effective police force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec and Canada therefore responded to the invitation that 
went out to them.  We have sent our soldiers and our police 
officers all over the world in order to provide substantial 
assistance with a number of problems.  These countries are 
grateful to us.  Diplomats and ministers are exchanging 
compliments. 
Government representatives are proud, sometimes rightly so, that 
their assistance has been beneficial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what about those who go to these countries?  What about the 
soldiers and police officers who risk their lives to make these 
missions a success?  Are we treating them fairly?  Are we 
providing them with proper recognition of their work which, let 
us be honest, is the reason we have such a good reputation 
within the international community? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have already mentioned, it is all very fine and well to 
rise in the House and make ministerial statements in support of 
people setting off overseas, but I also think it would be good 
for RCMP members to feel supported economically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where Bill C-12 comes in.  It tries to address a certain 
unfairness in the distribution of employee benefits. 
We realized there was a difference in the levels of pay of 
members of the RCMP serving on peacekeeping missions and members 
of the Canadian armed forces serving as peacekeepers on similar 
missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inequality arises from the fact that the Pension Act 
currently provides for payment of an allowance in the event of 
disability or death relating to service in the armed forces. 
While they are eligible for the same benefits as the armed 
forces in peace time, the members of the RCMP are not, by 
definition, entitled to benefits under the Special Duty Area 
Pension Order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, members of the RCMP are not entitled to the same benefits as 
the people they are working with—the members of the armed 
forces.  This salary difference remained, despite the fact that 
they are both exposed to the dangers of the special duty areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 clearly tries to remedy this anomaly.  In fact, by 
changing section 32(1) in part II of the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police Superannuation Act, the bill remedies the inequality that 
had existed up to now.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment will provide for a pension to be awarded in 
accordance with the Pension Act to a member of the RCMP who is 
disabled or dies as a result of an injury or disease incurred 
while serving on a peacekeeping mission in a special duty area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The expression “service on a peacekeeping mission” would not be 
defined so as not to be limited in the application of the law. 
A broad interpretation would enable us to apply new provisions, 
not only to traditional UN peacekeeping missions, but to other 
duties as well, such as supervising free elections held in 
special duty areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights we had an 
opportunity to hear a number of witnesses concerned about the 
changes proposed by Bill C-12. Whether it was Deputy Commissioner 
David Cleveland, director of RCMP human resources or Staff 
Sergeant Gaétan Delisle, the president of the association of the 
members of the RCMP, everyone agreed that the bill corrected 
injustices concerning the health and safety measures enjoyed by 
the military, but not the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During committee deliberations, we had the opportunity to ask a 
number of questions of the various representatives.  Like most 
parliamentarians, I agree with the measures put forward in Bill 
C-12.  I took the opportunity to thank the witnesses, who, in 
their testimony, shared with us what they go through on foreign 
missions. 
At the same time, this was an opportunity to find out what kind 
of support they expected from their government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In debating Bill C-12, we must bear one thing in mind: parity. 
This is the purpose of the bill. It is designed to remedy 
imbalances in the operation of the pension schemes. Basically, 
the intent of the bill can be summed up as the same coverage for 
the same risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the future, RCMP and Canadian Forces members will be able to 
say that they serve under the same conditions with the same 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as the members of this House are about to vote in 
favour of Bill C-12, I must ask them this: once this bill is 
passed, will we be able to say that any and everyone serving in 
special duty areas has a pension? 
In other words, is anyone who falls ill, is injured or killed in 
a peacekeeping operation eligible for benefits under the 
Superannuation Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that there are police forces besides the RCMP 
that participate in peacekeeping operations. For instance, 
municipal police forces in Quebec were actively involved in the 
training of police in Haiti. For them and for their counterparts 
in the RCMP and the Canadian Forces, there was a risk involved 
in accepting to help these communities. In fact, I suggest that 
parity requires that individuals serving abroad, whether RCMP, 
military or municipal police, be entitled to the same benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the hearings of the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights, RCMP officials expressed their view on the case of 
the municipal police officers who work abroad under the same 
conditions as their members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Cleveland, the RCMP's director of human resources, stated 
that it was not his intention to have Bill C-12 apply to 
municipal police officers, since they are not federal employees, 
unlike RCMP officers. No one can refute that statement. I think 
we all agree that municipal police officers are not members of 
the federal public service. 
However, based on the wording of the RCMP Act, municipal police 
officers serving in special duty areas could be considered as 
RCMP officers and thus enjoy the benefits provided under Bill 
C-12, to ensure equal treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I would like to submit to the attention of the 
House section 7(1)(d) of the RCMP Act, which reads as follows 
“The Commissioner—designate any member, any supernumerary 
special constable appointed under this subsection or any 
temporary employee employed under subsection 10(2) as a peace 
officer”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for subsection 10(2), it provides that “The Commissioner may 
employ such number of temporary civilian employees at such 
remuneration and on such other terms and conditions as are 
prescribed by the Treasury Board, and may at any time dismiss or 
discharge any such employee”.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, what prevents the RCMP Commissioner from appointing 
municipal police officers, so that they are temporarily deemed 
to be RCMP officers during peacekeeping missions? Municipal 
police officers could then enjoy the benefits provided under 
Bill C-12. Far from being farfetched, this proposal would allow 
all those who take part in peacekeeping missions abroad to enjoy 
the same benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Bloc Quebecois, equal treatment implies that all those 
who participate in the important task of peacekeeping are 
treated equally. We think Bill C-12 meets our desire for fair 
treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, we feel that a little goodwill on the part of those 
involved is all that is necessary to ensure that municipal 
police officers from Quebec—who do a tremendous job abroad—can 
also get their fair share.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak on behalf of my 
party in support of Bill C-12, an act to amend the RCMP 
Superannuation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation gives members of the RCMP serving abroad as 
peacekeepers the same benefits as their counterparts in the armed 
forces in the event of illness, injury or death.  It has been too 
long in coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we support its passage at third reading, we hope that in 
future when we ask our young men and women to place their lives 
on the line for their country they will not have to worry about 
their benefits and our commitment to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recognize that when our peacekeepers are serving abroad 
in war zones, areas of civil strife or natural disaster they are 
on duty around the clock, putting their lives at risk for their 
country 24 hours a day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is respected around the world for its commitment to peace 
and as a leader in peacekeeping missions.  We as representatives 
of the people must ensure that every measure is taken to give 
full support to our peacekeepers and their families both at home 
and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is intended to provide RCMP members who serve as 
peacekeepers the same health benefits as their counterparts in 
the armed forces.  It is a step in the right direction and is 
only fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, more must be done to recognize the service of our 
peacekeepers and the sacrifices they and their families make in 
the name of peace on behalf of all Canadians.  The issue of 
equity for all those who serve Canada must be addressed both at 
home and abroad, particularly with respect to the RCMP that 
currently do not have the same collective bargaining rights as 
their brothers and sisters in other law enforcement agencies 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear stories of members of the Canadian Armed Forces and 
their families having to use food banks to sustain themselves. 
Men and women who put their lives on the line for their country 
and for peace around the world are forced to live in near poverty 
conditions when they return home to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Long expected raises for servicemen and women have been put on 
hold.  This is in stark contrast to the Treasury Board decision 
to pay huge bonuses to an executive group of the public service 
averaging from $4,300 to $12,000, illustrating the government's 
bias in favour of the executive ranks while denying long, 
outstanding, legally required pay settlements to lower paid 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent history shows that the Canadian government will use its 
power against its own employees to take away rights and 
discriminate against low paid workers.  In the name of fiscal 
restraint, the government has in the past passed legislation to 
take away employee bargaining rights, freeze wages and remove job 
security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The slash and burn policies of the government jeopardize the 
lives of Canadians at home and abroad.  Half of the military 
installations across Canada have been closed.  Aircraft and 
equipment are being mothballed, services reduced and thousands of 
jobs lost in both the public and private sector.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been the impact of the Liberal government and 
demonstrates its lack of commitment not only to our peacekeepers 
but to all Canadians.  It is timely to address these issues at a 
time when all Canadians are encouraged to reflect upon the great 
sacrifices made by all members of our services on behalf of 
Canada and peace around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support Bill C-12 and hope that it is the beginning of a 
renewed commitment to our peacekeepers and indeed to all 
Canadians, for the government has a very long way to go to 
restore equity and fairness to Canadians.  We in the NDP will 
continue to fight to ensure that it does. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased, as always, to rise in the House 
of Commons to pledge the support of the Progressive Conservative 
Party for Bill C-12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the Conservative caucus and I support the 
legislation because it expands the scope of pension benefits for 
many courageous Canadians who presently serve or have previously 
served as peacekeepers throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically Bill C-12 would provide peacekeepers who are 
members of the RCMP with the same pension entitlements in the 
event of illness, injury or death as peacekeepers from the 
Canadian Armed Forces.  The legislation in essence is long 
overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Bill C-12 is adopted, provisions of the RCMP Superannuation 
Act would correspond exactly to provisions of the Pension Act 
regarding coverage and benefits for injuries, illness or deaths 
incurred while on peacekeeping missions.  RCMP peacekeepers would 
therefore be put on a level playing field with all Canadian 
forces counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position in the global community is unique since for the 
last 40 years Canada has built a proud tradition as peacekeepers 
in the world.  Cyprus, Egypt, Rwanda, Somalia, Bosnia and Haiti 
are but a few of the countries where Canadian men and women have 
put their lives on the line to help preserve the cause of peace, 
proud Canadians all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed Canada has been at the forefront of developing and 
implementing modern peacekeeping operations in the world.  This 
is due in no small part to the active involvement of thousands of 
members of the Canadian Armed Forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the first 30 years of participating in peacekeeping 
nations and operations throughout the world the nature of 
Canada's peacekeeping changed.  In 1989 RCMP officers were 
deployed to Namibia, the former southwest Africa, as it made its 
transition from the South African protectorate to an independent 
and democratic nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No longer would peacekeeping remain the sole domain of the 
Canadian forces.  These brave men and women who will henceforth 
have support from their peacekeeping colleagues in the RCMP will 
continue to do Canada's work abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1989 more than 600 members of the RCMP have participated 
in United Nations missions to the former Yugoslavia, Haiti and 
Rwanda.  I personally have had the pleasure of knowing a member 
who took part in such a mission.  From the constituency of 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, Guy Piché, a member of the 
Stellarton RCMP detachment and a dedicated officer, served his 
country proudly in Haiti. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP has successfully complemented the Canadian Armed Forces 
and their involvement in peacekeeping.  By expanding upon the 
earlier successes of Canadian forces in many of the world's 
trouble spots, RCMP members have met the demand for peacekeepers 
in developing nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should pause for a moment and reflect on what peacekeeping 
means.  It is more than a buzzword.  Peacekeeping means providing 
tools to developing countries to help support a stable and 
democratic government, namely an effective security force in 
place which will ensure and respect human rights and dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>RCMP members avail themselves to provide skill training in areas 
such as investigation, first aid and case management.  They have 
also provided monitoring for individual officers and monitoring 
for development of civilian peace officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally peacekeeping includes maintaining a safe and secure 
environment in which developing peace forces can operate without 
fear of reprisals.  The last element of peacekeeping is probably 
the most dangerous for those in the RCMP.  Like their Canadian 
forces colleagues in the traditional peacekeeping settings, RCMP 
officers will face violent opposition to their presence in some 
instances.  They will place themselves in harm's way because of 
warring factions.  This is the ultimate in bravery in the fight 
against unruly forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>United Nations and the bill define these peacekeeping locations 
as special area duties.  The everyday reality is much more 
precise. 
These are deeply troubled areas in which Canadians are putting 
themselves at grave risk of injury, illness or death for the 
cause of peace.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons the intent of the legislation, to put Canadian 
forces and RCMP personnel on an equal footing with respect to the 
Pension Act, is certainly a positive one, which I feel should 
receive priority and attention from the House and from the 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should note, however, that the situation of imbalance between 
Canadian forces peacekeeping benefits and the RCMP peacekeeping 
benefits was neither planned nor deliberate.  It occurred under 
the evolution of Canada's international military and security 
role during this century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of the 20th century there was no such thing as 
peacekeeping.  Soldiers for the peacekeeping force were, merely 
by the absence of full scale war, doing their duty abroad.  Such 
a war became a reality in the first world war in which Canada 
paid dearly with the price of the lives of many of the young 
generation of Canadians who took part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the wake of the first world war's carnage, the government of 
the Right Hon. Sir Robert Borden introduced the Pension Act, 
which provided compensation for disability and death related to 
service in Canadian forces.  The Pension Act, however, maintained 
a fundamental distinction in the eligibility of benefits between 
wartime and peacetime military service.  That distinction 
remained almost 80 years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Put simply, if an injury, illness or death was attributed to or 
incurred during the first or second world war, a pension shall be 
awarded under section 21 of the act.  This was around the clock 
coverage.  Peacetime service would result in the same benefit as 
wartime service, only if it could be established that the injury, 
illness or death was sustained on duty and attributed to service. 
The difference was clear.  If there existed a state of war, 24 
hour coverage was provided.  However for anything less much 
stricter restrictions would apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the second world war Canada continued to be involved in 
international military operations during peacetime such as in 
Korea and the Persian gulf.  Canada also introduced and executed 
the innovative notion of peacekeeping which nonetheless placed 
Canadian forces personnel in hazardous conditions not normally 
associated with traditional peacekeeping service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to that evolution, the federal government introduced 
the Appropriation Act No. 10, 1964.  The bill then allowed 
cabinet, through order in council, to designate special duty 
areas outside Canada in which members of the armed forces would 
be eligible for the same pension benefits as under section 21 of 
the Pension Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, there was 24 hour coverage for Canadian forces 
personnel in these special designated duty areas, whether in 
military operations such as in Korea or the Persian gulf or 
peacekeeping activities such as in the Middle East or the former 
Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Various governments have issued more than two dozen such 
designations.  Our Canadian forces personnel have therefore been 
eligible for pension benefits in the event of illness, injury or 
death incurred in these special duty areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP meanwhile have been eligible for the same pension 
benefits as those listed under section 21(2) of the Pension Act, 
but the illness, injury or death provisions incurred through 
peacetime military service was deemed to be equivalent to 
illness, injury or death entitlements for members of the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle was confirmed under the RCMP Act in 1984 and 
confirmed in the first RCMP Superannuation Act in 1959.  This was 
a logical provision for the domestic RCMP service.  In an area 
such as Canada where peace is the rule, it makes perfectly good 
sense to link this type of pension eligibility to duty rather 
than to service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore in special duty areas peace is the exception and not 
the rule.  That is why the federal government, I surmise, has 
changed the pension eligibility rules for Canadian forces 
personnel which were in effect for 30 years.  I suspect that is 
why the federal government must now change the pension 
eligibility rules for RCMP personnel who are now very much an 
integral part of Canada's international commitment to 
peacekeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the sole purpose behind Bill C-12.  For the reasons I 
outlined, it is with pleasure that I pledge the support of the 
Conservative caucus in a very non-partisan way.  I suspect that 
this will be of tremendous benefit to existing members of the 
RCMP and future generations who partake in this very noble duty 
abroad and within Canada.

Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  It must be a rare occasion when 
two members with the same name on opposite sides of the House 
support the same bill.  I intend to split my time with the member 
for Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very straightforward bill which will correct the 
inequalities that exist today between two groups of very noble 
Canadians, namely our peacekeepers and members of the RCMP.  In 
particular, it will extend protection provided to RCMP members in 
the event of an injury, illness or even death connected to such 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let me explain the amendment and its importance to Canada 
and its international peacekeepers.  Our Canadian peacekeepers 
serve in some of the most war torn areas of the world.  They are 
highly skilled individuals who work to bring law and order to 
nations experiencing civil strife.  While doing so Canadian 
peacekeepers live in danger 24 hours a day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are justifiably proud of their peacekeepers and expect 
that they will receive the same kind of protection and benefits 
that properly reflect the conditions in which they work and live. 
The special duty area pension order recognizes the environment in 
which our peacekeepers serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Canadian forces are considered on duty 24 hours a 
day while serving in special duty areas.  That means that should 
a member of the Canadian forces suffer an injury or illness or 
even die while serving in such an area, he or she automatically 
becomes entitled to the benefit under the Pension Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately such cannot be said for members of the RCMP.  At 
present 44 of their members are serving abroad in Bosnia or 
Haiti.  They are only entitled to benefits under the Pension Act 
if the injury, illness or death occurs during their normally 
scheduled work shift.  We had an anomaly with regard to two 
members serving in the same area, one an RCMP officer and the 
other an off duty soldier.  If injured, one receives compensation 
and the other does not.  It is not fair and it is not equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the terms of the present act the onus is on the employee 
to prove the disability attributable to the employment or 
service.  Since Canada first participated in international 
peacekeeping missions by sending members of the armed forces to 
areas of armed conflict, it was acknowledged that it would be 
unfair to oblige these individuals or their beneficiaries to 
prove that injury or death was attributable to their work. 
Whereas a member of the Canadian forces benefits from the 
presumption that the injury or loss of life occurred while 
serving in a special duty area and is attributable to his or her 
service, the onus unfortunately shifts to the member of the RCMP 
to prove his or her case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill corrects that inequity.  It solves the problem of the 
differences in treatment between members of the Canadian forces 
and the RCMP.  It acknowledges that Canadian peacekeepers never 
stop serving and running a risk even when their shift is over. As 
I indicated earlier, we would have two individuals leaving the 
service area, going off duty, and in the same accident one member 
would be covered and the other would not be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, for instance, members of both forces are on 
a mission in Bosnia, which has been declared a special duty area. 
In accordance with special duty area pension orders, members of 
the Canadian Armed Forces are considered to be on duty 24 hours a 
day with respect to injury, illness or death.  Members of the 
RCMP, however, are considered to be on duty only during their 
shift and therefore are treated differently from military 
personnel participating in the same mission, even though they are 
enduring the same conditions and are exposed to the same dangers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These special benefits take into account the increased risk 
associated with peacekeeping duties.  The amendment will extend 
the same kind of program to disabled RCMP peacekeepers.  The 
amendment reflects the changing role of peacekeeping and how 
Canada as a country, respected worldwide for its commitment to 
peacekeeping, has provided what many countries need most to 
sustain peace, a respect for the rule of law and a method of 
fairly enforcing the law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that RCMP members participating in these 
peacekeeping missions are volunteers.  They are highly dedicated 
individuals and highly skilled individuals who bring to their 
mission a great deal of talent and dedication.  They are all 
volunteers and they all experience some level of risk.  Their job 
is not an easy one.  It is not without significant personal risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore it is very important that RCMP members serving as 
peacekeepers be treated fairly and that their families can be 
confident in the adequacy of benefits to which they are entitled. 
The bill strives to do just that.  It seeks equity for all 
Canadian peacekeepers, whether they are military or RCMP 
personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In supporting this bill parliamentarians from all sides of the 
House will acknowledge the contributions of the RCMP as equal in 
value to that of their colleagues in the Canadian forces.  It is 
good law.  It corrects inequity and I hope all parties from all 
sides of the House will see fit to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping this House will act quickly.  There are at present 
44 members of the RCMP serving abroad in areas of risk.  We need 
to address that, and I am hoping all members will see fit to pass 
the legislation quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the RCMP currently serving their country in 
peacekeeping missions must be assured that they will be protected 
in the event of injury, illness or death.  I hope that all hon. 
members understand the fairness of the amendments proposed to the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act and that they 
will join me in the passage of Bill C-12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all of those reason, as the hon. member opposite said, I 
support the legislation.  I hope that in supporting the 
legislation it will see speedy passage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
enjoyed the comments made by my colleague who sits on the justice 
committee, as do I.  I am wondering if he would like to comment 
on a bit of a sidebar to this bill.  As we send our RCMP members 
overseas, which is rather a new and unique occurrence in the 
history of the force, I am wondering if he is concerned about the 
vacancy that is left in this country, where we see some 
detachments, particularly in western Canada, manned by the most 
senior member who holds nothing greater than the rank of 
corporal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he has any thoughts that he might add to his earlier 
comments with regard to that kind of a situation which is 
developing as a result of the extension of the work of our RCMP 
to serve in other countries which, at the same time, weakens the 
force in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I was more worried that 
the hon. member might ask me something about the proposed DNA 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out to the hon. member that all of the people who 
are serving in Bosnia and Haiti are in fact volunteers.  I am 
assuming that in the course of both budgeting and deploying 
resources the concept of their volunteerism is taken into 
consideration with their superior officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not argue that any diminution of ability or resources 
locally is in any way affected because of the approach to 
volunteering for this service.  These people do a wonderful job. 
We should be proud of them.  We need to support them and this 
bill goes a long way toward doing just that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a privilege for me to address the proposed 
legislative change to amend the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Superannuation Act.  I fully support this bill which will balance 
the benefits given to our peacekeepers whether they belong to the 
Canadian forces or to the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently there are inconsistencies in the work related health 
and death benefits offered to peacekeepers working in these two 
groups.  The amendment would allow RCMP officers to be covered 24 
hours a day for illness, disability and death while working 
overseas in special duty areas in the same way officers in the 
Canadian forces receive their benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will outline the importance of this bill to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our peacekeepers are sent to represent our country as well as to 
provide security and stability to the people living in some of 
the most war torn areas of the world.  They are highly skilled 
individuals who work to bring law and order to nations 
experiencing strife.  While doing this, Canadian peacekeepers are 
effectively on duty 24 hours a day whether they are on a formal 
shift or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While at home RCMP members, like all other Canadians, are 
entitled to government sponsored benefits for work related 
illness, disability and death.  The system makes a distinction 
between work and non-work situations.  In Canada this distinction 
is clear.  A work related incident occurs during a work shift. 
However, in the case of peacekeepers serving outside Canada in 
hazardous areas, the line between being on duty and off duty is 
less clear.  This bill will recognize that our Canadian 
peacekeepers while serving overseas can never truly go off duty 
or be away from danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are proud of their peacekeepers and expect them to 
receive the protection and benefits they deserve.  I know this to 
be true.  My constituents in Waterloo—Wellington are very proud 
of those who do so much for all of us as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Canadian Armed Forces first participated in 
international peacekeeping missions, soldiers or their 
beneficiaries were not required to prove that injury or death had 
occurred while the individual was on duty.  This acknowledgement 
continues today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Canadian forces are on duty 24 hours a day while 
they serve in special duty areas such as Bosnia and Haiti.  This 
means that if a member of the Canadian forces suffers an injury, 
becomes ill or even dies while serving in these areas, the 
benefits under the Pension Act automatically apply.  This is not 
so for the RCMP.  These officers are only entitled to benefits 
under the Pension Act if the illness, injury or death occurs 
during a normally scheduled shift.  Under the terms of the act, 
the onus is on the employee to prove the disability is attributed 
to on-duty service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently members of both forces are on a mission in Bosnia, a 
region declared as a special duty area.  According to the special 
duty pension order, members of the Canadian forces are considered 
to be on duty 24 hours a day with respect to the risk of illness, 
injury or death.  However, members of the RCMP are considered to 
be on duty only during scheduled shift hours.  Although both 
forces are participating in the same mission under the same 
conditions and exposed to the same dangers, RCMP members are 
treated differently than military personnel.  This bill addresses 
this double standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It solves the problem of the differing treatment between members 
of the Canadian forces and members of the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police doing the same jobs.  It acknowledges that Canadian 
peacekeeping forces never really stop serving and running risks 
even when their shifts are over.  This special pension benefit 
takes into account the increased risk associated with 
peacekeeping duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 reflects the changing role of peacekeeping and how 
Canada, a country respected worldwide for its peacekeeping 
commitments, has assisted many countries in stabilizing law and 
order.  This bill strives for equality for all peacekeepers 
whether they are military or RCMP personnel.  By supporting this 
bill we will acknowledge that the RCMP's contribution to 
peacekeeping is as important as that of the Canadian forces.  I 
hope all hon. members understand the fairness of the amendments 
proposed to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act 
and that they will join with me and others in passing this bill.

<A NAME="LINK250">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (for the Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-38, an act to amend the National Parks 
Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am indeed pleased, very proud and honoured to 
have an opportunity to begin second reading debate on the 
establishment of Tuktut Nogait National Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opportunity and the sense of pride that I have in being part 
of the establishment of Canada's newest national park is indeed a 
broad pride that I have in our nation and in the program that we 
embarked on back in 1885 when we began the process of 
establishing our national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is going to be an important step in the completion of the 
national park system.  As members are aware, it is our objective 
as a government and our objective as Canadians to have 
representation in all 39 of the natural regions of Canada.  When 
we speak about completing our national parks system we are 
talking in the sense of making sure we have representation in all 
39 agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process that we are engaged in today is the completion of a 
very lengthy process that has been ongoing for a number of years. 
The most important part of that process occurred on June 28, 1996 
when an agreement was signed in Paulatuk in the Northwest 
Territories for the formal establishment of Tuktut Nogait 
National Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an agreement among many of the partners who have 
worked toward the initiation and establishment of this park.  The 
agreement was signed by the federal government and indeed by the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage on behalf of the Government of 
Canada, in fact the same incumbent who holds that position today. 
The agreement was signed by the Government of the Northwest 
Territories and by a number of representatives representing the 
Inuvialuit who are also signatories to the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement also completed a long and lengthy process of 
almost seven years of study, negotiations and examinations of the 
issues that were evident in that area which came to a conclusion 
in 1996 and we are here in the House to formalize that agreement 
through an amendment to the National Parks Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the primary purposes in establishing this park was the 
protection of the Bluenose caribou herd and its calving and 
post-calving habitat.  It has long been a priority of the 
government and a priority of many Canadians to safeguard the core 
calving grounds of caribou, not just the Bluenose herd as we are 
doing with this park, but indeed with caribou all across the 
Arctic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a government and indeed the Prime Minister himself has 
said publicly, particularly in talking to our colleagues in the 
United States, how important this objective is and we have long 
called on the U.S. government to work toward that end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed this also represented a very special occurrence because 
in 1994 a resource company, Darnely Bay Resources, at the request 
of the Inuvialuit and others, voluntarily withdrew their mining 
interests within the park boundaries. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT86"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT86"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1715

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a very important signal of the times, that the mining 
community was willing to work with national parks, recognizing 
the importance of establishing them.  They withdrew but not 
because they felt there was no possibility of mineral resources 
there because in fact the area is designated as having medium to 
high potential. At that time there was a request to withdraw 
because the important environmental considerations, the important 
objective of protecting the caribou herd was made persuasively 
and the company withdrew its interest in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of important components to this park. 
Obviously it conforms with the Inuvialuit final agreement 
regarding their land claims settlement.  This agreement signed in 
1996 recognizes that and indeed it honours that agreement. It 
also provides for Inuvialuit wildlife harvesting activities. They 
will be able to maintain their traditional activities within the 
boundaries of the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said when I began my comments, the protection of Canada's 
special places is an important objective for this government.  It 
is indeed something most Canadians and I would hazard to say all 
Canadians believe in.  To date, federally we are protecting some 
3% of our land and when we count that which is under protection 
by the provinces it is a little over 10%.  We are working toward 
making sure we can leave to future generations these special 
places in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this legislation and with the protection of the caribou, 
with the protection of what is one of the most beautiful places 
in Canada, we are working toward the completion of our national 
parks system.  I am very proud of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon my colleagues in the House to support this 
legislation.  Support the formalization of this national park as 
a full-fledged member of the national parks family. This will 
ensure the protection we provide under the act will be provided 
to this area.  I urge my colleagues from all parties to support 
the establishment of this very special national park. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to Bill 
C-38.  This bill will establish the Tuktut Nogait national park 
in the Northwest Territories.  The park will be 16,340 square 
kilometres and it resides in the Inuvialuit land claims 
settlement region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill itself is very technical. It outlines in precise 
geographical terms the boundaries of the new park.  However there 
is more to the bill than lines on a map and a lot of complicated 
geographical land descriptions. The driving force behind the 
creation of this national park was the protection of the calving 
grounds of the bluenose caribou. In fact in the Siglik dialect of 
Inuvialuktun, “tuktut nogait” means “caribou calves”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989 the closest community to the new park, Paulatuk, 
prepared a community conservation plan that recommended the 
creation of a national park in order to protect the caribou 
calving grounds. In 1996 an agreement was signed by the 
Government of Canada, the Northwest Territories and four 
representative groups of the Inuvialuit. 
That agreement set out the boundaries of the park as they are set 
out in this legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new national park not only protects the caribou but it also 
protects the fragile tundra landscape in that region. The 
creation of the park advances the objective of Parks Canada of 
establishing a national park in every distinctive natural region 
of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tuktut Nogait park is located in region 15, Tundra Hills, as 
designated by Parks Canada in its national parks systems plan. 
This particular region is highlighted by a number of spectacular 
features.  One is the smoking hills where smoke billows from 
cracks in the ash covered ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, more than 95% of this region is tundra, rock barrens 
where only the hardiest plants can survive.  Wildlife in region 
15 is mainly comprised of summer migrants.  Muskox, wolves and as 
many as 500,000 caribou can be found in this region. According to 
Parks Canada this area is home to one of the rarest birds in 
Canada, the Eskimo curlew. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tuktut Nogait comprises only a portion of region 15.  However 
the new national park is an important step in preserving the 
wildlife and wilderness wonders which I have just described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a country that is extremely diverse in its landscape, 
temperatures and wildlife.  It is incumbent upon us to act 
responsibly to ensure that the appreciation of that diversity is 
available to future generations.  The creation of Tuktut Nogait 
is an important step in protecting that diversity and providing 
Canadians and our visitors with an opportunity to discover and 
enjoy the natural beauty of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Darnley Bay anomaly borders the new park on its western 
side.  The anomaly area which covers 463,847 hectares is thought 
to contain nickel, copper and platinum group elements.  There was 
some concern for the boundaries of the Tuktut Nogait park since 
this mineral find, or the proposed area where minerals may be, 
extends within the park's borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The company prospecting the anomaly had been given exploration 
permits by the department of Indian affairs that mistakenly 
included portions of the new national park.  However in 1994 the 
company in question relinquished its exploration rights within 
the national park area so that the establishment of the park 
could proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last September the president of Darnley Bay Resources was quoted 
in the Edmonton <I>Journal</I>. What he said was that he would not 
seek a change to the park boundary if a major mineral deposit was 
found on the boundary.  The company should be commended for that. 
It is encouraging to see that businesses in this country are 
willing to work with the government in preserving and protecting 
our natural heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to reviewing this bill more closely in committee 
so that the exact costs of the establishment and maintenance of 
the park can be determined.  I will be interested to learn how 
the park will be managed. I will be interested to examine any 
projected business or financial plans that may be available for 
the new park. While I am sure we are all in agreement as to the 
importance of establishing this park, we should also agree that 
the establishment of this park must be done in a fiscally 
responsible manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I can see no reason for opposing the establishment 
of this new national park in region 15.  It protects and 
preserves wildlife in an important wilderness area in the 
Northwest Territories.  It preserves a part of Canada's natural 
heritage for us, for our children and for our grandchildren to 
enjoy. Surely such an objective can meet with the support of all 
members of this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I concur with the speech just given by my colleague on the 
establishment of this park but I would like to add a couple of 
caveats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My major concern is in the management of the parks under Parks 
Canada, soon to be under the parks agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It strikes me that there has not been a sufficient 
differentiation between parks and preserves.  These are English 
words that I use to designate how I see the difference between 
the establishment of this park and many others, and where we have 
developed facilities such as the four mountain parks, especially 
the Banff park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear to me that there has to be an acceptance by the top 
management in Parks Canada or in the parks agency, whenever that 
comes about, to ensure we do not end up robbing Peter to pay 
Paul. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to the fact that the four mountain parks have the 
ability to generate revenue.  The town site of Banff has a gross 
domestic product in the range of three-quarters of a billion 
dollars a year.  That is not million; that is billion. 
Three-quarters of a billion dollars a year just from that one 
town site in the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parks Canada also has the ability and the responsibility to 
collect fees from people who have concessions or leases within 
the parks.  There is Riding Mountain National Park.  There are 
the contractual arrangements for some of the tour operations in 
Gros Morne National Park. The park derives revenue that is going 
into the overall park revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be some kind of linkage between the revenue which 
is being derived from a given area and the services which are 
being provided to that area. Unfortunately, as I understand the 
situation, revenues derived from the leaseholders, the tour 
operators, and other people who are paying into the park even the 
permits are currently going into the consolidated revenue of the 
park. In my judgment that represents a serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague has just stated, with the establishment of this 
park we have to make sure that we are doing these things on a 
very sound fiscal footing.  If there is a good reason for the 
establishment of this park, and I believe there is, we have to be 
able to cost it out.  The people of Canada will then know the 
administrative costs for the people involved in the environmental 
sciences, the protection and ranger work, the physical 
infrastructure required to support them as well as their pay and 
benefits. If they know that the cost of the entire package is 
going to be $1 million, then Canadians can either buy into it 
because it is good value or say that it is too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be a complete separation between the leasehold 
arrangements, the tour operator arrangements and the park fee 
arrangements that are currently in place.  There has to be more 
focus on those areas where the revenue is derived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a concern in the downsizing that has occurred. The Reform 
Party has been supportive of making government more accountable 
and leaner and we take pride in that.  However, the concern I had 
when I was responsible for this portfolio before turning it over

pay Paul in the parks system.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK257">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 12 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-208, an act to amend the Access to Information Act, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it gives me great pleasure to speak on private member's Bill 
C-208 brought forward by the Liberal member for Brampton 
West—Mississauga. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-208 proposes to amend the Access to Information Act to 
provide sanctions against any person who improperly destroys or 
falsifies government records in an attempt to deny right of 
access of information under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports ensuring that the government is more 
open and accountable to the public.  This bill would do that.  It 
therefore has my support and the support of a great number of my 
colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has the responsibility to ensure that the affairs 
of government are open and above board.  Canadians have a stake 
in government affairs and the actions of government must be open 
to public scrutiny.  The wilful destruction of public documents 
clearly must be prevented.  This can only be done with realistic 
sanctions, which is what this bill does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information collected for public purposes and paid for by the 
taxpayers belongs to the people.  Canadians have a right to 
ensure that public documents are made available to Canadians 
under the requirements of the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-208 will help to ensure that the guarantee of public 
access to government documents is protected.  Bill C-208 will 
hold government and public servants accountable for their actions 
when dealing with public documents.  Bill C-208 will also serve 
as a deterrent to future recurrences of destruction of public 
documents as we witnessed during the Somalia affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information commissioner John Grace investigated and found that 
allegations of document tampering or destructions at Transport 
Canada and national defence “proved to be well founded”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investigation also found document destruction by Health Canada 
in 1989 of the Canadian blood committee audio tapes and 
transcripts of all preceding meetings of the Canadian blood 
committee. The destruction was ordered and carried out so that 
records could not become subject to the Access to Information 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner concluded that the decision to destroy the 
records was motivated by concern about potential litigation and 
liability issues associated with tainted blood products.  The 
commissioner found that the then executive director of the 
Canadian blood committee had custody and control of the records 
and probably knew there was a pending access to information 
request for the records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the information commissioner, these “lamentable 
incidents of wilful actions taken by public officials for the 
purpose of suppressing information have been a wake-up call”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information commissioner has twice recommended: “There 
should be a specific offence in the access act for acts or 
omissions intended to thwart the rights set out in law. Moreover, 
those who commit this offence should be subject to greater 
sanctions than simply exposure of wrongdoing.  At a minimum, the 
offence should carry a penalty of up to five years in prison. 
Such a penalty is in line with that imposed in section 122 of the 
Criminal Code for breach of trust by a public officer.  The 
stakes are too high for simply a slap on the wrist”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also according to the information commissioner, the government 
has improperly destroyed or falsified government documents in 
many ways.  These include altering records before release to an 
access request or without informing the requester of the changes 
and without invoking any exemptions under the act, or destroying 
original records so that the alterations would not be found out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill makes good sense. 
It is filling a hole that currently exists within the Access to 
Information Act by allowing or specifying penalties for people 
who would wilfully destroy or alter public information so anyone 
having an access request would not get that information. I 
support this bill and I believe a number of people in the House 
will also support it.

to Information Act.  Bill C-216, the third hour on which will be 
in a couple of weeks, also deals with access to information.  It 
deals with commissions and crown corporations such as the CBC and 
the wheat board that are now exempt from access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The four bills come from all sides of the House dealing with 
access to information.  This shows all parties are interested in 
having an Access to Information Act that works, that is 
accessible and covers all areas of government.  We will see it 
happen in the votes over the next days and months in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am indebted the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington for his 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commence by commending my colleague for Brampton 
West—Mississauga for bringing this important issue to the 
attention of the House and for her continued commitment to 
safeguarding the rights of Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased to have an opportunity to speak on Bill C-208. 
It proposes to add to the Access to Information Act an infraction 
for destroying documents subject to the act with intent to deny 
access.  Before talking about the specific of the bill I will 
provide some background for my comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have had the benefit of the federal Access to 
Information Act since 1983.  The federal government can uniquely 
invoke certain exceptional, specific and limited measures to 
refuse access to information.  It is in these cases, when the 
government refuses to grant access to information, that the law 
confers on individuals the right to make a complaint to the 
access to information commission to review the decision made by 
the government in the federal court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The laws of access to information of the federal government are 
a fundamental right in a democratic system.  Under a declaration 
of the supreme court made earlier this year the primary goal of 
the legislative measures is concerning the access to information 
to facilitate democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The laws of access to information that the government possesses 
in order to facilitate the functioning of the federal government 
are to render more simple, more receptive and more responsible 
government.  States with repressive laws consequently are missing 
a tool that allows them to behave responsibly as governments. 
This is not to say that access to information could not be 
improved or brought up to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is trying to improve the act with the amendment 
proposed in the legislation.  One can argue that there is a gap 
in the protection currently offered by the act since it does not 
contain a penalty for the deliberate alteration or destruction of 
a record.  The act does contain a penalty but it is a penalty for 
obstructing the work of the information commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act also authorizes the commissioner to disclose to the 
Attorney General of Canada information relating to the commission 
of an offence against any law of Canada by any officer or 
employee of a federal government institution.

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would add an offence for actions that one can 
legitimately see as actions that intend to defeat the purpose of 
the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason I agree with the hon. member that the Access to 
Information Act should include a penalty for deliberately 
destroying documents subject to the act. I believe that such 
action is unacceptable and therefore should be punished.  For 
this reason I support the general goal of Bill C-208.  I do not, 
however, support the specifics of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could maintain that article 126 of the Criminal Code applies 
to a situation where a person voluntarily destroys a document 
with the goal to revoke access to information under the Access to 
Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under article 126 of the Criminal Code whoever without 
legitimate excuse contravenes the federal law by voluntarily 
accomplishing is guilty of a criminal act and is liable for 
imprisonment for a maximum of two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The severity of the penalty seen in article 126 can bring us to 
ask if we can foresee the penalty under the access to information 
law in the case where voluntary destruction of documents is 
applied to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We envision a penalty specific that would not be as severe as 
that in article 126 for the act of this crime and to receive 
imprisonment for a maximum of two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am of the opinion that the penalty as described in the 
Criminal Code is probably far too severe.  Consequently, if we 
add a penalty specific to the access to information law it should 
be less severe than the penalty currently listed in article 126. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is proposed in Bill C-208?  It is to create an indictable 
offence with a maximum penalty of five years in prison, which is 
heavier than the penalty provided for in section 126.  For this 
reason I cannot support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the hon. member wants to make the point that the 
destruction or alteration of the document is serious.  We all 
agree to this.  It should also be put into perspective. In my 
view a maximum of five years is far too heavy a penalty for 
destroying documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This penalty would be more severely punished than the offence of 
assault causing bodily harm, a hybrid offence with a maximum 
penalty of 18 months when prosecuted under summary conviction. 
Destroying documents, while undoubtedly serious, cannot be 
compared to assault causing bodily harm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the need to create an offence for the deliberate 
destruction of records in order to thwart the Access to 
Information Act is an issue that should be considered within the 
context of the reform of this act and should be examined by the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that a case can be made that an addition to such an 
offence would strengthen the principles of openness and 
accountability inherent in the access to information legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that particular attention should be paid to 
determining the appropriate sentence to be attached to the 
offence, which should be proportional to penalties provided for 
comparable offences.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with special interest that I rise today to speak to Bill C-208, 
an act to amend the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill provides more severe sanctions against any person who 
improperly destroys or falsifies government records in an 
attempt to deny right of access to information under the Access 
to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1980 Access to Information Act does not provide sanctions 
severe enough for this type of offence. Section 67 currently 
provides the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>67. (1) No person shall obstruct the Information Commissioner or 
any person acting on behalf or under the direction of the 
Commissioner in the performance of the Commissioner's duties and

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-208 makes it an indictable offence to destroy, falsify or 
not keep required records. The punishment for such an offence 
would be imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or a 
fine not exceeding $10,000 or both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is timely since people from every walk of life are 
becoming increasingly interested in public life, and this is 
good. 
Whether they are artists, professionals, intellectuals or 
labourers, they all want to know how their interests are being 
taken care of. It is critical to understand that citizens want 
to take an active part in the development of government 
policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this legitimate demand requires that the policy 
development process be accessible. Therefore the process to 
disseminate government information must be effective and, above 
all, transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the current act meet these expectations? Do information 
policies allow every citizen to really know how the government 
works? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the member for Brampton, who introduced this bill, 
the answer is no. 
According to the member, we must review the Access to 
Information Act to punish more severely any person who 
improperly destroys or falsifies official records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I totally agree with the member. Public servants who commit such 
destructive acts must be punished more severely. As lawmakers, 
we must protect the right of our fellow citizens to be 
adequately informed of their government's actions. And I am not 
the only one who thinks so. On several occasions, the 
Information Commissioner criticized the lack of teeth in the 
Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his 1995-96 report, he condemned the three following cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, at Transport Canada, a senior official directed his 
assistants to destroy all copies of an audit report concerning a 
refurbishing project which he knew was the subject of an access 
to information request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, at the Department of National Defence, a reporter 
claiming that certain documents had been falsified before being 
released to him requested an investigation, which showed that 
the allegations were founded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there was a similar case at Health Canada. Testimony 
presented before the Krever Commission revealed that recordings 
of meetings of the Canadian committee were fraudulently 
destroyed in the late 1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his 1996-1997 report, the commissioner reaffirms his position 
that the law as it stands now does not provide for effective 
enforcement mechanisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the specific issue of the tainted blood scandal, the 
commissioner once again sent a message to the lawmakers, saying 
“These lamentable incidents of wilful actions taken by public 
officials for the purpose of suppressing information have been a 
wake-up call. As recommended in last year's annual report, there 
should be a specific offence in the access act for acts or 
omissions intended to thwart the rights set out in the law. At a 
minimum, the offence should carry a penalty of up to five years 
in prison”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his last two reports, the commissioner warned us that the 
legislation was not effective. In 1996, he said and I quote 
“After 13 years of operation of this Act, it is unfortunate to 
have to report several very disturbing manoeuvres to hinder the 
right of access to government documents, including destruction 
and falsification”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, for the second time in two years, the commissioner 
stated “These lamentable incidents of wilful actions taken by 
public officials for the purpose of suppressing information have 
been a wake-up call. 
As recommended in last year's annual report, there should be a 
specific offence in the access act for acts or omissions 
intended to thwart the rights set out in the law. At a minimum, 
the offence should carry a penalty of up to five years in 
prison”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that we need to legislate according to the 
recommendations made by the commissioner. One of my colleagues, 
the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm, has introduced Bill C-286. 
He too urges parliamentarians to solve the problems related to 
the enforcement of the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, his bill differs from the one now before the House, 
because it deals with various aspects of the destruction of 
documents. The bill before the House does not seem to deal with 
that particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Laval Centre said, when we address the 
issue of the destruction and falsification of documents, we 
cannot disregard some considerations specific to our public 
administration. 
Documents requested under access to information are rarely 
destroyed by the individual who would really benefit from their 
disappearance.  Very often—and the bill must have provision for 
this—it is senior officials or senior public servants who have 
ordered this to be done, although they have not done it 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm is introducing 
Bill C-268, which forbids any employer in a position of authority 
from taking reprisals against anyone refusing to destroy or 
falsify a record when asked to do so.  This shortcoming in the 
present legislation would be remedied by the bill of my hon. 
colleague for Berthier—Montcalm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be severe penalties for those who use their authority 
to order destruction of a document and who threaten someone who 
refuses to go along with this. Unfortunately, Bill C-286 makes no 
mention of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, it must be recognized that the bill attempts—albeit 
only partially—to solve a very significant problem in our 
information policy.  It is therefore our party's duty to support 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Access to Information Act does, however, deserve to be 
reformed far more extensively.  I am therefore inviting you to 
discuss Bill C-286, which addresses access to Privy Council 
confidences, with my colleague soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, although this bill is praiseworthy, I must draw 
attention to some of its shortcomings.  One of these is  that it 
calls upon parliamentarians to resolve only some of the 
problems.  It must therefore be made clear that this reform 
remains incomplete in many ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we need to be aware that documents, and I repeat 
myself here, are rarely destroyed by the very person for whom 
their destruction would be advantageous.  The Access to 
Information Act must, therefore, prohibit any reprisal, or 
threat of  reprisal by an employer or a person in a position of 
authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The complete bill, in conjunction with Bill C-286, should 
therefore provide for three kinds of offence:  destroying or 
falsifying documents; ordering the destruction or falsification 
of documents; retaliating against a person who refuses to 
destroy or falsify documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore believe the intent of Bill C-208 to be commendable 
and that is why we are supporting it.  Much more extensive 
amendments are in order, however.  That is why we hope to have 
the opportunity at some point to discuss Bill C-286, which will 
be a useful adjunct to the bill before us today.

<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will add a 
few points to this important debate.  We are talking about the 
destruction of evidence of what government officials and 
bureaucrats do.  It seems the whole concept is one of 
accountability of which I am strongly in favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was first elected in 1993 I inherited all of the office 
equipment of my predecessor and the motor on the shredder was 
burned out.  Everything in the office was shredded.  Apparently 
they had bags and bags of shredded paper and a burned out motor 
on the shredder when it was all done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of suggestions for government with respect to 
the handling of confidential information.  There is a bit of a 
misconception here.  I believe there are justifiable occasions 
when in order to protect the rights of individuals, or in the 
case of MPs those of a constituent, documents need to be 
destroyed so they cannot be used against the individuals. 
That I think is important. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to government accountability and bureaucracy I 
think just the opposite is true.  There are two points that I 
think are very important.  One is that accountability comes from 
knowing that the document will some day be made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently we had a talk with, for example, the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  It is not subject to the Access to Information Act so it 
can do whatever it wants.  Other than what it chooses to report 
in its reports, the rest is never available to the public and in 
particular to farmers who have the greatest interest in the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though one can argue that there is a commercial value to 
secrecy at a certain stage, why can we not after five years, or 
even after ten years, say that everything has to be opened up? At 
that stage people would know what decisions were made on their 
behalf five years before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would very greatly affect the decisions being made by 
bureaucrats, by officials.  They might say they can do something 
and no one will ever find out and it does not matter.  However, 
if they know that some years down the road someone will find out, 
it may affect their decision and cause them to do what is right 
instead of what may not be right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of what we are talking about today is the 
destruction of documents that could be called upon later.  I 
would like to add another feature.  Anybody who is ordered by a 
superior to shred documents or otherwise destroy them should have 
the right to obtain the order in writing and to retain that 
document for his or her own protection for the future so that 
nobody can pass the buck afterward and say “I was simply 
following orders”, and then the person giving the orders saying 
“No, I never gave that order”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that way an individual, someone lower down in the hierarchy 
who did not make the decision, would still have protection. 
Thereby the person who actually gave the order would be held 
responsible because the document would be held in the safety of 
the person receiving the order who would be able to produce it if 
the matter became an issue later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general I would like to speak in favour of the bill.  It is 
an important measure to provide accountability and to make sure 
things are done correctly on behalf of taxpayers and voters.  The 
Canadian people would have confidence in their government because 
information would be available to them when they need it in order 
to provide the facts.  This measure would provide for the safety 
of materials, preventing their destruction, so that evidence 
could be brought forward if needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle I support the bill and I also urge other members to 
do so.

parliamentary secretary refused to answer the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of today my particular question on conditional sentencing has 
been outstanding for 45 sitting days of the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, prior and subsequent questions asked repeatedly by 
myself and my colleagues have gone unanswered since the inception 
of Bill C-41, the vehicle of conditional sentencing, in June 
1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For almost three years now we have asked the former and current 
justice ministers to amend the Criminal Code to restrict the use 
of conditional sentencing to non-violent offenders.  We have 
ample reasons to be concerned about the releasing of violent 
offenders including convicted rapists onto our streets.  These 
reasons include the safety of our sons and daughters, our spouses 
and our brothers and sisters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sex offenders have the highest rate of re-offending and therefore 
pose an enormous risk to the lives and safety of our families. 
Yet despite our repeated requests, the justice minister refuses 
to limit conditional sentencing.  As a result, rapists and other 
violent offenders are walking free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have numerous examples to prove this fact.  However, as my 
time is limited, I will use the most recent case which has raised 
the ire of Canadians across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 26 of this year, a Quebec court judge granted 24-year 
old Patrick Lucien and 23-year old Evans Shannon conditional 
sentencing for sexual assault.  Judge Monique Dubreuil granted 
these lenient sentences, although the crown recommended prison 
sentences of five and four years respectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A community sentence is totally inappropriate and unacceptable 
for these two men who took turns raping their 18-year old victim 
while the other held her down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When questioned about these two cases, the justice minister 
provided her typical answer.  She was satisfied to leave this and 
similar controversies to the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well the justice minister may be satisfied with this abhorrent 
use of conditional sentencing, but the Reform Party of Canada— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. member may 
not have been in the House the other day when there was an 
intervention by the Deputy Chairman of Committees of the Whole 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair is very concerned that the precedents of this House 
require that members be judicious in their comments in respect of 
the bench and members of the judiciary in this country.  I must 
say that I take exception to the hon. member naming the judge in 
this case and referring specifically to this judgement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wishes to refer to the case in general, the 
Chair has no objection to that.  It is a perfectly fair comment. 
However, the authorities of this House, including citations in 
Beauchesne's, which I could find for the hon. member to assist 
him, indicate very strongly that members ought not to be naming 
members of the courts in connection with debates in this Chamber 
and then speaking about them in terms that are less than 
flattering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the hon. member to comply with the rules in that regard 
and avoid reference to the judge in this or in any other case, if 
he is going to make adverse comments in respect of that person 
because I believe it is inappropriate for that to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member may continue his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I will be 
guided by the judgment of the Chair on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure where I ended, but I will continue my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 26 of this year a Quebec court granted 24-year old 
Patrick Lucien and 23-year old Evans Shannon conditional 
sentencing for sexual assault.  The judge in that particular case 
granted these lenient sentences although the crown had 
recommended prison sentences of five and four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that a community sentence under conditional sentencing 
is inappropriate in this case.  It is unacceptable for these two 
men who took turns raping their 18-year old victim while each one 
held the victim down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When questioned about these two cases, the justice minister 
provided a typical response that we have heard in our request 
that an amendment to C-41 be made to limit conditional sentencing 
to non-violent offences.  The minister has provided the answer, 
which is on the record, that she is satisfied to leave this and 
similar controversies to the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister, as I stated earlier, may be satisfied with 
this abhorrent use of conditional sentencing but the Reform Party 
and I believe thousands if not millions of Canadians are not 
satisfied with this.  We want the Criminal Code amended and we 
are tired of waiting, as we are tired of waiting for the 
minister's answer to the question I asked on December 5.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the parliamentary secretary is present I repeat my 
question to the government.  Will it consider an amendment to 
conditional sentencing that will deny the courts the use of that 
particular section in cases of convicted violent offenders, 
including rapists?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
December, justice ministers met to discuss conditional 
sentencing issues.  More specifically, they looked at the need 
for an amendment in order to limit conditional sentences to 
non-violent criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All jurisdictions agreed that Canada's appeal courts should be 
allowed to issue the necessary guidelines to sentencing judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is taking place in all appeal courts in the country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the appellate level, courts have expressed the view that 
conditional sentences are generally inappropriate for sexual 
offences unless exceptional circumstances are present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue, as the minister has said, to monitor in close 
consultation with the provinces and territories as requested by 
the territories and the provinces, the use of conditional 
sentences.  There will always be sentencing decisions that create 
controversy, and the Reform members are great creators of 
controversy in this House by bringing up the exceptions to the 
rule every single time, that seem on their face to be 
inappropriate.  That is why we have courts of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for hon. members to keep matters in perspective. 
There have been well over 18,000 conditional sentence orders 
imposed in Canada since September 1996.  As an article published 
in the Toronto <I>Star</I> in March 1988 noted the majority of the 
more than 18,000 conditional sentences have been free of 
controversy.  The vast majority of conditional sentence cases are 
well-reasoned appropriate dispositions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We continue to be vigilant.  We are working with provincial and 
territorial correctional experts and prosecutors to collect data 
on the use of conditional sentencing, as was requested by all 
territories and provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence so far is clear.  Most conditional sentences have 
been imposed for non-violent offences involving property, 
driving, drugs, administration of justice and other non-violent 
offences under the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not make laws in this country for the exceptions.  We make 
them in order to cover a wide range of offences. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to advise hon. members that there is an undertaking 
on the part of provincial and territorial governments to 
continue working together. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to advise in addition that the Minister of Justice is 
considering introducing possible amendments to streamline the 
enforcement of conditional sentences where an allegation of 
breach has been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is 
now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.08 p.m.)
