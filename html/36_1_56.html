<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL S-3—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, I am now ready to render a 
ruling on the point of order raised by the hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford on February 2, 1998 concerning Bill S-3, an 
act to amend the Pension Benefit Standards Act, 1985 and the 
Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to thank the Leader of the Government 
in the House of Commons, the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona, 
the whip of the official opposition, the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Leader of the Government in the House as well as the hon. 
member for Nanaimo—Alberni for their helpful contributions in 
this matter. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his presentation, the opposition House leader expressed 
concern about the introduction of public bills in the Senate. He 
went on to state that Bill S-3, which had been introduced and 
passed in the Senate and was now on the order paper of the House, 
should be considered a money bill and that, as such, it should 
have originated in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before proceeding further I would like to make two points of 
clarification. With regard to the introduction of bills in the 
Senate, may I respectfully remind members of a ruling I delivered 
on October 9, 1997, following the question of privilege raised by 
the same honourable member on this very subject. At that time I 
indicated that according to our practice, bills may originate in 
the Senate or in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, allow me to make a very small correction to a remark 
made by the hon. House leader of the official opposition. He 
reminded the House that Bill S-3 had been originally introduced 
as Bill C-45 in the previous Parliament.  In fact the similar 
bill from the previous Parliament was Bill C-85 and not Bill 
C-45. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now deal with the substantive procedural issue before the 
Chair. The hon. member alleged that both bills were essentially 
the same. Thus, he argued, since a royal recommendation had been 
attached to Bill C-85, one should also be attached to Bill S-3. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reply to this argument, the government House leader stated 
that Bill S-3 does not—and should not—contain a royal 
recommendation since it is not a money bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So-called money bills refer to those bills which raise taxes or 
bills which appropriate money, whether based on annual supply 
votes or on bills which authorize statutory expenditures.  Bills 
appropriating public funds must be accompanied by a royal 
recommendation which establishes “the objects, purposes, 
conditions and qualifications” as explained in citation 596, 
page 183 of Beauchesne's sixth edition.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have carefully examined Bill S-3 and find that there are four 
components to this legislation, none of which in my opinion 
either imposes a tax or appropriates money for any purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1987 legislation creating the Office of Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions, responsibility for supervising federally 
regulated private sector pension plans was provided for.  It 
seems fairly evident that the powers of the superintendent would 
be extended by Bill S-3.  It may well be that additional 
expenditures would be incurred because of those enhanced powers 
of the superintendent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should an increase in resources be necessary as a result of 
these new powers, the necessary allocation of money would have to 
be sought by means of an appropriation bill because I was unable 
to find any provision for money in Bill S-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons I have determined that Bill S-3 does not 
require a royal recommendation and does not contravene the 
provisions of Standing Order 80(1).  I rule therefore that Bill 
S-3 is properly before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In making this or any other ruling, the Chair examines the 
arguments raised in light of the standing orders of the House and 
our precedents and practice developed over time.  Although I may 
not always come to the same conclusion as a member raising a 
point of order, I share with all of you the common objective of 
having deliberations in this House unfold in a fair and orderly 
fashion according to our rules and practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not rule for or against a member or a party.  The Chair 
rules to uphold the standing orders and the practice of this 
House.  In this task I continue to depend on the vigilance and 
assistance of all hon. members and I wish to thank the hon. 
opposition House leader for raising this particular matter in 
defence of the privileges of the House.

to introduce Bill C-312, an act to amend the Income Tax Act 
(percentage of gifts that may be deducted from tax). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to introduce a bill 
entitled an act to amend the Income Tax Act, percentage of gifts 
that may be deducted from tax.  This bill will put charitable 
donations on the same tax footing as political donations for the 
first $1,150.  Thereafter any tax credits for charitable 
donations would remain the same.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS COMPENSATION FUND 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to present a petition signed by a number of Canadians, 
including Canadians from my riding of Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that police officers and firefighters are required to place their 
lives at risk in the discharge of their duties on a daily basis 
and that the employment benefits of police officers and 
firefighters are often insufficient to compensate families for 
those police officers and firefighters who are killed in the line 
of duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also point out that the public mourns the loss of police 
officers and firefighters who are killed in the line of duty. 
They wish to support in a tangible way the surviving members of 
their families in their time of need. The petitioners therefore 
ask Parliament to establish a public safety officers compensation 
fund to provide benefits to families of public safety officers 
who are killed in the line of duty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to introduce several petitions today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first petition is signed by 124 Canadians from British 
Columbia. The petitioners are concerned about the government's 
handling of herbal remedies.  They feel that these remedies have 
been dealt with in a heavy handed manner.

<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition concerns the age of consent.  I would like to 
present this petition on behalf of my former colleague, the 
former member for Port Moody—Coquitlam, who was a key player in 
initiating the move to raise the age of consent from 14 to 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners request that Parliament affirm the duty of 
parents to responsibly raise their children according to their 
own conscience and beliefs and to retain section 43 of Canada's 
Criminal Code.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>JOY RIDING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
the final petition which I wish to present, the petitioners 
request Parliament to amend the Criminal Code to increase the 
minimum and maximum penalties for the offence of joy riding and 
to impose financial responsibility on the offenders and/or their 
parents or guardians whose negligence contributed to the 
commission of the offence.

<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to present two petitions to the House this 
morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first petition has to do with the multilateral agreement on 
investment. The petitioners state that the MAI is fundamentally 
flawed in so far as it seeks to protect the rights of investors 
without seeking similar protection for workers through binding 
core labour standards and that the MAI is anti-democratic in so 
far as it would be binding for 20 years, thus tying the hands of 
several Parliaments and future governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the petitioners call upon Parliament to reject the 
current framework of MAI negotiations and instruct the government 
to seek an entirely different agreement by which the world might 
achieve a rules based global trading regime which protects 
workers, the environment and the ability of governments to act in 
the public interest.

<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this petition concerns a ruling by the international court of 
justice on July 8, 1996 wherein the court stated unanimously that 
in accordance with article VI of the Nuclear Non-proliferation 
Treaty there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and to 
bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament 
in all its aspects under strict and effective international 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the petitioners pray and request that Parliament 
support the immediate initiation and conclusion by the year 2000 
of an international convention which will set out a binding 
timetable for the abolition of all nuclear weapons.

Speaker, I have two petitions to present to the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first petition deals with amendments to the Criminal Code 
and requests that the age of consent for sexual activity be 
raised from 14 years to 18 years of age. This petition is signed 
by 231 individuals from my riding and indeed from across Canada, 
Ontario westward.

dealing with herbal remedies and other nutritional supplements. 
The petitioners call for increased personal freedom without 
government interference to use herbal remedies and supplements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petition is signed by citizens from the area of 100 Mile

protection for workers through binding core labour standards. 
They also point out that the MAI is anti-democratic in so far as 
it will be binding for 20 years and ties the hands of several 
Parliaments and future governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners call on Parliament to reject the current 
framework of MAI negotiations and instruct the government to seek 
an entirely different agreement by which the world might achieve 
a rules based global trading regime that protects workers, the 
environment and the ability of government to act in the public 
interest.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with 
the member for Berthier—Montcalm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are debating an issue of the utmost importance for people 
in Quebec and Canada: that the House of Commons recognize the right of 
the Quebec people to decide their own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, Quebec society reached a consensus, denouncing the 
reference to the Supreme Court as an attempt by the federal government 
to subjugate the democratic will of the people of Quebec to a decision 
by the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers from every political stripe, both federalists and 
sovereignists, agree with this. 
As early as last December, the Pro-Démocratie group sent out a call to 
mobilize against this direct attack aimed at Quebec's democratic 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group is made up of influential people such as Jean-Claude 
Rivest, a Conservative senator, André Tremblay, a former constitutional 
adviser to Robert Bourassa, Pierre Paquette, the CSN general secretary, 
Claude Corbo, a former rector of the University of Quebec, the author 
Marco Miccone, and Monique Vézina, chair of the Mouvement national des 
Québécoises et des Québécois and former federal minister.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a historical consensus. I choose the word “historical” 
because, for more than 30 years, regardless of the political 
debate, there has always been a broad consensus on this crucial 
question within our society, a consensus that dates back to the 
very birth of Canada, based on the concept of two founding peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far back as 1977, René Lévesque made a clear statement on 
this right, in response to attacks from Prime Minister Trudeau: 
“There is no question of the future of the Quebec people being 
decided by anyone other than Quebeckers themselves”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That statement was reflected in a National Assembly resolution 
in response to a framework referendum act tabled by the federal 
parliament in 1978. 
That resolution, adopted in May 1978, read as follows: “That 
the members of this Assembly unequivocally and firmly reiterate 
that they subscribe to the principle that Quebeckers alone are 
entitled to decide their own constitutional future, in accordance 
with the dispositions and rules this Assembly sees fit to enact”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This historical consensus has been expressed on more than 
three occasions since that resolution: in 1980, at the time of the 
first referendum on sovereignty; in 1992, during the referendum on 
the Charlottetown Accord; and in 1995, during the last referendum. 
On three occasions, the federal government recognized this Quebec 
consensus by participating of its own free will in the referendum 
campaigns and by even accepting Quebec's consultation of its people 
in keeping with the Quebec referendum legislation at the time of 
the Charlottetown accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But now today we find the federal government, led by its Prime 
Minister, trying to deny this reality, this consensus shared in by 
all of the key stakeholders of Quebec society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why Claude Ryan and Daniel Johnson spoke out last week 
against this historical backtracking.  The two former leaders of 
the no camp in the last two referendums on sovereignty merely 
reiterated their support and deep attachment to Quebec and Canadian 
democracy. For them, and for millions of Quebeckers, the debate on 
the sovereignty of Quebec is not a legal question, but a political 
one, a question of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For them, and for millions of Quebeckers, in the debate on 
Quebec sovereignty the democratically expressed voice of the 
Quebec people is what counts, not the decision by nine federal 
government-appointed justices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For them, as for millions of Quebeckers, the debate on 
sovereignty goes far beyond a legal issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a huge 
distance between the people of Quebec and the federal government, 
which is trying to subjugate the sovereign will of a people to the 
will of a court of law, to submit our will to a constitution, which 
the National Assembly has never approved and which was imposed 
unilaterally on us by Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For democratic Quebeckers, the sovereign will of a people is 
above a constitution.  The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is 
doing his level best to subject the vote of Quebeckers to the 
Constitution of 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who believe in democracy know that people decide on 
constitutions; constitutions do not dominate people.  If there were 
no people, there would be no constitutions. 
We place the democratic voice of the people of Quebec above the 
Constitution of Canada, whereas the federal government and its 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs are trying to subject 
Quebeckers to the Constitution, which never received the approval 
of the National Assembly of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And they chose the supreme court to attack Quebeckers' 
fundamental right.  The supreme court, their supreme court, their 
rule of law, their outdated colonial pretensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was pointed out by an international law expert, Alain 
Pellet, the chair of the United Nations International Law 
Commission, we are dealing with one of the worst attempts by a 
government at political manipulation.  The Prime Minister is trying 
to use the supreme court as a political and partisan tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a frontal attack on the institutions of Quebec, on a 
fundamental right of the people of Quebec and especially on the 
principles of democracy dear to Canadians and Quebeckers both.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's motion will be very revealing.  We will finally see whether 
some members of this House are capable of backing their words with their 
actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991, the New Democratic Party said: “The New Democratic Party 
recognizes the right of Quebeckers to self-determination.  The New 
Democrats will respect the result of the democratic expression of this 
right.”  If the New Democrats are willing to respect the result of a 
referendum, it means that what matters to them is the ballot box and not 
the opinion of the nine Justices of the Supreme Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 also, the annual meeting of the Progressive Conservative 
Party of Canada passed the following resolution: “Be it resolved that 
the right of Quebeckers to self-determination be confirmed.”  Therefore 
Conservatives also recognized that it is a political question, since 
they acknowledged that it is the right of Quebeckers to decide their own 
future, not the right of nine justices appointed by the federal 
government.  New Democrats and Conservatives will therefore have to 
abide by the democratic will of their own rank-and-file members and 
support the motion introduced by the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, if Reform members vote against the motion it will not be 
the first time that they target Quebec.  Yesterday, they were denying 
Quebeckers the right to be candidates. 
Today, if they vote against the motion, they will deny Quebeckers the 
right to freely choose their own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the Liberals got involved in the referendum, they never 
explicitly recognized the right of Quebec to democratically decide its 
own future, but the Liberal Party of Quebec did so a number of times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message sent to the House of Commons through our motion is 
intended for all parliamentarians, in Quebec and in Canada. It is an 
unequivocal message that neither judges, the federal government or the 
rest of Canada will decide the future of a whole nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I must recall what my father, Jean Duceppe, said on 
June 25, 1990, in his last speech. He said, and I quote: “One thing is 
for certain. 
The future of Quebec will no longer be decided in Newfoundland, Manitoba 
or elsewhere. It will be decided in Quebec by the Quebeckers 
themselves”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the leader of the Bloc a simple 
question.  He mentioned people being beyond the Constitution, the 
voice of people being above the Constitution.  Could he tell the 
House where the principle of the rule of law enters into his 
thinking?  To make it more clear, will one of the governing 
principles in the new Quebec that he envisions be adherence to 
the rule of law? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the leader of the Reform 
Party for his question. I said in my speech that we saw, in 1982, that 
the rule of law is the rule of law of Canada and not of Quebec. Quebec 
was not asked whether it accepted the Constitution of 1982. All parties 
in Quebec, both federalist and sovereignist, never accepted that 
Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked to see how, for example, the leader of the 
Reform Party would have reacted if, in 1982, the Constitution had been 
patriated without Alberta's consent. Let us think about that for two 
minutes. I am convinced that the leader of the Reform Party would have 
denounced this unilateral action. Federalists have been coming here 
since 1867 to support unilateral actions, always to Quebec's detriment. 
We have seen them at work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, today, I am being asked whether, in a new Quebec, the rule of 
law would prevail. The answer is yes, and it will be a true rule of law, 
not a hypocritical one, like the federalists who knowingly violated 
Quebec's referendum law at their “love-in” on the eve of the referendum 
on October 30, 1995.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They came and told us: “we love you”, while as the same time 
violating the very principles of the referendum law. “We love 
you” in 
French, in English, in multicultural, in all languages. They cannot even 
speak French in Nagano. We have had enough of this hypocritical 
rhetoric, Mr. Speaker. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are debating this morning a most important motion, probably the most 
important that the House will be examining during the 36th Parliament, 
since it deals with the foundations of our political system, democracy, 
and aims at allowing a people to express itself freely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of this motion is to obtain the acknowledgment of the 
consensus reached in Quebec, according to which it is for Quebeckers to 
decide freely their own future. Faced with this Liberal government, 
which is trying to hijack democracy, we could not stand idly by. We 
could not allow what they are doing to democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every party in this House has a civic and political responsibility 
to rise against this dangerous political manoeuvering by Ottawa. As the 
Leader of the Bloc Quebecois said earlier, other parties in this House 
will have to make their position on this issue known. 
Reformers, Conservatives and New Democrats alike will have to take a 
stand on this most important issue, democracy. When the time comes to 
vote, we will see on which side those parties stand. Will they be on the 
government's side, which is trying to use the supreme court for 
political ends? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they vote against this principle, they will become accomplices 
and players in this machiavellian plan of the government. Their hands 
will be stained by their rejection of a democratic principle recognized 
throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Quebeckers have understood what is at stake. In the last 
several weeks, we have seen and heard men and women from every political 
background condemn the government for what it is trying to do. 
Since I have little time left, I will name only a few of them. Claude 
Ryan, chairman of the no committee during the 1980 referendum and former 
Leader of the Liberal Party of Quebec; Daniel Johnson, leader of the no 
committee in 1995 and present leader of the Liberal Party of Quebec; 
some senators, and among them Jean-Claude Rivest; former Conservative 
ministers, among them Monique Vézina; reporters who are not always on 
our side but who have vigorously condemned what the federal government 
is doing. There were also members of the church hierarchy, namely Mgr 
Blanchette, bishop of Rimouski; Cardinal Jean-Claude Turcotte, who 
delivered the same message, namely that it is for Quebeckers to decide 
their own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals, Conservatives, civilians, the secular clergy and members 
of religious orders, former ministers, senators and even present 
politicians, all have in common a sense of democracy. The consensus was 
reached in Quebec and it is still there. The government must take note 
of that. 
As Claude Ryan rightfully proclaimed on February 4, 1998, “democracy is 
more important than anything else”. The future of Quebec is not a legal 
but a political issue. It is not a legal debate for lawyers or judges 
but a democratic debate for the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the actions of the federal government, the way they use the 
Supreme Court of Canada, revolting and shocking. I am not the only one 
to think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just quote the Chairman of the International Law 
Commission of the United Nations, who is not a sovereignist and who is 
not beholden to Quebeckers. 
I doubt anyone will question his credibility and expertise in 
international law.  In a brief to the Supreme Court of Canada, he said 
that he was deeply disturbed and shocked by the partisan way the 
questions were asked and suggested that it was the duty of a court of 
justice to react to what clearly appears to be a blatant political 
manipulation attempt. This is quite something.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if Mr. Pellet had gone over all the decisions made by the 
Supreme Court of Canada throughout the years, he would have seen that 
this is not the first time Ottawa has tried to manipulate the Supreme 
Court judges on issues dealing with the Constitution and the division of 
powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we have a saying: “Don't bite the hand that feeds 
you.” 
The Supreme Court judges probably feel like saying: “Do not argue with 
the people who appoint and support you.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems like the learned and distinguished judges sitting on the 
Supreme Court of Canada, or rather the loyal servants of the central 
power, have always been trying to distort the 1867 Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ernest Lapointe, who was justice minister and attorney general of 
Canada in 1925, a long time ago, once made the following statement, to 
which, I think, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs should listen 
carefully. He said that the federal power is a creation of the 
provinces, and not the opposite. That is quite easy to understand. 
However, through the years, we have noticed that the Supreme Court 
judges, in collusion with the federal government, do not see things the 
same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another consensus in Quebec about the legal impasse we 
have reached. People feel that things have never been so bad, and it has 
been like this for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court is like the Tower of Pisa, because it always 
leans the same way. This is more than an image, it can be proven. You 
only have to review the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada to get 
the picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers cannot expect anything from the Supreme Court of Canada. 
It is biased when it comes to protecting Canada and centralizing powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the patriation of the Constitution, René Lévesque said, 
in 1982: “What it does for Quebec is that it simply makes it virtually 
impossible to resist centralization every time the federal government 
wants to impose it”. Unfortunately, history has proven him right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1982, we have witnessed a systematic consolidation of federal 
powers and prerogatives to the detriment of provincial constitutional 
jurisdictions. This tendency is not only because of Ottawa's political 
will, but mainly because of the many decisions of the Supreme Court of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A statistical look at all the cases heard by the Supreme Court that 
came from provincial appeal courts between 1987 and 1996 reveals a 
pretty astonishing fact. Almost six out of ten judgements from Quebec 
are reversed, whereas the national average for all the provinces is 
about four out of ten. It must be, on the part of Supreme Court judges, 
a special treatment for a distinct society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The year 1981 was a very dark moment in Canadian history since it 
is the year when the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in favour of the 
federal government's decision to unilaterally patriate the Constitution. 
That opened the door to the largest possible centralization of powers by 
federalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1981, judges of the Supreme Court said that the federal 
government had the right, despite the provinces' opposition, to ask 
London for a patriation that would affect provincial powers, but that it 
would violate a constitutional convention by doing so. 
Therefore, the unilateral patriation of the Constitution by Trudeau and 
by the present Prime Minister of Canada was viewed by the highest court 
in the country as legal but illegitimate under a constitutional 
convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, to render judgement on the three matters submitted them by 
the federal government, the judges will not even have to examine 
constitutional conventions because these questions are based solely on 
the Canadian Constitution of 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time really flies. You are signalling me that I have only one 
minute left. I will certainly have the opportunity at some later point 
to say more on this subject and to refer to several judgements, dealing 
with matters ranging from Hydro-Quebec to intergovernmental affairs, to 
show that, more and more, centralization of powers by the federal 
government is done with the blessing and the complicity of the Supreme 
Court.

motion on this allotted day: 
<A NAME="LINK43">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by adding the word “alone” 
between the words “Quebecers” and “to decide”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, a comparison of the French wording of the Bloc 
Quebecois' motion with its English translation in today's order 
paper reveals a number of what I hope are unintentional translation 
errors.  When reading it, it is obvious that the English and French 
texts differ substantially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interests of clarification, I have translated the 
motion for the House and I would like to table it so that both 
the English and French versions reflect our original intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm for tabling the correction already ruled in 
order by the Speaker of the House earlier this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment is also in order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les

speech by the member for Berthier—Montcalm and that of the leader 
of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is an historic occasion, as both speeches made very 
clear.  The appeal to representatives of other parties is important 
because there was a very significant parting of the ways in Canada 
in 1982, and there will be another even more obvious one today if 
the other elected parties in the House decide to vote against the 
motion and allow the Supreme Court's decision to take precedence 
over that of the Quebec people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I would like the member for Berthier—Montcalm to 
be able to make all Canadians and Quebeckers understand why 
democracy must take priority. 
What in particular should Quebeckers and Canadians understand about 
our motion so that their decision is a clear one and so that the 
Canadian public, which has seen three referendums since 1980, can 
be sure that here in the House, which is a symbol of democracy, all 
parties act with respect for this democracy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question. It gives me an opportunity to add something to the 
argument I was making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed the purpose of our motion is to have the House recognize the 
existence in Quebec of a very broad consensus on a very critical issue,

</I></B></P><P align=left>The mere fact that someone like Claude Ryan, a political opponent 
who headed the no committee in 1980, is now recalling the first 
referendum held on Quebec sovereignty and now speaking up to seek 
recognition for the very important principle of democracy, and siding 
with the likes of Lucien Bouchard and the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, 
that is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also when someone like Daniel Johnson, the present leader of the 
Quebec Liberal Party who will face the premier in a campaign debate in 
a few weeks or months, takes a stand on the critical issue of democracy, 
like he did this week, all the political parties in the House should 
understand that, by rejecting the Bloc's motion they would be rejecting 
a well-established consensus in the province. Moreover, for the 
Conservative Party and the NDP, it would mean going against resolutions 
duly adopted by their members during their convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for Quebeckers to decide their own future. It is not a legal 
issue but a political one. It is not up to judges and lawyers, but to 
the province's population that is of age to do so. Recent referendums 
demonstrated how the Quebec people deals with such issues properly, in 
an organized manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Answering this question gives me the opportunity to add a very 
precise point. I could not mention it in my statement for lack of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last few years, a new principle has become apparent in the 
Supreme Court of Canada's authoritative judgments. Someone said earlier 
that the questions raised by the Court created some fears. It is now 
clear that those fears were justified since the new constitutional 
jurisprudence does not simply deal with the division of powers; in some 
cases, it clearly asserts the constitutional intention to create a 
single country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That notion is nowhere to be found in the Canadian Constitution. 
That is the judges' interpretation. So much so that in her presentation 
in response to the amicus curiae's presentation to the Court on Quebec's 
right to secede, in a case now before the Supreme Court of Canada, the 
Attorney General of Canada declares that it is clearly the intent of the 
Constitution and the wish of the founding provinces to unite in a 
federation to create a single united dominion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that this is not the way Quebeckers see the situation. To 
me, the real meaning of the concept of founding provinces and of two 
founding peoples that existed at the time has been lost on the way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first let me thank the leader of the Bloc for giving me the opportunity 
to explain once again for the benefit of the Bloc the reasons why the 
Canadian government asked the supreme court for legal clarifications on 
a unilateral declaration of independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let me deplore the totally uncalled for charges both 
spokespersons of the Bloc made against one of the most respected courts 
in the world, whose decisions have been quoted by the major judicial 
authorities in the whole world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could give various quotations supporting the competence of the 
highest court in the land. I will give you only one, and I quote 
“I have 
been practising law for 20 years. 
I can testify that justice in Canada is in good hands and that we have 
judges who are responsible and aware of their obligations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was said on September 1, 1988, by a former federal minister 
who is now the Premier of Quebec, that is, the Hon. Lucien Bouchard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could add this, and again I am quoting him “As for me, I am for 
the rule of law in all cases. Rights must be respected. In a society 
where the rule of law applies, it is totally unthinkable, in particular 
for a first minister, to consider threatening brutal action against the 
rule of law”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was said on September 21, 1996, by the current Premier of 
Quebec. 
I want to do him a favour and prevent him from continuing to claim that 
he can, in fact, take dramatic action outside the rule of law, for this 
is indeed the purpose of our reference to the supreme court.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have never said the issue was to keep Quebeckers in Canada 
against their will, but the opposite. Our country would not be the same 
if it were not resting on the voluntary participation of all its 
constituent parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is at issue is the claim by the current Quebec government 
that, under the international law—and they must stop telling us that 
this is not a legal issue, as they are the ones who claim they have a 
right—they have the right to proclaim themselves the government of an 
independent state as a result of a referendum process they alone would 
have defined and interpreted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe there is no such right. When there is disagreement on a 
legal issue, the thing to do is to go to the highest court or to some 
court in order to get clarification, which everybody should welcome as 
a needed clarification in democracy. I say it is undemocratic to refuse 
to hear a legal clarification and ask people to make a decision without 
knowing the legal consequences of their decision and the legal context 
surrounding it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we say in Canada that we cannot keep part of our population 
against its clearly expressed will, it is not because we are bound by 
some international or Canadian legal requirement—at least that is 
what we believe and we will see eventually what the court's opinion is 
on this score—but because that is part of our political culture in 
Canada, part of our values. We feel that our country would not be the 
same, as I said earlier, if it did not resting on the voluntary 
participation of all its constituent parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue in this debate does not concern peoples' will, but the 
way peoples' will should be expressed. We think that this procedure 
should be crystal clear and transparent, and express this will in such 
a way that it will be obvious to all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a community in Canada does not want to be part of Canada any 
more, which clears the way for separation, a most unfortunate 
occurrence, this community would not proclaim itself to be a people and 
bring along other peoples against their will. Because if that were the 
case, I would ask Bloc members whether this is a purely political issue 
which has nothing to do with the law. In that case, they would surely 
agree with this motion: That this House recognize the Cree consensus 
that it is for the Cree to decide freely their own future. Are the Cree 
less of a people than Quebeckers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You can see that they would be the first say: “Oh, no; the Cree do 
not have this right. We have it, and, on top of that, the right to take 
the Cree along with us. But no, they do not have this right”. This is a 
double standard that has no moral basis and, in our opinion, no legal 
basis. We will see what the court has to say about the legal basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The political culture Quebeckers and all Canadians share has been 
summed up very ably by Ernest Renan, a French philosopher who said that 
a country is based on the clearly expressed will of a community to live 
together. We believe that Quebeckers, if the issue is clearly defined, 
will always say that want to go on sharing this common life inside a 
great federation they have contributed to, along with all the other 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have just said should have been obvious and readily 
acknowledged for a long time. 
On September 26, 1996, in explaining why we were referring this matter 
to the supreme court, the attorney general of the day, who is now the 
health minister, said in the House, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leading political figures of all the provinces and indeed 
the Canadian public have long agreed that this country will not be 
held together against the will of Quebeckers clearly expressed. And 
this government agrees with that statement. This position arises 
partly out of our traditions of tolerance and mutual respect but 
also because we know instinctively that the quality and the 
functioning of our democracy requires the broad consent of all 
Canadians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is not whether a democracy such as Canada can keep 
a population against its will. Of course, it cannot. 
The issue arises from the false claim by the Government of Quebec 
that it alone, in a unilateral fashion that changes according to 
its short term political interests, can decide the process that may 
lead to secession. Quebeckers as well as their fellow citizens 
across Canada would be dramatically affected by the break-up of our 
country. Everyone has the right to be certain that the process is 
lawful, mutually acceptable and fair to all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This position, which I just stated, as did my colleague in 
September 1996, is not new. It was stated by the Prime Minister of 
Canada a few days before the 1980 referendum, that is on May 14. The 
Right Honourable Pierre Elliott Trudeau said: “This is what we have to 
tell the yes side. If you want independence, if you want to vote yes, 
you will not achieve independence, because you have made it conditional 
on an association. If you want association, voting yes is meaningless, 
because it does not bind the other provinces, which may refuse to 
associate with you. 
This is the impasse in which this vague and confusing question put 
us”. 
These comments were made just before the first referendum, on May 14, 
1980. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Prime Minister, who is still our Prime Minister, say 
during the first referendum? This is what he said in this House on 
September 19, 1995: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And perhaps I could explain this to the Leader of the 
Opposition. I would like to quote to him from a document produced 
by the government of Mr. Lévesque, and of course he knows Mr. 
Lévesque. In 1977, in a document which appeared under the title: <I>La 
consultation populaire au Québec</I>, they said: “Referendums would be 
consultative in nature”. I agree. The document says: “The first 
imperative of politics in a democracy is a clear majority”. 
I agree. The document goes on to say: “The consultative nature of 
referendums”, they should have said referenda, in any case, “means 
that it would be unnecessary to include in the legislation special 
provisions on the majority required or the minimum participation 
rate”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could ask the Bloc Quebecois to comply with the Quebec 
Referendum Act. Again, on September 19, the Prime Minister added: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as everyone knows, I want to make sure that the 
Canadian constitution is complied with. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 20, the Prime Minister said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I answered all those questions yesterday and the 
day before. I even quoted from René Lévesque's program, in which he 
mentioned the concept of a referendum as consultation, the need to 
respect the laws and constitution of a country and the need for a 
clear majority. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we accept that Canada can be broken up, it is not because 
we are forced into it by law, it is because of a political culture 
peculiar to us, one which other highly respectable democracies do 
not share.  The Australian constitution states that it is an 
indissoluble federal Commonwealth.  Is Australia a bad democracy? 
Surely not, but according to the Bloc definition, it would be a 
pariah among nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 167 of the Belgian constitution states that “No 
devolution, no exchange, no adjunction of territory can take place 
except by virtue of legislation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Denmark blocked the separation of the Faeroe Islands after a 
50.7% yes referendum. Is Denmark a pariah among democratic nations? 
No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Czech Republic, “The territory of the Czech Republic 
forms an indivisible entity, the borders of which may be modified 
only by constitutional legislation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Finland, another multicultural nation, “The territory of 
the State of Finland is indivisible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a long list of democracies which have decided they were 
indivisible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, let me say that it is absurd to state that the 
decision can be made by one side alone.  The amendment is therefore 
absurd, because secession must be negotiable.  Quebeckers cannot 
decide the division of the debt on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Oh, yes, they can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B> I therefore ask the unanimous consent of 
the House to move the following amendment to the amendment: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by adding the following after 
the word “future”: “while respecting the rule of law and the 
principle of democracy for all”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have both a favour and a question to ask the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot conceive of a minister rising in this House to question 
the quality of democratic life in Quebec. You will agree with me that it 
takes some nerve to tell the Quebec people, who, not just once but twice 
already have overwhelmingly expressed their willingness to be involved, 
by reaching a consensus in a referendum process, in the process their 
government was asking them to participate in. I will not stand idly by 
while the minister rises in this House and questions the democratic 
quality of the consultations that have taken place in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is crystal clear to the Quebec people and that is that 
the minister is isolated, a lone wolf. His yearning for attacking the 
deep-rooted democracy in Quebec is doomed to failure because the likes 
of Claude Ryan and Claude Corbo, the former rector of UQAM, have stood 
up to him. They contend that the Supreme Court cannot be the one to 
decide because what this is about is the right of the Quebec people to 
freely make an informed decision the only way it can be done and that is 
through a referendum process initiated by the Quebec National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of this House, and government members in particular, 
who do not recognize this process violate Quebeckers' cherished right to 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the minister will have the honesty to 
recognize that he is alone and isolated in his position and that the 
dynamic forces of Quebec, everyone who took part in the various 
referendum processes these past few years, said no, it is not up to the 
Supreme Court to decide. Will this minister now rise in this House and 
admit that he stands alone, that he was wrong and that Quebeckers have 
the right to come to a decision through a referendum? That is what 
democracy is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B> Madam Speaker, we must comply with the 
provisions of the Quebec referendum act.  That is the bottom line. 
It provides that a referendum is consultation and that, after the 
consultation, the results are assessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is whether the government of all Canadians can fully 
assess the results.  That is the issue.  It seems that that is self 
evident in any democracy in the world.  It is a very basic 
principle of democracy that Quebeckers are also Canadians and that 
their possible loss of Canada can arise only from a decision that 
is clearly expressed and recognized as one.  It cannot be a 
decision the provincial government takes because at that point in 
time it has the option of withdrawing Quebec from Canada according 
to a procedure it alone has established and interpreted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member, who claims he believes in democracy, whether 
there is one democracy in the world that supported this procedure 
—I can hardly wait to hear—and whether there are many 
political parties in democracies that oppose the constitutional 
state and democracy for all.

Winnipeg—Transcona, on a point of order.

the intent of this procedure for questions and comments the idea 
is that the questions and comments not only be spread around the 
parties but, when this rule was created, the intention was that 
members of parties other than that of the person who just spoke 
would get precedence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like 
the minister to tell me whether he still does not find it a bit odd 
that his court justices were asked for their opinion as a last 
resort.  It is a bit like a divorce case.  This is about divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as if a couple had a difference in separation 
proceedings and one of the spouses told the other that his or her 
mother was going to settle the dispute.  It is a bit like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not think that his justices—appointed by him, paid 
by him and in his service—are not likely to be biased in the 
decision they are asked to give, a decision that should, if they 
have understood their role, suit their minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is upsetting the people of Quebec at the moment, 
and he did not resolve the problem in his speech, earlier.  I would 
like him to be a little more explicit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B>  Madam Speaker, I believe I answered the hon. 
member by quoting the words of his leader, the Premier of Quebec, who 
recognized the quality, in fact the great quality, of the Canadian 
justice system, including the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we have a court renowned throughout the world and one of the 
most often quoted.  The opinion it will give will be considered by 
judicial experts and courts all over the world, because it will carry 
weight in some other countries, something which will be considered as 
very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that the justices really want to be honest and 
competent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing that should be said is that we are not asking the 
court whether it is right or wrong to secede.  We are not asking the 
court to declare that Quebeckers should stay in Canada against their 
will. 
We are asking the court to tell us whether or not the PQ government, the 
present Quebec government, has any legitimacy when it argues that it has 
the right to proclaim itself the government of an independent state 
based on the results of a consultation of the people it alone 
established and interpreted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not confuse the issues for political reasons.  They 
are too important for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the court renders a decision favourable to the position of the 
Government of Canada, everybody will benefit from this information.  We 
are not going to make important decisions without that information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you are a union leader and you tell your members that you can 
launch an illegal strike, you are not acting in a democratic way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Government of Quebec is presently asking its citizens to 
do is precisely that—

the minister, but his time is up. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I just want to put it on 
the record that I do not believe that I was not seen.  I believe 
I was not chosen.  I believe the Chair had the right, after 
acknowledging that I was right in my interpretation of the rules, 
to move to recognize me and not the member for Chambly.  The 
Chair chose not to do that twice and I regret that very much.

Quebeckers.  We want to do everything we can to make sure that this 
future is as good as possible. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the motion before us is only half a motion.  The 
motion is really referring to the rights of Quebeckers but it 
does so without qualification.  It appears to imply that the 
right of Quebeckers to decide their own future is some absolute 
right but in reality, there are no such things as absolute 
rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition maintains that Quebeckers have the right 
to decide their own future but first of all in accordance with 
the rule of law.  In the case of Canada that means in accordance 
with the Constitution of Canada which is the supreme law of our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether or not the Bloc or the PQ like the Constitution of 
Canada, it is the law of the land.  That law contains no explicit 
provision for the secession of a province.  The only way a 
province could lawfully secede would be to pass a constitutional 
amendment which would then have to be carried in this House and 
approved by the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point that the current law does not provide for a unilateral 
secession seems patently self-evident to us, but if that point 
will gain more authority by a ruling of the Supreme Court of 
Canada, so be it.  That is why we favour the reference to the 
supreme court to get a determination on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Bloc will say that they do not intend to respect 
the rule of law with respect to this point, the right of a 
province to secede, but I would plead with the Bloc members to 
tread very carefully on that ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once you say—particularly once lawmakers say—that you respect 
the rule of law except on this point or that, you are opening a 
door which you may never be able to shut.  And if you teach your 
people that there are exceptions to the rule of law and that when 
they disagree with the law they should feel free to break it with 
impunity rather than to change it, you are starting down a very 
dangerous road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I asked the hon. leader of the Bloc after his speech 
whether he believed in the rule of law within a new Quebec.  He 
said yes.  Yet if the Bloc teaches the people of Quebec that 
there are exceptions to the rule of law, what will be the answers 
of such members when some citizens of Quebec say to them down the 
road “We do not like your law.  We intend to break your law and 
we declare that we have a right to unilaterally break it because 
you taught us that this is permissible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another qualification on the Quebeckers' right to decide their 
own future is the principle of democratic consent.  Reform has 
been quite clear on this point.  We want Quebeckers to remain in 
Canada.  We fervently desire to unite Canada for the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that Canada can be united by reforming the federation 
on the principle of equality and through a rebalancing of the 
powers.  But we have also stated that if a majority of Quebeckers 
responding to a fair question in a fair referendum process were 
to decide in favour of secession, the Government of Canada would 
then have an obligation to enter into negotiations of terms and 
conditions of secession, terms and conditions on which Canadians 
would then have to pass judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the Bloc Quebecois members rejoice too much at our 
endorsation of this principle of democratic consent, let me make 
clear that it is a two-edged sword.  If we affirm that Quebeckers 
have a right to decide their own future in a referendum, that 
right should apply to every Quebecker including those who see 
their future as part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ballot for a referendum on secession to be fair to all 
concerned should bear two questions.  And I do not mind saying 
what the wording of those questions should be: Should Quebec 
separate from Canada and become an independent country with no 
special legal ties to Canada, yes or no?  If Quebec separates 
from Canada, should your community separate from Quebec and 
remain part of Canada, yes or no? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a majority vote on the first question on separation is 
sufficient to trigger the negotiation of a secession, a majority 
vote on the second question in a particular district or 
municipality would trigger the partition of Quebec, a change in 
the boundaries of Quebec in accordance with the right of 
Quebeckers, in this case a minority of Quebeckers, to determine 
their future. In other words if Canada is divisible, as long as 
the process employed respects the rule of law and the principle 
of democratic consent, then Quebec is divisible by the 
application of the same processes and the same principles.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying it is because the secession of Quebec would 
not only diminish Canada but would also diminish Quebec, it is 
because both Canada as a whole and Quebec as an entity would 
ultimately be injured by secession and partition, that we search 
for a third way beyond separation and status quo federalism.  We 
earnestly plead with Quebeckers to consider that third way and to 
generate a new consensus around that third option as the best 
guarantee of a secure and a prosperous future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, we 
welcome this opportunity to debate this motion in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take the opportunity to ask a few questions of the 
leader of the Reform Party to understand clearly where he stands 
on some issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote an article written in the Calgary 
<I>Sun</I> on October 30, 1995 by his principal adviser, a Mr. 
Ezra Levant, whom we see here almost on a daily basis in the 
House of Commons.  He wrote an article entitled “Ten reasons to 
vote yes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to offer the opportunity today to the leader of the 
Reform Party to clarify the position because I understand this is 
the position of the Reform Party of Canada.  And if it is not, 
then the leader of the Reform Party has a choice.  He can either 
fire his principal adviser who is presenting this position and 
has not backed down or it is the position of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote what Mr. Levant says in the name of the Reform 
Party on why they should vote yes in the referendum.  His second 
reason is to end bilingualism and multiculturalism.  In paragraph 
3 he states “If we kicked out Quebec, we might then have the 
fortitude to tackle Canada's other ethnic separatists, 
natives”—natives are ethnic separatists according to 
him—“demanding their First Nations”.  He then goes on to say 
“Next would be the National Action Committee on the Status of 
Women” and then radical environmentalist groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Levant in the name of the Reform Party goes on.  In 
paragraph 4 he states that we should “end the corruption of 
Parliament.  For decades, Quebec's largest export to Ottawa has 
been politicians who bring old style patronage to Parliament.  We 
won't miss the politics of road paving”.  I see the Reform 
members agreeing with that. That is the attitude they have shown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a second short question.  The leader of the Reform Party 
in 1990 at the opening of Reform's offices in Montreal said “If 
Reform Party MPs were elected in Quebec, they would work for 
separatism if that is what their constituents wanted”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Reform Party leader explain to us how he conciliates 
his position of populism that says they represent strictly the 
views of their MPs?  How can he explain that he would accept that 
there would be Reform MPs in Ottawa representing separatism? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from the July 21, 1994 Toronto <I>Star</I>:  “In 
our view the wishes of the constituents ought to prevail in 
determining how the members vote.  If we get a member of 
Parliament in Quebec, that member will be expected to represent 
Quebec's interest”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are two straightforward questions for the leader of the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Madam Speaker, first of all I find 
it incredible that the leader of the Conservative Party would put 
his focus in this debate on articles taken from the Calgary 
<I>Sun</I> and the Toronto <I>Star</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one was written by Mr. Levant long before he worked 
for us.  These positions do not represent the position of the 
Reform Party, as the hon. member knows.  But it gives us an 
opportunity to declare what our positions are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have made it abundantly clear that our principal position is 
to want this country united like it has never been united before 
and to put an end to the kind of division that has been brought 
about by old line party politicians practising on this national 
unity issue and making a career out of it for 30 years and 
leaving us in the position where we are at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we believe that the key to uniting this country is to 
find a new balance of powers between the federal and provincial 
governments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have practical evidence from the pollsters and from our own 
experience that it is the one concept for changing the federation 
for which there is growing support inside Quebec and outside 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the principle on which we believe the country can be 
united.  We are going to do everything in our power to 
communicate the rebalancing of powers in which we believe inside 
Quebec and outside Quebec and to provide a third option for 
Quebeckers and not the status quo federalism that has been 
represented by this party and that party for 30 years and not the 
separation of the country advocated by that party, many of which 
members were recruited into politics by that party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, if 
there is one constant for the NDP concerning the motion before the 
House today, it is our steadfast support, since our founding in 
1961, for cooperative federalism, which reflects the duality of 
Canada and the distinct place of Quebec within the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Tommy Douglas said in 1967 with respect to the first report 
of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Constitution must create equality between 
Canada's English and French speaking communities, as well as 
the conditions necessary for both these communities to have 
equality of opportunity. 
In order for there to be such equality, special arrangements 
must be concluded with the Government of Quebec in order to 
negotiate a new division of responsibilities between the 
federal and provincial governments. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since our founding convention in 1961 the NDP has been very 
clear in its support of the notion of Canada as two founding 
peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  It sounds like debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  It is debate.  Pay attention.  I spoke

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  No respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  In any event, what I was saying was 
that since the inception of the NDP in 1961 we have been very 
clear in our perception of Canada as two founding peoples, with 
the understanding that we have other founding peoples in Canada 
in terms of our aboriginal people.  We have gone on from that 
time to accept both in reality and in debate various forms of 
asymmetrical federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember in the debate on patriation—Madam Speaker, if this 
is so important to members of the Bloc, maybe they could have 
their caucus meeting outside the House so I can hear myself 
think.   I am talking about you, Bellehumeur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Order, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  We have traditionally supported forms 
of asymmetrical federalism and we have traditionally supported 
self-determination for Quebec.  Many of the resolutions that were 
quoted earlier by members of the Bloc in their opening speeches 
reflect accurately positions taken by the NDP in the past and 
positions which are held to this day with respect to the ultimate 
ability of Quebeckers to freely decide their own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not think there was any dispute about this.  I do not 
really understand Bloc members when they say there is a new 
consensus in Quebec around this, that Claude Ryan has suddenly 
done something new.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that in all of Canada, in the referendums of 1980 
and 1995 and in the debate that surrounded those referendums, 
there was always the acknowledgement by the prime ministers of 
the day and by other political leaders that in the final analysis 
the future of Quebec within Canada was a political question, not 
a legal question, and that it would be up to the people of Quebec 
to decide their future within Canada.  Any attempt to detract 
from this principle is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions at issue, which unfortunately the Bloc did not try 
to clarify in the language of its motion, are what is the role or 
purpose of the supreme court in this matter and what is the role 
of the rule of law in this matter.  There are process questions 
that need to be answered.  The Bloc did itself a disservice by 
not trying to address some of the process questions in the 
motion.  I heard some of the members address such concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a reference to referendum and a clarity of process, et 
cetera, but they are asking a lot of us and a lot of other 
members of Parliament—and we may yet do it—to vote for a motion 
that leaves questions of process up in the air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is our concern.  It is not an anxiety about or an objection 
to the principle that Quebeckers might freely decide their future 
and someday might decide to leave the country.  We think that 
would be a tragedy of historic proportion, but we have never said 
that Quebeckers should be kept in the country against their will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, just as Quebec entered the country by negotiation it is 
not unreasonable to make the claim that Quebec, having chosen 
freely in a clear and fair process to leave Canada, would have to 
leave Canada by negotiation with the rest of Canada.  The rest of 
Canada would have some say in how that would happen, not whether 
it would happen.  That seems to me to be only fair, particularly 
when we consider that there are outstanding questions with 
respect to the self-determination of aboriginal people within 
Quebec, a territory that was not a part of Quebec when it entered 
Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are reasonable questions.  They are not raised as threats 
or in any way to diminish the freedom of the people of Quebec to 
decide their future.  They are raised as reasonable questions of 
fairness and process which any Bloc Quebecois member would raise 
in any other context, were they not absolutely preoccupied with 
making the political point about what is happening at the supreme 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand their objection to the way in which the referral to 
the supreme court could be and sometimes appears to be used by 
the federal government in an inappropriate way.  When I say that 
there are questions of process that need to be decided, it is not 
a blanket approval of the way the Liberal government is dealing 
with the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the rant against the supreme court by the hon. 
member from the Bloc.  It made me regret all the more that we 
were not able to get the Meech Lake accord through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the objects of the Meech Lake accord was to change the 
supreme court structurally so as not to have it subject to such 
accusations, however inaccurate they may be, to change the 
supreme court structurally by changing the way the supreme court 
was chosen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would have been three judges chosen by Quebec and the rest 
of the judges would have been chosen from provincial lists.  All 
the provinces, not just Quebec, could have had more of a feeling 
that a court which finally decides federal-provincial matters 
would be a court that all levels of government participated in 
creating through the appointment process.

a lot of other things included in that accord, we have the 
political situation we have today.  We have my colleagues in the 
Bloc, whose genesis is in the defeat of the Meech Lake accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am inviting my colleagues in the Bloc to have more to say 
throughout the day about process, about how they see the 
principle which they have expressed in this motion with which we 
agree being embodied in process and about how many of the 
questions raised in terms of process will be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the people of Canada feel they have some part to play 
in this, not in instructing Quebec or in keeping Quebec within 
the country against its own will.  But, if Quebec makes a 
decision to leave Canada, they want a role to play in determining 
the nature of the separation, how it will happen and what the 
relationship will be after separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leads us to the topics of partnership, sovereignty 
association and all the things in which presumably the rest of 
Canada would be involved if it ever came to that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to begin by thanking our colleague from the New 
Democratic Party for his open-minded words with respect to Quebec. 
We recognize the New Democratic Party historically, but I would 
still like to ask him whether he, his fellow parliamentarians and 
his political party are aware of the gravity of the situation and 
the ramifications of a reference to the Supreme Court of everything 
having to do with the constitutional question, which has dragged on 
for 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, are the members of the New Democratic Party and 
members in the House generally—and I address Quebeckers across the 
way—aware that this whole process denies the existence of the 
Quebec people and instead identifies Quebec as just another 
province? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, are they aware that the whole constitutional question, 
which has dragged on for 30 years, now rests in the hands of nine 
judges whose allegiance is to the Parliament of Canada and to 
Canadian institutions, which appoint them and pay their salaries 
without consulting the provinces, particularly Quebec, and that 
these judges will soon be asked to rule on the future of Quebec and 
its democratic institutions as they relate to a Constitution that 
the Parliament of Quebec has never recognized and that it in fact 
denounced in 1982? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying, and we would like to hear the New 
Democratic Party's frank view on this, is that the people of Quebec 
alone have the right to make this decision, because they are a 
people.  What is happening here is that the existence of the people 
of Quebec is being denied.  Do the people of Quebec alone have the 
right to decide their future? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is conceivable that I 
and others outside the Bloc Quebecois either do not appreciate 
the gravity of what is before the supreme court or have a 
different view of the gravity of what is before the supreme 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that whatever is before the supreme court in 
no way impinges upon the ultimate political freedom of Quebec to 
determine its future.  My understanding is that what is before 
the supreme court has to do with process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think members of the federal government, and perhaps all of 
us, are playing catch up.  For the longest time there was 
sloppiness on the federalist side with respect to what would 
happen if there were a vote for separation.  It was a bit of a 
parlour game.  We had a referendum.  We had debates.  We had 
whatever.  But there was a confidence on the federalist side that 
the separatists would never win such a referendum. 
That confidence bore a certain laziness with respect to asking 
questions about what we would do if the separatists ever won the 
referendum.  It was always assumed that they would not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1995 when separation was that close, all of a sudden 
the people on the federalist side woke up and said that it was 
not a parlour game any more, that it was not just some kind of 
ongoing Canadian amusement.  It was real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we need to ask ourselves more fundamental questions than 
we have asked ourselves in the past about how this would 
transpire if in some future referendum there was a victory for 
separation. I think that is in part the genesis of the supreme 
court reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to make it clear that in our minds it is a legal 
thing.  It has nothing to do with the ultimate political question 
of how Quebec is either to be kept in Canada of its own free will 
by arriving at new arrangements that satisfy the desire of 
Quebeckers to feel they are being recognized and treated as a 
distinct or unique society within Quebec or, having failed to do 
so, Quebec leaving Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the answer for that from the point of view of the NDP is 
to rebuild the social democratic consensus that once existed in 
this country.  Part of the problem is that for the past 10 or 15 
years we have been governed from the right and we had a history 
of being governed from the left of centre federally. That is 
partly what kept the country together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a diminution of our national institutions, of the 
ties that bind us thanks to free trade.  I always remember during 
Meech Lake that the Tories were singing the praises of Canada 
while they were destroying it with free trade, deregulation and 
privatization. Had they given some thought to their other 
policies, maybe they would have been able to achieve what they 
set out to achieve. Instead they were destroying the country on 
one hand and trying to save it on the other.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, it is an 
honour and a pleasure for me to join in this debate on the opposition 
motion moved by the Bloc Quebecois on an issue that has taken up much of 
the time and energy of Canadian politicians for the last 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first want to deal with this motion. The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House recognize the consensus in Quebec that it is 
for Quebeckers— 
</UL>
<and as amended: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and for them alone to decide their own future. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue that my party has already dealt with several 
times. It was the subject of two referenda in our recent history, in 
1980 and 1995. Madam Speaker, I have no problem in telling you that my 
party, my caucus, can support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not create a major problem for us. But I also want to be 
very frank because, on this issue, the important thing is that the truth 
be told. The problem in this debate is not what the motion says, but 
what it does not say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the words in the motion that people might object to. It 
is everything surrounding the motion, including its impact and how some 
people would want to proceed in the event of a break-up. The real 
problem is there. Yes, the motion is fine and we can support it. We do 
not have any problem with it in principle. It does not create a major 
problem for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But at the same time, it leads us to ask other questions and we can 
say right away, because we do not want to give the wrong impression, 
that we have few answers. This is part of the problem. And this also 
must be said frankly. This is always in the spirit of portraying things 
as they are. It is commonly known that we are opposed to a Supreme Court 
reference as proposed by the federal government.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, it bears repeating that a reference to the Supreme 
Court by the federal government, or to a court of appeal by provincial 
governments, is always an exceptional measure. It is very seldom used, 
and with great caution, by governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And for good reason. Dragging the courts into political debates is 
not without consequences. There will be very real consequences for the 
courts and for Canada if we privatize, if I may be a bit ironic about 
this, if we privatize political issues by referring them to the Supreme 
Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason why we never thought this is a good idea is that the 
Supreme Court will not be in a position to tell us anything we do not 
already know on the substance of the matter. Legally, since we are 
always in a society that abides by the rule of law, the Canadian 
constitution does not provide for the breaking-up of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the legal standpoint, if we ever have a scenario of 
separation, we will be confronted with a legal vacuum, a kind of black 
hole. I keep repeating this, and it bothers quite a few people. My 
friends in the Bloc are already reacting to this. Whenever I talk about 
this, people laugh, but it is just the plain truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> Not again. You are funny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B> You find that funny, but Quebeckers have to 
suffer the consequences and I do not think they find it as funny. That 
is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In international law, we have to say things like they are. I cannot 
help but laugh when I hear people right and left, people from both 
sides, refer to the fundamental principles of international law. What I 
would like to know is who is going to enforce the decisions made in 
international law? Who are we going to refer to? On what authority will 
we decide to implement those decisions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In international law, there is no rule. I am sorry, but the way we 
see it, I will try to be accurate—one cannot say that there is no rule, 
because there are some, but the way we see it, where someone would say: 
“Here in a legal principle, a decision, which we will 
implement”, that 
is not how things work. There is a sea of principles in which we could 
swim for ever and ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another rule. Ultimately might is right, the strongest 
wins out. That is the plain truth. I will not elaborate on that because, 
needless to say, that is not a scenario anyone would wish for. It is 
simply a question of common sense. 
The Supreme Court could come back to us with that option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What upsets me the most, however, is that with this kind of 
reference to the Supreme Court we tend to recognize, to say publicly 
that the breakup of our country is so likely that the head of the 
Government of Canada and the government itself have come to the 
conclusion that it is a possibility to be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be honest and realize that, in every type of 
relationship, if we keep talking about a breakup, it will eventually 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing holds true for a country, spouses, or business 
partners. I think that the current government is not keeping the 
referendum commitments made in 1995 when it focuses on the breakup 
scenario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have brought forward a number of ideas to help move the debate 
along. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the 1995 referendum we have made it very clear that we 
oppose this supreme court reference.  We think it is a bad idea. 
By the way, we certainly acknowledge that there are great number 
of Canadians outside of Quebec who think this is a good idea and 
I know that.  However, I just think a lot of people are living 
under the illusion that this is going to solve a problem when it 
will not.  It is a political problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of things we can do.  I have written to the 
prime minister and the premiers at least twice in the last year 
making some constructive suggestions on behalf of my party and 
the men and women in my party who believe there are solutions and 
a consensus at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, we feel frustrated because we happen to know that there 
is a very real will for change in the country. It is reflected in 
all parts of the country, in Alberta, Ontario, the Atlantic and 
Quebec.  This will for change is compatible with what governments 
in Quebec have also been seeking for the last 30 years. 
It is within our reach if we have a leadership that is able to 
understand it and seize that opportunity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the things I have written about to the premiers and the 
prime minister are rebalancing the federation and limiting 
federal spending power. I have recommended some institutional 
changes.  Our country has matured to the point where we can 
change some of our institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party and I believe there should be a covenant, that we 
should renew the social and economic union of Canada. Under a new 
institution, a covenant, we could agree to national standards in 
health care for example.  We could make a commitment to delivery 
of services to people.  We could put the focus on the services we 
are rendering rather than on the governments that deliver the 
services.  Through such an agreement we could install predictable 
financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is probably the most important example.  Over the 
last few years our health care system has been slashed in its 
funding.  It is broken and needs to be fixed.  Here is a good 
place to start for the sake of our parents, our grandparents and 
our kids who deserve a good health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senate reform and the recognition of Quebec are among the ideas 
we put forth.  We have had the worst of debates on these issues. 
The Reform Party has gone out there cynically and for 10 years it 
has lived off of denouncing Quebec and the idea of distinct 
society.  It ran on that issue during the last election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the concept of unique character is on the table.  The 
minister and the Liberal government have said that unique 
character and distinct society mean exactly the same thing.  It 
is intriguing to us how the Reform Party will swallow itself 
whole on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  How profound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  The Reform member says how 
profound.  I can only regret that he and the people in his party 
have been an instrument of division on this issue.  I quoted an 
article from the principal adviser of the Reform Party of Canada 
and its leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  He was a college student at the time and 
did not work for the party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  One of the members said that he was 
a student at the time and did not work for the party, so we are 
getting some denials which is important.  Mr. Levant said:

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote three of them: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eliminate bilingualism and multiculturalism—.If we kicked out 
Quebec, we might then have the fortitude to tackle Canada's other 
ethnic separatists:  Natives demanding their “First Nations”. 
Next would be the National Action Committee on the Status of 
Women.  Then the radical environmentalist groups. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth reason he gives to kick Quebec out is to end 
corruption in Parliament. Is it any wonder that we are where we 
are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we have no problem with this motion.  It is the 
consequences surrounding it and what is not said in the motion 
that we have great difficulty with. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is with great 
satisfaction that we heard the leader of the Conservative Party say that 
he has no problem supporting the motion put forward by the Bloc 
Quebecois. But he has questions about what the motion does not say. He 
speaks about reality and truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind him of a reality that is still very present, 
namely that of the constitutional deadlock. For thirty years all the 
political parties in Quebec have been asking for radical changes to the 
Canadian Constitution. Every single party was calling for it. At the 
time, we were hoping to be able to stay within Canada, to live happily 
under this constitution and to have the respect we deserve. 
Unfortunately, English Canada was acting as if Quebec did not want to 
lose Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, Canada has never acted as if it did not want to lose 
Quebec. The roles have always been reversed, we were never taken 
seriously. Even the Charest report, the author of which just spoke in 
this House, gave all powers to Ottawa. 
The federal government did not listen to Quebec. It did not listen to 
the people's demands. From what it said, it looked like it understood 
us, but through its majority, it kept imposing its federalist and 
centralizing designs on us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens in reality when a law is abusive or unfair? People 
will not obey that law. We saw it with cigarette smuggling. Because 
taxes were too high, very few people obeyed that law. The government did 
not take too long to understand what was going on and changed it. It 
lowered taxes so that people could be happy and proud to obey that law. 
That was not done with the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers have been saying for 30 years that they are unhappy with 
the Constitution and that they want changes. Each time Quebeckers said 
yes to Canada, in the two referendums, they did so because they truly 
hoped substantial changes would be made to the Constitution. But they 
were duped. Such changes were never made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada got a wake-up call when 49.4% of Quebeckers voted yes in the 
last referendum. Canadians now realize, as the NDP member said, that it 
is no longer a game. Quebeckers mean business. If it were to become 
reality tomorrow, Canada might wonder whether it is prepared to lose 
Quebec. As for Quebec, it has already done its thinking, and an 
increasing number of Quebeckers realize that they are not happy to live 
in this country under current conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the rest of Canada want to force Quebec to stay, even if it is 
not happy, to justify the notion of unity, as the leader of the Reform 
Party said? Is this the case? 
Do they want to force Quebec to stay against its will, because it is 
important to look united? This is the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Conservative leader tell me whether he agrees that this is 
the reality that makes us want to become a sovereign Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to reply to the 
hon. member for Joliette and debate with him. First of all, not to 
flatter him, I think I can detect in his remarks a cri du coeur from 
someone who does not want Canada to break up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> That is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B> He says that is right. He may well be 
reflecting the views of many Quebeckers who want this country to work, 
who want Canada to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> The reality is that it does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B> They want it to work. The hon. member knows 
as well as I do—and we are going to tell it like it is—that the 
majority of constituents in his riding would like Canada to work. That 
would be their first choice. 
He knows it and I know it. It is important to point it out and it is 
important for those outside Quebec to hear this because we do not want 
to leave them with the impression that having a sovereignist government 
in Quebec means that a majority of Quebeckers are in favour of Canada 
breaking up. They are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be more specific. The great majority of francophones in 
Quebec, those who vote and are concerned in this debate, feel profoundly 
attached to Canada and want the Canadian system to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree with the hon. member for Joliette, however, in that I 
do not assess my country on the simplistic basis of the 
Constitution. I think of my country, Canada, with 300 years of 
history behind it and 300 more ahead, as more than a bunch of 
constitutional amendments. It is a partnership that was 
established between English and French-speaking Canadians in the 
early days of our country. That is how our language and culture 
were able to live on. That is how the British Empire at the time 
was able to keep this piece of land in North America. This is a 
partnership that evolved into a federation, an economic and 
social partnership reflecting the values shared by everyone who 
live here, whether French-speaking or English-speaking. That is 
the context in which I set my assessment of my country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I will conclude by saying that, as I see it, 
regardless of our constitutional failures, anglophones and francophones 
alike view Canada as a great success that I care for, both for myself 
and for my children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to have my turn to speak to the Bloc Quebecois motion 
before the House today, which reaffirms, since the consensus is 
nothing new in Quebec, that it is for Quebeckers to decide freely 
their own future. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, if I may, I shall make a brief comment on the 
words of the leader of the Conservative Party in which he rejoices 
at constitutional failures.  Many conclude each time there is a 
failure that the system, at a certain point, is no longer 
changeable.  That is what has led a growing number of Quebeckers to 
back sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many have done so because it strikes them as natural for a 
people to have all the tools necessary to manage and control its 
own future.  Others came to that conclusion because of 
circumstances, when the inability of the present political system 
to meet their aspirations became evident, whether in accordance 
with the formula developed by Robert Bourassa around the distinct 
society or some other formula. 
They found themselves with the door shut in their faces, not only 
closed but locked as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have moved from one constitutional failure to another.  The 
difference between the hon. member for Sherbrooke and members over 
here is that we realize that, at some point, the thing must come to 
an end. Discussions cannot go on forever. I personally do not want 
to be here when I am 55, still talking about the latest 
constitutional failure, and about what ought to be done in the next 
round of negotiations in order to avoid another failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Joliette said that this has been going on 
for 30 years.  I believe that 30 year point was reached 5 years 
ago.  Now we are up to 35.  We have been talking about it so long 
that we have stopped keeping track of the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to this federal strategy, what do we have in front 
of us now?  What is comes down to, finally, is who is entitled to 
decide the future of Quebeckers and of the Quebec people. 
Ottawa's strategy, and the federal government's in particular, is 
clearly not unanimous.  The Conservative Party clearly said it did 
not support them.  For a number of reasons, we can believe that the 
New Democratic Party would not support them either, following the 
resolutions passed at its political conventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future for the federal government has to be defined by 
others besides Quebeckers.  By whom?  By the justices of the 
supreme court?  By people in the other provinces?  Because in the 
end, the question they are putting to the supreme court is: if 
Quebeckers cannot do it, who can? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see clearly where they are leading us.  Their 
traditional constitution amending formula involving provincial 
consensus.  In the end, it means subjecting the future of the 
people of Quebec to the approval of a province, and I will let you 
decide on that. 
But you can clearly see that it would make no sense for the people 
of Prince Edward Island, and I have nothing against them, or the 
people of Newfoundland, Alberta or Saskatchewan, to have a veto 
over Quebec's future.  It makes no sense.  There is no basis for 
it, and on the very face of it, I think it should not even be 
considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is Ottawa's strategy?  They are playing both horses.  On 
one hand there is the hard line of the minister, the one who told 
us during the last referendum campaign that Quebeckers had to be 
made to suffer to prevent the recurrence of such a situation, where 
we get a bit excited at expressing our deepest hopes. 
It is now implementing its plan, on the one hand toying with the concept 
of partition, and on the other asking the supreme court to rule the 
whole sovereignty issue illegal within the present constitutional 
framework; it keeps on making incendiary declarations right, left and 
centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the provinces are led to believe there might be a 
glimmer of hope for some changes. This is the kind of line the leader of 
the Progressive Conservative Party keeps on pushing, changes are 
possible. What does all this mean? Let us have a look. In Quebec, nobody 
is talking about the Calgary declaration. And yet, this is the great 
constitutional reform process Canada is currently promoting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In about seven paragraphs, it sets out Quebec's uniqueness. 
A statement which is promptly watered down on four or five occasions by 
the fact that provinces are all said to be equal. These are profoundly 
contradictory pronouncements. If Quebec is truly distinct, meaning 
different, it should be given, through a formula yet to be determined, 
the tools to shape its own future. But the declaration is silent on this 
point. Quebeckers are told “You are unique, but you will be treated like 
everybody else”. So we are unique, period. End of story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is hard to sell. It is done in an underhanded way, on the 
Internet, and through a small questionnaire stuffed in an ad-bag so that 
nobody can see it. It is all hush-hush, but it will be passed by 
Parliament, possibly on a Friday afternoon, so that people do not talk 
too much about it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this way, they could say to Quebeckers, but not as loudly as 
during the referendum “See, we still love you”, to allow Daniel Johnson, 
the federalists leader in Quebec—officially, in any case—to 
campaign in Quebec and say that there is a willingness elsewhere to make 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each time, they start again with a lower offer than the previous 
time. We are part of a distinct society, an interpretative clause in the 
Constitution, a different sharing of powers and the Meech Lake accord 
that included a number a things that were given to Quebec. Of course, 
that did not respond to the aspirations of all Quebeckers, but there 
were some elements in there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, it did not work, we started off with less the next time, 
Quebeckers were given less. Then there was the Charlottetown accord, 
rejected by all Quebeckers. Since this did not work, the federal 
government tried giving even less. Then they wonder why there are more 
and more sovereignists in Quebec or people who have drawn the conclusion 
that this system does not work. They want it both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, our dear intergovernmental affairs minister has launched a 
philosophical debate in all this. He is a former university professor 
who wants to solve a deep academic issue, that is whether democracy 
exists within the law or the law exists within democracy. This is his 
pet subject and he wants to have his argument examined and validated by 
the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very foundations of democracy, and all of us here are products 
of democracy, provide that it is up to people to decide their future. It 
is not up to us to use all kinds of constraints, to put people in a 
straitjacket and tell them they cannot decide their future. What does a 
unilateral declaration of sovereignty imply? It implies that Quebeckers 
would, after an eminently democratic exercise—that is a successful 
referendum in which a majority of people would have supported 
sovereignty—decide to start the process to achieve sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a stage in this process about which Ottawa is silent. We 
sovereignists have always said, in good faith, that we will negotiate 
with Ottawa. In fact, a period of one year was even provided for this in 
a draft bill tabled in the National Assembly. 
A transition mechanism was defined. Ottawa is assuming it will not work 
because the unilateral declaration of sovereignty will come at the end 
of the negotiations if an agreement is not reached. So, Ottawa starts 
from the premise that we will not be able to reach an agreement, that we 
will not want to negotiate, etc.. There is some bad faith here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa admits it would not respect the democratic will of 
Quebeckers. Every now and then, the minister tries to tell us that he 
would recognize that will, provided it is expressed within the law. It 
is not true, because the minister would try to define how he would 
negotiate with Quebec. He would not be preparing the next stage, he 
would be preparing the first stage. I have no problems with Canadians 
discussing how negotiations should be conducted with Quebec, or who 
should represent them. I realize the Liberal Party has a problem, and I 
would be very surprised to see the current Prime Minister negotiate on 
behalf of Canada. 
They will not dare debate this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strategy is obvious: getting a Supreme Court decision stating 
that the Canadian constitution does not allow a unilateral declaration 
of independence on the part of Quebec, and that such a declaration would 
be illegal. We will then see the likes of Guy Bertrand come out in the 
open and tell us that we are thugs, armchair revolutionaries, and 
whatnot. Guy Bertrand has been the inspiration of all this. He is the 
one who launched this Ottawa strategy with the Reform leader breathing 
down his neck, and the intergovernmental affairs minister jumped on the 
bandwagon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to point out that the Bloc Quebecois is 
not the only one condemning this strategy. 
I will not have enough time to read all the quotations I have here, but 
let me give for the record the names of people who agree with us: 
Cardinal Jean-Claude Turcotte; Mr. Claude Ryan, the leader of the 
federalist no committee in 1980; Mr. Daniel Johnson, the leader of the 
no committee in 1995, and still the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party—he 
is therefore the current leader of the Quebec federalists; Mr. Lucien 
Bouchard; Mr. Alain Dubuc; the hon. member for Sherbrooke; the hon. 
member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois; Mr. 
Alain Pellet, chairman of the UN International Law Commission; Mr. 
Gordon Wilson, a constitutional adviser to the B.C. premier. There are 
many more. This consensus which is building up extends beyond Quebec 
borders at the international level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should recognize the obvious. Its strategy 
of using the Supreme Court for its own purposes should be set aside. It 
should in good faith let Quebeckers decide freely their own future like 
everybody wants them to and let the discussions in the coming years deal 
with this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from Témiscamingue for this overview that 
was much too brief for lack of time. I will try to be brief in my 
question in order to give him ample time to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to elaborate on a vital aspect of this 
reference to the Supreme Court. Is it acceptable, in 1998, in a 
democracy, for a government to refer such matters to a court, its own 
creation, consisting of a panel of nine judges appointed by the federal 
government itself? To reinforce that argument, one just has to look at 
the very close ties that the last two judges appointed to the Supreme 
Court have to the Liberal Party. 
Is it normal, is it acceptable, in 1998, in a democracy such as Canada, 
for a federal court consisting of a panel of nine judges appointed by 
the government to be asked to substitute itself for the democratic will 
of 7 million Quebeckers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Madam Speaker, my hon. colleague's question is so 
clear that the answer becomes obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not make sense to let nine judges hold in their hands the 
future of our people, because it is the future of Quebeckers that is at 
stake here. We talked about the appointment process, the fact that these 
judges are appointed by the Prime Minister. Moreover, two of these 
judges were appointed after it was known that there would be a reference 
to the Supreme Court on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking closely, it is obvious there is a kind of incestuous 
relationship there, to say the least. In their infinite wisdom nine 
judges will decide, based on the Constitution, what kind of a future we, 
Quebeckers, can have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think about it. During the last democratic exercise in Quebec, the 
voter turnout was almost 93% if I remember correctly. So 93% of all 
those old enough to vote, millions of Quebeckers, voted at the end of a 
long debate during which the federal government kept repeating what it 
always says, that is: “The question is not clear. What is at stake is 
this and that”. Today, they may have come to realize that their campaign 
was not all that effective, because now they say: “The people did not 
understand”. I for one think that the people did understand very well 
indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a long debate, nothing new in Quebec. The people know full 
well what is at stake. At the end of the campaign, 93% of all voters 
decided: “We are going to vote, to state our positions.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority voted no. We respect the will of these people. No one 
has put in motion the process leading to sovereignty. 
Nevertheless, we still believe that it is the best solution and we 
continue to promote it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were reelected as Bloc members, as sovereigntist representatives 
in Ottawa.  People in Quebec will have to chose between sovereigntists 
and federalists during the next provincial election.  This is par for 
the course, and people are fully aware of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the final analysis, how can there be a balance between 7 million 
people on one side and nine supreme court justices on the other?  Let us 
be serious.  It does not make any sense and I have no doubt that 
Quebeckers understand this very well.  That is why the provincial 
Liberals in Quebec, the Parti Quebecois, the Bloc Quebecois, the 
Conservative Party, the bishops, a cardinal, business people, people 
from all walks of life, say that it does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only the Prime Minister and the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs defend this strategy, and they drag the federal government into 
their crazy enterprise, plus the person most sympathetic to the Quebec 
cause, the leader of the Reform Party.  Can you imagine this fine group 
organizing our future?  These people are trying to manipulate the court, 
to put us in shackles, and they would like us to buy it? No way.

and I am convinced that the movement will snowball. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, to answer my colleague's question, it is clear that this 
makes no more sense in 1998 than it did 25 or 30 years ago and it will 
be the same five years from now because, in a democracy, citizens are 
free to decide their own future.  This is true for all peoples, 
including the Quebec people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the member for Jonquière, who was democratically elected June 2 
to represent the constituents of my riding in the House of 
Commons, I wish to support the motion introduced by the member 
for Laurier—Sainte-Marie, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, 
concerning the future of the Quebec people, and to repeat my 
conviction that Quebeckers alone have the right to decide their 
future, and that the current reference to the Supreme Court on 
the sovereignty of Quebec is contrary to our democratic values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spent several years of my life in community and 
political work and throughout these experiences and for as long as 
I can remember, I have observed Quebeckers' attachment to the 
democratic values of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The referendums to date have always had a high turnout, 
showing our people's wish to decide their own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the eve of the Supreme Court hearing on the legitimacy of 
a unilateral declaration of independence by Quebec, I think it 
vital to appeal to all Canadians and to point out to them once 
again that the Chrétien government is on the wrong track in relying 
on a legal authority to resolve the essentially political question 
of a people's right to decide its own future freely and to take 
responsibility for its destiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a lawyer and I am not about to launch into legal 
arguments.  My eminent colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois are doing 
a brilliant job today of demonstrating the futility of the exercise 
in which the Supreme Court is now engaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want instead is to appeal to common sense, which is in 
keeping with the feelings of the majority of Quebeckers, whether 
federalists or nationalists, concerning what I would call the 
hijacking of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are again seeing a process which fits perfectly into Plan 
B, concocted by the Chrétien government to keep Quebec within the 
Canadian federation.  This time, though, the reference to the 
Supreme Court strikes me as totally pathetic, since it is evidence 
of the failure of the Chrétien government to rise to the challenge 
of renewing the Canadian federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chrétien government's strategy was to stir up public opinion 
in Quebec on the legality of a unilateral decision to secede. 
Instead, it is being bombarded on all sides with the testimonials 
of Quebeckers stating their right to self-determination loud and 
clear. Whether federalist or sovereignist, all join in opposition 
to the federal claims on the right to self-determination.  All 
agree that it is for Quebeckers to decide their own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is presently facing a strong consensus, 
a common front of all those who have at heart the defence of our 
democratic values and the institutions with which we have equipped 
ourselves in Quebec in order to express our societal choices.  The 
federal encroachment in the Supreme Court was found unacceptable, 
even by such people as Claude Ryan and Daniel Johnson, although 
they headed the federalist forces in the last two referendums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By so doing, they confirmed the fundamental break between the 
Quebec Liberal Party and the federal Liberals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By rejecting the very substance of the legal arguments raised by 
the Chrétien government, Claude Ryan and Daniel Johnson have rejected 
beforehand the ruling by the Supreme Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides, Mr. Speaker, we have witnessed the establishment of a non- 
partisan groups composed of sovereignists and federalists, like the 
Pro-Démocratie group, which was joined by key figures like Monique 
Vézina, Jean-Claude Rivet, Pierre Paquette and André Tremblay, to name 
only a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leading the movement which has always been more in evidence in all 
classes of Quebec society, the Pro-Démocratie group makes a point of 
condemning the initiative of the federal government in the following 
terms: 
“We share the conviction that the constitutional debate is first of all 
a political debate and that it should be resolved by political means. 
Constitutional law is based on decisions made by the people. It is not 
the role of constitutional law to substitute itself to the people's 
prerogative of choosing their own political system.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other key figures like Cardinal Jean-Claude Turcotte, archbishop of 
Montreal, and Monseigneur Bertrand Blanchette, archbishop of the diocese 
of Rimouski, have said that the Supreme Court should not decide the 
future of the Quebec people, thus echoing the position taken by the 
bishops of Quebec and Canada in favour of self-determination, at the 
centennial of Confederation in 1967. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to stress one more time that all these people think it is up 
to the people of Quebec to decide their own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be recognized that the highest court in the country is 
widely mistrusted in Quebec today. 
Everyone of us will remember that in 1980, in the famous case regarding 
the veto right that Quebec thought it had, the Supreme Court concluded 
that the federal government could amend the Constitution with the 
support of a substantial majority of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This constitutional deadlock has lasted for 15 years. Quebec has 
learned that within the existing system, no compromise is acceptable to 
the English-Canadian majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 15 years, political players have been prisoners of that 
majority and incapable of renewing the federal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has found no better solution than to go into 
the legal arena in an attempt to muzzle the democratic expression of a 
whole people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this new case, the Supreme Court is heading towards a new 
impasse. Should we be surprised? 
Is it any wonder the supreme court defends the institutions that 
created it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, it is nothing more than the expression of the 
centralizing will of the federal government and bears witness to 
the impasse facing Canadian federation. The fact is that the 
Chrétien government has no argument to counter the advance of the 
sovereignist movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reference to the supreme court is, in the words of Quebec 
premier Lucien Bouchard, an act of powerlessness. In addition, the 
reference to the supreme court arises from the change in public 
opinion in Canada, which is galvanizing around the doctrine of the 
equality of the provinces and the denial of any special status for 
Quebec other than a symbolic and totally insignificant one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see the consensus within Quebec on our democratic 
values and the defence of our institutions, I am more than ever 
sure we can meet the challenges facing us in building our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite all of you watching me on television to express your 
opposition to the Chrétien government's initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our struggle will not end until we have given ourselves a 
country for the year 2000, because what counts for us is the right 
to decide our future.  Let us be proud to be Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All members should refer to one another by

<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think it was Montesquieu who, in the 18th century, considered the 
separation of the three powers, that is the legislative, executive and 
judicial branches of government, as the foundation of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, the executive branch is asking the judicial branch to 
interpret the Constitution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would be agreeable if the Constitution had not been 
unanimously rejected by the people on whom the court's interpretation is 
to be imposed. The initial Constitution was developed by two peoples, 
the two founding peoples. The Constitution of 1982 was adopted by only 
one of these two peoples and now this people wants to impose it on the 
other one because it forms the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague think, like myself, that this process is nothing 
more than another sign of the domination of the rest of Canada over 
Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Terrebonne—Blainville for his question. I fully agree with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he is right. The Canadian government completely ignored the 
fact that there are two founding peoples when it referred the case to 
the Supreme Court. There are the Canadian people and the Quebec people. 
By referring these three questions to the highest court in the land, the 
Supreme Court, the federal government misused that institution and 
proved that it has no sense of fair play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to state for the record that, by referring the case of 
Quebec sovereignty to the Supreme Court of Canada, the federal 
government loaded the dice in its favour, as it always does. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the ability of Quebeckers to decide their own future is at the 
heart of the motion tabled today by the Bloc. This principle and that of 
respect for democracy and the rule of law are as dear to the hearts of 
government members as they are to the hearts of our colleagues opposite. 
It is this principle, our right to decide our own future as exercised 
during the 1980 and 1995 referendums, that I will address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These principles—that are being discussed in detail today—have 
already enabled Quebeckers to choose Canada.  By applying these 
principles, we Quebeckers have refused to relinquish either one of our 
identities as Quebeckers and Canadians, which increase rather than limit 
our opportunities. 
One thing is for sure: twice we Quebeckers exercised our right to decide 
our own future, and twice we decided to stay within Canada despite the 
attempt to hide the option behind a confusing question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several reasons supported the decisions we made. Each time, Canada 
proved to be the logical choice since it has always allowed Quebeckers 
to promote their culture and language throughout the world.  The 
linguistic duality of this country and its multicultural character open 
the door to world markets for Quebeckers and other Canadians. These 
components of the Canadian identity are valuable assets for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we approach the next millennium, during which multiculturalism 
will flourish as will countries that will successfully meet the 
challenge of a harmonious multicultural society, I am confident that we 
Quebeckers will again choose to stay within Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On each occasion Quebeckers have found that Canada gives us an 
exceptional quality of life.  On each occasion we have been proud 
of our country's remarkable international reputation.  On each 
occasion we have understood that Canada has one of the most 
developed economies in the world and that we, Quebeckers, have 
contributed largely to its prosperity. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If on two occasions Quebeckers chose Canada it is because not only 
are we aware of the rich history we share with our fellow citizens 
across the country, but we are resolutely forward-looking. We know that 
in the new economy we must combine the strength of major entities 
with the 
flexibility of smaller ones, national solidarity with regional autonomy; 
our federal union is vital to our survival.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On each occasion, Quebeckers took into account the fact that 
through the years Canadians have built a strong social safety net. 
Compassion and solidarity, the Canadian federation's underlying values, 
are shared by citizens from coast to coast. These are the values that 
prompt us to lend a hand in difficult times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I remind the House how 
quickly the country as a whole responded and helped all those affected 
by the recent ice storm? Beyond linguistic and cultural differences, 
beyond distances, these values are shared by all. They form the Canadian 
fabric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On every occasion, Quebeckers said no to secession and yes to 
Canada. 
We have invested too much of our creative energy in this country to let 
it go. Quebeckers have contributed their culture and their way of life 
to Canada, making them part of our common heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes Canada strong is the values inherent in our identity. 
Openness, solidarity and respect for individual rights are often 
mentioned, and rightly so. These same values have shaped our common 
history. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers' desire to stay in Canada has always been the subject 
of a consensus.  That consensus has twice been tested and has 
twice held firm.  On each occasion Quebeckers have said yes to 
the Canadian component of our identity.  I am sure that we will 
do so yet again if the secessionist option is submitted to us 
Quebeckers again for approval for the third time in less than 20 
years. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1995 campaign and some revelations since have shown to what 
extent the referendum process was very very much like manipulation and 
intellectual dishonesty. That is why the Canadian government has decided 
to put forward initiatives aimed at clarifying the stakes of secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every member of this House will recall of the circumstances around 
the publication of the infamous book by Jacques Parizeau entitled <I>Pour 
un Québec souverain</I>, the case for a sovereign Quebec. Quebeckers, like 
Canadians as a whole, were shocked to learn that the one-year period for 
the negotiations that was always alluded to was only smoke and mirrors 
and that Mr. Parizeau had no intention of abiding by it. 
On the contrary, he wanted to drag us Quebeckers into an adventure 
which, as great as it was, was no game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, when the lobster trap closed, on October 30, 1995, we, 
Quebeckers were not caught in it. The strategy of the secessionists is 
to bury our heads in the sand and to play with ambiguity. For its part, 
our government wants clarity. A possible secession would have a huge 
impact on Quebeckers and Canadians as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is thus essential to ensure that the referendum process follows 
well defined, precise rules accepted by everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate, if there is one, should be held calmly and peacefully. 
We cannot sit iddly by when the Bloc member for Richelieu says cynically 
that his party wants to destroy federalism. 
Nor can we remain indifferent to the terrible call for intolerance by 
the Bloc member for Louis-Hébert who said, in 1995, that only so-called 
old stock Quebeckers should vote in the referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we cannot accept the disgraceful declarations by Jacques 
Parizeau on the evening of October 30, 1995. The list of the 
irresponsible comments by the secessionists is very long, but I do not 
have the time to speak to that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I could add, however, that the lofty statements about respect for 
democracy coming from the Bloc would be more acceptable if they were 
coming from more credible individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the dogmatic opposition of the Bloc, our country is 
progressing and changing.  Just a few weeks ago, the Canadian 
Parliament and the National Assembly passed a resolution amending the 
Constitution, which allows the Quebec government to proceed with the 
establishment of linguistic school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secessionists supported this amendment, proving that it is 
possible to work together for the common good, when they want to. 
If the interest of Quebeckers took precedence over partisan interests, 
the Government of Quebec would work with us much more often than it 
does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of Quebeckers are proud to be Quebeckers and also 
proud to be Canadians.  They do not want to reject one of the two 
elements of their identity, and certainly not in a confused way, and 
against democratic principles and the constitutional state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, we cannot support this motion from the 
Bloc, a party which is against the constitutional state and democracy 
for all. As Quebeckers and Canadians, we cannot support this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my colleague from Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine referred in her speech to 
a huge operation of intellectual manipulation when speaking about the 
referendum in 1995. I would like to ask her two questions. I am 
convinced that she has all the intellectual capacity to answer them 
brilliantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first question is: How does my colleague describe the millions 
of dollars spent by Option Canada, which did not hesitate to violate the 
referendum law and the measures governing the funding of political 
parties within a referendum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question is: How does she describe the declarations of 
love and the phoney promises that were made loud and strong by the big 
names of federalism, starting with the Prime Minister and continuing 
with other big names who are also here in this House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am anxious to hear the answer of my colleague from 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine. I am sure she will do me the honour 
of clearly answering this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, we already experienced two 
referenda in Quebec, in 1980 and in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Don't forget 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings:</B> Each time, the question was confused and, 
despite the confusion that existed, the majority of Quebeckers voted 
against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And if they respected democracy, there would not be a third 
referendum, because the will, the ability of Quebeckers to decide their 
future has already been expressed twice and, in the end, despite the 
confusion, the answer was very clear. By a majority, we said “We want to 
stay in Canada. We want to preserve our identity as Canadians and our 
identity as Quebeckers”. We answered “We want to stay in Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it deplorable that the secessionists are still saying that 
there must be yet another referendum when the will has been expressed 
clearly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I seems to 
me that the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine does not 
recognize the Quebeckers' ability to understand when she would have us 
believe that the Quebec people did not understand correctly the two 
questions that were put to them in 1980 and 1995.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course they understood them correctly. We must recall that 
promises were made to Quebec by big federal guns, Pierre Trudeau at the 
time and later Jean Chrétien, and these promises were broken. Quebec has 
always wanted to command respect within Canada but we have been denied 
that as well when Canada failed to recognize Quebec's distinct nature. 
I would say that there is a solid basis for Quebec's frustration, which 
make us want to get Quebec out of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing antidemocratic in wanting to go through the 
referendum process again and it does not confuse the issue. 
It is entirely democratic. But once again, in spite of the demands made 
in the past to show respect to Quebec, the federal government is the one 
who failed to fulfil this requirement, making a reference to the Supreme 
Court and failing to acknowledge the Quebeckers' ability to understand 
and Quebec's determination to freely decide its future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the hon. member should also recognize that the 
process was not antidemocratic in the past, was not intended to confuse 
anything and was not dishonest. It was not an attempt to manipulate. On 
the contrary, we were quite clear, still are and will continue to be 
until— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. There are only 20 seconds remaining in 
the five-minute question and comment period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question asked in the 
1995 referendum was not clear. A CROP poll held in July 1997 
revealed that 44% of Quebeckers who voted yes in 1995 thought 
that, after a yes victory, Quebec would still be part of Canada. 
This clearly illustrates the state of confusion that prevailed at 
the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question must at least be clear. I would like to know why 
secessionists would not use a question similar to the one asked in 
Armenia in 1991: “Should the Republic of Armenia become a democratic 
republic, independent from the USSR?” This question is rather clear— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but the period for questions and 
comments is over.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a remarkable country.  I believe in the 21st century 
it will be an even stronger and more united one.  Why?  Because I 
think Quebeckers will continue to chose to remain part of a 
country that they have done so much to build. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Quebeckers are proud of both their Quebec and Canadian 
identities and do not wish to have to choose between them. 
However, if Quebeckers should ever choose to leave Canada, I 
would want them to make this choice, as I am sure they would wish 
clearly and unequivocally.  I would not want Quebeckers to break 
the bonds of solidarity with their fellow Canadian citizens in an 
atmosphere of confusion where no mutually acceptable ground rules 
were in place. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I firmly believe that Quebeckers will choose to remain Canadians 
because Quebec benefits from being part of Canada and is an essential

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is flourishing within Canada and Canada is flourishing 
because of Quebec, but there are always new challenges to be 
addressed.  In many instances this commitment has seen the prime 
minister working side by side with the premiers.  As the minister 
of intergovernmental affairs has often said, what Canadians need 
today are strong provinces, a strong federal government and 
strong relationship between them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could name a great many policy initiatives on which the 
different orders of government have co-operated recently.  I will 
content myself with mentioning two, the Canada child tax benefit 
and the new partnership on labour market training. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to statistics, one in five children lives in poverty in 
Canada. That is just unacceptable. As Lutheran theologian Dietrich 
Bonhoeffer put it, a society's morality is judged by the way it treats 
its children. Our children are our future. When a child has to go to 
school on an empty stomach, we all lose out. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May 1996 the federal government offered its provincial and 
territorial partners the opportunity either to assume full 
responsibility for job training measures, funded through the 
employment insurance account, or to develop a new core management 
partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada-Quebec job training agreement, in the words of the 
prime minister, demonstrated that the governments of Canada and 
Quebec could work together to find practical solutions that are 
adapted to the real problem of Quebeckers.  As an executive of 
the Quebec business organization, the Conseil du patronat, was 
quick to observe, the agreement shows that it is possible to 
conclude administrative agreements in key areas without having to 
amend the Canadian constitution. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the manpower training agreements and the new national 
child benefit show what can be accomplished, within the scope of 
administrative agreements and through the exercise or non-exercise of 
powers without having to change one iota of the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that does not mean that our Constitution is or should be 
immutable. Our Constitution is not a straitjacket preventing us from 
changing it. Rather, it is a framework allowing for orderly and timely 
changes. It reflects our evolving identity as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen recently how our Constitution can adapt to the 
evolving needs of Canadians with the passage of a constitutional 
amendment requested by the Quebec government to set up the province's 
school boards along linguistic rather than denominational lines. 
Everybody in Quebec agreed that denominational school boards reflected 
the reality in Quebec in 1867. Today, however, linguistic school boards 
are more in line with the values and sociological realities of 
Quebeckers. The Parliament and the National Assembly combined their 
efforts at the appropriate time and invoked Section 83 of the 1982 
Constitution Act to proceed with a bilateral amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the constitutional amendment will enable Quebec to 
flourish further within Canada.  It will enable Quebeckers to 
have a stronger school system that responds more closely to their 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed it was seen as such a positive step by the Government of 
Quebec that the minister of education, Pauline Marois, was moved 
to praise the federal minister of intergovernmental affairs for 
having «livrer la marchandise». 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident the government of Prime Minister Chrétien will 
continue to deliver the goods for Quebeckers and for all 
Canadians.  All these changes, both constitutional and 
non-constitutional, show that our federation is capable of 
responding to the needs of Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we have our challenges.  Which country does not?  Our 
challenges are ones that can be resolved through negotiations and 
a long tradition of accommodation.  We must put our difficulties 
into perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We face serious challenges but they are nonetheless the problems 
of a prosperous country with strong, democratic institutions and 
a thriving civil society.  None of these challenges should lead 
to a break-up of our country.  In fact thousands of people from 
other countries apply to share our problems every year. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not lose sight of the fact that there have been 
debates and discussions on the Canadian identity since the 
beginnings of the federation.  The debate has, of course, become 
particularly lively in the past few decades, but the consolidation 
of national unity is an ongoing task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those who choose to wallow in past humiliations, real or

influence for the world, a source of pride for its people.

just like to ask the hon. member what she thinks of the statement 
by her colleague for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine referring to the 
confusion over the question asked of Quebeckers in the 1995 
referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read her the 1992 referendum question on the 
Charlottetown Accord, and then the one from 1995.  I would like to 
know where the confusion lies.  In 1995, 94% of the people of 
Quebec spoke.  I shall read the question the federal government 
asked in 1992: “Do you agree that the Constitution of Canada should 
be renewed on the basis of the agreement reached on August 28, 
1992?” That was the 1992 referendum on the Charlottetown Accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And then in 1995 the question asked by the Government of 
Quebec was as follows: “Do you agree to Quebec becoming sovereign 
after making a formal offer to Canada of a new economic and 
political partnership under the terms of the draft bill on the 
future of Quebec and the agreement of June 12?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know whether our Acadian colleague shares the 
view of her colleague from Notre-Dame-de-Grâce on the confusion 
that clouded those two questions. It is very clear to us. The 
people of Quebec spoke out clearly in 1995. When it has a similar 
question put before it, soon I hope, there will be a resounding 
yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
member for calling me his Acadian friend.  It is true that as 
Acadians we are friends of Quebeckers.  However, I would like to 
relate my version of the evening of the referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was sitting in my kitchen with my children, my husband and 
some friends, because my friends wanted to be with us on the 
evening of the referendum.  They came to our place for supper, and 
we watched the referendum together on television.  I can tell you 
we were anxious during the voting because we wanted Quebeckers to 
know how those of us outside Quebec were feeling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to answer your question.  I will say that my children 
and my friends agree with me that the question in the last 
referendum was not clear and specific.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it was the same question.  I have to say that 
we talked that night and we felt that the question did not make it 
clear to those voting with the separatists that they would separate 
from Canada.  For that reason it was not clear.  I think the book 
Mr. Parizeau wrote after the referendum made it clear that they 
would have voted for separation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I see a lack of logic in the position of the members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While they say the questions in the last two referendums were 
not clear, they use the responses to these questions to argue that 
Quebeckers chose to remain in Canada.  Either the question was 
unclear or it was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it was, so was the answer, and so the 50% less three-tenths 
cannot be used.  If it was not, then they should stop saying it 
was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe the answer to my 
friend is on two occasions Quebeckers clearly stated that yes they 
wanted to still be part of our great country and remain Quebeckers as 
well as Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's day of opposition by the Bloc Quebecois is extremely 
important and significant. The motion moved by my party leader and 
amended by my colleague for Berthier—Montcalm reads as follows: 
“That this House recognize the 
consensus in Quebec that it is for Quebecers to freely 
decide their own future.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Quebeckers, the stakes are basic since the debate deals 
essentially with democracy and the right of peoples to decide their own 
future. Whom are we talking about exactly? I am proud to say: the Quebec 
people who probably naively believed in the 1867 agreement when it was 
one of the two founding nations of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One hundred and thirty one years later, what we are talking about 
is Quebec's right to self-determination, a right it is denied by the 
federal government, as witness its reference to the Supreme Court. What 
was happened to cause the federal government to consider the reality of 
the Quebec people so negligible? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past 30 years, relations between the federal government and 
Quebec have not always been rosy. If I may, I will briefly remind the 
House of a few important events which will shed some light on what is 
happening today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1980, four years after the Party Quebecois was elected in 1976, 
Quebec held its first consultation on the future of Quebec within the 
Canadian federation. The outcome was clear, the rules of democracy 
understood and accepted by all concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the yes side defeat, Quebec abided by the decision of its 
citizens and continued to act within the Constitution of Canada. Two 
years later, in 1982, the federal government of Trudeau decided, in a 
great impetus of independence, to renew and patriate the Constitution. 
Despite Quebec's unwillingness and despite nice but shallow promises 
made in 1980, the federal government unilaterally patriated the 
Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, the government, once again through a reference order, 
had asked the Supreme Court to make legitimate a unilateral patriation 
without the agreement of all the provinces. The answer met the 
expectations of the federal government. Patriation without the agreement 
of all the provinces is legal. But is it ethical? That is something 
else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trudeau and his henchmen did not bother with these subtleties. For 
him, the new Constitution of 1982 would be the right one, and too bad if 
Quebec did not recognize it.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is neither sovereignists nor Quebec federalists have 
recognized and recognize the Constitution of 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, after years of negotiations both difficult and useless, 
the Canada-wide referendum is held on the Charlottetown accords. In 
Quebec, this exercise is framed by the Quebec Referendum Act. Again, all 
parties recognized the rules of the game and no one had any doubt about 
the legitimacy of this democratic exercise. The referendum of 1992 
unequivocally rejected the Charlottetown accords: in Canada, because 
these accords gave too many powers to Quebec, and in Quebec, because 
these accords were below the traditional demands of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, Quebec held its second referendum on the future of the 
Quebec people. This consultation again took place under Quebec's 
Referendum Act. Once again, the rules of the game were agreed to by all. 
The issues were clear. No one, not even the Prime Minister of Canada, 
questioned the legitimacy of the right of Quebeckers to decide their 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone remembers the result of the 1995 referendum. The yes side, 
the side that wanted change, got almost 50% of the votes, with 94% of 
registered voters taking part in this highly democratic exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having nothing to offer Quebec, the federal government went with 
what is now known as its plan B, a plan based on fear, a plan based on 
denying the existence of the Quebec people. One of the main elements of 
this strategy is the reference to the Supreme Court in order to deny 
Quebec's right to decide its own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, ever since the 1960s, Quebeckers have always thought they 
could decide their own future and have always acted accordingly. The 
referendums that were held in Quebec are good examples of that. With its 
reference to the Supreme Court, the government is giving nine judges it 
appointed the right to decide Quebec's future. That is a most 
undemocratic and illegitimate move. When a government asks judges to 
make political decisions, democracy is always threatened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is using the Supreme Court to validate its 
plan B, just as the Trudeau government seeked approval for unilaterally 
patriating the Constitution in 1982. The result of this action by the 
government in 1982 was that Quebec refused to recognize that 
Constitution. 
Today, the federal government is invoking this Constitution to pick on 
Quebeckers, by refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the National 
Assembly and the free will of the people the assembly represents, in 
other words, by denying the Quebec people its right to exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in 1982, the federal government stands alone, its positions have 
garnered no support. About the reference to the Supreme Court, there is 
a consensus in Quebec that only Quebeckers have the right to decide 
their own future and that no court of law can take that right away and 
decide for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, even the staunchest federalists in Quebec have decried the 
tactic used by the government. Mr. Claude Ryan, the former leader of the 
Liberal Party of Quebec and leader of the No side in 1980, was very 
clear on the reference issue: “It is for Quebec and for Quebec only to 
decide its own future.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his comments to the amicus curiae, Mr. Ryan said that, on the right 
to self-determination, which can be interpreted as including the choice 
to opt for sovereignty, there is in Quebec a broad consensus between the 
key political parties and the vast majority of politicians working at 
the provincial level. All agree that, at the end of the day, the future 
of Quebec, whatever option is chosen, depends on the political will of 
the Quebec people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current leader of the Liberal Party of Quebec and leader of the 
No side in the 1995 referendum, Mr. Johnson, approved Mr. Ryan's 
analysis and joined the vast consensus reached in Quebec. 
The right of Quebeckers to self-determination is a political issue, not 
a legal one. A legal measure would never stop a nation from 
democratically deciding its own future.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past week, the intergovernmental affairs minister has been 
making astonishing statements about the Supreme Court reference. After 
loudly invoking the rule of law, he recognizes, following Mr. Ryan's 
statements, that democracy prevails, but that the rule of law is 
essential. For us, the primacy of democracy is a fact and Quebec's right 
to self-determination cannot be challenged. Because they respect 
democracy and the right of people to self-determination, because they 
respect Quebeckers, the nine Supreme Court judges will refuse to answer 
the questions of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maurice Maeterlinck wrote, and I quote: “There is nothing finer 
than a key, as long as one does not know what it opens”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has given a key to the Supreme Court with 
the intention of locking up the people of Quebec, but it did not know 
what this key opened. We see it now with the consensus in Quebec: there 
is no key to lock up the people of Quebec, there is no key to lock up 
democracy.

<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened with a great deal of interest to the presentation of 
my honourable colleague. I would ask her two simple questions. 
First of all, does she believe in asking the people of Quebec 
once, twice or three times?  How many times does she want to ask 
the people of Quebec what their views are and then when is she 
going to be ready to accept the expressed will of the people of 
Quebec? That is my first question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question deals with how you train people to count 
votes and how you teach young people democracy. Is it by teaching 
them to look at a voting slip and accept a voting slip based on 
what has been indicated is the will of the people?  Is it to 
teach them how to be un peu croches and reject 86,000, 100,000 
votes?  How many tens of thousands of votes are you allowed to 
reject based on disinformation and poor counting and then have to 
be recounted how many times? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So tell me about this very democratic society that puts an 
unclear question, says no twice and does not count the votes 
properly. Is that democracy in Quebec? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am really not sure 
what I should do. Should I avoid answering the questions like my 
colleagues opposite do? I could make a nice speech instead, with 
elegance, and perhaps even with a measure of humour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I decide to answer my colleague's questions, I will probably 
show a more mature attitude and more respect for parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The choice between the two is quite clear for me, just as clear as 
my choice was in 1995, and also in 1980 and 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question was about the number of referendums. I would 
like to quote from the classics by saying: “Hone your work carefully; 
spare no effort”. There will be as many as it takes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My deeply held belief is that the Quebec people exists, that it has 
the right to have a country of its own and to run it in its own way, 
being respectful of international conventions and of its immediate 
neighbours and of countries that are a little bit more remote. That is 
what I believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this belief is a driving force for me, I am here to achieve 
a goal. I do not think I or my colleague opposite can ever say that two 
is enough, or three, or ten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Hone your work carefully”. I am confident that Quebeckers will 
finally take this extraordinary opportunity to join all other nations in 
the world when the next referendum comes, because we will have our own 
country by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question dealt with democracy and the vote counting.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am almost tempted to make a comment. The Liberals must be really 
shattered, they must be really worried to wonder, to draw a parallel 
between the value of democracy in Quebec and a few unfortunate decisions 
that were made in all good faith by scrutineers who were under the 
stress that is normally felt in all polling stations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, like me, you probably had the opportunity to witness 
the counting of votes, perhaps as a scrutineer or a secretary or a 
representative of the yes side, the no side or the perhaps side, and to 
know what goes on. There is some tension in the air. There is some 
stress and everyone wants to do his or her best. 
But you know, and I only have to look at my colleagues on the other 
side, obviously, it is not because one wants to do his or her best that 
one always does the right things. The evidence is in front of me. The 
Liberals want to do their best, but sometimes it does not work very 
well. So democracy is not in jeopardy in Quebec. Democracy is one of our 
fundamental values and I have confidence in Quebeckers' maturity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois to join in a debate which is the 
prelude to the political mobilization of Quebeckers in support of the 
consensus re-emerging in Quebec which, as stated in the motion moved 
today in the House by our party, holds that it is for Quebeckers, and 
Quebeckers alone, to freely decide their own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs is 
saying, the Government of Canada has put three questions to the supreme 
court dealing with the future of Quebec and phrased them in such a way 
that it has shocked and troubled the chair of the UN International Law 
Commission, Alain Pellet, and I quote “on account of the partisan manner 
in which they are asked”, not because it wants to clarify the rule of 
law and become its champion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, this is a political move. So political in fact that it might 
jeopardize the credibility of this same court held hostage by the law, 
according to the prominent lawyer Jacques-Yvan Morin. This strategy is 
aimed mainly at discouraging Quebeckers from opting for sovereignty when 
the time comes because it would be illegal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However in Quebec nobody, not only federalist allies, such as 
Daniel Johnson and Claude Ryan, is being fooled by such shifty tactics, 
such trickery, which, as Hannah Arendt put it, “never conflict with 
reason, because things could have happened just the way the liar claimed 
they happened”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This strategy is probably also aimed at influencing the 
international community, which Canada will ask to oppose any action the 
supreme court might have ruled illegal. 
However, the international community is not and will not be fooled by 
this none too subtle federal stratagem. One day it will recognize the 
will of the Quebec to have its own country and to become a full-fledged 
member of the international community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community will recognize a sovereign Quebec, a 
Quebec that will reassert, as it has stated for decades, its intention 
to abide by the Charter of the United Nations and the other 
international instruments ratified by Canada, guarantee the English 
speaking community and the native people the rights they need to develop 
within a sovereign Quebec, as well as respect all relevant commitments 
to ensure the stability of the continent and the whole world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has been trying and keeps trying to expose this 
legal tactic that undermines democracy in Canada and it will intensify 
its discussions with foreign representatives, here in Ottawa and abroad, 
to politely and patiently explain to them why Quebeckers will soon opt 
for sovereignty, why Quebeckers no longer want to deal with the Canadian 
impasse and why they want a state where people speak French and enjoy a 
Quebec culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the time comes to decide its own future, Quebec will have 
legitimacy on its side, as always. Canada, or at least the part being 
represented by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and his 
entourage, believes that it has the law on its side. The minister argues 
that the rule of law is crucial, but allow me to digress here for a 
minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be so crucial, it would have to be understood. Last week, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs showed us that he does not 
understand anything about international law. 
When he was talking about unilateral decisions made by Canada, he said 
things that exposed and brought to light his lack of knowledge in this 
area, which we will continue to decry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law is not crucial. Democracy is, the will of the people is 
crucial, and that is what the Canadian government is about to learn at 
its own expense. There is today a large consensus which the 
international community will take note of, a large consensus that it is 
for Quebeckers to decide, and Quebeckers will soon have another 
opportunity to decide their own future.

say that, as our leader stated this morning, we support the motion put 
forward by our colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that, once again, the Liberal Party of Canada has 
managed to focus the national debate on the relationship between Quebec 
and the rest of Canada. It is unfortunate—and I will say this before 
asking my question to my colleague—because, at a moment where 
Canadians have gone through successive serious crises over the past year 
and a half, that particular item is not on their agenda. Our priorities 
are definitely elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Canadians are not sending us a clear message that a 
constitutional debate in the House of Commons is a matter of the utmost 
urgency, I would like to ask my colleague if he thinks that this debate 
has been fuelled for 30 years by irresponsible politicians who have made 
historical mistakes, especially over the last 20 years, that went 
against the objectives of Canadians as well as Quebeckers as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A survey released a few weeks ago showed that 80% of Quebeckers 
among those who voted yes have had enough and are sick and tired of the 
constitutional debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it an issue that is used and abused by politicians? I would like 
to hear what the member has to say on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I will say that the politicians whom the member calls 
irresponsible are those who, for more than 30 years, have been proposing 
reforms to federalism without ever being able to see them through.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as if Quebeckers, and several of their governments, 
have not sought to take part in reforms aimed at changing the 
federation in order to bring it in line with Quebeckers' 
expectations.  The ones responsible for the division today are the 
politicians, and I agree with you that the Liberals of Canada are 
without a doubt the ones who must accept the bulk of the 
responsibility, in particular Prime Minister Trudeau, who we are 
not upset to hear is now losing his popularity in Quebec.  The 
Liberals are the ones who created the stalemate and they are the 
ones who continue to maintain positions that perpetuate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sovereignist politicians have their faults, but they also 
have their good points, and one of their good points is definitely 
that they wanted to find an alternative, and alternative within a 
federalism which has reached a dead end and continues to be stuck 
there.  Our alternative, since René Lévesque founded the Parti 
Quebecois, is the one proposed to the people of Quebec, sovereignty 
plus an offer to Canada in all friendship and respect to those who 
make up Canada, an offer of partnership or economic association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We 
have done so, and will continue to do so, giving priority to the 
democratic approach and inviting Quebeckers to reflect on their 
future and to decide on that future after sober reflection. 
Quebeckers have the right to decide their future, as they did once 
in 1980, a second time in 1992, a third time in 1995, and they will 
still be free to decide their future again, and soon we hope, so 
that Quebec may be a country by the year 2000.

not want to accept the amendment moved by the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, which was to include in the motion before the

democracy for all”? Why did he not want to deal with this amendment and 
accept it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Through you, Mr. Speaker, I will tell my colleague

accepted because it was deemed not to be in order by the chair.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to share my time today with the member for Beauce. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would like to convey a message to Quebeckers on the 
part of the people of my riding: we want you to remain within Canada. We 
believe that you make a contribution to our country by your uniqueness. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future of Quebec is very important to the residents of my 
province and my riding.  After all, the people of Ontario and 
Quebec have a long and significant history as partners and 
friends.  Historically we were the twin engines of growth in 
Canada.  Today our two provinces are bound together by a complex 
web of ties, families, friendships, professional partnerships and 
trading links. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many francophone Quebeckers have played an important role in the 
life of my province, and among them are Richard Monette, artistic 
director of the Festival of Stratford, and Yves Landry, chairman of the 
board and chief executive officer of Chrysler Canada. On the other hand, 
Quebec has benefited from the talents of Franco-Ontarians, namely Paul 
Desmarais of Power Corporation. The magnificent synergy of our two 
provinces is embodied in such people. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The presence of Quebec within Canada is also of particular 
importance to the franco-Ontarian community that enriches my 
province of Ontario.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just mention a few of their achievements.  Both writer 
François Paré and playwright Jean-Marc Dalpé have won governor 
general's awards for their work.  Ottawa's Franco-Ontarian 
festival, LeFranco, has grown to be the premier francophone 
cultural event of its kind in North America.  The Ontario economy 
is bolstered by over 7,500 francophone owned businesses, 
companies and corporations.  In economic terms the provinces of 
Ontario and Quebec are among the most closely linked of all 
Canada's provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the most recent figures available from StatsCan, 
which are for 1996, almost 60% of Quebec's interprovincial 
exports were to Ontario and over 70% of its interprovincial 
imports came from my province.  Meanwhile some 40% of Ontario's 
exports were indeed to Quebec and some 50% of its imports came 
from that province. Quebec is indeed Ontario's largest trading 
partner within Canada and vice versa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, social, cultural and economic, it is very 
important to Ontarians that Quebec remain within Canada.  As 
friends, it is natural that we should not wish Quebeckers to 
leave Canada in an atmosphere of confusion without a mutually 
acceptable process and a framework to ensure fairness and 
clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I remain confident that Quebeckers will continue to 
choose to enjoy the fruits of Canadian citizenship.  I feel 
confident that they will continue to build the federation 
alongside Ontarians and their other fellow citizens from British 
Columbia, the prairies, eastern Canada and the north, for there 
is no doubt that together Canadians are indeed a winning 
combination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former New Brunswick premier Frank McKenna said in his very 
emotional farewell address Canada is a country that has the 
civility to be able to deal with the most difficult issues in the 
most peaceful way imaginable, a country that has been able to 
fulfil the dreams and aspirations of hundreds of thousands and 
millions of people and it is a country that people want to come 
and live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reason why Canada is so attractive for people around the 
globe is that we have found ways to accommodate and indeed to 
celebrate our tremendous diversity.  In a world where so many 
countries are torn apart by ethnic and regional grievances, this 
is no mean feat.  In a country such as ours with its great 
distances and a citizenry drawn from the four corners of the 
globe, respect for diversity is essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Few Canadians would deny that the First Nations, Inuit and 
Métis, together with the new and not so new generations of 
immigrants, all contribute an important though by no means 
identical way to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to see this aspect of Canadian reality reflected 
in the statement of principles drawn up by nine of Canada's 
premiers in Calgary, together with a commitment to individual and 
provincial equality.  That commitment to equality, however, was 
by no means a call for uniformity.  The premiers indeed signalled 
their recognition of Quebec's uniqueness within Canada in this 
context.  It appears to be a signal to which Quebeckers can 
respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An Environics poll taken some time after the text of the Calgary 
declaration was released showed that over one-quarter of 
Quebeckers who currently support secession would change their 
minds if all nine other provinces passed resolutions recognizing 
the unique character of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clearly illustrates the ability of the Calgary principles 
to bring Canadians together from coast to coast to coast.  That 
is what we in the government of Canada wish to do.  We wish to 
bring Canadians together to continue building this remarkable 
country so that all Canadians can benefit from our combined 
strength in facing the challenges of the new millennium.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With our two official languages and our multicultural citizenry, 
Canada is increasingly well placed to compete in this new global 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the reasons for staying together as one country go 
way beyond our economic strength.  Together we have built a 
strong social union which reflects our commitment to sharing and 
our sense of a national community.  Together we are a stronger 
presence in the world and on the world stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, there is a wealth of ties which bind 
Canadians together on a wide range of different levels.  Our 
economic achievements are by no means negligible and it is clear 
that divided, our economy would be weaker than it is today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that at present Canada is a success as 
plenty of international organizations and experts agree. 
According to OECD, Canada's economy and employment growth are set 
to outperform those of all other G-7 countries in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston has indicated 
that it anticipates the Government of Canada will receive a 
credit upgrading in the near future.  The world economic forum 
rates Canada as the fourth most competitive economy in the world 
based on such factors as the shape of the country's finances, our 
infrastructure and our technology base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economist intelligence unit of London predicts that we will 
have the third best business environment in the world over the 
next five years. As the president of the Toronto-Dominion Bank, 
Charles Baillie, observed, Quebeckers can survive economically 
without the other provinces and vice versa. But, he said, “since 
when is our standard and our aspiration simple survival?  Canada 
has meant more than simple survival, much more than that to all 
its citizens, including Quebeckers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know Quebeckers are interested indeed in more than survival. I 
know they want to continue to flourish as the only majority 
francophone society on this continent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the motion today Bloc members say they are against the 
democratic principles and rule of law of their own province of 
Quebec, my province of Ontario and indeed our country of Canada. 
It is for those reasons that I cannot support this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to respond to my hon. colleague for Mississauga West, a 
region I know well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My brother, Maurice Marchand, lives in the riding of 
Mississauga West, and, like me as a Franco-Ontarian, is quite 
familiar with the treatment afforded francophones in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what my hon. colleague has just said or wants to 
have us believe, francophones have not been treated well in 
Ontario. 
The very opposite is true.  In the history of Canada, if there 
is one province that is more responsible for mistreatment and for 
failing to respect the rights of francophones outside Quebec, it is 
Ontario.  It prohibited teaching in French for nearly 50 years and 
only in recent years has it granted francophones their own schools. 
This is another issue I would have liked to tackle.  It is a bit 
off topic, but it is related to the Quebec issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It shows once again how little respect is accorded the French 
language in Canada, and the very same thing can be seen in Quebec 
as well.  Canada has not found a way to honour the integrity and 
unique character of Quebec.  The uniqueness of its character is 
ignored despite the fact that Quebec has for many years expressed 
a need for some recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, a number of referendums were held.  Changes in 
federalism promised to Quebec never materialized.  The member for 
Mississauga West is trying to tell us, like a number of members on 
the other side of the House, the federalism and the Canadian 
Constitution have changed.  It is true, but do they not think the 
federal government's stand on Quebec has hardened in the process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is its reference to the supreme court to prevent Quebeckers 
from freely expressing their will and their decision to become an 
independent country not further proof that the federal government 
has taken a tougher stand with Quebec rather than really honouring 
its claims for several years?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am quite sure that if 
the hon. member's brother lives in my riding there is probably a 
fairly good chance that he voted for me.  If he did I thank him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made reference to some of the history in Ontario. 
What he failed to do was recognize some of the gains which have 
been made, particularly in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was part of the David Peterson government in the province of 
Ontario.  We made several changes in our province to recognize 
the importance and the significance of the francophone community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was not easily done.  There were a lot of people who were 
saying why do we need bilingual signs on our highways in the 
province of Ontario.  We would not find bilingual signs on the 
highways in the province of Quebec.  That is an interesting 
double standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have ignored that particular problem.  We have done that 
because we believe in Canada and we believe in Quebec as being 
part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also point out there are a number of French schools and French 
immersion courses in Ontario.  Many people in my riding insist on 
having their children go through their entire elementary 
education in the French system.  That is tremendous. I wish I had 
done that.  Then my attempts at French in this place would be 
dramatically better than they are today. The reality is Ontario 
recognizes the importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line which the member and other members of his party 
refuse to admit is that they have clearly spoken out today 
against the democratic principles of Quebec, of Ontario and of 
Canada.  They have spoken against the rule of law of Quebec, of 
Ontario and of Canada.  For that reason we will not be supporting 
the motion.  However, we do support the people of the province of 
Quebec's remaining in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a Quebec MP, I am 
pleased to take part in today's debate on the future of Quebec within 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the motion before us significant on more than one account 
because it stresses our democratic values. It is not every day we 
parliamentarians have the opportunity to discuss such an issue; this is 
the reason why I find this debate so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government's position should another referendum be called in 
Quebec, the third one in less than 20 years, has always been clear. We 
do not want to deny Quebeckers the right to decide to separate from 
Canada if they believe it is the best thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have always maintained however is that the referendum 
process must be clear and allow Quebeckers to fully understand what is 
at stake. Whether we are for or against Quebec's secession, it would 
inevitably have a serious impact on every field of human activity, not 
only in Quebec, but also in the rest of Canada. This is the reason why 
the process must be clear. This is the reason why we are making sure it 
will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc members accuse us at times of wanting to deny Quebeckers the 
right to decide their own future. Nothing is further from the truth. 
Canadians have always been known for their sense of freedom and 
democracy. This country was built on openness and tolerance. Respect for 
these ideals and their implementation give Canadians a very  enviable 
reputation internationally. 
This legacy inherited from our forefathers is part of our identity and, 
as Quebeckers and Canadians, there is probably nothing we hold as dear 
as what sets us apart from the rest of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs so rightly said, 
Canada would no longer be Canada if was not based on the voluntary 
participation of all its constituent parts. Nobody is forced to be part of 
this country. Anybody who accuses our government of trying to exercise 
such force does not understand our position at all or does not want to 
understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We respect democracy, but contrary to some of our friends opposite, 
we also believe in clarity. We do not want Quebeckers to lose their 
country over a misunderstanding.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want the democratic experience to be turned into a bad 
joke. People have the right to understand what they stand to lose by 
opting for Quebec's separation. They will have to make their choice with 
full knowledge of the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc members will undoubtedly wonder why we are so prudent with 
them, since we have already taken part in two other referendum campaigns 
at the end of which Quebeckers still expressed the will to remain 
Canadians. The answer is simple: since 1995, several facts that were 
made public clearly demonstrated that the referendum process had not 
been followed with a concern for the respect of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us recall the controversial statements of Jacques Parizeau 
about a unilateral declaration of independence. Indeed, the three party 
agreement signed on June 12, 1995 between Mr. Parizeau, Mr. Bouchard and 
Mr. Dumont included dubious aspects. Concluded in mid-panic in the face 
of the probability of a bitter defeat, it had the effect of confusing 
Quebeckers by painting in glowing colours the possibility of an economic 
and political association with Canada, which Mr. Parizeau himself had 
never believed in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, we have to see that the approach suggested by secessionist 
leaders—to use an euphemism—has not always been crystal clear. And 
how. For years opinion polls have been showing that a clear question on 
Quebec's independence gets less support than if vague and utopian 
concepts such as “association” and “partnership” are added to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Association and partnership scenarios are continually presented as 
certainties, when over the years all successive federal governments and 
those of the other provinces have always rejected the sovereignist 
option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, results of the last referendum are most revealing. 
A few months before October 30, 1995, an opinion poll indicated that 80% 
of Quebeckers, including 61% of yes side supporters, said they were 
“proud to be both Quebeckers and Canadians”. Yet, 49% of Quebeckers 
voted in favour of sovereignty on that day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other results also enlighten us on the ambiguity that was knowingly 
fostered by secessionist leaders with regard to their option. 
According to a poll conducted at the very end of the referendum 
campaign, 80% of Quebeckers who intended to vote yes thought that, 
should the yes side win, Quebec would automatically continue to use the 
Canadian dollar as its currency. Close to 80% believed that economic 
ties with Canada would remain unchanged, while 50% thought they would 
continue to use the Canadian passport, and 25% believed Quebec would 
continue to elect federal members of Parliament. Another poll showed 
that close to 20% of yes voters thought that a sovereign Quebec could 
continue to be a Canadian province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you probably remember, the question asked in the referendum held 
on October 30, 1995 was based on the tripartite agreement of June 12, 
1995. Unlike in 1980, when the question was made public five months 
before the referendum, the PQ government released the 1995 question only 
six weeks before the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement reached by Parizeau, Bouchard and Dumont was quite 
extraordinary in its own way. The government pledged that, once the 
secessionist plan was approved by a majority of people, it would wait 
one year before proclaiming sovereignty and would conduct negotiations 
on the infamous economic and political association project with the rest 
of Canada. However, as Mr. Parizeau would later say, nothing would have 
prevented Quebec from deciding that the negotiations were going nowhere, 
thus leaving it free to make a move whenever it deemed it appropriate to 
do so. This is sure a nice example of transparency and of respect toward 
Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not dwell on the remarkable unworkability of the 1995 
sovereignist project. I simply want to stress the confusion that it 
generated among Quebeckers. A confusing and convoluted question almost 
resulted in the breakup of the country. We do not want the fate of our 
country to be dependent on tricks or semantics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want clarity, not confusion. The democratic process does not 
truly fulfil its purpose if we try to confuse voters instead of helping 
them make a decision. Voters must understand the consequences of their 
decision, and it is precisely the role of the government to make sure 
they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in favour of democracy, but we also trust Quebeckers' 
judgment. Quebeckers played a major role in the building of our country. 
They have left their mark throughout history, thanks to their 
determination and their drive. Canada provides them with even greater 
opportunities. Quebeckers excel in many areas.

firmly believe that, in a democratic process that would respect all of

across the way why the government was not interested in bringing 
before the people of Quebec the Calgary declaration as proposed 
by nine of the country's ten premiers. Why did the Liberal 
government not choose that opportunity to go before the people of 
Quebec and get a feeling from them on how they felt on those 
seven points that the rest of the country are prepared to 
consider with the issue of unity? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin:</B> Mr. Speaker, that issue was raised by the 
provinces and it must be resolved in conjunction with the provinces. We 
would have liked the Quebec government to consider it. Unfortunately, it 
has refused to do so. Let us hope it changes its mind and decides to 
submit this issue to Quebeckers.

of support for the Liberal Party of Canada, particularly its Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, in Quebec. Think about a former leader of the 
Liberal Party, Mr. Ryan, and the present leader, Mr. Johnson, two former 
leaders of the no side who faced us with complete honesty and with all 
their talent, both in 1980 and in 1995.

constitutional advisor to Robert Bourassa in Charlottetown in 1992. 
Think about Cardinal Turcotte—and that tops it all—who, despite 
his very delicate functions, has had the courage to take a stand in this 
debate, knowing what kind of criticism he would draw because of that. 
Where does the Liberal Party of Canada stand in Quebec at this moment

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley,

introduce its 1998-99 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major points of interest will be what this Liberal 
government intends to do with any budget surplus. Liberals appear 
to want to put 50% of any surplus into increased government 
spending with the rest being divided between debt reduction and 
tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the question is what do Canadians want?  I put this question 
to my constituents and their opinion differs vastly from the 
Liberals' plan.  With over 2,000 responses to my survey, the 
average response of the people of South Surrey—White 
Rock—Langley was to have 55% of the surplus going toward debt 
reduction, 36% going to tax relief and less than 9% going to 
increased government spending.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Several federal government employees in my riding of Sault Ste.

Canadian policy they once joined with the NDP in warning against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Liberals, Canada has become a country of no choices. 
Unlike the hope held out by the alternative federal budget and 
other proposals for change, the Liberals' Canada is a country not 
able to freely choose its own future.  If it is not the Americans 
it is the money lenders and bond holders or NAFTA or the WTO, and 
soon it will be the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Liberals, globalization is an ever tightening but 
apparently welcome vice that constricts our ability to be 
ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the NDP, globalization must become the opportunity for a 
truly global community in which Canadian values proliferate 
rather than are exterminated.  We must create a global economy

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
latest statistics show that the Newfoundland school system is 
facing a sharply declining enrolment.  Total enrolment this year 
is down by 4,597 students or 4.3%.  This enrolment drop is 
largely related to out migration of families with children, 
families in which parents have left home to find work elsewhere 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After nearly 50 years in Confederation my province still has an 
unemployment rate more than double the national average.  That 
out migration is currently at 9,200 people per year and is 
continually going up. 
As a result, whole communities have been decimated leaving only 
seniors in many areas.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

into the night and cabinet apparently discussed it this morning, 
but some critical questions remain to be answered by the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If diplomacy fails and force is to be used against Saddam

objective is.  Is it to take out weapons factories or is it 
something bigger?

is successful?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

a diplomatic resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that parliament has expressed its views, we as the 
government decided that this morning that there will be support 
coming from Canada.  There will be a frigate and Hercules 
airplanes going there.  There will be some Canadians on board 
United States AWACS aircraft.  I can inform the House of what has 
been decided to offer to the coalition.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Last night, Mr. Speaker, the weakest presentation made in the

said nothing had been ruled out, nothing had been ruled in, and 
had nothing much more to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the American secretary of defence appeared before the

of the Department of National Defence? 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of National Defence is a minister who is 
responsible enough to wait for a decision of the cabinet before 
announcing something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just told the Leader of the Opposition of the plan 
concerning Canadian participation at the moment.  I have talked 
about a frigate.  I have talked about the Hercules airplanes and

surveillance of the area. 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

that our personnel have been committed to support action with a 
clear mission, a clear vision of their role and adequate 
resources to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time for these vague answers and vague assurances has 
passed.  Will the Prime Minister provide that plan, that mission 
and that resource detail, or will we find out about it from CNN

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

very modern ship and very well equipped with very capable 
officials on board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hercules airplanes will be serving the forces personnel. 
They have used them many times in the past and know what to do 
with them.  Those who are already on the AWACS planes will keep 
doing what they are doing now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

initiative.  We have provided those families in which there are 
disabled Canadians with lower taxes.  We will continue in this 
vein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that the great reward for the clean-up of the

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FEDERAL COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
growing number of analysts, commentators and editorial writers, as well 
as Daniel Johnson, leader of the Liberal Party, fail to understand the 
attitude of the federal government, which refuses to compensate Quebec 
for damages to its hydro-electric system. They all question the 
President of the Treasury Board's restrictive interpretation of the 
compensation program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister recognize that the provisions of the 
federal compensation program give his government the latitude to 
compensate Quebec? 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
was a disaster in the Saguenay region and another one in Manitoba, and 
the rules were applied to the satisfaction of both provincial 
governments at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Companies like Hydro-Quebec do not qualify. Government assistance 
is targeted to small and medium size businesses and to farmers. In the 
case of the Saguenay region, for example, no money was given to Alcan or 
to the paper mills that sustained damages, because government assistance 
is not for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eligibility rules are very clear. They were established in 1988 
when Lucien Bouchard was a minister in the Conservative government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
guide clearly says that the federal government has the latitude to 
compensate hydro companies. It is not the words but only the section 
numbers that were changed in 1988. I suppose it is a subtlety that the 
Prime Minister fails to grasp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, will the Prime Minister recognize that the 
decision on whether or not to compensate hydro companies for the damages 
they sustained is up to the federal government? In other words, the ball 
is in the government's court. Will it respond to the requests that have 
been made? 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are applying the rules set out by the Conservative government in 1988, 
when Lucien Bouchard was a minister in that government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we did not compensate hydro companies for any damages 
sustained as a result of the flooding in the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean 
region. It is very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our role is not to help large corporations. Our role is to help 
small businesses and farmers. That system worked well in the Saguenay 
region and, last year, in Manitoba, and we intend to continue with what

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the President of the Treasury Board repeated his 
refusal to compensate Quebec, giving the excuse that Hydro-Québec 
is a very large company able to pay for the cost of its own 
repairs.  The federal policy manual states that the federal 
government may compensate large companies, and I quote:  “In an 
exceptional situation, if the minister thinks it justified”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand that the ice storm and the damage to the 
hydroelectric system are not exceptional enough for the government 
to feel it is justified in taking action? 
<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have made it clear to the Government of Ontario, which also 
sustained considerable damage, that Hydro Ontario was no more 
eligible than Hydro-Québec.  We are not compensating large 
companies.  We will not be providing assistance to Bell Telephone, 
which also sustained enormous losses in Quebec during the last 
storm, because the system provides that companies that can insure 
themselves must cover their own damages.  Companies such as Hydro-Québec 
and Bell Telephone can afford to insure themselves against 
disasters. 
<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am quite 
surprised to see the Prime Minister make no distinction between 
Hydro-Québec and a private company not owned by Quebeckers.  There 
is a big difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles underlying federal assistance would allow the 
government to pay compensation because, one, electricity is an 
essential public service; two, there is a clause to compensate 
large companies; and, three, there is a precedent in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, then, is the government stubbornly refusing to compensate 
Quebec? 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the government thinks that companies such as Bell Telephone, Hydro 
Ontario and Hydro-Québec, the latter having made $700 million, 
could have spent a few million dollars on insurance and not come to 
the federal government for money.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Prime Minister admits that he has been in touch with the 
President of the United States, the Prime Minister of Great Britain and 
the President of France in the last 72 hours, I would like to know if,

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the ceasefire was signed, Saddam Hussein agreed to allow the

by an admission of his Minister of Foreign Affairs yesterday who 
said there was division within the security council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister will know that there are more chances of 
success and fewer chances of bloodletting and children and

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say, though, that as I went through the facts 
yesterday, there are some other facts the House should consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, for the last week there have been only allegations 
and unfounded innuendoes.  The Reform Party has been undermining 
public servants.  It has been challenging duly elected chiefs and 
councils with no evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote the hon. member who said: “It really is easy to draw 
these conclusions, however, we do not have the evidence”.  No 
evidence.

we will deal with the facts?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the minister 
knows that quote has been taken right out of context.  The 
evidence is very clear that Mr. Starlight wrote to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That letter, with her stamp on it, is sitting in Chief Roy 
Whitney's office as we speak.  How can the minister say that the 
letter was not conveyed by her or by any official in her 
department?  How can the minister say this confidential letter 
did not come from her department when her own stamp is on it?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

responsible approach we are taking with regard to this letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to ask what the motivation is of this opposition.  I 
guess it puts me in mind of a comment made by a political 
forebear of mine, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who said that it is easy 
to raise prejudices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his recent book John Ralston Saul, a Canadian philosopher, 
says it is a major responsibility of those with power not to 
raise prejudices.  I believe that is why we are on this—

the start of the debate regarding Bill C-28 and a possible conflict of

people in this country need the help of all of us.  When I look 
at the agenda of the party opposite, it would cut $920 million 
per year from my department's budget.  That is money for

we acknowledge and we share the concerns of Canadians that we

in this country.  That is why this government supports the

just this year increased the cash floor in the transfers to the

alternative federal budget also shows that the $1.9 billion 
needed to fight child poverty can be found.  The Minister of

priority.  But it appears that the government is backing down and 
will recycle yet again last year's $850 million.

that are overcrowded and some of the places which require

have money to reinvest.  If some provinces choose to cut taxes 
instead of making those reinvestments, that should be taken into 
account.

Mr. Speaker, we are getting the same old malarkey.  They take 
dollars and give back pennies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crisis in health care funding is a result of the money that 
has been taken out by this government.  Will this minister ensure 
Canadians that we will have standards in place to ensure that the 
quality of health care is not compromised?  Will this minister 
agree today to work with the provinces to achieve a health care 
guarantee on standards of enforcement mechanisms so Canadians can 
enjoy the same standard of health care right across the 
provinces?

not pursue that quality the way he and his party suggested by 
removing cash transfers to the provinces and by removing 
altogether any influence on the part of the federal government. 
That is not the way to go.  We shall do it the Liberal way.  We

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. 
Many people in B.C. and across Canada are concerned about the 
report and recommendations of the Citizenship and Immigration Act 
and how it will affect the lives of Canadians. How will the 
minister ensure that the opinions of Canadians are heard and will 
affect the decisions of this report?

started because several Canadians have already responded and are 
writing us daily and consulting our Internet site.

consultation, from Vancouver to Halifax, beginning in late February 
so as to hear from the largest possible number of stakeholders

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all the people out there who just joined us, I would like to 
read the motion put forward by the hon. member from the Bloc Quebecois. 
The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House recognize the consensus in Quebec that it is 
for Quebeckers to decide freely their own future. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion seems to deal with the concept of 
self-determination, which is not without controversy, but is 
usually considered as being fair and democratic. However, we will 
not be able to support the principle of self-determination as 
long as we do not clearly understand what it implies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a well-known fact that, for the Bloc members, 
self-determination includes the right to a unilateral declaration 
of independence. Separatists have clearly indicated that they 
refuse to consult with the rest of Canada, even if the decisions 
made in their province will have a profound and lasting impact on 
the rest of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also clear that this motion tends to discredit the reference 
to the supreme court, which will start next Monday. Some people are 
opposed to any discussion about the possible legal restrictions to 
secession. This reference to the supreme court to seek the opinion of 
the highest court in the land on this issue is considered a denial of 
the right to self-determination. 
This shows clearly that, when the Bloc Quebecois and others speak 
about Quebec's right to decide its own future, they are suggesting 
that the rest of Canada is not entitled to participate in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No change as profound and irreversible as Quebec's secession can 
be made unilaterally.  It can certainly be argued that, after a 
vote on sovereignty, in which a clear question is put to the 
public, and as long as 50% plus one of the population is in 
favour, Quebec will be able to enter into negotiations with the 
federal government.  The people of Quebec have the right to 
self-determination as long as these conditions are met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no denying that separatist and federalist leaders in 
Quebec have questioned the government's decision to ask the supreme 
court to rule on a primarily political problem. 
However, general agreement within Quebec's political elite does not 
mean there is broad grassroots support among Quebeckers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However recent comments made by Quebec's political elite have 
suggested that self-determination and the right to declare a 
unilateral declaration of independence are mutually dependent 
self-supporting rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If self-determination includes the right unilaterally to deny 
the northern Cree their expressed desire to remain Canadian, 
their expressed desire to continue to be protected under section 
91 of the Constitution Act, 1867, we cannot in good conscience 
support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be clear that self-determination as it is explicitly 
understood by Bloc members of the House is not supported by the 
natives in Quebec.  They cannot be counted among those who are 
said to be in general agreement with the principle of sovereign 
rule.  Self-determination defined in such broad terms with the 
inclusion of such sweeping political powers is clearly in 
violation of aboriginal rights and is not supported by this group 
of Quebeckers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If self-determination includes the power to unilaterally deny 50 
municipalities in Quebec the right to remain Canadian, we cannot 
in good conscience support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues from the Bloc are acutely and painfully aware that 
there are municipalities across Quebec, each with its own 
democratic mandate, which have voted to remain a part of Canada 
should a yes vote unfortunately occur.  I hope that these 
municipalities and the hundreds of thousands of people they 
represent are not wrongly included in the so-called consensus to 
which this motion makes reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If self-determination is thought to include the right to 
unilaterally secede from the rest of Canada, it is likely that 
very few Quebeckers would support this principle.  There are 
censuses on the right to seek separation from Canada through 
democratic and legal means.  Legitimate democratic means would 
involve seeking a clear indication of support from the people of 
Quebec in a referendum presenting a clear question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal avenue would necessitate that the province of Quebec 
be obliged to enter into negotiations with the rest of Canada to 
determine the terms of separation.  Partition, passports, 
currency and debt allocation are the issues that would require 
open discussion before sovereignty could be achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a tiny minority of Quebeckers who would wish to ignore the 
legal and moral responsibility to settle on the terms of 
separation before a unilateral declaration of independence.  It 
is in response to the position of this tiny minority that the 
supreme court is offering its opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal reference does not affect self-determination unless 
this concept has come to include the right to ignore any legal 
obligations to the vast majority of Canadians who wish to see 
Quebec remain a part of Canada.  To my amazement it would appear 
that there are in fact some members of the House who would adhere 
to this understanding of self-determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a better solution to our unity problems than to concede 
defeat and argue over the process of secession.  We can all work 
together in the House to rebalance the federation.  This is what 
we call the third way.  Members of the House know it well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us join to make Canada work for Quebec, for Alberta and for 
the rest of Canada.  Members of the Bloc do the country a 
disservice with their singular focus on secession.  Canada can 
work.  I pray that we all can work together for this mutual 
beneficial end.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, before 
asking my colleague a question, I would like to apologize to the 
Reform Party for getting elected.  During the last election 
campaign, the Reform Party and its leader recommended electing 
members whose leaders did not come from Quebec.  I am even prouder 
that I was elected with the best leader of all this country's 
political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the thinking is that we will get the courts to sort out 
the constitutional question, I would like to ask my colleague 
whether he still agrees with the advertising in the last election 
campaign that was critical of Quebec's politicians. 
It cost us at least 25 Conservative MPs in Quebec by polarizing the 
vote and insulting all Quebeckers and French Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, we all learn from our 
mistakes.  The message of what was said in those commercials is 
simply what we have said from the beginning of Reform's 
inception, that the west wants in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may not use the same way of getting that message across in 
future and perhaps that could be up for debate.  However most 
people saw that message from Reform's point of view,  We need to 
have all Canadians involved in the constitutional process and in 
any process that involves changing the constitution.  Also the 
leadership of the country has to come from across the country, 
not just from one province and not from just one region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the message we tried to get across.  We continually 
fight for the fact that the west wants in.  In this case let us 
try to represent regions effectively.  That is what Reform stands 
for. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
carefully to what my colleague from the Reform Party said. I think that 
he is champion of federalism, especially on the Quebec partitioning 
issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT63"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT63"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1515

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much speculation these days around the fact that, if 
Quebec can part from Canada, it too can be divided or partitioned. The 
example of the Cree is often given. I would advise my federalist friends 
to be very careful with this very dangerous argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask my colleague two questions. At least Quebec is light 
years ahead of the rest of Canada in recognizing aboriginal peoples. In 
fact, there is a National Assembly resolution providing for the 
recognition of 11 aboriginal peoples. Will the Reform Party join the 
Bloc Quebecois in recognizing for instance the 50 other aboriginal 
peoples elsewhere in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, on the issue of partition, if my hon. colleague agrees that 
Quebec can be divided and the Cree can leave with the northern part of 
Quebec, the same rule should currently apply to Canada. Can the Nisga'a, 
Sahtu, Dogrib and 600 communities in Canada afford to leave, each with 
their little part of Canada? If not, the same is true of Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, specifically what I have 
identified in my speech today is that there have been groups that 
have not only wanted recognition as the hon. member refers to but 
want to remain a part of Canada regardless of what happens in the 
politics of Quebec.  I think that is something the hon. member 
and the Bloc has failed to recognize.  There are Indian groups 
and municipalities that have said that regardless of Quebec's 
secession, they want to remain a part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the Bloc has not addressed or talked about that 
issue at all.  Unfortunately, we do not get any details from the 
Bloc when it even comes to secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer his second question, the fact remains as I said 
earlier to a colleague who asked a question, we in the Reform 
Party are looking at different ways.  We know there are problems 
in Quebec.  There are problems in Alberta and right across this 
country.  That is why we are looking at a third option, something 
that status quo federalists and separatists have not brought to 
the table.  We are looking at rebalancing the powers in this 
country.  We are looking at trying to work with the regions in 
this country to make the federation stronger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I urge my hon. colleague from the Bloc to do is to start 
looking at realistic options to try to build a stronger nation 
for the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have a couple of questions I would like to ask the hon. member. 
I consider him to be a very thoughtful member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this debate actually entails is to find out what the rules 
are for secession.  One fact we do know is that the supreme court 
ruling will not tell us anything that we do not know already.  At 
the end of the day there are no rules when countries split up 
either domestically or internationally.  There are no 20 points 
which we can actually put down on a piece of paper and say that 
they are the rules if there is a yes vote in any referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of debate and this kind of question the government is 
posing to the supreme court essentially privatizes the political 
leadership of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member again, because I understand him 
to be a reasonable and thoughtful individual, about whether he 
agrees with the ads which the Reform Party utilized in the last 
election and should they ever be used again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question I want to ask the member is whether he will 
distance himself away from Ezra Levant's comments in terms of 
what he stated in the Calgary <I>Sun</I> on October 30, 1995, on 
the eve before the country could have actually broken up.  Mr. 
Levant makes comments such as “Say no to other special interest 
groups.  Is it any wonder that Canada has so many special 
interest groups?  After all, they see Quebec's payoff for being a 
constant nag.  If we kicked out Quebec, we might then have the 
fortitude to tackle Canada's other ethnic separatists, natives”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of extremism is not what actually adds to the 
political process.  I ask the member if he will distance himself 
away from these comments.  Also, if he were the leader of his 
party, would this person be under his employ? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think I made myself 
quite clear when I answered the other question from a member of 
the hon. member's party.  The fact remains that the message was 
quite clear in those commercials.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether the presentation is going to be used again is up for 
debate.  Personally, I was not happy with the presentation, but 
we learn from our mistakes, as we have seen from many members of 
other parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key is that the message was clear.  It is something that the 
west wants.  We have to try to represent other regions of this 
country equally in the federal Parliament.  That is exactly what 
we are going to stand by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer his other question, it is interesting that the 
Conservatives have brought this out of their sack of goodies. The 
fact of the matter is Ezra Levant was not a part of the party 
when he was writing for the <I>Sun</I>, like many other 
journalists in this country when they report on politics.  They 
are allowed to voice their opinions and they are allowed to do so 
freely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the hon. member is not suggesting that we should have any 
censorship on the media or gag laws.  That is something which 
most members of this House would fight against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is, regardless of what he said as a 
journalist, it does not reflect his current work for our party. I 
am really upset that the member did not paint the proper picture. 
The fact is that he was a journalist when he made those 
comments.

practice speaking French in this House as he does on a regular basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He probably noticed recently that, in Quebec, federalists are 
joining with sovereignists to state that the Quebec people should decide 
their future, that the supreme court has no business interfering with 
the freedom of speech of Quebeckers and that it is up to them to settle 
the matter in a future referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what the position of the Reform Party is on 
this issue in light of the emerging consensus among Quebeckers, 
including federalists like Claude Ryan and Daniel Johnson. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, I addressed that point 
somewhat in my speech when I said that even though there may be 
some sense of consensus in Quebec, the fact of the matter is that 
there is not a clear consensus as to whether first of all Quebec 
has actual support for separation from the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Conservative member pointed out, in the Constitution 
currently there is no legal provision for any province to 
separate from the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly we need to have some legal parameters as to what this 
means.  That is why we have supported the reference to the court.

opportunity.  I have spent the last three months working with the

emotions that run to a high level when we talk about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion the Bloc has introduced is “that this House 
recognize the consensus in Quebec that it is for

decision on their own without consideration from the rest of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear to me that this motion has arisen because of the 
three questions that have been put before the Supreme Court of 
Canada to make a recommendation on. I want to clarify what those 
questions are for the Canadian public listening to this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three questions that have been put before the Supreme Court 
are: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One, under the Constitution of Canada can the national assembly, 
legislature or Government of Quebec effect the secession of 
Quebec from Canada unilaterally? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two:  Does international law give the national assembly, 
legislature or Government of Quebec the right to effect the 
secession of Quebec from Canada unilaterally? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three:  In the event of a conflict between domestic and 
international law on the right of the national assembly, 
legislature or Government of Quebec to effect the secession of 
Quebec from Canada unilaterally, which would take precedence in 
Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the question is not whether or not Quebec 
can raise the issue of separation, that Quebeckers are not in a 
position to say by referendum that they want to secede from 
Canada.  The question is do they have the right to do so without 
the input from the rest of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the analogy has been made before but the analogy of a 
divorce is very apropos in this case.  A member of a marriage can 
state that they want to leave the marriage, that they want a 
divorce but there are laws in our country that help that process 
to proceed, that have to be followed for that divorce to go 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be a mutual agreement on the division of assets and 
liabilities.  If a mutual agreement between the two parties 
cannot be reached, then the intercession of the courts is 
required. One partner cannot say that they are taking the house 
and the kids and walk away from the marriage.  If it is not 
agreed upon, the courts enter the situation and the courts decide 
whether it is fair for one spouse to take the house and one 
spouse to take the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was not law in this matter and in all other matters, 
then what we would have in this country is anarchy.  I do not 
think anyone wants to see that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers can decide whether they want to leave, but the laws 
must be followed.  Even the former Quebec premier, Jacques 
Parizeau, understood the rule of law when writing the draft bill 
that he introduced in 1994. I would like to quote two sections of 
that draft bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In section 10 he acknowledged that laws passed by the Parliament 
of Canada shall remain in force until amended or repealed by the 
national assembly.  It is very clear that he believed in the 
existence of laws to give some direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing that he acknowledged and which I want to quote 
was, “In so far as the negotiations unfold in a positive 
fashion, the national assembly will declare the sovereignty of 
Quebec after an agreement is reached on the partnership treaty”. 
After an agreement is reached.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that he did not mean an unilateral declaration 
when he recognized the need for an agreement with the other 
partner.  I do not think it is possible for the Bloc to suggest 
that Quebec can separate unilaterally and not allow or extend 
that to parts of Quebec that could then unilaterally separate 
from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Edmonton—Strathcona brought up the aspect of 
the aboriginal communities and others who have specifically 
indicated that they do not want to leave Canada and that they 
would make the decision to stay in Canada given that option.  For 
the Bloc to suggest that Quebec has the right to unilaterally 
leave Canada but not extend that to members of the Quebec 
province, be they the Cree in the north or other municipalities, 
is hypocrisy in the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unilateral declaration of independence would set a precedent for 
the Quebec Cree, for the Outaouais and the island of Montreal to 
vote on partition.  If separatists wish to ignore the decision of 
the Supreme Court of Canada, they set the precedent for the 
partitionists to ignore any Quebec court ruling.  If Quebec 
separatists believe that this is purely a political decision to 
be made solely by the people of Quebec, they are setting a 
precedent for the partitionists to make purely political 
decisions made solely by the people in the affected regions of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real myth that there is this thing called the rest of 
Canada that Quebec could negotiate with.  Separatists are living 
a pipe dream if they believe that an independent Quebec would be 
able to make a negotiation and an agreement with the rest of 
Canada.  If Quebec were to separate there is no guarantee that 
the rest of Canada would remain intact.  No one can predict what 
would happen in the aftermath of the breakup of the country, but 
none of the realistic proposals include a rosy scenario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure separatists that if they were to be successful in 
separation there would be very little willingness in British 
Columbia to welcome Quebec as an equal partner.  However British 
Columbians are more than willing to accommodate Quebec within 
Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully the country will never come to a point where Quebec 
decides to leave.  Hopefully the separatists will never get a 
majority.  It is clear to me and others that people in Quebec are 
looking at a third option.  People in Quebec are realizing that 
separation is not the answer to getting rid of the status quo. It 
is clear to me that people throughout the country, including 
British Columbia, feel very strongly that Canada is worth 
fighting for and Canada is worth making changes so that all 
provinces, all regions, have a much greater say in their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although maybe not perfect, the Calgary declaration was brought 
by nine premiers to the Canadian public to talk about other 
options:  the devolution of power, the equality of citizens and 
the equality of provinces.  Hopefully this attempt by Canadians 
to talk about the unity issue in a positive way, in a way that 
all regions including Quebec can benefit from, will be 
successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of my work with the B.C. unity committee I can say 
that Canadians are willing to talk and make concessions. 
Canadians are willing to accommodate the differences in our 
societies and in our country under the understanding that all 
Canadians are equal and that all provinces have equal status 
within Confederation.

questions and comments, I would like to offer a clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have checked in <I>Hansard</I> and found that the hon. member for 
Edmonton—Strathcona had indeed said he would be sharing his speaking 
time. I think this settles the matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, we 
will have to address three important elements in the whole 
scenario of the right of Quebec to separate from the rest of 
Canada.  When Quebec entered into Confederation it became a part 
of a partnership.  At the time there were no terms concerning 
what would happen in the event the partnership would come to an 
end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, to that extent any one partner of all 10 partners in the 
partnership would have to seek the consensus of the rest of the 
partners, or at least the consensus of the majority of the 
partners, before the partner departs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second one concerns the notion of native people in Quebec 
who entered into a historical agreement with the rest of Canada 
of the day.  The agreement these people had with the rest of 
Canada has to continue to remain intact notwithstanding what 
would happen to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, if we were to move with the assumption that Quebec is a 
level of government that has a right to decide on its own what 
happens to it, we would have to look at the third level of 
government, the municipal governments in Quebec in urban settings 
or urban cities such as the city of Montreal and other cities in 
western Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to move forward with the notion that Quebec is a 
level of government that has a right to decide once it consults 
its people, the city of Montreal as a level of government would 
have the right to consult with its people and make a decision 
based on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue is irrelevant now in light of what has happened 
around the world.  Borders are collapsing at an incredible speed, 
faster than the speed of light.  People are coming together 
around the world faster than ever before.  The European Union is 
now moving toward political, monetary, economic and social unions 
where language is no longer an issue.  People to people relations 
are becoming the prime element of our global village. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent, rather than continuing to frighten the people of 
Quebec and the small, medium and large businesses of Quebec with 
uncertainties, we as Quebeckers, as Canadians, must work together 
to ensure that society as a whole is meeting the needs of our 
people.  There is nothing one level of government in Quebec, the 
provincial level of government, cannot do now within 
Confederation.  It can do just about anything it would like to 
do.  It has control over education, labour, health, immigration 
and transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it the Government of Quebec wants to do and cannot do in 
the present Confederation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is obvious a question 
was not posed.  It was just comments.  However I agree with the 
hon. member for Ottawa Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very serious issue.  It is something that Canadians are 
very able and wanting to address.  Canadians want the issue 
settled.  They do not want to be dealing with the unity issue 20 
years from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my hon. colleagues to let us get on with settling the 
issue once and for all. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and 
Africa), Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, as I was saying before, the 
government would oppose this motion but not because of its terms. 
It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House recognize the consensus in Quebec that it is for 
Quebeckers to decide their own future. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is fine. 
It is because of the fact that the Bloc Quebecois refused to give 
unanimous consent this morning to our proposed subamendment which 
would roughly translate as being that Quebeckers should decide 
their future but with respect for the rule of law and of 
democracy for all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa I have had 
the opportunity to meet with people in places as diverse as Peru, 
Honduras, Brazil, Uganda and Rwanda.  Visiting places like those 
has made me even more aware of how fortunate we are in Canada 
with our high standard of living and our comprehensive social 
safety net. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some cases my visits have shown me just how important respect 
for individual rights and democratic values are and the crucial 
role that the rule of law and an independent judiciary play in 
upholding both.  These travels have already driven the message 
home.  If Canadians, with our virtually unparalleled good 
fortune, are not capable of settling our differences and building 
our future together, it does not bode well for many other people 
around the world.  A member of parliament from a southern African 
country said to me a year ago that if this country could not stay 
together how could his own country stay together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having written extensively on relations between western Canada 
and central Canada I know that learning to live together will 
remain a constant challenge for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly an ongoing task but respect for differences is a 
hallmark of the country.  In my own province of Alberta, first 
nations, British and French settlers have learned to live side by 
side.  They were joined by Ukrainians, Poles, Germans and people 
of many other nationalities, many of whom were fleeing 
persecution or economic deprivation in their own homelands.  We 
have welcomed a new generation of immigrants who are often from 
the Pacific Rim and more recently from Latin America and the 
Caribbean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This history has made Canadians more open to cultural diversity 
than perhaps anywhere else on the face of the earth.  It is part 
of who we are.  I strongly believe that we can overcome the 
difficulties of today and build a Canada for tomorrow that is 
even stronger, more united and entirely secure in its diversity 
because it is part of who we are as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been reminded that I am sharing my time. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My current portfolio makes me keenly aware of Canada's presence on 
the international scene. This presence reflects our commitment to 
democratic values and the lessons our country's true diversity has 
taught us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a Canadian, John Humphrey, who 50 years ago drafted the 
initial Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which, as predicted by 
Eleanor Roosevelt, was to become humanity's Magna Carta. 
The Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs stated recently before an 
American audience, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our democratic tradition, our commitment to the rule of law and our 
bilingual, multicultural society have prepared us well to help 
Eastern European countries and the former Soviet Union make the 
transition to democracy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, we are doing our very best around the world to 
convince governments to support human rights and the values inherent in 
a democratic regime. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be an enormous shame if Canada, which has served as 
an inspiration for so many countries, were to crumble?  I do not 
believe it will.  The vast majority of Quebec, the Québécois and 
Québécoises, will remain committed to building their future 
within Canada; but if they should decide otherwise, it must be 
with all the facts before them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing would be more sad for the country than if a quarter of 
our population were to leave “in confusion without a legal 
framework to overcome our divisions in a dangerous ambiguity that 
is unacceptable in democracy”, to quote my ministerial 
colleague. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a province which is one of the engines of economic 
growth and innovation in Western Canada. However, Alberta is also the 
cradle of pioneer spirit in Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, in Alberta, we appreciate the kind of determination 
needed to overcome difficult situations. So I do appreciate the efforts 
required of French speaking Quebeckers not only to protect a mainly 
francophone society on this continent, but also to allow it to prosper. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is no small achievement.  Now is the first time in the 
history of humanity that almost an entire continent, North 
America excluding Mexico, is more or less unilingual and more or 
less unilingual in what has become a major international lingua 
franca, the language of business, the language of the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of this, since the beginning of Confederation, Quebec 
has never been as francophone as it is today.  In 1997 no less 
than 94% of Quebeckers can express themselves in French.  This is 
a triumph for Quebec and it is an enrichment for the whole of 
Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know solidarity is a value dear to Quebeckers. It is also 
important to Albertans. Those of you who believe that Alberta is a 
bastion of rough-edged individualists might be surprised to learn that 
it has the highest percentage of volunteers of all provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a larger scale, Canadians from sea to sea feel they belong to 
the same community. It could be said that it is when tragedy strikes 
that our belief in solidarity shines through; such was the case during 
the recent ice storm, the floods in Manitoba and in the Saguenay in 
Quebec, and the tornado which ripped through my home town of Edmonton in 
1987. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time it was obvious that Canadians care for one another and 
love their fellow citizens. 
Is there a more telling sign of the links uniting the prairies to Quebec 
than the decision by the head of the Saguenay relief fund to send $1.5 
million to flood victims in the Red River area in Manitoba? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we really want to see these ties broken by the secession of 
Quebec?  At an international level this solidarity is of vital 
importance as well.  Our two official languages give us an edge 
when it comes to competing internationally. They are two of the 
various official languages of the European Union, a market into 
which we are seeking to expand.  Both are recognized languages at 
the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>English is the official language of 56 countries, and French of 
33.  Our country benefits for membership in both la francophonie 
and the Commonwealth.  It should be noted that our image abroad 
is strengthened by the important role that Canada plays in 
international peacekeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a Canadian, former prime minister Lester B. Pearson, 
who came up with the idea of an international peacekeeping force 
for which he won the Nobel peace prize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that time, thousands of our fellow Canadians have served 
on international peacekeeping missions.  Our bilingual capacity 
has been invaluable in countries like Haiti, Cameroon and Rwanda 
and in helping our troops to work with peacekeepers from other 
nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our peacekeeping is good for Canada's international image.  The 
fact that we are a united country gives us more economic weight. 
Together we are strong enough to be a member of the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All provinces benefit from this membership.  Domestically, all 
employees benefit from being part of a large internal market. 
The importance of international trade was underlined recently by 
an economic who estimates that when adjustments are made for 
distance and size of market, Canada's provincial trade is some 14 
times more with each than with American states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec, for example, imports about $33 billion worth of goods 
and services from other provinces.  Our economic union, our 
international strengths are important building blocks for the 
future of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To position Canada optimally for the challenges of the coming 
millennium, we must draw on the strengths and diversity it brings 
all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was delighted when the premiers met last September in Alberta. 
They stressed the importance of diversity in drawing upon 
statements and principles that can serve as well for the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the premier of our smallest province, P.E.I., put it, the 
Calgary declaration sends a positive signal to Quebec by 
recognizing the province's unique character but it does so within 
a framework that mirrors the ideals of a great many Canadians 
from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a celebration of Canadian diversity with an emphasis on 
the importance of provincial and individual equality.  The 
declaration of Calgary and the broad public relations it has 
engendered can also be positive steps toward national 
reconciliation and a stronger future together.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the speech of the hon. member, who is a minister 
as well as a lawyer. He is extremely familiar with the Canadian justice 
system. I liked his serious speech. However, I would like him to look a 
little further at what is currently going on in the justice system, and 
especially at the use that the federal government, of which he is a 
minister, is making of the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if he had the opportunity to hear me this morning 
when I made my speech where I tried to demonstrate in the 10 minutes 
allotted to me that, since 1981, the supreme court, with the unilateral 
repatriation of the Constitution, has been more than a tribunal that was 
there to interpret the law. With these decisions, since 1981 and 1982, 
the supreme court judges became legal scholars; they became tools for 
the federal government to centralize more powers at the federal level. 
Let us just think about the veto that was taken away from Quebec in 
1982. In 1983, in trade and economy, there were some extremely important 
judicial precedents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989, there was the General Motors case, where provinces were 
told this is not your jurisdiction; everything at the interprovincial 
level is under federal jurisdiction. There were decisions in 1990 and in 
1993. 
Recently, there was the Hydro-Québec case, where Hydro-Québec was told 
that environmental studies were not their concern, but under federal 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each time Quebec went before the Supreme Court of Canada because it 
had no choice, because it was taken there, even about the language law, 
even about extremely important institutions in Quebec, it came out 
weakened. I would like the member, as a lawyer, as a law professional 
who looks at what is going on in the supreme court, to give me an answer 
if he has reviewed the supreme court's decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like him 
to explain to me why decisions made by Quebec's courts of appeal, 
superior courts that come before the Supreme Court of Canada are 
reversed six times out of ten by the tribunal known as the Supreme Court 
of Canada. This is the case for Quebec. 
But when it comes to decisions made by courts in other provinces, they 
are reversed by the Supreme Court of Canada only four times out of ten. 
Why is that? I would like him to explain this to me. Why is it that the 
supreme court treats Quebeckers and the whole Quebec justice system in 
such a way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm. His comments are very eloquent. I certainly hope 
judges will read them and people will reflect on them. The hon. member 
is well aware that, in West Germany, there is a constitutional court 
made up of eight judges. Four of them are appointed by the Länders, and 
four by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a federal system, I personally think we should have a court 
whose members are appointed by both sides. I am convinced the hon. 
member and the people in my region gave some thought to this issue. We 
hope that, in the near future, the provinces, including Quebec of 
course, will have the right to appoint half of the judges. It could be 
that the people appointed by the two sides might be perceived as being, 
shall we say, less neutral. I was very interested in the hon. member's 
comments.

also very pleased to address the motion moved by the Bloc Quebecois. 
First, let me say that I intend to oppose this motion. However, I would 
like to explain why I hope Quebec will never take a chance and go for 
the secessionist gamble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For obvious reasons, French speaking communities in the other 
provinces have special ties with Quebeckers. We speak the same language 
and we may share more intimately certain episodes of our history. 
As a Canadian and a francophone, I am obviously concerned by the 
political situation in Quebec, and I hope that province will continue to 
be part of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are of course many similarities between French speaking 
Quebeckers and francophones from other parts of Canada. However, the 
context in which we live is very different. Francophones who live 
outside Quebec are in a minority position in three ways. They are a 
minority on the continent, in their country and in their province. 
French speaking Quebeckers are also in a minority on the continent and 
in their country, but they form a majority in their province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Linguistic and cultural insecurity can partly explain the desire of 
some Quebeckers to opt for secession. We francophones living outside 
Quebec are particularly apt to understand this feeling of insecurity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, however, that the French language is not threatened in 
Quebec and that it is becoming even more prevalent in that province. 
Data from the last census shows that Quebec is more francophone than 
ever and that the future of francophones in Quebec have never been so 
promising. We can only be thrilled about the vitality of the French 
language in Quebec because, as francophones outside Quebec, we also 
benefit from this strengthening of the francophone community in our 
country. What affects Quebeckers affects us as well. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My community has been called on to face special challenges. The 
linguistic and cultural uncertainty experienced by Quebeckers is 
felt by us even more intensely.  We believe in solidarity among 
the country's francophones and we have always counted on Quebec's 
influence within the country to ensure francophone communities 
from coast to coast to coast the cultural vitality needed for 
their development.  That is why we oppose Quebec secession.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of our country has been marked from the start with a 
French presence that has influenced our collective journey. Our language 
is part of our Constitution. The Official Languages Act recognizes our 
country's linguistic duality and prescribes the use of both official 
languages in every institution of the Canadian Parliament and 
government. As for the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, it 
ensures the growth of the French language and culture, along with the 
many initiatives implemented by the Canadian government to this end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe this official recognition to generations of francophones 
from coast to coast who asserted their rights. That does not mean that 
justice was always easily achieved. As is the case with any minority, 
the historical journey of francophones outside Quebec had its dark 
moments. 
We still have to assert our language rights today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these struggles have created between members of my community 
ties of solidarity that make us strong and proud. And we have confidence 
in our future and in that of our country as a whole. The Canada in which 
I live is no longer the one that existed under Regulation 17 in Ontario. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's francophones are proud of what this country has become. 
They have helped Canada to become what it is today, a country 
distinguished by its openness and its tolerance.  These great 
human values are the essence of Canadian ideals.  Francophones 
and anglophones have learned to live together and to grow in 
mutual respect.  Naturally there have been some obstacles along 
the way but no one can dispute that Canadians have achieved a 
degree of maturity to which Quebeckers have greatly contributed. 
We have achieved this because we have worked together, not 
divided. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody can ask me to be indifferent to the political debate in 
Quebec. By separating from Canada, Quebec would take away a vital part 
of ourselves. Nobody wants to deny the right of Quebeckers to express 
their choice to separate from Canada if they were to do it some day with 
full knowledge of the facts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that they fully understand the consequences of 
the action they are contemplating.  One of these consequences has 
to do with the fate of the francophone minorities in the other 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that, by staying in Canada, Quebec is in that 
much better a position to promote the French fact in all regions of 
the country.  Quebec plays a vital role in our linguistic and 
cultural development, as we too, for our part, help consolidate the 
Canadian French-speaking community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best proof that Canada has never held Quebec back is that 
its language and culture have flourished, to say nothing of 
Canada's promotion of the Quebec culture internationally, so that 
it is now associated with Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>French language and culture are essential elements of the 
Canadian entity.  They strengthen the unique character of Canada. 
While this vitality is due, as I have said before, to the 
determination shown by francophone communities across the 
country, it is also true that the recognition of the French fact 
in this country has also played an important role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together francophones in every region of Canada have succeeded 
in affirming the bilingual character of this country and have 
helped to give it an identity that is expressed in a genuine 
openness to the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian federalism has greatly contributed to the French fact's 
vitality throughout the country.  Canada can reap the benefits of 
its participation in the francophonie.  Quebec also benefits from 
its ties with this country with the different countries of the 
Commonwealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, francophones in Quebec and Canada have made a remarkable 
contribution to building our country.  That contribution stems 
from a vitality specific to each of our communities.  In every 
region francophones are inspired by the same ideal, to make live 
and flourish an identity enriched by their contribution to our 
collective heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I say more about Quebec's exceptional contribution in this 
respect.  Quebec should never feel this country is foreign to it 
because, on the contrary, it has an exceptional place within it. 
Canada would not be Canada without Quebec.  I also think it is 
right to say that Quebec would not be Quebec without Canada.  We 
francophones in other provinces need our fellow citizens of 
Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our ancestors had a great dream: to help francophone 
communities survive in a country whose spaces were as far-reaching 
as its ideals.  Together, we have built a land of tolerance, in 
which each of us can choose our own way of being Canadian without 
apology.  Canadians know that diversity is a strength, not a 
weakness.  It is in large measure to the maturity with which they 
live out this diversity that they owe their international 
reputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one is thinking of forcing Quebeckers to stay within 
Canada.  If I may, however, I will tell them frankly what I think: 
You would be making an irreparable mistake if you were to leave 
Canada.  Why renounce a part of what you are, of what we all are? 
The loss would be everyone's.  Canadians themselves would be 
irremediably diminished, and francophones outside Quebec doubly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together, as francophones from western Canada, the Prairies, 
the territories, Manitoba, Acadia and Quebec, we have shown that 
those who, through their sacrifices, their hopes and their efforts, 
fulfilled the promise that the Fathers of Confederation saw in 
Canada, were right.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to congratulate the member 
opposite for the speech he gave as a francophone outside Quebec. We in 
the Bloc are always moved when we discuss this issue with our colleagues 
opposite.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker's question was just as emotional: “Why would 
Quebeckers want to leave Canada, a country as beautiful and great as our 
ambitions? We can be Canadian any way we want.” That is what he said in 
his speech. We do not have anything against francophones outside Quebec. 
We love them too. But the hon. member forgot to mention that Canada was 
founded by two peoples, the two founding nations as they are called in 
Canadian history books. These two peoples each had their own territory, 
one was called Upper Canada, the other one, Lower Canada, and they have 
become Quebec and Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the beginning of the famous 1867 Confederation. 
After that, more people joined Canada, and the last province to join 
was Newfoundland. I hold no grudge against them, but they had two 
referendums and joined Canada after the third one. This decision was 
made by Newfoundlanders. I do not think my father ever told me 
Quebeckers were consulted in 1949 on the admission of a new province. 
The question that begs to be asked today is this: Why should the rest of 
Canada be consulted today if Quebec wants to separate and go back to the 
situation before it entered into an association with Upper Canada, which 
is now Ontario? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should Quebec want to separate from Canada? That was the 
member's heartfelt cry. Maybe because we do not feel a lot of respect, 
maybe because we want things we cannot get within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the member opposite is this: Why did his government 
choose Plan B, which focuses on repression? 
“If you do this, you will get a slap on the wrist.” In more polite 
terms, the reference to the Supreme Court tells us: “We are going to ask 
a few questions, and the way they are asked, it all means the same 
thing.” For some of us, the questions as phrased call for a certain kind 
of answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask the hon. member why his government or the people in his 
party are not looking for ways to keep Quebec in Canada. During the last 
referendum, the Prime Minister made promises in Verdun. What are they? 
Are they reason enough for Quebeckers to stay? Instead of wasting their 
energy looking for legal tricks to force us to stay in Canada, they 
should look for real solutions. If they do not have any, Quebeckers will 
stay on the same track, and I can assure my hon. colleague I will make 
an excellent neighbour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réginald Bélair:</B> Madam Speaker, I 
hope the hon. member is speaking in the name of his colleagues from the 
Bloc when he says he recognizes at least that there are many affinities 
between French-speaking Quebeckers and francophones outside Quebec 
because we must admit to ourselves and to all Canadians that we, 
francophones outside Quebec, come from the province of Quebec, one way 
or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1925, my father, who incidentally was from Boucherville, settled 
in northern Ontario, so I am a francophone immigrant. Consequently, I 
have no doubt that we have a lot of affinities. The message I conveyed 
in my maiden speech is that I do not understand why Quebec would want to 
separate from Canada since, in my humble opinion, it has benefited just 
as much as the other provinces from being a part of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy and proud to say that I am living proof that it is 
possible to live in Canada, to exercise one's rights, to keep one's 
mother tongue, one's culture and even to blossom. This is why I say to 
Quebeckers: “Make no mistake about it, the best solution for you is 
still to stay in Canada. Think seriously about the consequences”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I had more time to speak. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to 
participate in this debate, which the Bloc Quebecois launched today to 
bring this House to recognize that only the people of Quebec should 
decide their own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also with some emotion that I heard my colleague who has just 
spoken and who is, if I may say so, a francophone outside Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell him that what the people of Quebec want is the 
collective ability to establish their own priorities, to develop their 
potential, and to fight poverty, as it competes annually with 
Newfoundland for the title of poorest province. 
Many Quebeckers are tired of seeing the Quebec government fight with the 
federal government over a budget surplus to which Quebec has contributed 
more than the other provinces, because the Employment Insurance Act was 
especially hard on Quebec and the maritimes and the reduction in 
transfers hurt Quebec more than other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the deficit has been wrestled to the ground, the federal 
government wants to use the money to give scholarships, for example. But 
the political life in Quebec is marked by these endless fights. If only 
this had started six months ago and could be resolved within two years. 
But this is not the case. The truth is that the people of Quebec, who 
are concentrated in what we call the State of Quebec, must usually 
fight with less powerful weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, what we want to say today is that the people of Quebec 
themselves are the driving force behind this democracy. That is a basic 
fact: only the people of Quebec can decide for themselves. If there is 
one thing that we can declare in this House, it is that. The right of 
one people to make its own decisions takes precedence over a Supreme 
Court that was created by another people for its own ends. Always we may 
respect its intentions, we cannot let another people decide what shape 
democracy will take in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the bottom line. We must go to the bottom of things. 
Liberal and Reform members say that if Quebeckers can make the decision, 
then municipalities will have to ask themselves questions. The members 
across the way and beside us do not want to recognize the right of the 
Quebec people, but they are ready to give that same right to 
municipalities which are administrative creations of provincial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear the hon. member and others speak about the Canadian 
dream, I can only see a theoretical Canada where the two languages and 
the two cultures can flourish. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not how things are in real life. The truth is closer to 
what happened in Nagano, the truth is that we had to fight some battles 
for Quebec artists to be able to pursue their careers, because many of 
them receive financial assistance to promote their art throughout 
Europe. The truth is we had to face huge cuts in higher education and we 
will have to fight because they are trying to go over our heads by 
setting up two grants systems. And I could go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate tonight is part of our history, of our evolution. 
Quebeckers and their longing for sovereignty have been around for 
a long time. It is a result of history, but not only of history. 
Our project does not dwell on the past. It is forward-looking. It 
is a result of a socio-economic and democratic project that will 
no longer suffer any obstruction. As I said before, poverty also 
affects a lot of people in Quebec. In education, the needs are 
great and there are many of us—people of my generation and 
others—who are fed up with debates that lead nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before, there is a theoretical Canada, the Canada which 
is said to be the best country in the world, but where the political 
leaders do not care enough about the best country in the world to wonder 
what it would take to keep the other founding nation part of the 
country. The other nation, not just a province. What do they offer us? 
They tell us we should stay in the best country in the world as a 
province just like the others and that we should be very pleased to 
remain in this country and also that we should be very careful if we are 
serious about leaving because they will not let us go so easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Canada only exists in theory. The truth is that if Canadians 
were so concerned about this great country of theirs they would be 
worried. They would finally agree that Quebeckers are a people. They 
would take a look at other federations, not uninational federations, but 
multinational federations, and get concerned. 
But we are faced with the terrible situation of a people governed 
by a government which does not want to face the problems, because 
it is committed to saying that it is the best country in the world, 
a government whose political leader is incapable of looking at what 
could be done, and who knows only how to refuse negotiation of a 
future partnership, and to use threats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Bloc Quebecois has said on numerous occasions is that, 
with its present leadership, Canada is headed—and 
rapidly—toward a dead end. It is amazing to see how few people outside of 
Quebec will say so.  I must say that I am very proud that Claude 
Ryan has acted consistently with what he has done for most of his 
life.  Although I have often disagreed with him, he has taken 
courageous steps in the past, and this is one more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same 
thing goes for Daniel Johnson, Jr. In 1965, his father wrote 
<I>Égalité ou indépendence.</I> In it he said that if there were no 
equality between the two nations, French Canada and English 
Canada, it would be understandable if the French Canadians in 
Quebec were to wish to realize their full potential there, and he 
was not opposed to that.  Daniel Johnson, Jr. sometimes remembers 
that point.  He has stated that the question must be decided in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us, this was a fundamental debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to the Quebec people to determine its future and we 
deeply regret that the federal government has dragged the supreme 
court into it, because the way the question is worded is very 
tricky and neither Quebec nor Canada can get out of it easily, on 
the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This desire of Quebeckers, which we have now expressed a 
number of times in our history, will be forcefully expressed again, 
and you will have helped us in the end.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to ask the member opposite if she would 
care to comment on this.  She mentioned that a lot of what we are 
very proud of in Canada is in theory only.  However, I can think 
of two of the most important votes that I as a member have voted 
on. One was the Newfoundland school question and the other was 
the Quebec school question.  Those votes were a clear 
demonstration that this country and its constitution are willing 
to keep time with current events as they unfold and also to make 
room for an emerging nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member opposite how she could make those 
comments in the face of legislation which has already been 
passed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, I cannot respond for 
Newfoundland, but I can for Quebec and say we wanted to carry out 
this reform a very long time ago.  Had it passed this time in the 
House of Commons—I deeply believe so, and I am not speaking for 
my colleagues—Newfoundland too had a problem, and Quebec could 
have posed its problem in the same process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, you have to understand one thing.  It is a small part 
of the problems we experience as a different people.  When we see 
how Canada is changing and how Quebec is changing, we are forced to 
admit that they are not changing differently, they are growing 
apart.  It is quite legitimate for you to change in one direction, 
as it is for us to change in another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are tired of having to fight over every little thing when 
the matter of jobs is so important as are the issues of fighting 
poverty, education and economic development. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Timmins—James Bay, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, as 
there is not much time left, I shall be brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member for Mercier tell us, first of all, how Quebec 
would go about giving back to the rest of Canada its share of the 
national debt? Also, how would a new Quebec government give money back 
for all that was investment in infrastructure, anything provided by the 
federal government in Quebec, including occupational training? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, this is a very interesting 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell you that the sovereignists in Quebec have been giving 
a great deal of thought to what would happen “after” for quite some 
time. The Bloc Quebecois had been instrumental in defining such terms 
and conditions. Discussions were held, as they were byn the Bourassa 
government in Quebec, at the commission on sovereignty. We have looked 
at negotiating strategies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1995 referendum campaign, a booklet was distributed to 
every Quebec household and this booklet said that, following a victory 
of the yes side in the referendum, the National Assembly would make an 
offer of partnership; this would naturally entail negotiating assets 
because part of these assets are ours.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These matters would be addressed as part of negotiations carried 
out afterwards, but nothing stops us from looking at various scenarios 
together before then. In fact, we would feel it is quite normal to start 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To do so, one must recognize and agree that this offer of 
partnership made after achieving sovereignty may provide the basis for 
settling disputes. Bear in mind that our goal is to maintain an economic 
zone. The various treaties that will have to be signed may require that 
ministers meet on a regular basis, as some sort of political body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, what we want is to be able to pursue our dreams without 
bothering the rest of Canada and for the rest of Canada to stop 
interfering with this pursuit so that we can work in partnership and 
like each other better. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would never 
have thought that I would speak about the very foundation of democracy 
in our society that I considered a democratic one until today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I would be ashamed if I were a Quebecker and an elected 
Liberal member of this government. I will therefore bring to the 
attention of Liberal members elected by Quebeckers the consensus that 
was achieved in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite their allegiance to federalism, their fellow citizens never 
denied the right to decide for themselves the future of Quebec, their 
Quebec. I invite these members to respect their constituents and the 
consensus of the people and of the major political stakeholders, 
including those of the Liberal Party of Quebec, and to support the 
motion moved in this House by the 44 Bloc Quebecois members. 
I address them—you—directly as a part of the Quebec society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision of the Quebec government to respond to the possible 
choice of the people of Quebec in favour of sovereignty is a political 
decision, not a legal one. A court of justice will never be able to 
replace the will of a people. A court will never be able to impose on a 
whole nation a road it did not choose to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, public remarks made by former leaders of the no side fully 
demonstrate that there is a strong consensus in Quebec. I remind this 
House once again of the statements made by Mr. Ryan and Mr. Johnson, 
because I think that, as the day gets closer, it is better to recall the 
essential things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Ryan said: “I support a most elementary principle, namely the 
primacy of democracy over any other consideration in an issue as 
fundamental as determining the future of a nation”. He even stated that 
it would be a tremendous victory for democracy if the Supreme Court 
clearly confirmed that the right to self-determination is fundamental 
and must be respected by all means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Daniel Johnson, leader of the opposition in Quebec and 
leader of the no committee in the 1995 referendum, he said that the 
Supreme Court should not deny Quebec's right to self-determination. And 
I quote: “Quebeckers will decide what will become of them, and it is 
they who must determine the referendum question”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wisest thing the court could do is to give politicians the 
responsibility of finding democratic answers to the questions that were 
submitted to it. 
Quebec politicians have demonstrated their ability to steer the debate 
on Quebec's political future with the utmost respect for democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On many occasions, Canadian politicians have shown respect for the 
approach taken by the people of Quebec. But after the close results of 
the 1995 referendum, the rules have changed. The old rules were no 
longer applicable and valid. That is when the federal government decided 
to set its plan B in motion, that is the hard line strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems clear to me that the future of seven million people cannot 
be decided by nine judges of the Supreme Court of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This misuse of the court by the Prime Minister and his associates 
shows that they seek victory at any cost, regardless of democratic 
principles. Plan B reflects a unitarian vision of federalism, in which 
the historic equality of the two founding nations is scorned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The referral asking the Supreme Court to rule on Quebec's right to 
secede is illegitimate since the federal government's real objective is 
not, as claimed, the respect of the rule of law. The government is using 
that pretence to try to have the Supreme Court judges take part in 
lowdown dirty tricks. This referral is an attempt to fraud democracy. It 
is an attempt to put our democratic institutions under state 
supervision. This referral denies the existence of the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still time for the court to avoid undermining the Quebec 
democratic and political process. In order to do so, Supreme Court 
justices must refuse to answer the questions submitted by the federal 
government. I am referring in particular to the judges from Quebec, 
Chief Justice Antonio Lamer, and Justices L'Heureux-Dubé and Gonthier. 
We urge them to refuse to play the game of a federal government running 
out of arguments and strategies to stop the sovereignist project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I rise in this House to ask Supreme Court judges not to answer 
these questions, it is because the referral to the Supreme Court is a 
basic demonstration of the inability of Canadian federalism to meet 
Quebeckers' historic demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about history, the official one and the other one. 
Historically, Quebec's gains were made within the political sphere, in 
the respect of democracy. 
Let us remember the nationalization of electricity, the Caisse de dépôt, 
the creation of the local community service centres, the powers relating 
to culture, language and immigration. These development tools were not 
given to Quebec by the Supreme Court of Canada. We got them by occupying 
the political space, in the respect of democratic rules. The result is 
that we have now become a modern democracy.

with the very fabric of the people of Quebec.

Lizottes, owns the same land since the 17th century. Like other 
families, over the years, it has welcomed the unfortunate survivors of 
the great famine that struck Ireland and Scotland. We are tolerant, 
generous and open. 
My great-grandfather was a seagoing captain. At the time, the motherland 
was constantly in contact with our founding people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up in this environment, and I learned to understand and to 
protect my people. This is where my political commitment comes from. 
With a pride reminiscent of that of my ancestors, I am asking Supreme 
Court judges to refuse to answer the three questions, and to let 
Quebeckers decide their future themselves.

questions and comments on the speech by my colleague for Louis-Hébert. 
She dealt with the substance of the matter. It is quite important to 
point out that this debate has been requested by sovereignist members, 
who have come to Ottawa in order to make sure decisions on Quebec's 
future would be made democratically.

after the referendum. People tell us we lost the referendum and we 
should accept these democratic results. 
We do accept them, but we think we can go on trying to convince 
Quebeckers because we have been able to raise the level of support from 
40% in 1980 to 49.4% in 1995.

the ones who raised this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciated the call to Liberal members, especially newcomers, 
those that have nothing to do with the Trudeau generation, who did not 
take part in the process that gave us the Canadian constitution, a 
constitution for the judges. When the constitution was unilaterally 
patriated, it was to create a society ruled by the judges, the Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau society. The result is an ever greater involvement of 
the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the hon. member for Louis-Hébert is this. If the 
Liberal majority in the federal Parliament votes down our motion, would 
that not be an even greater rupture than the unilateral patriation of 
the constitution? Once more, Quebeckers would realize that the country 
in which they want to live would not make such undemocratic decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Madam Speaker, I think my colleague has 
raised a very important point.  If we do not have the agreement of 
our colleagues in the House today, we will probably be facing an 
even greater impasse than the one we faced when the Constitution 
was unilaterally patriated in 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking about working towards rapprochement and understanding 
is one thing, but I think that if members oppose the most basic 
step of allowing a people to define themselves and be able to say 
what they wish to become, if they ignore this issue, I really 
wonder how this could ever be put behind us later on.   I see some 
very sad times ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier

Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok is the 
nose-shaped part of Quebec that extends into the Gulf of St.

the Lower St. Lawrence region, who said that her family still has 
its parcel of land from the 1700s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to the Gaspé in the Gulf 
of St. Lawrence. 
All the inhabitants of Upper and Lower Canada, all those who live 
in the western part of my riding, passed by us on their way up 
the St. Lawrence and now the members opposite are telling us what 
to do, that we can no longer decide for ourselves.  I will not 
stand for it and, on that note, I give the floor back to my 
colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Madam Speaker, I will continue the 
heartfelt words of my hon. colleague.  It is true— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It's frustration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> No, not frustration.  It is true that we 
have everything we need in hand, and have proven it with all of the

Quebec, everything we need to continue to determine our own future 
without waiting for someone else to do it for us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, in response to the 
Bloc Quebecois motion, I wish to reaffirm the position of the 
Government of Canada, which acknowledges the right of Quebeckers to 
decide their future.  It is precisely because it believes in that 
right that the Government of Canada has introduced certain 
initiatives to ensure that the debate for the possible secession of 
Quebec is held in an atmosphere of clarity and transparency.  It is 
only then that the right of Quebeckers to determine their future 
takes on its full meaning.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that Quebeckers cannot be kept in Canada against 
their clearly and democratically expressed will, but they must 
not lose Canada without having renounced it clearly.  A clear 
question, a legal, orderly process acceptable to all, an 
enlightened decision made by citizens who have all the 
information they need and a clearly expressed will, these are the 
essential components for Quebeckers to be able to decide their 
future. To settle for less would be to deny Quebeckers the 
exercise of their democratic rights that clarity and transparency 
are paramount for the Government of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some information that has now been made public reveals the 
true intentions of the Government of Quebec at the time of the 1995 
referendum, and the approach it had in mind, even after a weak yes 
on a nebulous question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unilateral declaration of independence, plan O or the big 
game plan of Jacques Parizeau, as well as the famous political and 
economic partnership suggested by the referendum question but 
described now by Mr. Bouchard as just the bare bones, or a summary, 
clearly demonstrate that the process for taking a decision as 
serious as separation from Canada must be clear and transparent. 
The process proposed by the PQ government to achieve sovereignty was 
irresponsible and unrealistic, and the negative consequences of a vote 
in favour of secession were not disclosed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only must the process be transparent, but the consequences of 
a vote in favour of Quebec's separation must be clearly explained to 
people. The fact that the government was prepared to risk losing over 
$17 billion in people's savings for the unrealistic purpose of limiting 
panic on the markets after a victory of the yes side—this after 
assuring people that the consequences of such a victory would not be 
alarming—clearly shows that the right of Quebeckers to decide their 
future must be exercised with full knowledge of the facts. The decision 
to break up a country must be taken with full knowledge of the 
consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers must be allowed to decide, but they must also know 
exactly what they may have to give up. 
The confusion generated by secessionists regarding the consequences of 
Quebec's separation convinced the Canadian government to ensure the 
clarity and transparency of the process. Do I have to remind the House 
that, according to a CROP poll taken in July 1997, 44% of Quebeckers who 
voted yes thought Quebec would still be part of Canada after a yes 
victory? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Queen's Privy Council and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs reaffirmed the importance, for 
Quebeckers, to have all the information required to properly 
exercise their right to decide their future. In a letter dated 
February 6, addressed to Mr. Ryan and dealing with the reference 
to the supreme court, the minister wrote “Through this reference, 
the Government of Canada seeks clarification of an important 
issue, that of the legal aspects of a unilateral secession. We 
believe Quebeckers and other Canadians are entitled to that 
information. Above all, the decision whether or not to secede 
should not be made on the basis of myths and false theories”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could add that the governments of Quebec and Canada alike 
have a duty to take necessary measures to inform citizens of all 
the aspects of a possible secession by Quebec.  I repeat, only 
under those conditions does Quebec's right to decide its future 
take on all its meaning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has and will always have the 
responsibility to respect that duty, to provide information that 
is incumbent on every government. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Quebec government said on a number of occasions that, 
should the yes side win a referendum, even with a small majority, it 
could separate Quebec from the rest of Canada by unilaterally declaring 
its independence, adding that neither the Constitution nor the courts 
have a role to play in a secession. The Government of Canada is of the 
opinion that such a statement has no legal foundation.

with living outside the Constitution of Canada, when we live 
in a society based on the rule of law.  And Canadians have to 
understand this. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secession within the law would already cause huge problems. 
While it is true that unilateral secession has no basis in law, it 
would raise problems that are even more difficult to overcome, as 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs indicated in his letter 
to Mr. Ryan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In it he said that one of the consequences of such legal 
instability could fly back in the face of the secessionist 
government, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Quebeckers would claim the right to not lose Canada in 
the confusion, without a recognized legal framework.  The 
Government of Quebec would have a hard time obliging its 
citizens to comply with its laws, since it would have moved 
itself outside the legal framework.  We Quebeckers would not 
want our society plunged into such instability. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No person and no government would benefit from such 
instability, which would, in turn, create economic uncertainty and 
threaten peace in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The action taken by the Government of Canada for clarification 
purposes in no way questions the legitimacy of a referendum.  The 
aim is not to prevent Quebeckers from expressing their opinion on 
their political future, but rather to clarify certain matters of 
law to enable Quebeckers and other Canadians to better understand 
the scope of the unilateral action proposed by the current 
Government of Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things the principle of the rule of law protects the 
democratic rights of the population.  It ensures that over and 
above the political choices of the day all democratic principles 
underlying society and guaranteeing its existence within an 
orderly and peaceful context are respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs went further in his 
letter to Mr. Ryan, stating that the law is necessary in order 
for political action to take place democratically and not in 
anarchy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada undertook to explain clearly what was 
at stake in a possible third referendum on Quebec's independence 
and, in particular, the consequences of unilateral secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs when he 
says that, as a Quebecker, he wants to be sure that neither he nor 
his fellow citizens will lose their identity or their full rights 
as Canadians in the confusion, with no legal framework to decide 
our disputes, in a dangerously unclear state that is democratically 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot support the motion introduced by the Bloc Quebecois 
because this party refuses to recognize the rule of law, as we saw 
with its refusal to agree to the amendment moved earlier today by 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It is my duty

secretary.  As always I was impressed with the logic and concise 
nature of the arguments he put forward against the motion before 
us today.  Among the many good points he made, he made it quite 
clear that we must at all times in this very civilized country 
rule ourselves in accordance with the rule of law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem to me that an avowed separatist would want to 
pursue a strategy to achieve his or her objectives which are in 
accordance with the laws of the land.  After all, in the case of 
a favourable vote in accordance with a good clear question, he or 
she would want the international community to recognize that 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the parliamentary secretary elaborate a bit more on the 
importance of the rule of law in any civilized society, 
particularly as we might unfortunately at some time face another 
referendum in Quebec on the question of separation?  Why is it so 
important to remind all Canadians and all Quebeckers that we must 
at all times conduct ourselves in accordance with the rule of 
law? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member emphasizes 
the point that the government is trying to make sure that Quebec 
or any other province is not denied the right to determine its 
own position within Confederation or, for that matter, outside 
Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rule of law is important.  This needs to be done in an 
orderly fashion.  I would like to quote from the former justice 
minister and current health minister when he was in the process 
of this reference to the supreme court.  He made reference to the 
rule of law by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rule of law is not an obstacle to change.  It permits change 
to take place in an orderly way.  It allows Canadians to alter 
and adjust institutions that govern our country in a fashion that 
reflects our values of consensus, dialogue and accommodation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is hoping to have clarification.  It is not a 
question of attempting to deny the right of Quebec or any other 
province to determine their own future.  We trying to guarantee 
that it is done in an orderly fashion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I know the parliamentary secretary was sincere in what he said, but 
I think he abandoned originality and emphasized sincerity, because 
it was a speech straight from the Privy Council, prepared by speech 
writers obviously hired for that very purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have three comments and one question.  When our colleague, 
the parliamentary secretary, says that we do not know the 
consequences of sovereignty, if he says something like that at this 
point, then he has not followed the debate, because all Quebeckers 
know that, on the day Quebec becomes sovereign, through democratic 
means, no other means having ever been considered, there will be 
three consequences: Quebec will keep all its taxes; Quebec will 
decide on its international politics, and there will be a single 
parliament, the National Assembly, that will pass laws having force 
over its territory.  So, the next time the parliamentary secretary 
is asked about the consequences of sovereignty, he can give as a 
reply what all Quebeckers know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is at issue in the parliamentary secretary's discourse is 
whether he admits that, unlike Prince Edward Island, Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan, Quebeckers form a nation and that, because they form 
a nation, they have the right to decide their future 
democratically.  And does he admit that that is basically what the 
last two referendums were about?  Once his government took part, it 
recognized Quebeckers as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear what my hon. colleague has to say about 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B> Madam Speaker, the documents the government 
just submitted to the supreme court mention there would be many 
people in 
both Canada and Quebec; however, as I said in response to the member's 
question, the questions the government put to the supreme court are 
aimed at clarifying what the consequences would be.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard—La Prairie, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, we 
have had a motion before us I would like to reread to be sure that I 
understand its terms and that there is no confusion. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House recognize the consensus in Quebec that it is for 
Quebeckers to decide freely their own future. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some reservations I would like to express.  Despite these 
reservations, I was almost prepared to support the motion.  Some would 
consider my reservations fundamental.  Often it is simply a matter of 
semantics.  Are Quebeckers a people, when the definition in the 
principle of the founding peoples included much more than Quebec? 
In spite of this potentially contentious difference, this was not reason 
enough for me not to support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It mentions a consensus. The word consensus has become a buzz word. 
It is being used, abused and interpreted. Is there really a consensus in 
Quebec? This too is contentious, and I am far from convinced there is 
one. In spite of this I might have supported the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We moved an amendment. It said “while respecting the rule of law 
and the principle of democracy for all”. This amendment was not 
accepted. So I have to say no. Democratic values are being promoted 
abroad. In Quebec, inclusively— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like you to remind my 
colleague opposite that the Chair ruled on the amendment in question 
this morning and that a parliamentarian should not question a ruling by 
the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to remind the House that, 
this morning, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs proposed an 
amendment. The Chair ruled that amendment out of order. The minister 
then asked the unanimous consent of the House for his amendment to be 
accepted, but the House refused to give unanimous consent. I am not 
questioning the Chair's ruling, but these are the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> Madam Speaker, our society, both in Canada and 
in Quebec, has a tradition of promoting democratic values, and I do not 
mean only at home. I am speaking here of our influence around the world. 
The role that Quebec and Canada play abroad is marked by this desire to 
promote democratic values throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that what is good for others is not good enough for us? 
How can we refuse that any debate be based on a fundamental and 
inescapable premise, which is respect for democracy for all? If that 
term is not included in this motion, then I cannot support it.

am not trying to make the point the Minister of Intergovernmental

credibility, why is it that, less than two weeks ago, Serge Ménard, a 
Quebec minister, the former justice minister as I recall, was quoted in 
<I>Le Devoir</I> as stating that, following a separatist victory in a

to be the beginning of an interesting consensus in Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, when Liberals say “a clear question”, that is an insult to 
Quebeckers. If the question had not been clear, do you think that 93% of 
the people would have answered it? 
His whole political organization worked to have people vote on the no 
side. That means that you are contradicting yourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there not a clear message in there? Is it not a insult to the 
intelligence of Quebeckers to tell them that the question was not clear 
and that there was no possibility to decide properly? Quebeckers came to 
a decision in 1980, came to a decision in 1992 on the Charlottetown 
accord, came to a decision in 1995. They know full well the political 
issue that is at stake. It is an insult to their intelligence to show 
such an attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, what we reproach the supreme court for is not the fact that 
it is a tribunal. It is the federal government that uses the supreme 
court as a tool, with three loaded questions, to ensure beforehand that 
the answers will be the ones it wants to obtain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a tactic one usually resorts to when one knows once are 
losing. Instead of trying to win on the skating rink, they are trying to 
change the rules of the game. It was the same thing this morning with 
the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an important distinction to be made. This morning, the 
minister was not able to move his amendment because it was out of order. 
It is not my fault if he still does not know how things should be done. 
If he does not know our procedure, and if there were difficulties within 
the majority in Parliament, it is not my problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it should never be said that this amendment has been rejected 
by people on this side. It was not accepted because it was out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B> Madam Speaker, this morning, the minister was 
following the practice of this House. Anything can be done with 
unanimous consent. It happens all the time, and it is not exceptional. 
The hon. member is impugning the minister's motives, but he could 
perfectly well do what he did under the rules of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</B> On a point of order, Madam Speaker. This is 
the second time a ruling of the Chair has being challenged. The hon. 
member is telling us the House could have reversed the Chair's ruling on 
procedural acceptability. That is not so. Once again, the integrity of 
members on this side has been questioned, just as the Chair's integrity 
has been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation should be clarified, and the Chair should tell these 
members they should be talking to the motion before the House and not to 
an amendment that has been ruled out of order by the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> This matter has been debated 
long enough. I have already made a decision and we will go back to where 
we were in questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to see that we did 
touch a nerve with the majority on the other side. To get back to the 
wording of the motion, the motion on which we will vote is very clear 
and simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member, as a member from Quebec, will return to his 
riding, when he will have to make a decision before his fellow citizens, 
before all Quebeckers, will he say that he voted against what should 
have been in the resolution, rather than what is actually in it? He will 
have to bear this responsibility before all Quebeckers, like all the 
other members from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very anxious to hear his answer to this question. Is he able, 
in all good conscience, to say that he has Quebeckers' interests at 
heart when he denies their right to decide their own future?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> Madam Speaker, I am much more concerned 
about Quebeckers than about the separatist government of Quebec. 
I hear talk of a consensus, when— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</B> That is an opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> Democracy is all about letting people speak 
when it is their turn.  There is talk of consensus.  Has somebody 
forgotten to mention the fact that Mr. Ryan, whose intellectual 
contribution to this debate I always welcome, was very definite on 
the need for a clear question and solid rules of interpretation? 
There is no mention of that, because it does not serve their 
purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The insult was trying to get Quebeckers to swallow the affront 
of an unclear question, an unclear interpretation and no plans from 
Mr. Parizeau.  That was the insult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now what I find totally hilarious is the arrogance I see.  If 
the members opposite are so sure of winning, why do they fight the 
principle of a clear question with clear rules of interpretation 
and a clear context?  Why are they trying to fool the people if 
they are so sure?  René Lévesque must be rolling over in his grave.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
pleased to rise this afternoon to add my voice to the debate on 
this motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank you for allowing me to speak on a subject so important 
for everyone as self-determination. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the issue of people determining their own future is one 
of importance for all Canadians and one I strongly support in 
principle.  It is the particular application of this principle 
that we must now take time to explore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a member of a family decides on a plan of action that will 
have significant impact on other members of the family, it is of 
course essential that such impact be weighed carefully.  I 
appreciate the opportunity given us here today to develop that 
exploration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having had the opportunity to explore issues affecting 
aboriginal peoples, I am particularly concerned about this motion 
in general and the notion of consensus in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the aboriginal peoples of Quebec?  Much of northern 
Quebec is the traditional land of the Cree and Inuit. Roughly 
15,000 square kilometres of the province's north are exclusively 
dedicated to aboriginal peoples.  Quebec's aboriginal peoples 
include Inuit, Cree, Micmac, Malecites, Algonquin, Huron, 
Montagnais, Abenakis, Attikameks, Naskapis and Mohawk people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people need to know what plans the hon. member and his 
party have in store for the traditional peoples of these lands. 
The wording of the motion is very general and ambiguous.  What 
plans are there for negotiations and discussions with these 
peoples before and during this “decision of their own 
future?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec boundaries extension act of 1912 stated that the 
province would recognize the rights of Indians to the same extent 
as the Government of Canada had recognized such rights. It also 
provided that the trusteeship of Indians in the territory and 
management of lands reserved for their use would remain within 
the Government of Canada.  Does the Bloc still plan on upholding 
the principles outlined here or is it planning to try to deny the 
rights of aboriginal peoples in northern Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the position taken by the Cree people in Quebec? 
Their position during the last referendum was that they had the 
right to maintain their territory in Canada.  This cuts to the 
heart of one of the difficulties with this motion.  While it 
supports the right of self-determination for Quebeckers, surely 
the same must be true for aboriginal peoples within Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To support self-determination for Quebec in general but then to 
deny that same provision for the aboriginal peoples living within 
the boundaries of Quebec is not only contradictory but sets back 
the tone of relations with aboriginal peoples to a time to which 
surely none of the members in this House would wish to return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion refers to the ambiguous concept of consensus.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the hon. member reconcile this with the notion of 
self-government?  The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples 
stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right of self-determination is vested in all aboriginal 
peoples of Canada including First Nations, Inuit and Metis.  It 
is founded on emerging norms of international laws and basic 
principles of public morality.  Self-determination entitles 
aboriginal peoples to negotiate the terms of their relationship 
with Canada and to establish governmental structures that they 
consider appropriate for their needs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does this notion take into account self-determination for 
aboriginals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It being 5:15 p.m., 
it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith 
every question necessary to dispose of the business of supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the House ready for the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Question.

OPERATIONS ACT

<A NAME="LINK252">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-233, an act to provide for the settlement of labour disputes 
affecting west coast ports by final offer arbitration, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate 
on my private member's Bill C-233 which provides a process to 
prevent costly strikes and lockouts at west coast ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As new MPs in 1994 one of the first emergencies we were forced 
to deal with emanated from a work stoppage at west coast ports. 
The Reform Party has always understood that when labour disputes 
occur in the transportation sector or at the ports, it is the 
users, the innocent third parties who pay the costs.  Since we 
arrived here four years ago there have been three occasions when 
work stoppages in these sectors alone required back to work 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1994 the dispute between the British Columbia 
Maritime Employers Association and the International 
Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union shut down west coast 
ports for almost two weeks.  One year later, in March 1995, 
parliament was called on to bring an end to a dispute between the 
foremen from this very same union and the Maritime Employers 
Association.  No sooner had this group been ordered back to work 
than we were called upon to pass another bill legislating an end 
to a work stoppage, this time in the railway sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On each occasion the Reform Party pressed the government to act 
quickly to protect the livelihood of the users.  Rather than deal 
with each work disruption on an ad hoc basis, we believe it would 
make more sense to deal with all potential disputes ahead of time 
by establishing a process called final offer selection 
arbitration.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government, however, does not see the need for a permanent 
solution.  For some perverse reason it passes up every 
opportunity to solve the problem once and for all by giving both 
sides the tools to settle their disputes.  The government prefers 
instead to take a piecemeal approach to labour issues. Nowhere is 
this more obvious than when the labour bill currently awaiting 
second reading is examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Labour Code has jurisdiction over only 10% of the 
country's workforce, yet a work disruption in any federally 
regulated work place has immediate, far-reaching and long lasting 
effects on the entire nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the unique nature of the federal system alternate 
sources are often not available.  It is in the interest of all 
Canadians that we have reliable access to essential services to 
keep employment within our borders and to establish and maintain 
a reputation worldwide as exporters of goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our reputation as reliable exporters and shippers is dealt a 
severe blow every time work stoppages occur in the vital 
transportation and port sectors.  Like a boxer, the more frequent 
and prolonged the blows the longer it takes to get back up until 
eventually the match is lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a trading nation we cannot afford to lose ground.  Today's 
global customers require a stable, dependable supply of goods. In 
a proper functioning labour environment, employers and employees 
both have to weigh the costs if they resort to a strike or 
lockout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employees will have to forgo wages, live on a meagre strike pay 
and face possible personal financial hardship.  Employers, on the 
other hand, stand to forfeit lost sales and revenues.  These are 
normally powerful enough incentives for a negotiated settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In key economic sectors, however, this normal safeguard does not 
apply.  The knowledge that work stoppage will not be permitted to 
last for any length of time must be factored into the negotiating 
process.  If they cannot achieve their goals at the bargaining 
table all too often negotiating parties will give up and allow 
the federal government and its arbitrators to settle the dispute 
for them.  Unfortunately the real victims of this process are not 
the employers and employees, but Canadian farmers, producers, 
importers and exporters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good labour relations cannot be legislated.  Final offer 
selection arbitration, however, gives the parties the tools to 
resolve their differences.  It does not favour one side or the 
other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is how it works.  If and only if the union and employer 
cannot make an agreement by the conclusion of the previous 
contract, the union and the employer would provide the minister 
with the name of a person or persons they jointly recommend as an 
arbitrator or an arbitration panel.  The union and employer would 
be required to submit to the arbitrator or panel a list of the 
matters still under dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For disputed areas, each party would be required to submit a 
final offer for settlement.  The arbitrator selects either the 
final offer submitted by the trade union or the final offer 
submitted by the employer; all of one position or all of the 
other.  The arbitrator's decision would be binding on both 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A permanent and fair resolution process must be put in place, 
removed from the whims of government.  Back to work legislation 
has become too predictable and management and unions count on it. 
Permanent legislation would provide both sides with predictable 
rules and a timetable by which to negotiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The risk to Canadian jobs should be minimized.  Not only a 
significant number of jobs would be lost in the export sector if 
these disputes could not be resolved, but jobs at the ports will 
be at severe risk when alternative means to ship goods are 
utilized. The use of more reliable U.S. west coast ports would 
result in the loss of cargo and British Columbia jobs in the 
ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost interruption of government business should not occur. 
While there is need for regulation by various levels of 
government, it is unnecessary to put emergency measures in place 
each time labour and management are unable to reach a 
satisfactory agreement. 
Resolving the differences of these two groups can be achieved 
without interrupting the regular flow of government proceedings.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Final offer selection arbitration is not a new concept.  As a 
matter of fact, it was used by the government to settle the 1994 
longshoremen's dispute.  At that time the minister of human 
resources development said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The imposition of the final offer selection procedure should 
encourage the two sides to demonstrate a strong sense of 
rationality in deciding on the positions they place before the 
arbitrator. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we have been saying all along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Mulroney government saw the benefits of final offer. It 
included it in the 1987 National Transportation Act as a 
mechanism to solve pricing disagreements between shippers and 
railways.  One transportation writer described it as a very 
useful precedent for all rail shippers, in that it confirms that 
an inexpensive and expedited recourse is available when 
manufacturers or producers are dissatisfied with their freight 
rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that no government has yet been willing to 
enshrine final offer selection arbitration in the Canada Labour 
Code as a permanent dispute settlement mechanism.  The best 
solution the government could manage is the half measure in Bill 
C-19, the amendments to the labour code, which would force grain 
handlers and longshoremen to cross the picket lines of their 
colleagues to ensure that the grain already in the ports is 
loaded on to ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the time parliament intervened in 1994 in the dispute between 
the British Columbia Maritime Employers Association and the 
International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union the work 
stoppage is estimated to have run up $125 million in direct 
costs, $250 million in indirect costs, and $500 million worth of 
grain sales had been threatened.   During the best of times this 
is a very severe hit on the national economy.  In a recession it 
is devastating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, despite the problems with the Canadian dollar and 
the recent jump in the unemployment rate, analysts describe the 
economy as strong.  Yet a prolonged strike or lockout in the 
railway sector could wreak havoc with this recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grain represents 30% of the port of Vancouver's business.  There 
is no doubt about its importance.  I would be the first to agree 
that grain farmers have been forced to endure more than their 
fair share of losses due to labour disputes beyond their control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was in Vancouver last month begging farmers to 
support his bill but he is missing the point.  Farmers do not 
want to be pawns in other people's labour disputes.  They have 
enough obstacles to contend with from the weather to the wheat 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the threat of a rail strike hovers over us.  In March 
1995 when parliament legislated an end to the railways dispute, 
the legislation included provisions mandating two year contracts 
with an expiry date of December 31, 1997.  A nationwide rail 
strike this spring is a very real possibility. Contract talks 
involving 6,500 CN Rail workers collapsed over the weekend 
despite the presence of a federal conciliator, and a strike vote 
is not unlikely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provision which the government is proposing as a solution to 
the problems of farmers will be useless if there is a rail 
strike. Final offer selection arbitration as described in the 
bill would give farmers, producers, importers and all exporters 
that use west coast ports the assurance that their goods would 
reach consumers unimpeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Final offer selection arbitration is not discriminatory.  It 
does not single out one commodity over another like the Liberals 
are attempting to do with their proposed amendment to the Canada 
Labour Code.  It is fair to importers that are suffering because 
of the dismal value of the Canadian dollar. It is fair to grain 
farmers who, thanks to the Canadian Wheat Board, have enough 
problems trying to sell their grain.  They deserve to be spared 
the ongoing threat and uncertainty of strikes and lockouts. 
It is fair to all producers and exporters who use the west coast 
ports to ship their goods to market.

Code.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have this 
opportunity to participate in today's debate on Bill C-233. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read my hon. colleague's bill with some interest and I am 
surprised by the lack of balance in the bill.  I know my 
colleague tries very hard to achieve good solutions. However, it 
puzzles me that the member opposite has proposed such a rigid and 
mechanical approach to labour relations, especially at a time 
when rapid economic change both in Canada and around the world 
requires imaginative responses to difficult problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Free and fair collective bargaining is a cornerstone of 
industrial relations in Canada.  Members will ask is the system 
perfect.  My answer would be no, but what system is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our history and experience have demonstrated that collective 
bargaining has served the interests of labour and management well 
and, by extension, it has served the interests of Canadians well. 
The best solution in any dispute is the one arrived at by the 
parties themselves in the give and take process of collective 
bargaining.  That is where this government feels that the 
responsibility should rightfully remain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pride ourselves as a free and democratic society and in such 
as society it is not the government's job to intervene and impose 
solutions on people.  However, there are times when the rights 
and freedoms of different groups must be weighed against the 
interests of the nation and the well-being of its citizens as a 
whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one disagrees with that but in labour relations in the 
federal jurisdictions we already possess the tools required to 
ensure that a balance exists between the national interest and 
the rights of the parties involved in a labour dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague across the way is nodding and giving me a 
thumbs up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain what I mean.  Right now, if there is a labour 
dispute at a port, part I of the Canada Labour Code gives the 
minister and the government a variety of tools to help the 
parties.  The goal is to assist the parties in their negotiations 
so that an agreement can be reached and a contract signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, a conciliation officer is made available to assist the 
parties in their negotiations.  Should the parties fail to reach 
agreement at this stage of the process further assistance can be 
rendered by a conciliation commissioner if deemed appropriate. At 
any time a mediator can be appointed to assist in the resolution 
of issues in dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, there is no shortage of assistance available 
to help the parties reach a settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble to the Canada Labour Code states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Canadian workers, trade unions and employers recognize and 
support freedom of association and free collective bargaining as 
the basis of effective industrial relations for the determination 
of good working conditions and sound labour-management relations. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that in Canada we recognize that labour unions have 
made lives better for millions of their members.  It means that 
labour unions have an important role to play in the economy. They 
also have an important role to play as a safeguard for workers 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Sims task force looked at part I of the code, it 
concluded that “free collective bargaining continues to serve 
our social and economic needs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the benefits of free collective bargaining 
usually outweigh the inconvenience caused by any strikes.  When I 
say usually, I mean there will always be times when a strike 
causes too much damage for the economy.  I think this is what the 
member for Wetaskiwin had in mind when he drafted his bill. 
His party mainly represents rural ridings where agricultural 
interests are dominant and important. If the ports are closed, 
produce does not head for its destinations abroad.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Ports play a crucial role in the distribution of goods into and 
out of this country, and a lengthy work stoppage cannot only 
create economic hardship but also it can jeopardize the 
country's reputation as a reliable trading partner in the 
international scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to argue this point, particularly in light of the 
legislation interventions which have been made in the past. There 
are times when the national interest demands an end to work 
stoppage and back to work legislation becomes an unfortunate 
necessity. That legislation normally includes a number of 
provisions, including a process to resolve the issues in dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Final offer arbitration is one of the many mechanisms which may 
be chosen. Final offer arbitration can be a useful tool if used 
to settle a single, definitive issue such as the amount of a wage 
increase. But the implementation of this process across a broad 
range of issues is not appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key weakness of final offer arbitration is that the 
arbitrator picks one side's position on all issues in its 
entirety over the other side.  Suppose you have a labour dispute 
where the union wants an end to outsourcing, 50 cents more an 
hour and a dental plan. Management offers 25 cents, no dental 
plan and no end to outsourcing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some feel that final offer arbitration will encourage 
compromise, but it could well do the reverse. If you know that 
final offer arbitration will force someone to win everything and 
someone to lose everything, and if you know that final offer 
arbitration is based on final offers, you have a very good reason 
to stand pat and to take your chances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, with final offer arbitration you cannot split the 
difference, 35 cents more an hour, keep the dental plan but allow 
management to continue outsourcing. That may be the best solution 
but with this process it can never happen. Either one side gets 
everything it wants or the other side does. End of argument. The 
more complicated the dispute, the worse it gets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How, for example, would you use final offer arbitration to solve 
disputes in a court over manning provisions, rules of dispatch, 
grievance procedures or overtime?  When you try to use final 
offer arbitration for complicated labour disputes, inevitably one 
side is left very bitter, and this bitterness keeps on poisoning 
the workplace after. It is very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of the sense of satisfaction that comes from settling 
differences through collective bargaining, you may instead have a 
legacy of simmering anger that manifests itself down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are better solutions. Bill C-19 currently before this 
House modernizes part 1 of the Canada Labour Code and improves 
the collective bargaining process for federally regulated 
industries. It balances the rights and the responsibilities of 
employers, unions and employees and it reflects Canada's changing 
labour relations environment. It will improve flexibility and 
encourage settlement of disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my hon. colleague saying “well”, but perhaps that is a 
move forward and I feel that is progress too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have tried to strike a balance and I do not feel that Bill 
C-233 advances our interest at all. Instead of seeking a balance, 
it eliminates the balance completely.  I urge all members of this 
House to vote against Bill C-233. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, as 
I understand Bill C-233, the Minister of Labour would have the 
authority, without coming back to the House of Commons for any 
debate, to suspend the right to strike or lockout in the west 
coast ports or, where a strike or lockout has occurred, to direct 
the parties back to work. Then any outstanding differences would 
be settled by final offer selection and the findings of the 
arbitrator would be binding without any recourse to appeal.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That much seems straightforward.  The bill makes the argument 
that the movement of goods to market through our west coasts 
ports is so critical to the nation's well-being that workers in 
that sector should not have the right to withhold their services 
if negotiations break down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stripped down to its basics, that is the essence of the bill.  I 
am happy to rise today to speak against it on behalf of the New 
Democratic Party and on behalf of working people everywhere for 
whom free collective bargaining is their only avenue of recourse 
if they ever hope to elevate their standards of wages and working 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elements of the right wing in this country have tried to take 
away workers' right to strike for years.  It is an ongoing 
battle. This is only one in a serious of attacks on worker rights 
that we have seen from the Reform Party.  I do not what it is 
about fair wages and worker rights that so offends the members of 
the Reform Party, but bill after bill and motion after motion 
submitted by them seeks to strip away the most basic fundamental 
rights and freedoms that we as Canadians have put in place in the 
interests of fairness and justice for working men and women in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since ancient times people without power in the traditional 
sense have been using the tactic of withholding their services as 
a bargaining tool to achieve their objectives without resorting 
to violence.  In ancient Greece the playwright Lysistrata tells 
us that the women in that community were so sick of their 
husbands warmongering and pillaging expeditions that they 
withheld their services from their mates until the men would 
listen to reason. The author tells us that before long the front 
of the men's togas look like tents pitched in the desert.  Before 
long the collective action taken by the women began to have the 
desired effect.  The men were willing to sit down and accept the 
counsel of their partners and things gradually returned to normal 
relations much to the relief of all concerned.  That may be the 
first recorded strike in known history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that the right to withhold services is a legitimate 
and peaceful means of protest.  It is one of our most basic 
rights and freedoms as working people.  The New Democratic Party 
caucus is opposed to any legislation that would erode that 
fundamental right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard a great deal about final offer selection during the 
recent postal strike.  The Reform Party critic at that time was 
arguing that all future negotiations between Canada Post and the 
Canadian Union of Postal Workers should be settled by final offer 
selection.  It seems they want everything settled by final offer 
selection.  They have such confidence in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to burst anyone's bubble but there is nothing 
magic about final offer selection or any type of binding third 
party arbitration.  There is certainly nothing new about it.  The 
fact is final offer selection is of very limited value to labour 
relations practitioners, as was very capably explained by the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour.  It has great 
limitations in what it can do to resolve a round of bargaining 
that has reached impasse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiators already have the option to use final offer selection 
in any round of bargaining they see fit.  As such it becomes 
another tool in the tool chest for negotiators to use.  But we do 
not need legislation to voluntarily stipulate ourselves to some 
form of binding arbitration because that option already exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that final offer selection has its 
origins in major league baseball where it is still used largely 
today.  It is hardly in an industrial setting but it is useful to 
look at their experience in major league sports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only fair and useful way to use final offer selection is if 
the items in dispute are very simple and straightforward, as the 
parliamentary secretary pointed out.  For instance, if all that 
is left on the table are the monetary issues, the money matters, 
then there is some value in putting your final offer forward and 
the selector will choose either one or the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is generally agreed that FOS process is heavily biased toward 
the employer when dealing with any matters other than money.  For 
example, it would be very unlikely for workers to achieve any 
type of non-monetary gains such as changes to work rules, the 
introduction of new benefits, a language that might recognize 
family leave or any clause that would be difficult for the 
arbitrator to weight against a cash offer from the employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arbitrators, like judges, are very much creatures of past 
practice and precedence.  They are reluctant to break new ground 
with their rulings. 
They feel, quite correctly, that new and innovative approaches to 
industrial relations should be arrived at through negotiations, 
not through any kind of imposed settlement.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore in a case involving complicated non-monetary issues, 
the arbitrator in all likelihood would rule in favour of the 
employer. The employees would never achieve clauses that were 
important to them and having lost the right to strike they would 
not be able to apply further pressure in the form of withholding 
their services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have tried to explain what I do not like about final offer 
selection and I would like to spend the last few minutes I have 
explaining what I specifically do not like about Bill C-233. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of Manitoba where I am from we actually had 
final offer selection legislation for a number of years.  As a 
labour relations practitioner, as a union representative I had 
the occasion to not only follow that legislation very carefully 
but to actually use it in my own collective bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actual fact is in Manitoba FOS was used very sparingly.  In 
fact the Manitoba labour relations board received only 97 
applications in all the time that it was legislation in that 
province.  Of those 97 applications only seven were ever ruled on 
by an FOS selector or arbitrator. Four went to the union package 
and three were in favour of the company in those rulings. In the 
vast majority of cases, 72 in all, the application was withdrawn 
because the parties returned to the bargaining table and found a 
satisfactory resolution by more conventional means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This illustrates my first criticism of Bill C-233, that nowhere 
in the proposed legislation are the parties encouraged to 
continue meeting to resolve their differences after the FOS 
process had begun.  As I say, in Manitoba this led to a 
satisfactory resolve in a large majority of the cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in Manitoba either the employer or the union could make 
application to the minister of labour if they wished to use the 
FOS process. The minister would then order a supervised vote of 
the employees in the bargaining unit to determine if it was their 
wish to conclude this round of bargaining by final offer 
selection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-233 never asks the parties.  It is the minister involved 
who would impose his or her will on the two parties involved in 
the negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the Manitoba legislation stipulated that the parties could 
only apply for FOS between two windows:  either between 30 and 60 
days prior to the expiry of a collective agreement, or after a 
strike had gone on for 60 days or more.  This was crafted with a 
specific idea in mind, that it is far better for the two parties 
to use their normal avenues of free collective bargaining as much 
as possible without third party interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So only if the two parties agreed to FOS 30 days or 60 days 
before the expiry date, or only if the two parties had already 
been on strike for over 60 days would the legislation even be 
relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party are very critical of any labour 
legislation that imposes binding time limits, such as clause 9(3) 
of Bill C-233.  It not only has binding time limits, but it has 
severe penalties if anybody misses those time limits.  We believe 
that this flies in the face of the deemed fairness provisions 
that most labour relations practitioners are striving to achieve. 
In that sense we are critical of both the tone and the content of 
clause 9(3). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, Bill C-233 is an intrusive and heavy handed proposal 
that has little or no merit in the labour relations environment 
of a 1990s democracy.  It is poorly crafted and it is riddled 
with serious flaws and omissions.  Even if it were better 
written, members of this House should speak against it because it 
does nothing to further the cause of harmonious labour relations 
in this country. It would further erode workers rights by 
stripping away that most basic and fundamental right which is the 
right to withhold your service as a peaceful bargaining tactic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Final offer selection is a little used bargaining strategy 
because it is of little value and it is of questionable merit. It 
is available and free to use for those who choose to use it, but 
it is certainly not necessary to impose a heavy handed bill such 
as Bill C-233.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour said that 
she was very puzzled by this. I will try to clear up some of 
those things that seem to puzzle her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said that final offer arbitration is very one sided and 
results in one side being very bitter about the settlement.  I 
suggest that she ask the Canadian Union of Postal Workers what it 
thought of her government's settlement which used a different 
method.  She should ask if the postal workers are bitter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She may be even more puzzled by something that is in keeping 
with the comments of the NDP member who just spoke.  He spoke 
about how this is a right wing plot by the Reform Party.  He also 
mentioned that final offer arbitration was used for a number of 
years in Manitoba.  But he did not mention that it was put in by 
the NDP government which is kind of to the left.  It is not right 
wing like Reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This method was taken out by the Conservative Party.  That party 
sits to the right of the Reform Party here in this House. The NDP 
members who sit on the far left of the House are saying that this 
is a terrible right wing plot, but it was put in by them and it 
was taken out by the Conservative Party whose members sit on the 
righthand side of the Reform Party.  If the parliamentary 
secretary was not really puzzled before, that must really get her 
spinning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of misconceptions need to be cleared up.  The NDP 
member has used this one before, as have many others.  It is the 
old sabre rattle about how Reform is trying to take away the 
rights of workers to collective bargaining with bills like Bill 
C-233. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For someone who says he has been involved in labour negotiations 
for a number of years, to steal the words of the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Labour, I am really puzzled as to 
what he thinks collective bargaining is. Strikes and lockouts are 
not collective bargaining.  Strikes and lockouts are the result 
of the failure of collective bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Collective bargaining involves three things.  It involves 
negotiation.  It involves conciliation.  And it involves 
mediation.  When those things fail, the company locks out the 
workers, or the workers withdraw their services from the company. 
That is not collective bargaining.  It is a failure of collective 
bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strike or lockout is a dispute settlement mechanism. It is a 
form of coercion used by one party against the other to drive 
them back to one of the three real parts of collective 
bargaining: negotiate, conciliate, mediate.  That is collective 
bargaining.  We have no intention of taking collective bargaining 
away from anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both members who spoke in opposition to the bill suggested final 
offer arbitration rarely needs to be used. Consider Canada Post 
which was mentioned by both members.  There was a strike in 1987 
and the government legislated the workers back to work.  The next 
strike was in 1991 and the government legislated them back to 
work.  The next time up was 1997 and the government legislated 
them back to work.  There is a bit of a pattern here, is there 
not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The early 1970s saw the first ever strike of air traffic 
controllers. The government legislated them back to work.  The 
second time around the workers took a strike vote. They had not 
yet gone on strike but the government legislated them back before 
they went out and imposed a settlement on them. That does not 
make for a happy side.  And the parliamentary secretary to the 
minister was worried that final offer arbitration would make one 
side bitter.  I was an air traffic controller in those days and I 
can tell her that the government's methods made one side very 
bitter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then a ports strike crippled the country in 1994. The government 
legislated them back to work.  We had a rail strike in 1995 and 
the government legislated them back to work. There is a long 
history of the government intervening in labour disruptions in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the problem comes in.  We have already heard figures 
mentioned about the cost of the ports strike.  The more recent 
Canada Post strike cost Canada Post in loss of revenues, workers 
in loss of wages. The NDP is so concerned about the rights of 
workers. Lots of workers suffered financial devastation 
themselves through loss of wages.  The union lost a tremendous 
amount of money paying out the strike pay and the cost of the 
negotiations that were going on with this process.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Charities and mail dependent business collectively lost 
somewhere between $1 billion and $2 billion in the last postal 
strike because the government failed to act on a prompt basis. 
And it failed to have a method in place like the one proposed by 
my colleague in Bill C-233 to deal with the problem in the west 
coast ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the port of Vancouver in my province of British Columbia, we 
used to have among other things, grain, a tremendous number of 
shipments of potash.  A lot of the potash from Saskatchewan does 
not go to Vancouver any more.  It goes to Portland, Oregon. 
Portland, Oregon said to ship it there instead, that they would 
build the facilities and they would guarantee it would be 
delivered on time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are losing our ability to trade internationally because the 
government has failed to put in place some method of settlement 
that is fair to both sides.  How can it possibly be one sided 
when each side has the exact same power as the other, no more and 
no less? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the NDP said that this is terrible because it 
will not allow the parties to reach a settlement.  They could 
both go with the same settlement.  They would say that they did 
not mean it to go that far.  All they would have to do is to go 
to the arbitrator making the decision with their common 
presentation and they would have a settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this in fact does is it puts out a message to both the 
employer and the employees that if one side's demands are 
outrageous and the other side's demands are not, they will lose. 
That is the way it should be. That is reasonable and proper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current system, workers lose wages and the company 
loses revenue.  The workers and the company collectively lose 
business which means jobs and this devastates the national 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the port we talked about the impact going all the 
way back to the prairie grain farmers.  It affected me in my 
riding 400 miles inland from the port in British Columbia.  In my 
riding I have a mill and a smelter that almost got shut down 
because all the ore was locked up in the port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that cannot go on.  If the government thinks 
that we can have a system that allows people to willy-nilly go on 
strike, which has a devastating impact on the national economy 
and of people totally unconnected to the job, then it has to 
rethink its priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about a corner store. The workers in that corner 
store say “Give us a dollar or we are on strike” and the owner 
says “No, I am only giving you 50 cents”.  They go on strike. 
What is the impact?  It is an economic tug of war between the 
employer and the employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who else is hurt?  Some of the neighbours are inconvenienced 
because they will have to go to a different store.  The families 
of those workers are going to be harmed but it is the impact 
directly related to their families' jobs.  There may be a little 
economic spin-off in the immediate area if it happens to be a big 
store. Primarily it is right there located within that worksite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the Vancouver port, there can be an impact felt 
2,000 miles away by people totally unrelated to the port, 
thousands of different people in all kinds of different 
industries, such as farming or other businesses across the 
country.  The government does not only have the right to act, it 
has a duty and a requirement to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill tries to address a real problem that the government 
itself has already recognized by intervening time after time 
after time when these types of situations have come up in the 
national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now is the time for the government to recognize the old system 
is not working in the interests of Canadians and to say that it 
is time for a little evolution to take place in collective 
bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Collective bargaining will still exist.  All we will be doing is 
putting in a more effective final dispute settlement mechanism. 
If the government cannot see that, it is time it moved aside and 
allowed someone else to do it.

was listening very closely to some of the comments from the 
parliamentary secretary and those made by the labour critic from 
the New Democratic Party.  I think it is necessary to correct 
some misconceptions they have about this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said that in her opinion fair and 
free collective bargaining has always been the best way to arrive 
at a settlement, or words to that effect.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly we agree.  We are not advocating a heavy-handed 
approach here at all.  It is most important to note that the 
process applies equally to the employer and to the employee. It 
is a tool that can be used equally by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said many times before in the House that final offer 
selection would take the place of very heavy-handed back to work 
legislation.  I see it as a real step forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to work legislation has become sort of a crutch whereby 
management and labour do not feel compelled to earnestly bargain, 
to get right down to cases and to settle the disputes themselves. 
Of course any dispute that can be settled between the parties is 
absolutely the best way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are offering final offer selection as a final step that would 
take the place of having to go through the trauma, so to speak, 
of a strike or a lockout and then having parliament legislate 
them back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tool can be used equally by both parties.  If it were in 
legislation both parties would realize it was the final step and 
would bargain accordingly.  They would get right down to the last 
parts of the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague in the NDP actually made the case for final offer 
selection in Manitoba.  He said that knowing the legislation was 
there 93 of 97 cases resolved themselves because the parties came 
to an agreement.  That is exactly how we want it to happen.  For 
those 4% to 5% that cannot come to an agreement, someone has to 
make the agreement for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague in the Reform Party from British Columbia made an 
excellent point.  When the local grocer has a work disruption, 
whether it is a strike or lockout, certainly it affects a few 
families that like to deal at the particular store. It also 
affects the employees and the owner of the store. However people 
in the city do not starve because they have alternative places to 
buy their groceries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians, particularly in the western part of Canada, do not 
have an alternate west coast port to use.  It is the only game in 
town and the people who run the west coast port are very much 
aware of it.  It is no coincidence that work disruptions take 
place at a time of year when western farmers are trying to market 
their crops through the port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary says that this process will not 
work.  There are many precedents in Canadian history to show that 
it does work.  In the case of legislating parties back to work, 
all that accomplishes is to reluctantly have the parties go back 
to the job.  It does not resolve any of the outstanding issues. 
Those outstanding issues are yet to be resolved and in many cases 
are done through the exact method we are suggesting here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most unfortunate the bill is not a votable motion.  I 
would have been very pleased to have seen how the House would 
have voted on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  There being no 
further members rising for debate and the motion not being 
designated as a votable item, the time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the order is dropped from the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would there be unanimous consent, since it is 10 minutes before 
the hour we were to adjourn tonight, for the House to proceed to 
the adjournment motion?

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EDUCATION 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
October 22, I asked the Minister of Human Resources Development 
whether the Liberal government was going to restore hope to young 
Canadians by making access to post-secondary education a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His response was that he was going to give students as many 
options as possible. 
The only options he appears to be offering our young people are 
exorbitant fees and a future fraught with insecurity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has not done enough for our young people. 
Over the past four years, all Canadians have suffered from the 
Liberals cuts.  Among those most heavily affected by these 
unfeeling Liberal measures were young Canadians, with an average 
debt load of $25,000 at the end of their post-secondary education. 
As if these unbelievable debts were not enough, they find 
themselves jobless, with an unemployment rate as high as 16.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government introduced its youth employment strategy, 
there are 48,300 more young people unemployed.  Clearly the 
Liberals have missed the boat as far as young Canadians are 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is so critical that 78% of young Quebeckers believe 
that poverty has increased in our society. The majority of them even 
think that the worse is yet to come. This government has taken away from 
our young people the most important thing they need to succeed: hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the problem of inequality in our society is growing every 
day. A minority of people benefit from the new global economy, whereas 
most of us live in insecurity. This insecurity is most deeply felt by 
our young people. High unemployment, an education system accessible only 
to the rich, a lack of hope and a deep feeling of insecurity, that is 
what the Liberals have given our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young Canadians are our future. An investment in our young people 
would mean a bright future for all Canadians. That is why we need to put 
more money into the post-secondary education system. 
More money for post-secondary education means a better education for our 
young people and a system that would be accessible to all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, I met with students in New Brunswick. They are deeply 
concerned about the exodus of our young people in Atlantic Canada who go 
west because they cannot find jobs in their region. The enormous debt 
load is also one of their main concerns, as it is for everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government must start listening to young Canadians and respond 
to their expectations and concerns. Government programs, such as the 
millennium scholarship fund, must be there to help those who need them. 
But that is not enough. The government must help all young Canadians by 
increasing transfers to the provinces, to ensure that tuition fees stay 
at a reasonable level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actions of the Liberal government have demonstrated that it is 
more concerned with corporate interests than with the future of our 
young people. We need a government that will make young Canadians its 
priority, that will invest in their future by investing in our post-secondary 
education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government must start working for all Canadians to 
build a secure future for our young people and for the whole country.

with my hon. friend that the millennium scholarship fund 
announced by the prime minister will become a cornerstone.  It 
will assist those students who not only are most in need but also 
qualify for post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out to my hon. friend that the Government of 
Canada does not set tuition fees.  The whole educational process 
is the purview of the provinces.

facilitating access to post-secondary education through the

higher education and skills by improving interest relief and tax 
measures such as the period of interest relief and by pursuing 
with interested provinces an income related repayment scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We introduced special opportunity grants for students with 
permanent disabilities, high need part time students and female 
doctoral students in certain fields of study. With all the 
financial pressure that has been on the government over the years 
we recognized the need for post-secondary education support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 Speech from the Throne announced the government's

<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Asian crisis underscores the extent to which the economies of 
the world are interconnected.  It dramatically points our the 
extent to which globalization of the World Trade Organization and 
world trade in general is now in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has felt the effects of the Asian crisis.  Even the 
Governor of the Bank of Canada recently stated that the fallout 
from Asia would no doubt have a dampening effect on Canadian 
output. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased, however, to see other more positive developments 
that will hopefully will work to mitigate this effect.  Growth in 
Canada's major trading partners outside Asia have been stronger 
than expected.  With low inflation, falling government deficits 
and declining unemployment, Canada is now in much better shape to 
withstand such shocks as the Asian crisis.  This is certainly the 
case more so today than it was during the Mexican peso crisis of 
two years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern, however, is the impact the Asian crisis could have 
on Canadian firms doing business in that part of the world.  Some 
international economists have warned that the recent crisis in 
the Asian markets could have a negative impact on foreign 
companies doing business there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can Canada do to mitigate any negative impact?  Are we 
continuing to get countries in the Asia-Pacific to open their 
countries to Canadian companies?   I ask the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of International Trade to respond. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I say to my hon. 
friend that it has never been more important to encourage these 
economies to become more open and, if I may use the word proudly, 
liberal in their trading practices.  I am pleased to say we are 
now getting signals from Asia that the countries are moving to 
further modernize their economies and overcome these effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem of the financial downturn for Asia was partly the 
lack of transparency in business practices and in government 
regulation.  At a time of dynamic economic growth across Asia and 
in an environment of readily available loans, a pattern of 
imprudent borrowing and lending has developed with a 
concentration of investment in overheated property markets.  This 
did nothing to contribute to the productive base of the affected 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A more transparent system of controls, accounting and financial 
statements could have alerted national authorities, overseas 
lenders and international financial institutions earlier to the 
true underlying picture and perhaps could have prevented the 
crisis from developing.  Given the current realities of 
globalization, Canada can promote the return to stable economic 
growth, enhanced trade and future prosperity by encouraging 
increased transparency and liberalization.  Moreover, we lessen 
in the future the probability of financial shocks of this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By supporting trade liberalization we improve the climate for 
Canadian firms seeking to do business in Asia.  This is what 
Canada, its G-7 partners, the IMF and other international 
financial institutions are striving to achieve—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
November 24, 1997, I asked the Hon. Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
if he intended to protect Canadian dairy farmers against the import 
of increasing amounts of the cream and sugar mixture commonly known as 
butter oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, the secretary of state for Agriculture and Agri-Food 
stood up to thank me, of course, for my question and say he was doing 
his best. That was on November 24, one month before Christmas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, nearly two months after Christmas, many weeks have gone by 
and it is clear that butter oil imports to Canada are doubling every 
year. To preserve our so-called supply-managed industries, that is to 
say dairy, eggs and poultry, when the WTO agreements, formerly known as 
GATT, were signed in December 1993, tariffs were set so high that they 
would discourage any country from exporting supply-managed items to 
Canada, including dairy products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of exporters affiliated with Unilever met with Revenue 
Canada senior officials to discuss the tariff schedule and numbers. With 
the blessing of Revenue Canada, they were told: “Put in only 49% 
butter, melt it, add 51% sugar, and you will pay a 7% entry tariff 
instead of 284%”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how things are done under this Liberal government and our 
farmers, our dairy producers, have seen their milk quotas drop by 3% 
last year. That is a 3% decrease in net profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very recently, the Dairy Farmers of Canada held their annual 
convention in Vancouver, where the minister took the trouble to meet 
with them at the end of their meeting. The poor guy said he was 
disappointed by the position taken by the Dairy Farmers of Canada, and 
he asked the revenue department to set up some kind of tribunal, a so-called 
advisory tribunal, to review the tariff on butter oil. What a 
disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one, two or three years from now, this advisory body will 
probably submit its report to the revenue department, which will review 
it under the leadership of the revenue minister, but without too much 
pressure from the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. We will end up 
with another agreement we will have to sign since, in 1999, in 18 
months' time, we will have to embark upon a new negotiation process to 
renew this WTA agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always been told that, in law, one cannot do indirectly what 
one cannot do directly. Dairy products were subject to a quota—

shares the concerns of the dairy industry as we all do on this 
side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make very clear that the government recognizes the 
dairy industry's concerns about increasing imports of 
butteroil-sugar blends.  However, while there have been efforts 
to address the concerns of the dairy farmers of Canada, it has 
not been possible to find a solution that would not—and I would 
emphasize the word not—would not contravene Canadian law and our 
international rights and obligations.

dairy blends outside tariff rate quotas.  The government shares 
the DFC's concerns about the impact of these blends on dairy 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the government has referred the broader issue to the 
Canadian International Trade Tribunal, CITT, for a thorough 
examination of ways we could address these concerns in a manner 
consistent with our international rights and obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is very disappointed that dairy farmers have 
indicated they do not intend to make their arguments to the CITT.
