	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development be directed 
to consult broadly, to analyze, and to make recommendations regarding the 
modernization and restructuring of Canada's social security system, with 
particular reference to the needs of families with children, youth and working 
age adults;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the Standing Committee's work be undertaken in two phases as follows: 
(i) an interim report by March 25, 1994 on Canadians' concerns and priorities 
regarding social security and training and preparations to receive the 
Government's Action Plan and proposed changes; and (ii) a final report by 
September 30, 1994, including a review of the Government's Action Plan and 
recommendations for reform.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, in rising to speak to what I consider a 
very important motion I would like to begin by acknowledging 
and giving my appreciation to the deputy minister of my 
department and his staff. They have worked very diligently over 
the last two or three months to help prepare the groundwork for 
this proposal.
<P>
	As well I wish to thank the members of my staff, my 
colleagues in cabinet, particularly the Secretary of State for 
Youth and Training and the leader of the Senate who is 
responsible for literacy, and members of the Prime Minister's 
Office who have been working very closely with us in 
establishing terms of reference.
<P>
	Finally, my thanks to many of my caucus colleagues who over 
the past several weeks of discussion have given me a number of 
ideas and proposals that we hope to pull together as part of this 
very large scale and important undertaking.
<P>
	The first order of business in speaking to this motion is to 
issue an invitation to Canadians to join in the rebuilding of the 
social security, labour market and learning framework of this 
country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I ask members of this House and all Canadians to work with 
the government to develop an action plan for the renewal of our 
social safety net. Our social programs cost billions of dollars 
and in one way or another affect all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am asking members of the House, our colleagues in the 
Senate, our counterparts in the provincial and territorial 
assemblies, members of business and labour, leaders of our 
communities and each and every Canadian to start fresh, to 
throw off old ideas, to put aside vested interests and regional 
differences and begin thinking as one group of people on how we 
can begin to set a new framework of ground rules that will 
restore a sense of fairness, hope and security for the future in 
Canada.
<P>
	I do this in acknowledgement that in the past different 
generations of Canadians have had real successes in developing 
important and essential social security for this country. One of 
the defining features of Canada has been that we have tried to 
treat each other with a sense of compassion, a sense of tolerance 
and a sense of sharing. There are seniors' pensions, 
unemployment insurance, family allowances, vocational 
rehabilitation and various health programs. Each generation has 
constructed in its own way a different response to the problems 
of its time. In many cases they have worked. They have been an 
important net for giving Canadians that sense of security.
<P>
	What is also clear is that the pace of change both in this 
country and around us has overtaken many of these programs. 
They no longer have the same resiliency, strength or 
effectiveness that they have had in the past. For that reason we 
must begin to think anew and rebuild anew.
<P>
	The starting point began in October when Canadians in 
overwhelming numbers revealed that they wanted change. They 
gave a mandate to the Prime Minister and his team of members 
to use the tools of government to put people back to work, to 
make government a constructive, positive force in the lives of 
people; no more passivity, no more indifference, no more 
avoidance of the problems. They wanted a government to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="610"> 610 </A></B>
<P>
provide leadership, direction and to begin to restart the engine 
of employment and job creation in this country.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	The message was clear. Jobs are the issue and Canadians want 
action. I believe our government has taken a number of 
important steps to begin a systematic approach to jobs, not a 
series of ad hoc initiatives. We have to see one piece as it fits the 
other. A full range of government policies and departments are 
presently engaged in this exercise of trying to re-establish the 
work world for Canadians.
<P>
	We launched the infrastructure program. We have set in 
motion the development of a new set of incentives for small 
business, new programs for technology, a national 
apprenticeship program and a service corps for youth.
<P>
	We are beginning to redial the codes of fiscal and monetary 
policy as the Minister of Finance consults across the country in 
preparation for a budget.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	But in Question Period or in the speeches in reply to the 
speech from the throne, I have noticed that members on both 
sides of the House share the same concerns about 
unemployment, the future of Canadians and of some training 
programs. We share the same concern for all unemployed 
Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The time has come to put that concern to work and to begin to 
meet the challenge that has been placed before us, to restore 
employment as a central focus of this Parliament and of this 
government. That will require an overhaul of existing systems.
<P>
	We are asking this House and all Canadians to look with clear 
eyes at ways of delivering unemployment insurance, training 
and employment programs, social assistance, income security, 
aid to education and learning, labour practices and rules 
affecting the workplace, taxes and premiums that affect job 
creation, management of programs within the government and 
between governments and the more effective delivery of 
services.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All programs-unemployment insurance, training, 
employment, labour market regulation, taxes, program 
management and administration-will be reviewed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The purpose of such a thorough review and redesign is not to 
slash and trash. It is to renew and revitalize, to build a better 
system. Canada needs a social security network that makes 
meaningful connections between different programs, that 
integrates, meshes and merges the resources and energies of 
people in a new synergy of output, a system that better rewards 
effort and performance, that offers incentives to work. Our 
redesign is based on compassion and will be designed to 
enhance it, not diminish it. We must ensure that the system 
continues to offer basic security to all those in need.
<P>
	There are voices out there-I have heard them from time to 
time in this House-that say redesign is simply a code word for 
cutting costs. They are wrong. The purpose is to find out what 
really works so that we can help people get back to work. That is 
the purpose of redesign.
<P>
	The test for members of this House is, are we prepared to 
recognize new realities. Are we prepared to deal with the 
realities, or are we simply going to live in the past using 
obsolescent ideas and notions for the sake of trying to make a 
political case?
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	This will be an opportunity for Canadians to really see how 
Parliament works. Is it to be the engine of change, the forum for 
real dialogue, the place in which Canadians can begin to see 
their country moving forward again? Or will it simply be the old 
talk shop, using old outworn ideas and old outworn arguments 
that no longer fit the contemporary needs of Canadians?
<P>
	For those who say change is not necessary, for those who are 
going to stand on a soap box saying to keep the system the way it 
is, I say to them: Look at the stubbornly high unemployment rate 
that has existed over the past 10 years. Regardless of the cycles 
of the economy the deeply embedded structural unemployment 
must be dealt with.
<P>
	Canadians are out of work for longer periods. Under our 
unemployment insurance system people now draw benefits on a 
basis of one out of three, which used to be one out of six. The 
system is not working any longer. Anyone who tries to defend 
that system is wearing blinders.
<P>
	Canada has unacceptable levels of illiteracy. There are close 
to a million Canadians who cannot read or write. Is that not 
reason for looking toward serious change?
<P>
	Far too many children live in poverty. There are 1.1 million 
Canadians below the age of 12 who are considered to be living in 
poverty. One of Canada's great embarrassments and shames is 
that the United Nations itself in its UNICEF report called 
Canada into question for not doing enough for its children. Is 
that a reason to defend the existing system? No. It is a reason to 
begin to put our best energies and resources and ideas into how 
to deal with the nurturing and nourishment of our children, to 
give them a better place to live and a better start in life.
<P>
	We have a generation of young people who cannot find 
meaningful work, who find it increasingly difficult to make 
their transition from the formal school place into the world of 
work. Unemployment rates are close to 18 per cent for those in 
the age bracket of 18 to 25.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="611"> 611 </A></B>
<P>
	It was interesting to watch the consultations under the 
guidance of the Minister of Finance, to look at what is now 
called the generation <I>x</I> problem. It is no longer simply a question 
of the old shibboleths of left and right, business and labour, or 
rich and poor. I heard those millions of young people saying to 
the rest of us: ``You have your social security programs, you 
have your pensions, you have all that you need to give you a 
certain security, but we do not.'' They are tired of part-time 
work. They are tired of being told that their education does not 
count any more. They are beginning to say: ``If you are going to 
invest, invest in us, invest in the future, invest in people, that is 
what we want this government to do''.
<P>
	Our country is increasingly divided between those with 
well-paying, secure and interesting jobs and those with 
part-time and low-paid intermittent work. We have a society 
where, to use an analogy, there are people who are able to drive 
stretch limousines with the windows blacked out in order to 
ignore the homelessness around them. It is time we stopped that 
car, opened the doors and brought all Canadians into moving 
ahead, to give everybody a good ride into the future, not just an 
exclusive group. That is what this review intends to do.
<P>
	The message is that we must invest in people to create hope, 
not dependency. We must recognize that investment in people is 
the key to both our economic and social renewal. Those who 
divide and categorize policy saying: ``That is economic over 
there, and that is social over there, and the bleeding hearts can 
worry about one side of the spectrum and the hard-nosed realists 
the other'', is not the kind of world we live in.
<P>
	I refer again to the kinds of views which are coming out of the 
consultations the Minister of Finance has been holding. How 
many times have we heard in those sessions that if we are going 
to be productive, if we are going to be competitive, if we are 
going to be able to meet global challenges, then we must make 
use of every single human being in this country. We must bring 
out the best in our talent. We must bring out the best in our 
brains. We must make sure that a country of 27 million people 
does not leave one person on the sidelines. Every person must 
give their best and it is up to the Government of Canada to open 
those doors for them.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	That is why we need to make a change, not piecemeal, not ad 
hoc, not chipping away or tinkering with one program or 
another. We have to understand that it is systematic. They link. 
They connect. They merge. There is a synergy of programs. It is 
time for us to look at how we can better design those programs to 
meet the problems Canada faces today.
<P>
	Let me set out two goals for our action plan. First we must 
clearly confront the issues facing us: long-term structural 
unemployment even in times of growth; the impact of 
accelerated technological change on our labour market and 
training systems; unacceptably high drop out  rates and 
illiteracy levels and skills shortages; the unrealized potential of 
a generation of youth with diminishing opportunities; and a 
mindset in the business world that decides that down-sizing and 
job fretting is the way to solve problems rather than making 
better use of workers and providing new opportunities for new 
workers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There is also poverty, especially among children; a lack of 
training and work for young people; tensions between new 
family structures and the demands of work; duplication of 
government programs; and the limited financial ability of 
governments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Over the coming weeks this Parliament will be listening to 
Canadians. We will ask them to help define the issues and set 
priorities.
<P>
	The first part of our judgment is to open our minds and our 
hearts to what people want us to do. That period will last six 
weeks to two months. We will scope out together the nature of 
the exercise and the objectives we will ask Canadians to meet.
<P>
	In the second phase the action plan will propose clear options 
for change. I give them to you not as an exhaustive list but ones 
that I believe are key: to meet basic labour market adjustments 
and insurance requirements; to restructure parts of the 
unemployment insurance program and Canada Assistance Plan 
to create a new form of employment insurance; to help people 
make that crucial transition from school to work by providing a 
range of options and training, apprenticeship community 
service and work; broadening our educational and training 
assistance to support life-long learning; enhance support and 
care of our children in society; to redefine the distribution of 
work and rules of the workplace; to ensure that individuals with 
disabilities can achieve equality, independence and full 
participation; to seek a much better balance between incentives 
for job creation and payroll tax levels; to ensure basic security 
for those in need; and to redefine responsibilities between 
governments and strengthen co-operative arrangements and to 
achieve savings through greater efficiency; and to design new 
smarter ways to deliver services and avoid duplication.
<P>
	That is not a complete list. Canadians will have the 
opportunity to react to these proposals and introduce other 
ideas, other notions, other directions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians, provincial governments and all interested groups 
will be able to propose changes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There will have to be extensive public discussions and 
continued interaction with provincial and territorial 
governments. That phase should be completed by early fall. We 
will then move 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="612"> 612 </A></B>
<P>
to legislation for a new employment and social security system 
in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	To carry out this task I am announcing the following process 
and propose following: First, I am tabling the motion that is 
before the House today asking this Chamber to direct the soon to 
be formed standing committee on human resources development 
to begin a two-stage examination of the proposed reforms.
<P>
	The first stage will last until April. Canadians will be given 
the chance to express views, hopes and concerns about social 
security in the job market. This will form an important part of 
the preparation of the actual proposals.
<P>
	The second stage will begin in April. The government will 
present action plans setting out the options and choices. 
Committees will then consider those in the second stage, 
working through the summer until September using the widest 
possible means of public dialogue: the parliamentary channel, 
weekend conferences, whatever means they can to engage 
Canadians in this important exercise.
<P>
	The third stage of parliamentary action will take place when it 
examines the specific legislation we hope to introduce this fall.
<P>
	There will be three different distinct phases in which this 
Parliament will act as the forum in which Canadians can become 
involved and feel that they are engaged in restructuring this 
country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All these governments are our partners. Several provinces 
have already begun the reform exercise. These provinces have 
shown a desire to co-operate. For example, before Christmas, 
all first ministers at the meeting agreed on social reform. We 
must work together constructively so that changes at the federal 
level complement those at the provincial level.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This partnership of working with us in Parliament is essential. 
The provinces have already become the incubators for social 
reform in this country. They have been waiting for the federal 
government over the past several years to show leadership and 
to give a definition at the national level so that they can tailor 
their programs and needs according to their regional 
requirements but based upon a sound base of national support, 
national standards and national interest. We must mesh our 
efforts in a combined, collaborative way. We will begin that 
exercise at the meeting of federal and provincial ministers on 
February 14.
<P>
	In addition to these discussions with the provinces, we want to 
work with them in establishing a series of agreements, joint 
ventures and projects to test new approaches to unemployment 
insurance and training assistance. This will all be designed to 
avoid duplication, to achieve savings, to improve performance 
and to test out new ideas.
<P>
	To do this it may be necessary to come back to Parliament 
early in the session in order to alter the Unemployment 
Insurance Act and the Canada Assistance Plan to provide 
authority for such innovative federal and provincial 
collaborations, a request the provinces have been making for the 
past two years.
<P>
	We also want to engage key sectors of society in developing 
their own proposals and views. Business, labour, equity groups, 
organizations and social community organizations in the private 
and voluntary sectors will be invited to participate, as will the 
existing government advisory groups: the Canadian Labour 
Force Development Board, the Canadian Labour Market 
Productivity Centre, the National Council of Welfare, and the 
National Advisory Council of Women, to name just a few.
<P>
	We will assist those groups in society that would not 
otherwise have the resources to contribute fully to the process. 
We will be making available parts of our grants and 
contributions programs to those groups needing that assistance 
so they can fully participate in this activity.
<P>
	In addition to those phases, a thorough study of the 
distribution of work and the rules of the workplace will be 
undertaken in co-operation with labour and business. We have 
already received requests from these sectors and will be setting 
up a special group to work with them.
<P>
	It is clear there are too few jobs. The Minister of Finance is 
working on expanding those opportunities. However, the 
challenge lies not only in the number of jobs but also in their 
distribution. Sharing of work is becoming one of the most 
important public policy concerns around the world. We will be 
undertaking that study in concert with the kind of work I have 
just outlined.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	A new definition of work is needed to correspond to changes 
in the labour market and to meet new family structures and new 
family needs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I take the opportunity to invite all interested organizations 
and associations to participate in this process and to send me 
briefs, studies and comments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To help me pull together all these different elements and to 
help the government work, I will be chairing a small task force 
comprised of Canadians who have been working on matters of 
social insurance and unemployment over the years. They will 
help look at the research, the past records, the history, the 
consultations, the various views, and pull them together in a 
series of proposals that our government will then consider as 
being the basic elements in the proposed plan. The names of 
these people will be released shortly. They will be carefully 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="613"> 613 </A></B>
<P>
selected to ensure broad representation both on a regional and an 
occupational level.
<P>
	I recognize this is an ambitious plan. No one knows more than 
I do just what is involved. It has a tight timetable and engages all 
of us in a very complex task.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We know very well that it will not be easy, but I am 
encouraged by the interest shown by the newly elected members 
on the government side and in the opposition.
<P>
	Total reform of the social safety net is a good response to the 
demands of the poor and disadvantaged and these changes are 
essential for developing an employment program for many 
Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I hope members of the House are not afraid to make change. I 
hope members of the House will understand the responsibility 
that Canadians have placed upon us to put forward a new 
blueprint, a new map to lead us into a new world. It will not be 
easy but it is worth doing. It needs doing. Canadians want us to 
do it. It is the real reason for government to give leadership, to 
mobilize energy, to set directions, and to foster a common will 
to improve our common lot. It is the reason we are all here.
<P>
	If we do our work well together we can do much to renew the 
country, to give Canadians a sense of their own uniqueness in a 
country where people care for each other and are prepared to 
share opportunity. We can prepare ourselves for all new 
challenges the world has to offer. We can look to a new century 
with a real sense of hope. Our people really are our strength. We 
will look to our people for both guidance and inspiration. If we 
work together as a Parliament with groups outside I truly believe 
this can be one of those moments in which we will make a 
difference, that we will define who we are and where we want to 
go.
<P>
	In closing my remarks I want to recount to the House an 
experience I had within the first couple of weeks of taking over 
this ministry. Perhaps in its own way it provided a little of the 
inspiration for the initiative we have announced today. I visited 
the joint federal-provincial project in New Brunswick called 
Canada Works, designed to give primarily single women on 
social assistance new opportunities to be trained to get back in 
the work force.
<P>
	I spent the day going around to the different workshops and 
classrooms. I sat in on one group in a small classroom in 
Fredericton. I asked the women what being involved in the 
project meant to them. One woman said that she had only been in 
the program for a couple of months but already there had been a 
big improvement because now she could help her daughter to do 
her homework. She was now learning to read and write in a way 
that gave her a new sense of relationship with her child. She 
said: ``If nothing else happens that is an important step. It has 
given me reason to go on to do something more. Some day I will 
be making a real contribution to my family, to my community 
and to my country''.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	She went on to say: ``When I helped my child with her 
homework she gave me a little saying that I wrote on the 
blackboard''. I turned around and there written on the 
blackboard was: ``Never be afraid to reach for the moon. Even if 
you miss you will still be among the stars''.
<P>
	I invite members of the House today to reach for the moon.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to thank the minister for 
proposing this debate in the House. We may not agree with the 
content or with the minister's announcement, but this debate 
will at least launch a much-needed discussion of the 
government's intentions and of exactly where the government is 
going, considering the real interests of Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	The government intends to focus its concern on our social 
security system. With the help of the people of this country, it 
will to conduct a review of the social safety net.
<P>
	The minister's speech is full of noble sentiment and 
references to the dignity of work, leadership, the promise of 
change, and all those wonderful words people find in the 
dictionary when they want to make an announcement without 
saying exactly what they plan to do.
<P>
	To listen to the minister, one would think this government, 
mindful of its social justice traditions-the traditions of the 
Liberal Party -is preparing to strengthen the universality of 
social programs, give broader access to these programs and 
provide reassurances for the unemployed, welfare recipients 
and people in need generally who are suffering most under the 
impact of the recession.
<P>
	Unfortunately, that is not the case, because these fine phrases, 
pronounced so eloquently by the minister, are mere camouflage 
for an unprecedented attack against our social security system.
<P>
	Although mouthing noble sentiments, these reformers have 
their scissors at the ready. Behind the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, we see lurking in the shadows the 
Minister of Finance and the President of the Treasury Board. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="614"> 614 </A></B>
<P>
Can there be any doubt about the real motives for this 
rationalization when it is announced by a government that is 
trying to keep the wolf from the door?
<P>
	Let us not be fooled into thinking that this government wants 
to improve the quality of health care. Do not believe for one 
minute it is trying to do something about crowded emergency 
wards or long waits for people to be admitted to the hospital or 
have an operation. And it certainly does not plan to raise the 
meagre pensions we pay to the elderly.
<P>
	The threat is a serious one, because the federal government is 
involved. As we all know, the role it plays in maintaining and 
financing social programs is considerable. The federal 
government has taken advantage of the provinces' lack of fiscal 
resources and occupied a large section of this area of 
responsibility, so that today, a very substantial part of our social 
safety net is controlled from Ottawa. I am thinking of 
unemployment insurance, disability pensions, old age security, 
the guaranteed income supplement, spousal allowances, 
survivors' allowances and veterans allowances and, except in 
Quebec, the Canada Pension Plan and family allowances.
<P>
	These programs are administered by Ottawa, which 
determines benefit levels, benefit criteria and eligibility. 
Another section of our social security system is dominated in 
part by the federal government because the services are 
provided by the provinces. Included are equalization payments; 
the Canada Assistance Plan, which covers welfare payments; 
and Established Programs Financing, which covers medicare.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Under these programs, the provinces provide services to their 
citizens, but in strict compliance with standards set by the 
federal government. Program costs are shared by both levels of 
government.
<P>
	The one thing that all of the programs just mentioned, whether 
federal or cost-shared, have in common is the participation of 
the federal government. Whether or not they survive depends on 
the goodwill of Ottawa.
<P>
	The provinces have continued to exercise their jurisdiction in 
the health and social services field, but their jurisdiction is no 
longer exclusive. Workers' compensation, assistance to 
residents of homes for the aged and dental care for children are 
just a few examples of vitally important social services provided 
by the provincial government.
<P>
	Quebec was a pioneer in several fields and continues today to 
provide a range of services not found elsewhere such as 
maternity allowances and child grants. Quebec was also in the 
forefront in terms of protecting its rights from being encroached 
upon by the federal government. It took steps to establish its 
own pension plan, its own retirement pension scheme and its 
own family allowances system.
<P>
	For many in Quebec and in Canada, social security is the very 
core of our values system. It should be remembered that the old 
age pension system was first introduced back in 1927. This year 
marks the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Family 
Allowances Act, when the federal government first turned its 
attention to the plight of the poor. This year's reform initiatives 
promise to be a sorry tribute indeed to this event. Starting in 
1944, the social safety net was gradually cast ever wider to cover 
the blind, the disabled and finally, the unemployed.
<P>
	With each federal foray, the provinces found themselves with 
less room to manoeuvre where social programs were concerned. 
Indeed, to finance its so-called ``national'' programs, Ottawa 
needed a major tax grab and it set its sights on the same 
taxpayers that the provinces would have liked to target because 
they were underfunded and no longer able to meet the 
responsibilities associated with the baby boom. In other words, 
by encroaching upon provincial fields of taxation, the federal 
government put the provinces in a vulnerable position. And 
when Ottawa extended to the provinces an offer to establish 
social programs which would be partially funded and controlled 
by the federal government, the provincial partners had no choice 
but to accept. The joint programs included hospitalization 
insurance introduced in 1958, the Canada Assistance Plan 
introduced in 1966 and health insurance introduced in 1968.
<P>
	Quebec challenged Ottawa's incursions into these areas. At 
federal-provincial conferences during the sixties and seventies, 
successive Quebec governments demanded that the provinces, 
not the federal government, have jurisdiction over health care 
and social services.
<P>
	Jean Lesage said in 1965 that the provinces were in a better 
position than the federal government to take lasting, effective 
action. Daniel Johnson Sr. and Jean-Jacques Bertrand 
repeatedly argued that health and social security came under 
provincial jurisdiction. Even Robert Bourassa called upon the 
federal government to end joint hospitalization and health 
insurance programs and replace them with outright grants.
<P>
	But, as usual, Quebec stood alone. Only once did it succeed in 
catching the federal government off guard, and this was when it 
set up its own pension plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, the 
cornerstone of the Quiet Revolution. Nevertheless, in spite of 
Quebec's dogged opposition, the provinces lost ground to the 
federal government. Today, Ottawa collects the taxes and sets 
the standards. And as it prepares to reduce transfer payments to 
the provinces, it wants to control programs and at the same time 
keep the money collected from taxpayers.
<P>
	The goal of this exercise is patently obvious. The federal 
government wants to use the money saved by cutting transfer 
payments to finance the debt, using  money it now allocates to 
social services. And what is likely to happen as a result of this 
action? Either the provinces will be forced to cut services, or 
they will have to raise taxes even higher. In either case, they will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="615"> 615 </A></B>
<P>
have to bear most of the burden and the federal government will 
piously wash its hands of the whole matter.
<P>
	The economic security afforded by our social safety net is the 
envy of millions of people who enjoy no such protection against 
the whims of fate. This is doubtless one of the reasons why 
Canada and Quebec rate so highly among the best places in the 
world in which to live. Canadians and Quebecers are pleased and 
proud of this affirmation of the values of social justice and, over 
time, a consensus has emerged on the success of our social 
system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	We know that social values are one of the symbols of Canada 
and of Quebec. We happen to be sovereignists. We have said so 
and we will say it again on numerous occasions. We know that 
not every program has been a failure in Canada and in Quebec.
<P>
	We are not naive and extremist to the point of thinking that 
everything that has been done for the last century and more has 
been a failure or a weakness. We do not think that everything has 
been built on bad faith. There have been successes. Many people 
thought for a time there would be more successes.
<P>
	One of the successes is the social programs. We should know 
that when we are trying to touch them. The minister probably 
knows that more than most of us because he is dedicated to 
social programs. I know it.
<P>
	We know this is something very delicate. We know that 
politicians are devoted to rhetoric. We heard very strong words 
to qualify the importance of the social programs. Words like 
``sacred trust'' were used and nobody laughed. This was 
something deeply rooted in the traditions, the mentality and the 
values of Canada and of Quebec.
<P>
	I listened to the speech of the minister. Of course there were 
nice words: leadership, change, better days, to restart the 
engine. There were all kinds of words used to crank up people 
and make them believe that what will be done is something very 
sweet and nice for them.
<P>
	When one knows the situation of the government and of the 
federal state, when one knows that we are on the brink of 
collective bankruptcy, who will believe that this is not a 
budgetary operation? Who would believe that out of this will 
stem a better system of security, a better system of health and 
care. Who will believe it? I suspect no one will believe it and 
certainly not the Official Opposition.
<P>
	We have heard speeches like that in the past. For example last 
year, a few of us were here to hear the rhetoric of the 
Conservatives. When the Tories brought in Bill C-113 they used 
words like that. I am sorry but they were the same words. When 
we heard the ministers of the Tory government last year they 
said something like this: ``to build up a new Canada, to restart 
the economy, to revitalize faith in our institutions, to put Canada 
back to work''. We heard all those words so many times. The 
minister did not believe them. The minister was not fooled by 
those words. He voted against the bill like we did.
<P>
	Here we are today. The minister is using the same words. I 
think we must fear that he is probably getting ready to do the 
same thing as the people he was strenuously denouncing last 
year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is already said in some circles that the federal government 
does not have a choice, that its disastrous financial situation 
requires it to reduce its effort to fund social programs but what is 
not being said is that these cuts have already taken place. In fact, 
the federal government has been reducing its share of program 
financing for the last 15 years.
<P>
	In 1977-78, 45 per cent of total health expenditures in 
Quebec-I am taking Quebec as an example but I am convinced 
that it is about the same everywhere else-came from federal 
transfer payments. Today health expenditures account for nearly 
$12 billion-which is a lot of money, of course-only 33 per 
cent of which is Ottawa's share of Quebec's health budget. In 15 
years we went from 45 to 33 per cent. That is a reduction, Mr. 
Speaker. It is indeed a substantial reduction and I think that to 
determine who must pay for health care, who must support the 
tax effort and the budget cuts necessary to turn around our 
financial situation, we must look elsewhere.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	The health needs of Quebecers and Canadians have not 
changed. The fact that social programs will be cut, revamped or 
whatever term you want to use-restructured, redesigned, 
redefined, modernized-does not mean that health care needs 
will diminish. They are not going to decrease.
<P>
	With the level of excellence-everything being relative-that 
we have reached in terms of hospital and medical care, people 
will not resign themselves to inferior care overnight.
<P>
	The Quebec government allocates every year about 31 per 
cent of its budget to health and social services. To maintain the 
quality of its services, it had to compensate for the federal 
government's withdrawal by increasing spending and cutting 
operations elsewhere, a step the federal administration has yet 
to take.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="616"> 616 </A></B>
<P>
	Last year federal cuts produced a $1.121 billion shortfall in 
health and social services in Quebec alone. The more than $1.7 
billion frozen by the federal government last year brought the 
proportion of Quebec revenues coming from federal transfer 
payments from 29 to 18 per cent between 1984 and 1993 in terms 
of health services.
<P>
	The federal system of transfer payments is a trap that has 
slowly closed in on the Canadian provinces. Today, because it is 
facing a chronic deficit, the federal government is trying to 
make the provinces pay the bill without giving them the money 
needed to fund these programs or reducing its taxes to clear the 
tax base to the benefit of the provinces. It has chosen to attack 
the poor on the back of the provinces.
<P>
	It will be the provinces and not the federal government that 
will attack the poor. The provinces will have to play the part of 
the bad guys, of right-wing governments without compassion 
while the federal government will make a large contribution to 
health care by maintaining by law its own standards to keep 
services at the same level. The problems will be left to the 
provinces.
<P>
	Canada is now standing on the brink of the financial abyss. 
The deficit projected in this year's budget was $32.8 billion but 
the Finance Minister is now talking about $45 billion. This 
shortfall cannot be blamed on the federal government's social 
spending because, while it was slashing transfer payments to the 
provinces between 1985 and 1993, the federal debt jumped from 
33 to 58 percent of the GDP. While social expenditures were 
being cut the federal debt kept growing, therefore we must not 
blame social expenditures. On the contrary, they helped to slow 
the growth of the federal debt.
<P>
	Social programs have been in existence for a long time but it 
is only in the last 20 years that deficits have been fuelling the 
federal debt. But social spending was already on the scene when 
the deficit phenomenon emerged. Therefore social spending is 
not responsible for our current deficit. It is wrong to make our 
social programs responsible for the government's financial 
crisis. We must look elsewhere for the cause of the chronic 
deficits in the federal budget.
<P>
	This problem cannot be addressed by another tax increase. 
Taxpayers are already feeling the squeeze. An increase in 
underground employment and in smuggling would deprive the 
federal Treasury of revenues it is trying to collect.
<P>
	We cannot borrow more money. The deficit is already 
draining a large part of savings and the money withdrawn from 
the economy would no longer be used to buy goods and services, 
thus reducing government revenues. In addition, increasing 
foreign borrowing would put us at the mercy of international 
lenders. Let us not forget that the part of the federal debt held by 
non-residents has already doubled in ten years.
<P>
	Like everyone else, we recognize that there must be more 
cutbacks. The welfare state has become a hunted animal that 
must bite somewhere, but where? Does the government not 
realize that it cannot make extra cuts in health care budgets 
without affecting the level and quality of services?
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Since the poor have already been squeezed for money, we 
have to look elsewhere. Social justice means not only 
distributing wealth in times of prosperity, but also, especially in 
times of crisis, sharing the burden of the deficit and the debt 
before going any further in the direction of cutting social 
programs. The government must start by exhausting all other 
means of putting the economy back on its feet.
<P>
	What is the government waiting for to cut drastically, I would 
even say mercilessly, just this one time, in the public 
administration? What is it waiting for to cut its operating 
expenditures? What is it waiting for to bring the military budget 
in line with the reduced requirements of a changing geopolitical 
situation?
<P>
	The government should address the overlap between levels of 
government. Billions could be recovered, but the government is 
not even interested in knowing how much.
<P>
	What is it waiting for to launch a program to eliminate 
unjustified tax shelters? What will it do in light of the scandal of 
family trusts that enable the rich to avoid paying tax on major 
portions of their capital?
<P>
	The government made a mistake this morning. The Cabinet 
member who should have been the first to rise in this House to 
announce ways of remedying our disastrous budgetary situation 
is not the Minister of Human Resources Development-whose 
role it is to protect the less fortunate who need his help now more 
than ever.
<P>
	It should have been the Minister of Finance. He should be the 
one to tell us how his government will cut excessive and 
unwarranted expenditures to restore tax fairness and put a stop 
to duplication between levels of government. That is where they 
should start!
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> In closing, I want to remind the hon. members 
that social justice is at risk. It could be bearing the brunt of 
decades of federal government carelessness. This is no time to 
be reducing the social security net, as there is more and more 
cause for concern for the situation of the less fortunate. And for 
as long as we can foresee, we will always have to protect those 
who, as fate would have it, will not have the same opportunity as 
other people.
<P>
	The recession that we are only now starting to put behind us 
has caused terrible hardship. Take the statistics for 1990. 
According to the National Council on Welfare, 18 per cent of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="617"> 617 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec population, or 1.2 million individuals, had incomes that 
placed them below the  poverty line. Using Statistics Canada's 
own figures, Campagnie 2000 estimated that 1.1 million 
Canadian children, or one child out of six, were living in 
poverty. This is Canada we are talking about here, Mr. Speaker, 
not some far-away country that we see shows about on TV at 
night. We are talking about Canada where 1,100,000 children 
are living in poverty.
<P>
	At the same time, an international group of research scientists 
was reporting that Canada ranked second to last among the eight 
industrialized nations, with 29 per cent of single-parent 
families living in poverty.
<P>
	Had it not been for our social programs, this recession would 
have irreparably affected these people. Can we safely lower our 
guard now? We say no, because the economy has not completely 
recovered yet from the last recession.
<P>
	We also object to reducing the level of social protection while 
the economy is recovering because of the lingering risk of 
seeing the gap between the poor and the wealthy widen.
<P>
	I dare the government to name one good reason for abdicating 
its role with regard to ensuring fairness. The fact that such 
poverty exists constitutes a major problem that all social 
stakeholders in Canada deplore, but this problem cannot be 
solved by attacking the poor, as the government is probably 
about to do, but rather by fighting poverty. And to fight poverty, 
we need programs that allow the underprivileged to regain their 
dignity and the courage to find a way out of poverty. To fight 
poverty, we need coherent social programs, not a maze of 
federal-provincial programs. Finally, to fight poverty, we need 
stable employment in areas where there is a future. But this 
government has no job creation program. This is one of the 
tragedies caused by frustration.
<P>
	Here is a government which owes its victory at the polls-a 
very significant victory, with an overwhelming majority of 
members elected to this House-to a promise heard a thousand 
times, a quite simple promise but one of tremendous importance 
to those who heard it: jobs!
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	What is there to foster job creation? Two things. First, the 
municipal infrastructure program, which today is a vague 
measure and one that will lead to patronage tomorrow. Again, in 
Quebec, we are still waiting for an agreement to define the 
applicable criteria, which are still unknown. Yet, the 
government has started handing out goodies, to the order of a 
few billion dollars a year, this in spite of the fact that no criteria 
are established. We fully agree that this initiative could be 
useful and we are not opposed to it, but the fact that it ``could be 
useful'' does not solve anything and does not give it the stature 
of the government's commitment to introduce measures to get 
the economic job creation engines going again. That was the 
first measure.
<P>
	The second measure is the one announced this morning in that 
speech announcing broad consultations, a major redefinition, as 
well as a restructuring of Canada's social security system, to 
revitalize the economy and put people back to work. But how is 
the government going to put people to work if it cuts into social 
programs? How is it going to put unemployed workers back to 
work by reducing their benefits? Who can believe that the 
measures announced in this speech will indeed turn the job 
situation around?
<P>
	The government must avoid the easy solutions it is attracted 
to, namely the elimination of programs and the reduction of 
transfers to provinces. If the government opts for those easy 
solutions, it will violate its social contract with Canadian and 
Quebec taxpayers.
<P>
	Is it not intolerable that 725,000 employable adults are out of 
work? Of course it is. Is it not intolerable that 125,000 young 
heads of households have to rely on welfare assistance in 
Quebec? Of course it is. The government cannot let these people 
down until they find a job commensurate with their skills, their 
will and their wishes. In the name of that compassion to which 
the minister referred to, and also to avoid a deterioration of our 
social fabric, the Bloc Quebecois proposes three solutions:
<P>
	First, in the short-term, the federal government must 
maintain at its current relative level the transfer payments made 
to provinces. At its ``relative'' level means relative to its current 
commitment, given the other expenditures faced by provincial 
governments. Let us not play with words; let us not play little 
games. Let us not say: We maintain transfers to provinces at 
their current level when, in fact, those transfers would be frozen. 
That is not the solution. The government must increase and keep 
increasing its level of contribution to those transfers, 
proportionally to the efforts made by the provinces, which are 
struggling with inflation, increased needs, and so on and so 
forth. By current level, we mean to truly maintain that level and 
not merely do some tricky accounting.
<P>
	Also, in the middle term, we propose, for the sake of economy 
and cohesion, an in-depth review of transfer payments. Only 
one level of government should set standards, collect taxes and 
provide social services on a given territory. And Quebecers will 
never want to leave those responsibilities to the federal 
government. In other words, the federal government must stop 
interfering in provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	Sound management of public funds is based on the 
elimination of overlapping jurisdictions, programs, 
departments and unhealthy competition, which all lead to the 
wasting of taxpayers money. Such a measure is simply a matter 
of ensuring 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="618"> 618 </A></B>
<P>
cohesion. To be effective, social as well as employment 
development policies must be integrated. Every Canadian 
understands that.
<P>
	However, for Quebecers the choice is simple: health and 
social services policies must be concentrated in Quebec. After 
some 30 years of making claims, from Jean Lesage to the Allaire 
report, it must be recognized that such a reform is impossible to 
achieve. The solution, therefore, is in the sovereignty of 
Quebec. Then, Quebec will have to make choices. It will be 
responsible for its decisions, its successes and its failures. It will 
have to perform without this safety net, from a political point of 
view, but it will make its own decisions. Conversely, English 
Canada will also be free to decide which level will be 
responsible for its social and economic policies.
<P>
	I strongly suspect that English Canada, at least some groups, 
will largely support the measures which the minister is about to 
implement. Indeed, I truly believe that a lot of people will 
support this government initiative. English Canada has the right 
to choose its own social and economic measures. I also strongly 
suspect that other groups from English Canada will be 
concerned by the minister's intervention in a sector which 
matters so much to English Canadians. But one thing is sure: 
English Canada is like Quebec and must deal with the situation 
by taking action to meet its needs.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Third, the federal government must immediately implement a 
vigorous economic recovery and job creation program using the 
cuts made not in social programs but in Canada's heavy 
bureaucratic and military structure. If Parliament can operate 
with less resources, the government and the armed forces can as 
well.
<P>
	I do not think that many people will believe that this bankrupt 
government, subject to continual pressure from the right, is not 
trying to take money from the less fortunate with this reform. 
Who will believe that this is not a budget exercise? The rhetoric 
of the department and of the minister, I am sorry to say, is the 
same as we heard last year from the Conservatives when they 
imposed their reform with Bill C-113, a reform which after 
some very fine words, as wonderful as those spoken today, 
resulted in a 5 per cent reduction in benefits paid to the 
unemployed.
<P>
	The Liberals did not fall for that rhetoric then. They rightly 
and to their credit voted against that bill. We will do as they did 
and vote against the proposed measure.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 43(2), Reform speakers will divide 
the time allotted them into two equal time periods.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Very well. The first 
speaker for 10 minutes will be the hon. member for Athabasca.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in the 
House this morning to discuss the sustainability of our nation's 
social programs and how this discussion will relate to Canada's 
aboriginal peoples since this particular segment of society in my 
constituency is one of the most vulnerable to the social program 
changes.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate the minister on his presentation in 
the House this morning. Certainly he can count on support from 
the Reform Party for the goals he set out for us this morning. 
They are certainly goals we can all agree with. We look forward 
to seeing some substance added to the goals in upcoming 
months.
<P>
	The minister spoke of fear of change on the part of members 
of the House. I assure him that members of our party do not fear 
change. In fact we stand for real, basic change in the way 
government operates and the services it provides. We can 
support him in some real change.
<P>
	I only hope the government is prepared to act on the root cause 
of why Canada's social programs are on the brink of collapse. 
Members opposite say that we do not have a spending problem 
in the country, that we have a revenue problem. Since arriving in 
Ottawa I have heard much debate in the pre-budget 
consultations about broadening the tax base. By my calculations 
and from the admissions of members opposite this broadening 
of the tax base can perhaps add, at most, $5 billion a year to the 
revenue of the federal government which has a $40 billion plus 
deficit and 60 per cent of government spending, excluding 
interest costs, going toward the cost of social programs either in 
direct payments to people or transfers to provinces. It is very 
clear that we must examine our social program spending in a real 
and basic way.
<P>
	The root of the problem is the enormous and increasing debt 
of the country, a debt with interest payments eating up the 
amount of tax dollars available for social programs. In less than 
one decade the debt has more than doubled. In 1984-85 the 
national debt was $206 billion. By 1994 the federal debt is 
exceeding $500 billion. Not only has this debt increased by $300 
billion in less than a decade, the rate of increase is gaining 
momentum at a frightening speed.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Interest payments on the debt are not getting any smaller. It is 
quite the contrary. They are increasing by billions of dollars 
every year. Interest payments last year were $39 billion while 
our revenues were only $121 billion. This means that the 
government will be paying more tax dollars toward interest 
payments on the debt and less and less on social programs.
<P>
	While interest payments in support of the debt increase so 
does the amount of money the government is spending on social 
programs for Canadians. In 1984 the total amount of money 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="619"> 619 </A></B>
<P>
transferred to Canadians was  $25.1 billion. By the end of that 
decade the cost had increased to $30 billion, an increase of $5 
billion in only five years. Transfers to other levels of 
governments in support of social programs have also increased 
from $17.7 billion in 1984 to $24.3 billion by the end of the 
decade.
<P>
	With less and less money available for social programs 
spending because of the spiralling debt costs while program 
spending is increasing at an alarming rate, it is only a matter of 
time before we can no longer sustain social programs which 
make Canada such a unique and wonderful place to live. If we 
cannot sustain our social programs it will be the poor and 
disadvantaged of our nation who will suffer most.
<P>
	My riding of Athabasca has a significant aboriginal 
population. While some reserves are financially capable of 
sustaining social spending because of revenues from oil and gas 
reserves, the majority of the reserves of my riding mirror that of 
the national aboriginal statistics.
<P>
	Let me give some staggering statistics on natives in Canada 
and why the sustainability of these social programs is so 
important to our native communities. The native population 
today is experiencing a baby boom similar to what Canada 
experienced in the 1950s. Because of this baby boom natives 
rely more on Canada's social programs to build houses and 
schools, to provide health care services and to raise their 
standard of living above helpless poverty. If the government 
does not take control and reduce the debt, how can we continue 
to provide these basic services to the native communities that 
depend so heavily on these programs as well as other 
Canadians?
<P>
	Also, 60 per cent of our natives live in remote rural areas of 
Canada. It is obvious that because of their location the delivery 
of social programs becomes very difficult and expensive to 
provide. Forty per cent of the total status Indian population 
receives social assistance. Approximately half the adult male 
population is unemployed, although on some reserves these 
rates can increase to as much as three-quarters or four-fifths of 
the able bodied population.
<P>
	Additional problems face Canada's native communities 
including the tragedy of alcoholism, gasoline sniffing, suicide 
and many other problems. Davis Inlet is but one example of 
what these horrible inflictions can do to a community. How will 
government be able to help these communities by funding 
addiction clinics, counsellors and doctors if the debt continues 
to increase and eat up available funds? If the debt continues to 
increase we will not be able to sustain the programs we have 
today, let alone fund new ones.
<P>
	Federal spending on Indian and Inuit programs has doubled 
since 1982-1983 and is the fastest growing area of federal 
spending. Under legislation federal program spending is capped 
at 3 per cent annually by the Spending Control Act, but for some 
reason native programs are exempted and far exceed this rate. 
Total  federal spending on Indian and Inuit programs now 
exceeds $7 billion in non-taxable dollars or $60,000 per family 
of four. With this level of funding why do we have problems like 
those in Davis Inlet?
<P>
	When I review the Auditor General's reports of the last 20 
years I notice that every time he examined part of Indian affairs 
programs concerns were raised about accountability for money 
spent. He continually questioned whether funds were used for 
the purposes intended or managed with due regard for economy, 
efficiency and effectiveness.
<P>
	Not only must we reduce the debt to be able to sustain 
Canada's social programs, we must seek ways to lower the cost 
of providing social programs to natives. Abusers of the system 
must always be exposed and dealt with in an expeditious 
manner.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	I believe the administration and management of some of these 
social programs can be much more efficiently and effectively 
delivered to the native community by natives themselves which 
in fact appears to be the direction the government is going.
<P>
	By providing a system of block funding and allowing natives 
to decide for themselves what their priorities will be, we could 
cut a lot of red tape and inefficiency out of the system which 
natives themselves claim is contained in the department. The 
only qualification I must add to this proposal is that native bands 
must meet rigid standards of accountability for tax dollars 
received which is exactly what the Auditor General has been 
demanding for the past 20 years.
<P>
	We must end the waste and squandering of dollars that is 
going on today. The natives must set their own priorities. Are 
water and sewers a higher priority than Ovide Mercredi 
travelling to Mexico to assess the aboriginal uprising or other 
natives travelling to England to protest in front of Buckingham 
Palace, as well as native leaders taking trips to Geneva, South 
America, South Africa? The list goes on and on.
<P>
	Safeguards must be put in place to monitor more closely the 
funding of projects in aboriginal communities, to end the 
provision of substandard housing and other infrastructure 
projects which could possibly pose health hazards and safety 
risks to the people occupying them in these communities and 
provide better accountability for the tax dollars spent.
<P>
	Another recommendation I would like to make is to provide 
incentives for native students to be educated in fields which are 
needed back on the reserves, examples being medicine, business 
management, nursing and so on. By encouraging this type of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="620"> 620 </A></B>
<P>
training the government can save thousands of dollars in 
transportation costs to give native people access to the programs 
because they could receive them in their own communities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 
listening to the minister, this morning, I really have the feeling 
that the government wants to opt out of the social programs, 
which does not come as a surprise to me, since the Liberal 
government is following in the footsteps of the Conservative 
Party. It is a well-known fact. For several months now, the 
media have been telling us that the Liberal government wants to 
withdraw from social programs, because of a lack of money.
<P>
	Faced with Canada's enormous deficit, the Liberals want to 
dump it in the provinces' backyard as much as possible. Besides, 
it has been estimated that by the year 2000 the federal 
government will put no money in social programs. That 
responsibility will be left to the provinces, but the federal 
government will keep establishing national standards and 
criteria, which is totally ridiculous.
<P>
	The federal government is developing standards for all 
provinces to follow, while it will be the responsibility of the 
provinces to pay for these programs. That goes to show how 
ludicrous the present federal system is, so ludicrous in fact that 
it convinced Quebecers they had to opt out early.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kilgour):</B> I think this comment 
was not addressed to the hon. member for Athabasca. Is there 
anyone who wants to ask a question or make a comment about 
the speech made by the hon. member for Athabasca?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will try not to play politics here and ask a serious 
question of the member who spoke for the Reform Party. He and 
his party have constantly argued that we should cut social 
spending and do so in the interests of those who are receiving the 
social programs.
<P>
	I wonder if I could ask him two questions. How does he 
explain the fact the cuts under the last government merely 
increased the demand on both unemployment insurance and 
social assistance across the country? There were major efforts 
over the last five years to cut social spending, to cut moneys 
going to the provinces. All that happened was the number of UI 
recipients went up. The cost of running the program went up as 
did social assistance.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, what notice is he and his party prepared to take of 
those groups who represent the poor, the recipients of social 
programs in moulding the new social programs that we 
rightfully need in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, the whole thrust of my 
presentation was not that we must cut social spending, although 
when 60 per cent of government spending goes to social 
programs we clearly have to examine the benefit of those 
programs and assure Canadians that we get real value for every 
tax dollar spent on social programs.
<P>
	As I said in my presentation there is a tremendous lack of 
accountability for dollars spent. In my view a tremendous 
number of dollars can be saved, or at least greater benefit 
received by the poorest people in our society, for those dollars 
spent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on the occasion of my first remarks to this House permit me to 
congratulate you on your election as Deputy Speaker. As a 
newcomer here I rely on your expertise and your ability.
<P>
	I also wish to thank the voters of beautiful 
Okanagan-Shuswap for putting their trust in me to try to 
represent their needs and hopes in this historic Chamber. I 
especially want to thank my wife, Cicely, for her unfailing 
support throughout the election campaign and I know my wife 
wants to thank the voters for getting me out of her hair.
<P>
	Okanagan-Shuswap is a mixed rural-urban riding. Our 
sources of employment are many and varied. Historically our 
agriculture grew up around ranches producing beef for the 
Barkerville gold rush along the Hudson Bay fur brigade trails, 
north from the Columbia River up through the Okanagan Valley 
and across to Fort Kamloops.
<P>
	Lord Aberdeen, the Governor General of Canada, and Lady 
Aberdeen visited their famous Coldstream ranch in 
Okanagan-Shuswap each fall for many years. Against the 
advice of their ranch manager who told them to share crop the 
vast acreage for profit, the Aberdeens decided to sell a portion of 
it as five-acre plots to Englishmen to come to Canada and grow 
fruit, thus launching our modern Okanagan fruit producing 
industry.
<P>
	The influences and values shown by these pioneers remain 
strong in Okanagan-Shuswap today; love for our fertile land, 
being comfortable with hard work, and being willing to sacrifice 
for an ideal.
<P>
	Some of these ideals can be seen by the kind of volunteer fund 
raising in our area in the past two years. For example, the 
Okanagan Valley, including Salmon Arm, recently raised over 
$600,000 for additions to valley wide campuses of Okanagan 
University. This shows our commitment to higher education.
<P>
	The area served by the Vernon Jubilee Hospital raised 
$760,000 for a CAT scanner and the building to house it to help 
diagnose serious illnesses. This shows our commitment to 
excellent health care.
<P>
	The area in and around our biggest city of Vernon, total 
service area population of about 56,000, went over their target 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="621"> 621 </A></B>
<P>
of $600,000 for a new women's transition home. The original 
building dated from 1977, one of the  first women's transition 
houses in Canada. This shows our commitment to the family and 
our concern for the innocent victims of its breakdown.
<P>
	Today's small community of Enderby, with the highest per 
capita number of senior citizens in Canada second only to 
Victoria, was famed in the late 1800s for growing wheat and 
milling and shipping flour around the Pacific rim, loaded at 
Fortune's Landing. Today Enderby and all of 
Okanagan-Shuswap is concerned that government pensions be 
maintained for households with incomes below the Canadian 
average.
<P>
	I wish to praise the government for this motion indicating that 
it is prepared to ask Canadians what social programs it values 
the most and, hopefully, what areas of government spending it is 
willing to see cut in order to pay for those essential programs.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	However, the Reform Party already asked Canadians those 
very questions at the start of the 1993 federal election campaign 
in our program called, Let the People Speak. Canadians told us 
most important was health care, pensions for households with 
incomes below the Canadian average, higher education and the 
environment. We therefore pledged that if we formed the next 
government we would maintain those programs at the same 
level in real dollars.
<P>
	Canadians agreed that we should cut deeply in other areas of 
spending, including federally funded bilingualism and grants 
for multiculturalism and for special interest groups to pay for 
the most essential programs.
<P>
	Canadians know that the only way to ensure the future of our 
treasured social programs is to be sure they are fully funded and 
on a sound financial footing we can sustain for the future.
<P>
	Sustaining any program means we as a nation must create 
wealth. The way to create wealth is to have jobs. I know the 
voters back home in Okanagan-Shuswap are profoundly 
concerned about jobs, as are most Canadians. Because I have the 
honour of chairing the Reform caucus committee on labour and 
employment, I would like to comment on job implications of 
this motion.
<P>
	The 1963 throne speech proclaimed, in loud and forceful 
terms, that any Canadian, young or old, who wanted a job must 
be able to find one. Back in the early 1960s the so-called full 
rate of unemployment was estimated by the Economic Council 
of Canada to be about 3 per cent, making some allowances for 
people changing jobs. Today we are not even dreaming about 
having a job for every Canadian who wants one let alone 
actually working and planning for that most desirable goal.
<P>
	According to Statistics Canada there were 14,022,000 people 
employed in Canada last month. They are the people who carry 
the load of producing some 58 per cent of this country's total tax 
revenue on their shoulders. They will be the ones who pay for 
any presently unfunded programs.
<P>
	Let me quote from the Year-End Review and 1994 Economic 
Outlook of the Canadian Manufacturers' Association. It states: 
``It takes the average company seven hours and fifty minutes in 
an eight-hour production shift just to cover operating costs. 
Taxes must be paid on top of that. Manufacturers are responding 
to these cash pressures by increasing operational efficiency and 
improving productivity. However, with their backs to the wall 
there is often little option open in the short term but to reduce 
costs by focusing on overhead and cutting jobs. Unless the cost 
burden that governments impose on businesses is significantly 
reduced prospects for future investment or employment do not 
appear very bright''.
<P>
	In a section of that report labelled Jobs on the Line, the 
Canadian Manufacturers' Association states: ``The average 
Canadian manufacturer is having to restructure today in order to 
cover fixed costs, forcing companies to reduce their labour costs 
in an effort to keep overall unit costs of production under 
control. Manufacturers are responding in one or a number of 
ways: contracting out services once performed in-house; 
relying more heavily on part-time workers; extending the work 
day; attempting to freeze or reduce wages, salaries and benefits; 
or downsizing their work force. Labour costs are being cut 
because they are one of the few variable costs that firms are able 
to reduce. Of the more than 325,000 jobs lost in Canadian 
manufacturing since mid-1989, about 60 per cent can be 
attributed to cost pressures unrelated to production 
performances''.
<P>
	In short, increasing taxes decreases jobs. Therefore, I must 
conclude by urging the government to recognize that the only 
sure way to keep the social programs which Canadians treasure 
is to control spending enough to improve the employment 
picture in Okanagan-Shuswap and all of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the last speaker and I generally 
agree with most of what he said. However, there is one 
remaining problem which has to be solved as quickly as 
possible.
<P>
	When you take a look at what has happened in Quebec over 
the last two years, you realize that the ministers responsible for 
manpower training, Mr. Valcourt in Ottawa and Mr. Bourbeau in 
Quebec, met several times and even argued at times to get the 
results we now know of. Right now in Quebec, there are over 
80,000 jobs available and our employment situation is abysmal. 
More than 25,000 people have applied for development training, 
but the funds allocated to the institutions  delivering those 
training programs are frozen. This situation is unacceptable.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="622"> 622 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	What we are asking for is for Ottawa to give to Quebec all the 
money earmarked for training. In Quebec, we know what kind of 
manpower development is required by the industy. We have very 
specialized needs at times and they are different from what 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba or any other province need. So, let us 
give the money to Quebec in order to enable Quebecers to look 
after the development of their own labour force.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think there was actually a 
question directed to me in that statement by the hon. member. If 
what the province of Quebec wants is total control of funding of 
its UI and the employment picture, I cannot see why other 
provinces cannot ask for the same.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I would like to say to the hon. 
member that I listened to his remarks attentively. I share his 
view that the small and medium sized businessmen are under 
stress right now because of the incredible paper burden and tax 
situation which exists at all levels of government. I thought the 
hon. member's comments, unlike those of the Bloc Quebecois, 
were constructive.
<P>
	Today is the day the minister of human resources has said that 
we are going to start afresh, that we are going to look at new 
ideas and new proposals. He did not say that we were going to 
withdraw from all social programs. He said that we were going 
to look at the existing social programs to see if they are meeting 
their original objectives.
<P>
	For example, if there is a Government of Canada program of 
which only 10 cents on the dollar is going to the end user then 
obviously we would not want to support continuing that 
program.
<P>
	The Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition said in his 
opening remarks-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The question has been put. The 
member has less than a minute to reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> There is no reply to that. I thank the hon. 
member for his remarks.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today in 
support of the government's action plan for social reform 
announced by the hon. Minister for Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	First, I would like to preamble my speech with somewhat of a 
rebuttal to the statement made by the Leader of the Official 
Opposition. I wonder what century this leader lives in. Where 
does he come from? What direction is he coming from? What 
kind of visionary is this individual to speak in a duplicitous 
language that does not really relate to what I would call the 
honest bold  truth about facts and figures relating to the transfer 
of programs or the overall social security programs? As a matter 
of fact, I am a little alarmed by the lack of substance in the 
speech given by the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	If the truth were to be known it should be put as such. The 
federal contribution to social security programs in Quebec is 
$14.6 billion. This is 28 per cent of all national funds. As the 
Prime Minister said two weeks ago, Quebecers will lose if 
Ottawa transfers employment and training programs to Quebec. 
They will lose because the transfer will have to be done on a per 
capita basis. It will be a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars. It 
will represent in fact $200 more in taxes for each Quebecer.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	I would like to be heard and reiterate: Every Quebecer will 
have to pay $200 more in taxes. These are figures that we have 
worked through our officials. These figures are good. These 
figures are solid. They are substantive. They are validated.
<P>
	Will that help the unemployed in Montreal, the young people 
looking for better training opportunities, many of whom I have 
met? No. If the Leader of the Opposition is honest with 
Quebecers he ought to tell them what will be the real cost of 
these transfers. Is he saying to the one million children living in 
poverty that we do not have the mandate or the leadership given 
to us by the citizens of this country to do something? Is he saying 
that the status quo is good enough? Well, we say no. We are the 
government and we say no.
<P>
	I would like to address the House on what these social reforms 
will mean specifically for the young people of Canada. 
Canadians, aged 17 to 25 have as much to gain from the 
rebuilding of our social safety net as any other group in the 
country.
<P>
	First I would like to address an important question, a question 
that I am sure many Canadians are asking themselves and will be 
asking themselves over the course of this rebuilding process: 
Why is the government reforming our social security programs? 
The answer is that this government wants to redistribute 
opportunity more broadly so that many people will have a decent 
standard of living and can build good lives for themselves and 
their families.
<P>
	Not since the great depression have people in this country 
faced so many economic and social changes. The constant 
tinkering that has occurred over the years is failing to meet the 
realities of our young people, our work force, our society in the 
1990s and beyond. The failings have become shockingly evident 
as we see the wasted, alienated and sometimes desperate state of 
many of our unemployed young people as well as many other 
Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="623"> 623 </A></B>
<P>
	We want to rebuild society for young Canadians who need 
help to get their lives back on track. Being the same, leaving 
things status quo is not going to do it. Sole parents, mostly 
young single mothers who want training to find work, cannot 
afford to lose their benefits to do that. Single young people on 
welfare who want to go back to school cannot find a job to 
support themselves while studying full time. As well there are 
drop-outs who need to improve their reading, writing and job 
search skills to enter the work force. In restoring security we 
want to offer employment training and education choices and 
restore hope to young people and restore hope to the future of 
our country.
<P>
	Our long-term goal is to create a more productive economy 
by investing in the potential of our young people. To do all this 
we have to recognize the needs of young people who are on 
unemployment insurance or social assistance and want to break 
their dependency and do something with their lives.
<P>
	Their needs could not be any clearer than what Statistics 
Canada reported last week and I quote: ``Young persons were the 
big losers in the recent recession''. With an unemployment rate 
of 17.7 per cent there were half a million fewer young people 
working in 1993 than before the recession.
<P>
	Let us put aside this urgent problem of high youth 
unemployment for one moment to look at the changing nature of 
the work force. Forty per cent of young people are working part 
time. In 1992 youth unemployment was 1.6 per cent of the adult 
rate. Non-traditional jobs are becoming more common as 
people scramble to find contract work, part-time jobs or 
seasonal work to make some money in this changing global 
economy.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance stated last week we are moving 
away from a resource based economy to an information based 
economy. Youth are not developing the skills required for this 
information based economy. Young people have trained for jobs 
that are now in low demand, while jobs in emerging fields are 
looking for skilled workers.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Youth who have been taught traditional skills, such as 
trapping, farming and fishing now face a very bleak future. That 
is the situation not only for young people but all people in those 
fields of occupation are facing a very bleak endeavour. That is 
the situation for young people who have skills to market, but 
what about the young people who lack the most basic reading 
and math skills? We can call them early school leavers or we can 
call them drop-outs but they all have the same problem.
<P>
	In some provinces the drop out rate is 30 per cent. In the north 
it can be as high as 95 per cent. These people do not even have 
the bare minimum qualifications for the workforce.
<P>
	Companies that once demanded grade 9 or 10 for entry level 
jobs have raised the mark to grade 12. Chrysler's mini van plant 
in Windsor is an example. All young people have to wrestle with 
the same labour market forces but not all are equally prepared to 
combat them.
<P>
	This inability to compete for some is the result of child 
poverty and neglect. One in five children live in poor families. 
That is over one million children. If we do nothing for fear of 
interfering with the agenda of other people and maintain the 
status quo, we are in a sense betraying the mandate we have been 
given. We are in a sense betraying the trust we have been given 
to rebuild hope and rebuild opportunities for those people.
<P>
	Many are children of sole parents, mostly single mothers or 
teenage mothers who are caught in the poverty trap, dependent 
on social welfare without any opportunity to progress. Many 
young people with no education, no jobs and no future are 
turning to destructive social acts with harmful consequences for 
all Canadians. Schools, malls and neighbourhoods are dealing 
with gang violence and youth crime.
<P>
	Reality is not a pretty picture. Reality is something we are 
grappling with, something we are prepared to work with, 
something worth taking a risk for, something to stick our necks 
for. That is the reality of many of these young and poor 
Canadians.
<P>
	Young people are involved in robberies for clothing and other 
essentials. The link between economic hardship and crime is 
well known. Young people are bored, looking for an escape, 
anything to kill time. Some turn to drugs and alcohol for 
comfort. Some end up homeless on the streets.
<P>
	The RCMP have a file of 41,000 missing children. They are 
not all missing. Some have joined the under-class of society. 
They end up on welfare, some of them locked in for life. We 
need to break the cycle of dependence. Young people all over the 
country are hurting. We cannot allow our young people to 
wallow in abject poverty and grow up in dead-end situations.
<P>
	Indeed, Canadians all over the world reacted with horror at 
the sight of children sniffing gasoline in Davis Inlet. I know hon. 
members on the other side have made statements about their 
horror and shock at seeing this on television. What happened at 
Davis Inlet, Labrador is the worst symptom of all that is wrong 
when we abandon our young people. What hope do the children 
of Davis Inlet have for a better future if we do nothing for that 
fear, if we take no risk, if we maintain the status quo? What are 
we doing? Ultimately we are betraying the hopes of those people 
for a better future.
<P>
	I have seen many similar desperate situations in the north 
throughout my life and in different centres across the country. If 
most Canadians only knew the kinds of nightmarish conditions 
young people are battling in some of our most populated areas, 
some of the inner-city poor. If most Canadians only knew the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="624"> 624 </A></B>
<P>
horror of the  conditions in which some young people are living 
in some of our most isolated communities then I think things 
might have a chance to improve.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	The housing needs across Canada are severe. We need 11,000 
units across this country. Twenty-five per cent of households in 
the Northwest Territories are in need. This is the highest 
proportion of households in need compared to the national 
average of 12 per cent. We need 3,400 units in the north under 
the severest conditions.
<P>
	We have probably recorded the coldest month of January in 
Ottawa. It is minus 17 point something. Think of how cold it 
must be in the north. The north's population is young and 
gaining rapidly. The birth rate is almost twice the national 
average, yet 41 per cent of the children in the north under the age 
of 12 live in overcrowded housing. These conditions have a 
direct negative impact on their performance in school, their 
health, social development and their well-being.
<P>
	Aboriginal people, as was indicated by my hon. colleague 
from Athabasca, have among other things the highest illiteracy 
rate and the lowest incomes of any other group. What does that 
spell for these young people? Only 3 per cent of aboriginal youth 
complete grade 12. In a nine-year period 154 students graduated 
from grade 12 in the Baffin region.
<P>
	Where will the future leaders of the north come from if not 
from their own schools, their own communities, their own 
families with the proper support systems?
<P>
	Society in a sense is paralysed, is immobilized by a myriad of 
problems that challenge us as legislators. We sit in the highest 
court in the land and we are charged with the responsibilities of 
making laws that will subsequently make life better for those 
who have the greatest need.
<P>
	A chaotic family life is scarred by high drop-out rates, 
teenage pregnancy, physical and sexual abuse, solvent, drug and 
alcohol abuse, increased incidents of juvenile delinquency and 
suicide. In the north the suicide rate for youth between the ages 
of 15 and 24 is more than five times the Canadian average. I was 
told in Big Cove suicides are one a month. Can you imagine? 
One a month.
<P>
	While the problems are magnified in the north, it is happening 
in southern cities too. The native population has grown an 
average of 41 per cent in Canada's 25 largest cities between 
1986 and 1991. Although more and more are staying in school 
and graduating into jobs, the outlook is bleak for the majority.
<P>
	Aside from high levels of unemployment, suicide and 
substance abuse, many face plain and simple discrimination, 
even if they try to get a job. Graduates from the Gabriel Dumont 
Institute who appeared before the aboriginal commission have 
spoken about the problems of finding employment, largely as a 
result of systemic racism and stereotyping of Métis people.
<P>
	Some young people are quite able to guide themselves 
through the pitfalls because of the support of family, friends and 
strong self-esteem. What about those young people who need 
more help, who do not have that hand outstretched to them? 
What about the neediest of the needy?
<P>
	In the past, all too often we have sent them to the 
unemployment line or the welfare line and left them there and 
tried to forget. Our social security system has become a net that 
entraps rather than liberates them for greater opportunities. We 
never foresaw such a multitude of social problems affecting the 
ability of our young people to make a successful move from 
school to work. The result is that young people are more 
dependent on social assistance.
<P>
	The Province of Newfoundland has found that UI dependence 
is beginning at a very early age. One out of two 19-year-olds is 
on unemployment insurance at some time during the year. The 
cycle of dependency must end. As Geraldine Kenney-Wallace, 
the President of McMaster University has said, &quot;in order to 
compete globally we must raise the literacy and numeracy skills 
in general&quot;.
<P>
	We have to do more. We have to do it better. We all have 
something to contribute toward finding solutions. Our 
government is prepared to make a commitment to the young 
people of Canada. The Ministry of Health is working on an 
innovative program and many others, such as the aboriginal 
head-start program. Skills and nutrition and parenting are 
taught so that the children will begin their lives in an improved 
atmosphere. This is pro-active; this is progressive. This is 
something where, before we create the problems, we will have 
created an atmosphere that will avoid them, an atmosphere 
where parents have self-esteem that they can pass on to their 
children.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Our government will take the renewed sense of worth of these 
children and ensure that programs are instituted to keep these 
children in school.
<P>
	The Canada Youth Service Corps will help unemployed youth 
to discover a fresh approach to learning and building 
self-esteem. The youth service corps will provide young people 
with skills to enable them to begin their career path.
<P>
	Not only that, we also have the national youth apprenticeship 
program that will garner a lot more attention in months to come. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="625"> 625 </A></B>
<P>
This again will help young Canadians to develop the skills 
needed in the growing  economic sectors, with business and 
labour setting the standards.
<P>
	These programs, along with others, will provide youth with 
opportunities to compete and better themselves.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by saying that in the aboriginal 
society that I come from there are three philosophies that are 
specific to the success of how people help one another. One, is 
fundamental change. There is a word called guli gogho 
agudegha, because we need real change in a big way, 
fundamental change. It cannot happen without that.
<P>
	The other thing is working together. Dene tuluh keh egalats 
edegha: we are going to work on our future path together. It is 
only by that we can succeed. This is the path that we all come out 
together and work on. It is our future path.
<P>
	The third is our destiny, dene galé. We all have one, whether 
we are aboriginal or non-aboriginal.
<P>
	I say to my colleagues, that our destiny is brought to us 
through our hands, through our hearts, through our minds, and 
we cannot do it alone. This thing we call dene tuluh, our future 
road, our path, is one that is done together; it is one that comes 
together. Through each individual effort we will make 
something for the people of our country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to thank the hon. member for Western Arctic for her 
excellent speech, and especially for what she said about the 
men, women and children of Davis Inlet.
<P>
	You may be assured that my colleagues and I-as we and as 
the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean mentioned last week-will 
make a concerted effort to expedite the kind of action that is 
necessary to deal with the sad plight of this community, as 
reported on <I>Le Point</I> last week.
<P>
	However, I am less inclined to agree with what the hon. 
member said about the speech by the Leader of the Official 
Opposition and member for Lac-Saint-Jean, when she 
commented on his and the Bloc's demands in terms of managing 
manpower training and unemployment insurance.
<P>
	These are not the demands of our members but of the people 
who reside in Quebec and have made those demands since 1988. 
This is especially true since the creation of what we in Quebec 
refer to as the forum on employment. Participants include 
representatives from all parts of the political spectrum, 
including Ghyslain Dufour, Gérald Larose, and others; and there 
is a consensus on patriating all components connected with the 
labour market.
<P>
	My second comment, and I will be very brief. When the hon. 
member referred to the surplus Quebec received under the 
federal system, I would say we have a surplus on some items but 
a deficit on others. On the whole, since 1988 Quebecers paid $28 
billion in taxes to the  federal Treasury and got back more or less 
what they put in.
<P>
	However, as far as equalization payments are concerned, it is 
true we have a surplus. I will tell you why: we are the province 
with the highest percentage of poor families. In other words, 
16.2 per cent of low-income families live in Quebec. We rank 
first, followed by Newfoundland, so it is only fair we should 
have more in the way of equalization. The same applies to 
unemployment and welfare. Basically, the federal system 
prevents us from getting out of the poverty cycle, and Quebecers 
are fed up with transfer payments and welfare.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Finally, we have to compare this surplus with what we lost 
during the past thirty years in terms of research and 
development, transportation, agriculture, and so forth. The real 
figures are there. Ask your officials to redo those calculations 
with their net surplus of $200 for each Quebecer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am really happy that 
the representative for the Official Opposition, my hon. 
colleague, has risen to place a number of comments that would 
be questions. I will respond no less.
<P>
	He indicated that party officials and leaders were not the ones 
who wanted this question of jurisdiction to be settled, it was the 
people who wanted it. Since the election I have been into Quebec 
twice and I have an idea of some of the things they want. They 
want leadership. The Official Opposition has been given the 
mandate to express leadership with a vision to creating jobs and 
an atmosphere that would be conducive to improving the 
economy. They have also been given the mandate to create 
better opportunities for Quebecers.
<P>
	On my forays into Quebec, on the consultations with the youth 
service corps, the most popular elements of the five streams of 
the youth service corps program were the personal development 
and social development aspects of that program. That had the 
greatest interest because those were particular to the needs of 
the people who have the greatest need in Quebec.
<P>
	We know if we get the co-operation for change, we are 
engaging in this particular approach to effect change 
fundamentally, a major restructuring, so that we can provide the 
opportunities that are lacking there. We are appealing to the 
Official Opposition for its co-operation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the member, for whom I hold 
considerable respect, for her speech. She pointed out the plight 
of the young, the unemployed and the aboriginal peoples in 
particular.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="626"> 626 </A></B>
<P>
	I note that she talked about the need for fundamental change, 
the need to take risks. She pointed out that leaving things in the 
status quo simply will not do. I could not agree more.
<P>
	She also talked about the long-term goal of making the 
economy more productive. She surely would agree, though, that 
appointing Gordon Thiessen to the Bank of Canada, following 
on the principles of John Crow, with a mad obsession with 
inflation, signing on to NAFTA, increases to UI premiums and 
reductions to the UI training fund, let alone proposed 
suggestions for cuts to cigarette taxes, can only harm the youth, 
can only harm their employment opportunities and their health 
opportunities.
<P>
	I wonder how she fits those policy directions, which are 
clearly not fundamental change in any meaningful, good 
direction, with her suggestions that we do indeed need 
fundamental change.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, we were given a clear 
mandate on the things in the Red Book we said we would do. In a 
very short time we have delivered on most of those promises. 
We have dealt with a number of issues. I have to say that has not 
been the case for the proposal that came forward from that hon. 
member's party.
<P>
	We have a mandate. We have been given a clear mandate. In a 
sense, we have been given the authority to do the things that we 
have done in very little time. Basically we are not going to find a 
path through which we are going to nit-pick on specifics to stop 
us from undertaking fundamental change; broad, sweeping 
moves that will have the most fundamental impact on most 
Canadians, not to suit the political agenda of one particular 
political party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, since this is a debate on restructuring 
all the human resource initiatives that exist in this country, I 
would like to ask the member, through you Mr. Speaker, a very 
specific question.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	An important weakness in the preparation of young Canadians 
to participate in the labour force is the lack of linkages between 
the school and the work place. By way of comparison, in 
Germany some 70 per cent of students enrol at the age of 16 or 
17 on the famous dual system, in which a part of each work week 
is spent in the classroom and part on the shop floor acquiring 
practical experience under the direction of a professional 
instructor. My question is, will the minister of youth, in this 
period of renewal and reform, look into and consider such a 
system?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, we have looked to the 
experience of Germany, which has a great trades tradition. They 
are very good at apprenticeships. We enrol 124,000 Canadians a 
year; we only graduate 24,000. We know it is not working. We 
want to fix it. We are looking to Germany, which graduates 
about 400,000 a  year. We know that they have the tradition. We 
are looking at revamping the whole image of trades and suiting 
it to modern needs. We are doing that and we intend to get the 
help of the hon. member who asked the question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, during the 
past sixty years, Quebec and Canada have gradually put in place 
a variety of social programs, more commonly known today as 
our social safety net. These programs are part of our Quebec and 
Canadian heritage, in that they reflect values that are important 
to our societies.
<P>
	Two basic characteristics of social programs are universality 
and accessibility. The principle of universality means that all 
citizens of Quebec and Canada are entitled to receive benefits 
offered under the program. Accessibility means that insured 
individuals have reasonable access to the services offered, 
unhampered by any financial barriers.
<P>
	Although formerly, the focus was on helping the poor and the 
destitute, Quebec and Canada have since opted for guaranteeing 
each citizen a minimum standard of living. This guarantee is 
now considered a right.
<P>
	To this end, the federal government has, over the years, put in 
place a number of social programs, including medicare, the 
Canada Assistance Plan, family allowances, old age security, 
the guaranteed income supplement, spousal allowances, 
unemployment insurance and the now defunct social housing 
program.
<P>
	Social programs are today one of the main responsibilities of 
the federal government, which designs and implements some of 
these programs directly, as in the case of old age security and 
unemployment insurance. The government indirectly provides 
funding for other programs while setting certain rules for their 
implementation, as in the case of welfare payments and daycare 
under the Canada Assistance Plan and provincial spending on 
health care.
<P>
	According to this funding format, federal spending on social 
programs varies between 70 and 80 billion dollars or two-thirds 
of federal program spending.
<P>
	Although existing social programs, with the exception of 
unemployment insurance and pensions, come under provincial 
jurisdiction, the federal government has always been able to 
impose universality and accessibility as well as the application 
of certain criteria, thanks to its spending power.
<P>
	Practically speaking, only two programs are truly universal, 
up to a point: health care and old age security. As far as the latter 
is concerned, the federal government now requires the elderly to 
pay back part of their pension cheque if their net income exceeds 
$50,000, and the entire amount if net income exceeds $76,000. 
One sixth of federal revenues, or $20 billion, are allocated under 
this program. This is an enormous amount which will  increase 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="627"> 627 </A></B>
<P>
as the population ages. What will happen then in terms of 
universality and accessibility?
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Universality as it applies to family allowances was eliminated 
in the 1992 budget. As I indicated a few moments ago, the 
previous government scrapped universal old age pensions by 
imposing a special tax. Today, health care universality and 
accessibility are threatened in several provinces where user fees 
are being considered.
<P>
	It has been stated repeatedly over the past several years that 
Canada is no longer able to guarantee the universality of its 
social programs. Some argue that Canada's social safety net is 
outmoded and too expensive. The fact is that the system was put 
in place during the 1960s when jobs and money were plentiful. 
However, the fundamental principles are as important today as 
they were then. It should be noted that Canada spends less on 
these programs on a per capita basis than most Western 
industrialized nations.
<P>
	Moreover, universality of social programs is a question of 
social justice. Without universality, without accessibility, the 
poor will become increasingly marginalized in our society and 
the middle class will be at the mercy of misfortune.
<P>
	We have a decision to make. If we believe that all citizens are 
entitled to universal and accessible social programs, then we 
have to take steps to eliminate the loopholes in our tax system 
and create jobs to build up our tax revenues. When each and 
every Canadian works and contributes his or her fair, reasonable 
share of taxes, only then will we be able to cover the cost of the 
system.
<P>
	I would like at this time to briefly review a few of the most 
important programs, starting with unemployment insurance.
<P>
	The aim of this program, which was launched in 1941, was to 
provide assistance to workers who had lost their jobs and to tide 
them over until they found another job. It was intended to be a 
temporary measure. Today, many people draw unemployment 
insurance every year in a planned manner. They do so simply by 
working the required number of weeks to qualify. Theoretically, 
the program should finance itself. However, it is roughly $400 
million in the red on revenues of $19 billion. Given the current 
rules of the game, recipients receive little encouragement or 
help in finding a stable job and too little is done to train those 
who are underqualified.
<P>
	I know of people in my riding who currently collect 
unemployment insurance and who, in spite of their efforts and 
desire to improve their employability, are unable to find work or 
receive training. Unfortunately I also know of others who would 
rather collect generous benefits than work at an available low 
paying job.
<P>
	We must not blame those who live off the UI program. They 
are only reacting very rationally to ludicrous incentives. The 
rules of this program are socially and economically 
counterproductive. Within two generations, these rules have 
profoundly changed the way people behave. As the great Quebec 
poet Félix Leclerc said 20 years ago, when people are paid to do 
nothing, they become zombies.
<P>
	The jobs that are available today require highly skilled 
workers. Or people can start up their own small business. Our 
unemployment insurance program is woefully inadequate when 
it comes to helping people acquire the necessary skills or start 
up a business.
<P>
	The unemployment insurance program is universal and 
accessible only in so far as collecting premiums and paying out 
benefits are concerned. There is absolutely no such universality 
or accessibility when it comes to supporting training or 
entrepreneurship. Twenty-five thousand Quebecers are 
currently waiting for training to which they do not have access.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the increase in the number of weeks of insurable 
employment needed to qualify for unemployment insurance 
benefits and the reduction in benefits have increased the social 
welfare costs of all provinces and of Quebec, simply by 
transferring the costs from one level of government to another.
<P>
	The previous government completely abdicated its social 
responsibilities for unemployment insurance. Not only did its 
fiscal and monetary measures contribute to a dramatic increase 
in unemployment, but faced with this situation which could have 
been avoided, it changed in cowardly fashion the criteria and 
duration of eligibility so as to offload onto the provinces the 
burden of the unemployment which it had created. While 
everything indicated the need to invest energetically in training 
and small business creation, the previous government took 
paltry, inadequate measures.
<P>
	In Quebec, the labour force development corporation was 
quite prepared to take useful action right away to correct the 
misdeeds of the previous government with respect to 
unemployment. The then Minister of Employment and 
Immigration, however, after the Charlottetown accord was 
rejected, refused to let Quebec act as it should have done.
<P>
	The unemployment insurance program must be retargeted to 
training and job creation in a way that is universal and 
accessible. In this regard, Quebec and the provinces have a 
leading role to play.
<P>
	I would now like to share my thoughts on the Canada 
assistance plan with my colleagues in the House. In theory, this 
program ensures that Ottawa pays half the authorized welfare 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="628"> 628 </A></B>
<P>
expenses of the municipalities and provinces. Originally, this 
program was designed to ensure continuous support for a small 
number of individuals who could not work.
<P>
	Today, the situation is very different. This program helps 
many people who are able to work but cannot find any jobs. Even 
worse, little is done to help them re-enter the labour market. 
Many welfare recipients are unemployed people who have used 
up their unemployment insurance benefits. What I said earlier 
about training and entrepreneurship applies here too.
<P>
	Social assistance is universal and accessible as far as the right 
to benefits is concerned, but few beneficiaries of this program 
have access to serious measures that would put them back to 
work through specialized training or help in creating their own 
employment. In this sense, the program is neither universal nor 
accessible.
<P>
	Here we have an example of a perverse consequence of 
Canadian federalism. By reducing unemployment insurance 
coverage, the federal government has made honest unemployed 
people into welfare recipients dependent on their province or on 
Quebec. For the provinces and Quebec, the purpose of welfare 
was to provide extended support to people unable to work. The 
federal government's unilateral action has undermined the plans 
of the provinces and of Quebec.
<P>
	By retargeting the unemployment insurance program, the 
balance of the welfare program will be restored and these two 
programs will then provide the universality and accessibility 
which the people of Quebec and Canada need.
<P>
	There is another social program for which the issue of 
universality and accessibility should be raised, because this 
program is no longer in any way universal or accessible, despite 
crying needs. This is the social housing program.
<P>
	Before 1986, the federal government helped build about 
25,000 new housing units every year. Since then, as a result of a 
series of budgetary measures, this effort was reduced to 13,000 
units. In its 1992-93 budget, the previous government abolished 
its co-operative housing program.
<P>
	In Canada, at least 57 per cent of women and 30 per cent of 
men are tenants. Almost two thirds of the residents of public 
housing are women. Young women who head single-parent 
families, women working for low pay and older women on 
limited income must have access to affordably priced housing, 
as before. Already thousands of women spend a 
disproportionate share of their income on housing.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	As regards social housing, universality and accessibility are 
not only moral but also economic necessities. Indeed, people, 
families and children who live in inadequate dwellings are more 
likely to experience problems and, consequently, more likely to 
perform poorly at work or in school. They are also more likely to 
consume excessive amounts of intoxicating substances, to resort 
to violence and even to commit offences.
<P>
	Abolishing the social housing program was a very 
near-sighted economic measure. The resulting problems in 
terms of health, unemployment and criminality will be very 
serious.
<P>
	Medicare is a program which Quebecers and Canadians are 
proud of. Health insurance, along with post-secondary training, 
are financed through what is called established programs 
financing. Under this initiative implemented in 1977, every 
province is guaranteed a contribution proportional to its 
population and to the economic growth of Canada, minus an 
amount raised by each province through taxes. Let us not forget 
that, since 1986, the federal government has been reducing its 
financing, in terms of its rate of increase, regarding health 
services.
<P>
	Also, in 1990, Ottawa unilaterally decided that its 
contribution would no longer be tied to economic growth. 
Consequently, the per capita contribution is now frozen until 
1994-95 and, if the situation persists, it will eventually be 
totally covered by the tax levy in each province, including 
Quebec. Therefore, the federal government will no longer have 
to make any contribution. It must be pointed out, since this is yet 
another example of the perverse consequences of Canadian 
federalism, that all these measures were unilaterally 
implemented, without the approval of Quebec or of any other 
province, in spite of the formal agreement reached in 1977. So, 
from 1978 to 1993, the federal government's contribution to 
health and post-secondary education programs in Quebec 
dropped from 47 per cent to 34 per cent.
<P>
	Therefore, a freeze on federal transfers for EPF is in itself a 
serious threat to accessibility and universality. This trap set up 
by the federal government makes it even harder for Quebec and 
the other provinces to make the difficult choices they face to 
make up for their losses and to reduce their tax burden.
<P>
	The federal government must realize that increasing the tax 
burden of Quebec and the other provinces will result in the 
emergence of a two-tier health care system.
<P>
	Since the Liberal Party took office, I noticed two trends 
among its Cabinet members: some ministers are sensitive to the 
need for universality and accessibility, while others are more 
concerned by the financing aspect.
<P>
	Consequently, we hear terms such as restructuring, 
profitability, reform and review, which are all as vague as they 
are disturbing. What are the true intentions of the government? 
If it wants to redirect social programs, while preserving 
universality and accessibility, that would already be more 
encouraging, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="629"> 629 </A></B>
<P>
although we would have to define the targets to be given 
priority.
<P>
	But if the government wants to cut the social budget, then 
there is every reason to be really concerned. Indeed, cuts of this 
type will invariably generate increased costs further along.
<P>
	When economists tell the Minister of Finance that Canadians 
can no longer live above their means and must expect a lower 
standard of living, do they also tell him that it is the federal 
bureaucracy which is the most costly element and that a lower 
standard of living should start there? Streamlining is something 
which can be done within the federal government and 
bureaucracy.
<P>
	Recently, I read that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development had stated that he would not be very patient with 
those people in three-piece suits who insist that the cuts should 
apply to social programs, while they themselves are not 
prepared to do much. I agree with the hon. minister, but I remind 
him that this three-piece suit mentality also exists within the 
public service.
<P>
	Also, the hon. minister was upset by the calls of the Bloc 
Quebecois for the federal government not to meddle in the fields 
of training, education and welfare, which are under provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	The minister explained that these problems affect the whole 
country and that we need national programs to solve them.
<P>
	This is where I completely disagree with the minister. 
Training, education and welfare are problems a number of 
nations are faced with. If I were to follow the minister's 
reasoning, the UN would then be entrusted with the task of 
solving such problems. But of course the minister would answer 
that only a country has all the facts and the vision to understand 
its real problems. If the minister were to take his argument one 
step further, he would come, I think, to the right conclusion.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, to blindly cut social programs will not be 
helpful, quite the opposite. Our social policies must support the 
needy, improve skills and respect human decency.
<P>
	The government must remember that they can cut 
unemployment expenses simply by reducing unemployment and 
that they can cut health insurance expenses by providing 
housing for the underprivileged, for example.
<P>
	The Official Opposition will watch the government's every 
move and criticize any attempt to cut the services Quebec and 
Canadian society so badly need. We will automatically criticize 
any lack of consultation with the provinces and with Quebec, 
any administrative duplication reducing program efficiency, 
any costly and useless attempt to centralize the various systems, 
and any cut to programs aimed at meeting the special needs of 
Quebec or other provinces.
<P>
	Finally, Canadians and Quebecers can rest assured that the 
Official Opposition will do everything possible in this House to 
protect their interests and their dignity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, through you I would like to once 
again remind the opposition party that today is the beginning of 
a debate in which we are attempting to re-invent, redesign or 
review government programs and services with the ultimate aim 
of meeting many of the objectives that the hon. member 
described in his speech of decreasing, overlapping, and 
eliminating waste. We on this side of the House share that with 
you. I guess the only thing we do not share with you is that we do 
not believe in separation.
<P>
	There is a question related to putting people back to work. In 
1982 there was a program called NEED, designed by the then 
Minister of Employment, who happens to be the same member 
responsible today. It was a program where, rather than people 
being on unemployment where they received approximately 
$17,000 a year, people went directly to small and medium-sized 
businesses and said, ``If you take someone off unemployment or 
off the welfare rolls, then we will pay you approximately 60 to 
70 per cent of their salary'', rather than paying them to sit at 
home not doing anything. The employer would put in 
approximately 30 per cent. After six months of work the 
employer's contribution would increase and the government's 
would go down, and after a year the employer is responsible for 
the person.
<P>
	Essentially it acted as a catalyst to help small and 
medium-sized business. At the same time, within a five-month 
period we put about 300,000 Canadians back to work in every 
region of this country.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would consider looking at a program 
like that and whether or not he considers that type of reform 
worth while.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure that the hon. member 
who just spoke has voiced his sincere opinion. However, Mr. 
Speaker, I must say that I have heard these kinds of remarks in 
the past and they were no doubt made by very sincere people. I 
am not questioning the sincerity of previous governments. 
Unfortunately, the only concrete action that flowed from such 
remarks were reviews, expensive and time-consuming reviews 
which did not produce the expected results.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	I remain a little sceptical, although I am quite prepared to 
keep hoping. The point I am making is we, the Official 
Opposition, will check daily to make sure that the good 
intentions which have been and will be expressed here today and 
in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="630"> 630 </A></B>
<P>
coming weeks will quickly bring about the results the people 
need. The hon. member is right; creating hundreds of thousands 
of jobs  is important, but how will this be achieved? We do not 
have the revenues we had 10 years ago.
<P>
	The reality is-as I am convinced all the hon. members are 
aware- that when technology is introduced in a business, it 
does not create more jobs; jobs are taken away, replaced by 
technology. To compensate, we have to provide the workers who 
are affected by this technology with high tech training. This is to 
say that the approach used 10 years ago cannot be applied in the 
same way. We will have to find much more creative solutions 
and, above all, find them very quickly. We cannot afford to wait 
two, three or four years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, I simply 
want to tell the hon. member for Portneuf that I greatly 
appreciated his remarks, particularly with regard to the health 
care system.
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague, the hon. member for 
Portneuf, to tell me if it is fair to say that, if the federal 
government cuts its transfers to the provinces for health care, 
the provinces could encounter serious difficulties, which in turn 
could threaten the universality of health care. The danger is that 
we could revert to the way things were in the 1950s, when there 
were two health care systems: one for the rich and one for the 
poor. Illness can strike anybody regardless of their ethnic origin 
or their financial status. Therein lies the danger in reducing 
transfer payments for health care, and I would like to know the 
views of my colleague, the hon. member for Portneuf, on this 
matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for Montmorency-Beauport-Orléans for his 
question. He said: ``What if we lowered transfer payments'', but 
this is no longer hypothetical. It is a fact, unfortunately. This is 
what has been happening for 10 years, and we can see the results. 
We do not have to figure out what is going to happen, we just 
have to observe.
<P>
	In fact, health care is less accessible than it was. Hospitals in 
Quebec, like hospitals in other provinces faced with the same 
problems and resorting to the same expedients, are selling their 
laboratory services -I read that recently, perhaps you did 
too-to the private sector in order to get cash to be able to 
provide services to people.
<P>
	You have to understand that if hospitals have to provide 
services without having the funds to do so, they have to find 
solutions that I would say are creative, although they are, in a 
way, creating a two-tier system of health care, whereby those 
who can afford it get the results of their tests fast, while others 
have to wait for them.
<P>
	This is unfortunate, but it is the visible, clear and immediate 
result of the cuts made over the last 10 years or so. Will things 
change? I dare think they will. Excuse me, Mr. Speaker, how 
much time do I have left? About a minute, two minutes. I just 
want to say one more thing, Mr. Speaker. The money the federal 
government is transferring to each of the provinces is not its own 
money. It is money coming from taxpayers from all provinces.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Here we have money from taxpayer Joseph Latrémouille, or 
Joe Blow in the English provinces, that is going to Ottawa. 
Ottawa gets a certain amount. There is a return trip to the 
province of origin, this is the transfer payment. However, 
Ottawa does not return the full amount, it keeps some to cover 
its administrative costs.
<P>
	Would it not make more economical sense, Mr. Speaker-I 
am not asking you, of course-for the taxpayer to send that 
money directly to his provincial capital, in our case Quebec 
City? Would it not entail substantial savings in administrative 
costs? I believe that to ask the question is to give the answer, and 
the recipe of sovereignty for Quebec might not apply to Quebec 
only. Perhaps some other provinces could feel the same way.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate this opportunity to speak on the government's action 
plan for social security reform.
<P>
	The minister has invited the members on all sides of this 
House to join together in this critically important mission, 
nothing less than the entire rebuilding of the social security, 
labour market and learning framework of our nation.
<P>
	In the recent election the people of Canada asked us for a 
sweeping change. Clearly Canadians want the government to 
act, to provide leadership in getting people back to work. No 
more inattention, indifference or inaction. They want action on 
job creation.
<P>
	As the minister has said, reform of our social programs is the 
most important, most compelling, most sweeping task we face 
today as a nation. The decisions we make in the coming year will 
affect every single person who lives in this country, in this 
century and the next.
<P>
	The government's approach to reforming our social security 
programs is to preserve and foster Canada's well-earned 
reputation as a society in which we help those who need our 
help. This has indeed been our long tradition, going back 
hundreds of years, even before the birth of the nation.
<P>
	Each of us in this House has an opportunity to continue that 
tradition by weighing the proposals put before us from citizens 
of every quarter, considering the merits of all recommendations

and, with due  deliberation, deciding what the best solutions for 
our country are.
<P>
	Each of us, I am sure, know constituents in our own ridings 
who are suffering: children who are poor and going to school 
hungry; young men and women with no jobs and no prospects; 
families trying to support both young children and aging 
parents; single parents seemingly trapped on social assistance; 
workers who have spent half of a lifetime in an industry that is 
now dying; other workers with skills nobody wants any more; 
people in our inner cities oppressed by poverty and despair. 
These are people in our own neighbourhoods, on every avenue, 
crescent, road in our political ridings, whether it is mine in York 
North, or Montreal or Vancouver. These are people who are 
suffering, who are asking the federal government for action. We 
have a responsibility, as we do to all Canadians, to bring back 
hope, to bring back a sense of dignity to the lives of those people 
and their children.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	Altogether there are millions of citizens who are not 
benefiting from our present so-called safety net.
<P>
	It is evident to me that the safety net is full of holes. Restoring 
employment as the key concern of the government requires a 
complete overhaul of our existing programs. We must examine, 
analyse and reform unemployment insurance, training and 
employment programs, social assistance and income security, 
aid to education and learning, labour practices and rules 
affecting the workplace, taxes and premiums that affect job 
creation, management of programs in government and between 
governments, and delivery of services.
<P>
	Our purpose is to renew, revitalize, re-invigorate the 
government's role in advancing the prosperity and security of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	It must foster creative new linkages, eliminate disincentives, 
seek efficiencies, organize by mission, organize by vision rather 
than by bureaucratic mandate. We must, at the end of the day, 
improve spending efficiencies by monitoring the results of those 
programs. That is fundamental to accountability in our system.
<P>
	To those who insist that the objective is simply to cut costs, I 
simply must say to them that they are wrong. The present system 
is not working. People understand that. People understand that 
young people are having problems in the transition period 
between school to work. People on social assistance understand 
that there are disincentives to once again getting back into the 
workplace.
<P>
	Everywhere I go throughout this country people are telling me 
that what they really want is an opportunity for a job. The high 
school dropout wants a vehicle of opportunity so that he can 
return to the workplace, and the older worker whose job has been 
eliminated because of globalization or downsizing, call it what 
you want, wants a vehicle of opportunity too. He does not like to 
sit at home. What he is saying to us is, please, give us  
something; give us something we can hope for. That person who 
is sitting there waiting for this opportunity to knock also has a 
son and a daughter whose prospects are not any better.
<P>
	I think that in this House we must do some soul searching. We 
must look within ourselves and find the inner strength to face 
change, to provide this country with the type of change that 
Canadians called for on October 25.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	We can perhaps fight for the status quo, as the leader of Her 
Majesty's Loyal Opposition stated earlier this morning. But let 
me tell you, that is not the mandate we on this side received. 
People told us they wanted change, they wanted reform. We 
have a responsibility not only to react to what the public wants, 
but also to take a leadership role that has been missing for far too 
many years in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Why change? The evidence is there, for all of us to see: 
chronic long-term unemployment; too high levels of illiteracy; 
one million children living in poverty; an entire generation of 
young men and women without employment. We are still asking 
ourselves, why change?
<P>
	The time to move is now. We have no time to waste. The high 
school dropout who needs a vehicle of opportunity needs it 
today. Tomorrow is too far away.
<P>
	Our nation is fast becoming two Canadas: one comprising the 
secure and well-paid, the other containing those with part-time, 
low-paid, intermittent work. It is the type of polarization that I 
spoke about when I was employment critic of my party and I was 
occupying your seat. I said then and I will repeat today that no 
one has benefited from nine years of Conservative trickle-down 
economics. Nobody has. We have divided a nation on economic 
terms. We have denied people opportunity. The days when 
working hard and playing by the rules meant reward are long 
gone. Well, this government will restore those days, and this 
government will bring back hope to so many Canadians who are 
today hopeless.
<P>
	We are living in very stressful, discouraging, dispirited times. 
This type of feeling is evident with our young people as it is with 
our older people. It is evident in every sector of our society. 
Discussions around kitchen tables are not about getting up in the 
morning and looking forward to tomorrow with confidence. 
They are about whether or not there will be a job waiting for 
them tomorrow. It is about reading about downsizing, about 
trickle-down economics, about young people who have lost 
hope. That has to change. This is the type of dialogue that I hope 
Canadians will engage in.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="632"> 632 </A></B>
<P>
	Whether you sit on this side of the House or that side, we were 
given a mandate to represent people's views. Whether you are a 
member of the Bloc Quebecois, the Reform Party or the 
governing Liberals, there is a constant reminder. As we take our 
seats in this House, we must always remember that when we 
knocked on doors during the election campaign people were 
asking us to restore their faith in the role of government. They 
wanted us to give their children hope for the future and to build 
safer and better communities for everyone.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	The day we forget the reason why we are here will indeed be a 
very sad day for this country.
<P>
	If I may, I would like to return to the minister's comments this 
morning. He set out two goals for our action plan. The first goal 
is to confront the issues that face us. They include long-term 
structural unemployment, even when the economy is growing, 
faulty adjustments for people who have to change jobs, and 
constant changes in technology affecting the labour market and 
training programs. There are people in this House who are not 
aware of the technological revolution that has occurred, even 
though it has redefined time and space.
<P>
	The unacceptably high levels of school drop-outs, illiteracy 
and shortage of skills are things we should all be extremely 
concerned about. We should also be concerned about the 
growing poverty, especially among children, the stress caused 
by competing demands of the family and the workplace. Among 
some corporations there is a persistent determination to cut jobs, 
even though there is growing evidence that this does not achieve 
the expected efficiencies.
<P>
	While it might perhaps look great in the corporate culture to 
say ``I want a lean and mean organization'', I feel that is not the 
function of a cultured business person. To me, a cultured 
business person is one who can absorb technological advances 
while at the same time widening the opportunities for his or her 
workers. It is not simply saying to your workers, ``I have a better 
and more efficient machine, so I don't need you any more''. We 
are talking about people. We are talking about people's lives. We 
are talking about families. We are essentially talking about the 
future of our country.
<P>
	We will be engaging in a number of discussions with other 
governments and we will be looking at ways to end duplication 
and waste that exists. We will also look at the limited capacity of 
governments to provide assistance and security.
<P>
	The second goal of our action plan is to propose options for 
change to meet basic employment insurance and adjustment 
needs, restructure parts of the unemployment insurance 
program and the Canada assistance plan, and to create a new 
form of employment insurance. We want to broaden educational 
and training assistance to recognize the need for life-long 
learning. We want to enhance support and care provisions for  
children, and introduce measures to ensure that individuals with 
disabilities can achieve equality, independence and full 
participation in employment. We want to seek a better balance 
between incentives for job creation and funding social security 
programs.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	We want to ensure basic security for those in need; redefine 
the roles and responsibilities between governments; improve 
efficiency; strengthen the co-operative nature of all levels of 
government; and we want to design new and improved ways of 
delivering our services. The challenge is great, but let us make it 
very clear from the start that it is not merely a challenge for 
members on this side. Essentially today we have begun a process 
of positive change for all Canadians.
<P>
	We hope and trust that members of the opposition will take the 
opportunity to participate, whether through parliamentary 
committees or in their own ridings, seeking input from their own 
constituents to participate in redesigning the social security 
system of this country. Perhaps this will be the most important 
initiative this government will undertake.
<P>
	In a modest way I must say to you that we simply cannot do it 
on our own. We need your input, whether you agree with our 
vision of the country or not. We need to hear what the people are 
saying. Some of you will participate as members of the 
parliamentary committee, but that does not mean that the rest of 
us will not have a role to play.
<P>
	These types of issues should be discussed in every riding, in 
town hall meetings, and in everything one does as a member of 
Parliament. At the end of the day, the legislation that we 
collectively will propose to the Parliament of Canada will 
design the type of Canada that will lead us confidently to the 
21st century.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the speech of the member from the 
other side and I would like to ask a few questions in order to find 
out more about his way of thinking. Is he one of those who 
believe we should cut government spending even further or does 
he think we should strive to find new ways of increasing 
government revenues?
<P>
	I admit that I draw my inspiration largely from the speech my 
colleague, the member for Davenport, made in this House last 
January 20, a speech I find very enlightened. The member for 
Davenport is among those who think we should make every 
effort to increase revenues, since everything has decreased over 
the recent years in this government, revenues and expenditures 
alike.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="633"> 633 </A></B>
<P>
	If we are to restructure and modernize every program 
pertaining to the redistribution of wealth in Canada, I would like 
to ask my colleague if we should not think about taxing lottery 
and games winnings. As the member for Davenport said, this 
would bring in $860 million a year. Should we not tax capital 
gains, a measure which would bring $665 million a year to the 
Treasury, and re-examine grants given to multinationals 
investing overseas, and particularly exemptions for foreign 
currency deposits which would represent a revenue of $500 
million?
<P>
	I for one think we should reconsider very seriously the issue 
of revenues rather than throw around words like modernize and 
restructure that will only lead, in the end, to a widening of the 
gap between the rich and the poor.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his question.
<P>
	I must tell the hon. member that as a member of Parliament I 
have taken a great deal of time to examine the transformation 
that has occurred in our society and indeed in our economy. 
What is fundamental in that examination is the fact that we 
simply cannot look at issues the way we did before. If I can use 
these words, given some of the words being used by the Premier 
of Ontario, we have to look at a new contract, a new set of 
arrangements between the individual, the community and 
government. In that sense what is fundamental for the success of 
this new contract is full co-operation between the various 
stakeholders in our community.
<P>
	There are programs today in Canada that date back to the 
1940s. They have been tinkered with, but essentially they have 
never gone through the type of review that is necessary to 
upgrade and to make them relevant to the present situation. In 
this social security review that is taking place today and that is 
being started this morning by the minister, we have to rethink 
the way we provide services. We have to rethink the purpose for 
unemployment insurance. We must modernize what individual 
Canadians have grown accustomed to.
<P>
	Fundamentally, this change is necessary simply because of 
the fact that we cannot tell the single mother who is compelled, 
with her children, to stand in front of the local food bank for her 
daily meal that this is the way our country is going to deal with 
her reality. Nor is it fair to tell the high school dropout who is 
hoping for a better tomorrow that he will be in long-term, 
chronic unemployment because the measures that we as a 
government and as a people are taking are not effective.
<P>
	There is a moral obligation on the part of all members of 
Parliament on both sides of this House to engage in the type of 
dialogue that the Minister of Human Resources Development 
initiated today so that our programs, the delivery of our 
services, are efficient, modern and updated to the reality of the 
global village in which we live today.
<P>
	I hope that in summary answers the hon. member's question. I 
am certain, given his dedication to representing his constituents, 
that he will participate fully in this very comprehensive review 
of our social security system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the speech of the parliamentary secretary 
and to speeches from both sides of the House earlier in the day. It 
seems to me that recently there has been a good deal of criticism 
of Confederation from the other side of the House, addressing 
some of its so-called weaknesses. We tend to forget that 
Confederation is a very powerful and successful type of 
government. One of its strengths is that in times of economic 
difficulty one part of the country that is prospering can help the 
parts of the country that are not.
<P>
	In the reforms that we are envisaging, in the training and 
retraining systems and in the social systems, I hope 
consideration is being given to the flow of young people across 
the country. At the present time only 14 per cent of the 
apprentices in Ontario obtain licences which allow them to work 
outside the province. This is a tragedy.
<P>
	I hope the parliamentary secretary and his colleagues will 
work to allow the flow of skilled and unskilled young people 
across the country to become more effective.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> If the hon. member would like to say yes or no, 
I think we are in good shape.

<P>

<P>
	One of the outcomes will be the possible replacement of air 
traffic control operators at a number of airports with flight 
service stations. My concern is that Charlottetown is one airport 
so targeted. Any reduction in essential services at airports is 
often perceived as a safety factor. The government must 
demonstrate that cost reduction will not impact upon safety.
<P>
	I am therefore calling upon the Minister of Transport to 
ensure that before any action is taken as a result of this review 
all stakeholders on the island will be consulted. After all, we 
should not be following the agenda of the previous government

<P>
	For example, Canada's tobacco tax levels represent 70 per 
cent of the selling price as do every other industrialized country 
in the world except the United States. Why does the U.S. not 
increase its tax?
<P>
	They suggest a reinstatement of the export tax. In the few 
weeks it was in effect in 1992 the flow of smuggled tobacco 
dropped from a record level of 737 million to 146 million 
cigarettes.
<P>
	They suggest licensing tobacco retailers and increased 
enforcement. It has taken 50 years to lower the number of 
persons smoking and thereby decrease health hazards.
<P>
	One of our roles as a government is to protect the health of

express my thanks to the voters of Surrey North who chose me as 
their representative in the House. I also congratulate the many 
new MPs whose presence here reflects the desire of the 
Canadian people for a real and lasting change.
<P>
	This Parliament is going to face many new challenges. As a 
member of the nursing profession the challenge I am most 
familiar with is that of health care in Canada. Therefore I 
welcomed the government's announcement in the throne speech 
of a national forum on health.
<P>
	I believe a frank and open dialogue is necessary to ensure the 
survival of our health care system, and I look forward to 
participating in this dialogue. Debates on health care are never 
easy. I hope when we approach the enormous task of examining 
Canada's health care system that members will do so with an 
open mind.

	It has become very obvious to me and to these constituents

restructure Canada's system of social security between now and

<P>
	It is an ambitious plan. While I commend the minister on his

Canadians will be holding the minister to his promise to renew 
and revitalize rather than slash and trash Canada's social safety 
net.
<P>
	New Democrats, particularly those from my home province of 
Saskatchewan, have an interest in this review as they were 
instrumental in developing Canada's social programs in the first 
place.

for Nanaimo-Cowichan directed a question to the Prime 
Minister relating to the salary of House officers. Although I 
allowed the Prime Minister to respond, I reminded the House 
that such a question ought to be more properly addressed to the 
representative of the Board of Internal Economy. I also stated 
that I would seek advice and return to the House as soon as 
possible.
<P>
	I want to take this occasion to clarify the procedure. All 
questions relating to the internal and financial management of

of the Board of Internal Economy, the membership of which was 
tabled in the House on Wednesday, January 19, 1994.
<P>
	Such matters do not fall within the administrative 
responsibility of the government. That is why responses to these 
questions cannot be expected from the ministry.

offer information about the Board of Internal Economy. They 
are the chief government whip and the whip of the Official

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXATION">TAXATION</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	A Bank of Canada study released today under the Access to 
Information Act has suggested to the government a number of 
measures that would increase income tax for families, students 
and, especially, for the elderly. By substantially reducing the 
current tax exemption for senior citizens, the Bank of Canada 
proposes saving a total of $1.8 billion at the expense of the 
elderly.
<P>
	Does the minister intend to follow up on these 
recommendations, which would have the effect of raising 
income tax for thousands of senior citizens? In other words, is 
he prepared today to give certain assurances to these senior 
citizens who are concerned, and rightly so, about these 
recommendations, revealed just a few weeks before the budget 
speech?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
(Quebec)): </B>Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member is aware, the report 
of the Bank of Canada was published on October 26, the day 
after the happy occasion of the federal election.
<P>
	I can inform him that this was prepared under the aegis of the 
former government. We will read it. We will look at it. However, 
I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that we have no 
intention of doing anything at the expense of the senior citizens 
and the poor in this country.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the Minister of Finance for his answer, 
which was specific enough to be somewhat reassuring for senior 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="638"> 638 </A></B>
<P>
citizens. I am not so sure that the occasion was as happy as he 
seems to think. The budget speech will tell whether the occasion 
was a happy one.
<P>
	However, since this report exists, is now available to the 
public and will be widely examined, it may prove very tempting 
for people who want to tamper with what so far has been 
inviolable, and I am referring to old age pensions. Could the 
Minister of Finance tell us whether he personally, as the 
Minister of Finance, would agree to start taxing old age pensions 
when an individual's annual income exceeds $30,000, in order 
to save 700 to 800 million dollars at the expense of the elderly?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
(Quebec)): </B>Mr. Speaker, our position has been very clear. 
Whether we are talking about different ways to close the 
loopholes in our tax system or about subsidies to corporations or 
individuals, the watch word is fairness. And that will be the 
purpose of this budget.
<P>
	If the Bank of Canada's report contains some interesting 
points, we will certainly look at them. However, I believe I 
already answered the question last week when I referred to the 
Reform Party's program. I said that I felt their option, which is 
to cut subsidies and cut government spending on the elderly, was 
entirely unacceptable to us.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, continuing in the same vein, one has the impression 
this report was drafted by a member of the Reform Party, 
because one of the recommendations suggests abolishing the 
basic exemption of $3,482 for the elderly and to tax the first 
$1,000 of senior citizens' income.
<P>
	Would the minister agree that publishing such information on 
the moral authority of the Bank of Canada is bound to upset 
people and is liable to create a political movement that might 
compromise old age security, causing it to be taxed mercilessly 
and unfairly, a measure that would be most harmful?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
(Quebec)): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am not sure whether I fully 
understood the gist of the question put by the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition. He seemed to be saying that the Bank of Canada 
should not release this information and should not try to express 
its views.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	I think the Bank of Canada has the right to prepare these 
studies, and when it does, they should be published. However, as 
my hon. friend knows full well, we did not always agree with the 
Bank of Canada when we were in the Opposition, and I believe 
this study was prepared at that time.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The Minister just created uncertainty for millions of 
Quebecers and Canadians by putting into question the future of 
our income security system.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Human Resources Development not using 
consultation to lead people into accepting cuts in social 
programs, exactly as his colleague the Minister of Finance did?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very unfortunate that the 
hon. member makes hasty pre-judgments before there is any 
opportunity to hear from Canadians. The whole reason for 
having a Parliament is to listen to what Canadians have to say.
<P>
	We have been listening to Canadians and they have said that 
they do want changes because the present system is not working. 
It is too bad the Bloc Quebecois is taking such a reactionary 
position. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition is still reflecting 
his position as it used to exist in the previous government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, despite his 
generous observations, is the Minister not of the opinion that his 
government is putting the cart before the horse by putting into 
question the social security net-despite all the good intentions 
he expressed towards Quebec and Canada-before doing 
anything to put an end to federal waste of money and, in 
particular, before proposing a job creation strategy?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said this morning, if we are 
going to get Canadians in all provinces and all regions back to 
work, we must do it systematically. We must do it through 
stimulation of the economy, by creating work through 
infrastructure and by encouraging small business. We must do it 
by looking at our employment, training and income security 
programs.
<P>
	This government has a global, comprehensive look. If the 
hon. member simply looks through a very narrow pipe and is not 
able to see the broad picture then it is no wonder the Bloc is not 
able to understand what a good place Canada is.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. It concerns his proposal to redesign Canada's 
social safety net.
<P>
	The fact that we have a caucus of 52 members speaks well to 
the point that we too are listening to Canadians. They have been 
saying that when their businesses or their families establish 
budgets they always ask how much money is available and then 
they ask how best they can use it. It is only governments that 
decide what they want and then try to find the money to pay for 
it.
<P>
	Will the minister break with his backward budgetary approach 
and ask the Minister of Finance for a pre-established, overall 
budget limit for social spending?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
</B><B>Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I listen to the questions 
arising in the House, first we hear from the Bloc Quebecois who 
make no change and then from the Reform Party who say there is 
no safety net.
<P>
	Only the Liberals really understand that what we really need 
is to create a system in which people want to get back to work 
and we will help them do that.
<P>
	I say to my hon. friend that in the discussions we have held so 
far with our provincial colleagues, business, labour and others 
they all recognized that until we redesign a system that really 
targets the need to get people back to work, to get employment, 
jobs and growth we will never be able to solve Canada's deficit 
problems.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, certainly no one understands the concern of Canadians 
about their social safety net any more than Reformers who are so 
closely in touch with them.
<P>
	During the minister's speech this morning he did not properly 
recognize the acute financial reality that Canada faces today. 
How realistic and sustainable can a long term plan be if it does 
not take into account the severe financial constraints Canada 
faces today?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we have said many times, we 
are certainly aware of the real financial pressures for all kinds of 
programs and for all kinds of initiatives.
<P>
	As I said in answer to an earlier question, we believe that by 
taking a systematic approach, by taking a look at the various 
ways government can collaborate with the provinces, with the 
private sector and with interest groups can we redesign our 
social security programs to make them more efficient but more 
particularly to give the kinds of opportunities, options and 
choices for people to re-enter the labour market.
<P>
	However, the core of solving our problems is not simply to 
slash and trash programs. It is to revitalize and renew them and 
put Canadians back into the workplace.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, certainly we concur that we want to see Canadians 
going back to work. I have a further supplementary question for 
the minister who informed the House this morning that he will 
announce soon the names of those chosen to sit on his task force.
<P>
	Could the minister tell the House how those people were 
chosen and whether there are any members who will bring a 
strong sense of fiscal responsibility to the table?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, all members of the task force 
will have a strong sense of fiscal responsibility and a strong 
sense of social responsibility.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health. The government is 
currently engaging in a vast consultation exercise. Your 
colleague, the Minister of Human Resources Development, is 
holding consultations to restructure social programs. On the 
other hand, the Prime Minister gave you a mandate to hold a 
national forum on health to identify priorities in this area.
<P>
	Does the Minister not think that is a lot of consultation? How 
is she going to harmonize her own reform program with that 
undertaken by the Minister of Human Resources Development?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
the last five years we spent here, Canadians across the country 
told us: You do not listen to us enough. And we told them, now 
that we are in office, we will work in co-operation with all 
Canadians and all levels of government. The national forum on 
health will do exactly that. We will try to bring all levels 
together so that everyone can benefit from positive initiatives 
taken across the country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government is intensifying its consultation efforts on manpower 
training, education and health. Does it mean that, as far as health 
care is concerned, the government is using this forum to 
centralize services and encroach on areas of provincial 
jurisdiction?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the Minister of Health for Canada I am very well aware of the 
responsibilities the provincial governments have in health 
matters.
<P>
	Overall however we do remain responsible. We set the 
framework by which governments administer the health care 
system in this country. I think it is one of Canada's best assets. I 
believe 
<P>

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Finance. At the final pre-budget conference 
in Calgary this past Saturday the finance minister said: ``The 
government cannot be expected to heed all advice''.
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	Has the finance minister come to this conclusion because he 
does not like what he has heard, that deficit and debt is the major 
problem and not revenues?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, at these conferences, as would be 
expected, there were very different points of view, primarily 
because the institutes invited people not simply representing 
one very narrow point of view but all points of view. Obviously 
there were differences of opinion expressed on the panels and 
within the workshops. Therefore it would be impossible for 
anyone to square the circle and to simply do what everybody 
said.
<P>
	What we did say very clearly was that we were listening, that 
we understood the common message, the common theme which 
is the desire to turn this economy around and give jobs back to 
the people. We said unequivocally that if we were not prepared 
to follow the suggestions made in any individual instance, we 
would indicate why that was the case because we take these 
consultations very, very seriously.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, having spent 
$800,000 on these conferences, is the finance minister now 
going to waste this money and go against those constructive 
alternatives offered and proceed by increasing the tax haul?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, with reference to the $800,000 let me 
say that the constitutional conferences put on by the previous 
government cost $7.5 million.
<P>
	These conferences were put on by these institutes. Let me tell 
you the food we got was very good but it was not very expensive. 
Perhaps that is why the hon. member was not there.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Perhaps the hon. minister has given us all food 
for thought.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Mr. Speaker, what really 
came out of these conferences was that Canadians with different 
perspectives sat down at the table. They were forced to make the 
kinds of trade-offs and have the kinds of discussions that 
governments and finance ministers have to go through.
<P>
	The problem with private consultation, the kind that was done 
before, is that individuals come in and give a single perspective 
and then walk away, claiming they have made their point. 
However, they have never had to test it in debate with people 
from the other side. That was the great advantage which came 
out of this.
<P>
	Tomorrow all members of this House are going to have the 
opportunity to present their views on this debate. I hope that the 
members will do what Canadians did and what they very clearly 
did in Calgary. I hope that they will simply not tell us to spend 
more in their area or to cut into somebody else's, but that they 
will make the trade-offs. If members of this House do what 
Canadians across the country did, then I will feel very good 
about the process tomorrow and very good about the budget we 
are going to present.

that negotiations had been held with Chief Jerry Peltier with 
regard to the events in Kanesatake. After the minister changed 
his own version of the facts, Chief Jerry Peltier changed his 
accordingly, because he himself had confirmed to me that shots

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and concerns his speech this morning.
<P>
	In his speech, he received much applause from his caucus 
colleagues when he stated that his planned ``redesign'' of social 
policy is not a code word for ``cutting costs''.
<P>
	Given that social programs take up the bulk of total program 
spending, how does the minister expect his government to 
reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of national income promised in 
the red book without cutting the costs of social spending?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should look at 
the entire speech. We set out a series of very specific objectives 
and goals that we wanted to achieve.
<P>
	One is to achieve more effectiveness, more efficiency in the 
delivery of programs, to end duplication, to overcome a lot of 
overlap and to find better ways of delivering dollars to those 
who need them. Those are clear ways in which money can be 
saved but that is not the only objective.
<P>
	The real objective and the real saving comes when we can get 
the three million Canadians who last year had to depend on some 
form of unemployment insurance or social security to find a 
good job, to have some hope and to have good training.
<P>
	The real saving to Canada is when it makes full use of its 
human resources. That is when we will really have a saving. 
There is a bigger human deficit than a fiscal deficit in Canada 
today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am somewhat confused now by the minister's reply.
<P>
	It was excellent rhetoric but did the hon. minister retract his 
earlier statement that there will be no cutting of costs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to say to the hon. 
member that there is no contradiction. What we are saying very 
clearly is that if one takes a broad approach to these programs 
one can achieve a saving in the way we deliver them. One can 
achieve a saving by getting people back to work.
<P>
	However, to do that one must invest in the people themselves. 
I would suggest that rather than simply cherry picking one point 
or other of the speech, I recommend that he read the entire 
speech. I am sure that he will find it really quite thrilling.

	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the House Leader of the Government.
<P>
	During the election campaign, Liberal candidates, invoking 
the red book, proposed various measures which they said were 
an action plan to create jobs and stimulate the economy. Now the 
third week of the session has begun without any legislative 
indication of the measures promised for this action plan.
<P>
	My question is this: Since we are in the third week of the 
session, why has the government not yet proposed a single 
significant piece of legislation to give effect to the job creation 
provisions of the red book?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my hon. friend forgets that even before the House opened we 
announced a massive national program of infrastructure to 
create tens of thousands of jobs across Canada.
<P>
	I expect if my hon. friend keeps in touch with the situation he 
will see other measures put on the Order Paper before too long to 
carry out our commitment to get the economy going and create a 
lot more jobs for Canadians.

over the ensuing session the commitments of the Liberal

	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
while 59,000 of the 250,000 immigrants entering Canada settled 
in Ontario, Ontario received only 39 per cent of the federal 
immigration funding for settlement and language training.
<P>
	Provincial cuts to school boards is forcing them to cut 
programs including second language training programs, leaving 
immigrant children without proper education.
<P>
	Can the minister of immigration tell the House how he intends 
to deal with this very serious inequity in our system?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for her question. We have made promises to work 
together with local and provincial governments and I am pleased 
to say this again is another promise we are keeping.
<P>
	The minister responsible for immigration met this morning 
with the Ontario Minister of Citizenship and the Minister of 
Community and Social Services to discuss this issue. We are 
committed to enhanced co-operation and co-ordination 
between the two levels of government. We have to work together 
to use scarce resources more effectively.
<P>
	We understand and share Ontario's concerns about settlement 
and immigration. We are certainly prepared to listen. This 
government has already introduced regulatory changes that will 
allow refugee claimants to work while awaiting the outcome of 
their claim, thus reducing the burden on social assistance.
<P>
	The minister of immigration intends to review other 
provisions in co-operation with the provinces with a view to 
maximizing the benefits of immigration to our country while 
minimizing its costs.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The Liberal Red Book promised to balance increased 
spending for new programs with cuts to existing programs. To 
date, however, spending cuts through the elimination of the 
helicopter contract are much less than the announced spending 
increases in the following programs: $2 billion for the 
infrastructure program; $100 million for a residential 
rehabilitation assistance program; $100 million for the 
Canadian youth services corps; $5 million over four years 
toward the national literacy program and $900 million in 
equalization payments. These programs represent a spending 
increase of more than $3 billion yet the proposed cuts are far less 
than $2 billion.
<P>
	Would the minister tell this House where this extra money 
will come from?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Increase taxes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> You should read the Red Book.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite lists the 
items in the Red Book with the same degree of pride that we on 
this side of the House and all Canadians do.
<P>
	Suffice it to say that the statement we made, that the items 
listed will be paid for through reallocation of existing spending 
will be met and the member opposite will see that in my budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
supplementary question.
<P>
	Will the finance minister issue a guarantee to the millions of 
Canadian taxpayers who are concerned about their future RRSP 
investments that their contribution ceiling will not be lowered to 
pay for these programs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a somewhat generous definition 
of a supplementary question.
<P>
	As I have said many times before in this House, we are 
engaged in an unprecedented degree of consultation. We are 
really going to have a very unique day in the House tomorrow 
when members of Parliament for probably the first time will

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Finance. Following his 
pre-budgetary consultations across Canada and after talking 
about broadening the tax base, the Minister of Finance 
identified certain measures that the government could take to 
increase its revenues. These included lowering the ceiling on 
RRSP contributions, eliminating the $100,000 capital gains 
exemption, reducing the scope of old age pensions, taxing health 
care and dental care premiums paid by employers, in short, 
initiatives that affect the middle class which has been reeling 
since 1984 under the Canadian tax system.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us clearly and frankly if he intends to 
follow through on all of these initiatives?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will repeat what I said 
earlier. I am eagerly looking forward to tomorrow's debate and I 
really want to hear what members have to say. Of course, I am 
also anxious to hear the response of the Bloc Quebecois finance 
critic. I do not intend to choose from among the suggestions put 
forward. Rather, I will wait for the debate. In due time, the 
member will see what is in the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have a supplementary question. Why has the minister not 
hinted publicly, as he has done with respect to all of the previous 
measures, at the elimination of the preferential tax treatment 
afforded large corporations and especially at the elimination of 
family trusts which, according to a weekend report by Claude 
Picher in <I>La Presse</I>, deprive the treasury of roughly $350 
million? Is the minister afraid to target the friends of the 
government?

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Last Monday the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood 
rose in the House to express his concern about Canadians being 
fed up with consultation and I presume that meant through 
consultants.
<P>
	The government is currently paying a consultant to conduct a 
study into such issues as perks and pensions for senators and 
MPs both past and present.
<P>
	Why did the Deputy Prime Minister, as reported in the 
Montreal <I>Gazette</I>, recommend that all MPs take part in yet 
another study at taxpayers' expense, especially in light of the 
fact that the government has already announced its position on 
perks and pensions.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the article in the Montreal 
<I>Gazette</I> was false. There were never any letters signed by me 
sent out to any members.
<P>
	There is, however, a process being put in place through the 
President of the Treasury Board where in advance of a bill that is 
going to be tabled specifically dealing with members' pensions 
and the so-called perks of members of Parliament we are asking 
for the input of all members.
<P>
	That survey actually went out under the signature of the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board. 
He is asking for input from all members of Parliament so that we 
can take into consideration the concerns expressed every day in 
the House by members of Parliament and others.
<P>
	Again it is a necessary part of getting our act together to make 
sure that we are being responsible to the Canadian taxpayers 
who pay our salaries.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question concerns the $200,000 survey which 
was originally supposed to be $150,000. It was prompted by the 
comment of the Minister of Finance who mentioned a narrow 
point of view earlier. Could the Deputy Prime Minister explain 
to the House how asking senators and MPs, both past and 
present, what they think of their own compensation is any 
different from asking the fox to guard the hen house?

the hon. member about hearing the views of Canadians on this 
issue. That is why the Government of Canada has asked 
members of Parliament, who presumably represent the views of 
their constituents, if I understand the assessment of the Reform 
Party properly, to express their views. We are asking all 
members of Parliament to express their views.
<P>
	Unfortunately every constituent cannot express his or her 
views by way of a questionnaire. But if any member of 
Parliament would like to copy that questionnaire and send it off 
to their constituents, please do so. We are looking for input. We 
do not think the Government of Canada should be criticized for 
looking for input on an issue which obviously every Canadian is 
very concerned about.

	<B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the minister responsible for western economic development.
<P>
	During the election campaign the Liberals made a 
commitment to assist small business, to increase availability of 
venture capital, and to promote regional co-operation between 
provinces and industry.
<P>
	Given western Canada's trade profile, notably continued 
heavy reliance on natural resources and our leadership role in 
the Asian Pacific markets, what initiatives has the minister 
undertaken to fulfil the government's promises to assist small 
business in western Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, in answer to the hon. member's 
question, it is very useful to set out the initiatives already taken. 
We have shifted the funding formula to targets, specifically 
small business in western Canada, and have used a part of the 
portfolio to begin working directly with industry based groups 
so that we can help them develop export markets.
<P>
	To give one example, on Friday I met with all the provincial 
ministers of western economic development where we discussed 
how we can work together and collaborate on joint programs. 
We announced at that time a joint program to aid the agri-food 
processing industry of western Canada to develop its export 
markets in the United States.
<P>

with a province, getting good value for our money and creating 
jobs for westerners.

office closings and not one post office across this country has 
been closed since.

within a matter of weeks to come back to the House and share an

	Could the minister please tell the House what action his 
government is taking to ensure that the current strike and 
lock-out in B.C. will not continue to adversely affect prairie 
grain farmers who already face an uncertain future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, because the matter of the labour 
strike comes under my responsibilities I would be more than 
happy, if less adequate than my colleague, the Minister of 
Agriculture, to answer the member's question.
<P>
	What is happening right now is the basis of a long and drawn 
out negotiation that we have been watching. We have provided 
conciliation officers in the past. The parties as they reported this 
weekend are not that far apart and could settle their differences 
very quickly if they went back to the table.
<P>
	While we recognize the gravity of the situation, there is a 
collective bargaining process we believe is important to honour. 
However, the government will stand by and monitor carefully. If 
the parties want mediation services we will be more than happy 
to provide them. We really believe that in this case labour and 
management can come to an agreement through honest 
collective bargaining.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
remind the hon. minister this is the type of rhetoric that we, as 
grain farmers, heard all through the seventies and the eighties.
<P>
	I would like to know from the minister, if alternated shipping 
points are not sufficient to move Canadian grain, would he 
seriously consider declaring grain handling an essential service 
and force a binding arbitration and dispute settling mechanism?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find that question exceedingly 
strange from a spokesperson for a party which claims its great 
fealty and belief in the private sector system is so opposed to 
collective bargaining which is a free decision between business 
and labour to arrive at a proper settlement. That party should get 
its act straight and its position straight before it starts asking 
these kinds of questions.
<P>
	What we are saying is that we are looking at the situation very 
carefully. The federal government is very concerned. However 
we do believe, because the parties are so close to negotiation, 
that if they do bargain in good faith there could be an agreement 
and the grain could flow.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
the motion before us to set up a committee to examine the social 
security programs for this country, first of all I would like to 
commend the prospect that has been raised by this government 
through the Minister of Human Resources Development of a 
broad consultation on this issue which is very much close to the 
hearts and important to all Canadians.
<P>
	I would also like to commend the prospect of considering 
Canadians' concerns and priorities. This is appropriate because 
Canadians pay the shot for these programs. It is also their lives 
and their futures which are being affected by any changes that 
might be made.
<P>
	I would also like to commend the timetable that moves ahead 
briskly dealing with this issue of changes to social programs. It 
also shows real promise of input and responsibility for this 
initiative being given not to government bureaucracies and 
departments but with the elected representatives of the people 
where it belongs.
<P>
	There are a couple of improvements I would like to 
recommend to the proposed mandate of the committee. First of 
all I believe we should define the terms in the mandate, 
particularly the terms modernization and restructuring. It seems 
to me that these words can be taken in quite a number of ways, 
depending on a person's philosophy or particular perspective on 
these issues. I believe that the government ought to define for 
the committee what exactly is meant by modernization of our 
social security programs and what is meant by restructuring.
<P>
	Also I noted that the mandate made particular reference to the 
needs of families with children, youth and working age adults, 
but it omits seniors and Canadians in their retirement years. This 
is a very large and constantly growing segment of our society. I 
believe that the omission of this segment of society from the 
mandate of the committee is not wise.
<P>

<P>
	It is still to be demonstrated also whether this broad 
consultation and the effort by members of this House through 
the committee will have any real meaningful or substantial 
impact on the final direction of the government.
<P>
	Will it be like the public consultations on the Constitution 
which were held in 1992 which ignored the clearly expressed 
majority view of Canadians across the country? Will it be like 
the current pre-budget consultations where it appears to some 
Canadians at least that this government magnifies a few 
minority view comments into proof of support for a direction the 
government intends to go anyway while dismissing clear 
majority consensus?
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	If the current broad consultation and open debate turn out to 
be so much more empty window dressing, paid for once again by 
hard earned tax dollars and taking away time that could be spent 
actually achieving something, it will merely add to the cynicism 
and contempt Canadians already feel for government and the 
political process. I urge the minister and the government not to 
let that happen.
<P>
	I commend the government for raising the hope of a more 
genuinely democratic process. I urge it to ensure that there is 
change, not just in the form but also in the substance of what is 
actually allowed to be achieved through the process.
<P>
	This morning the minister set out his underlying philosophy 
on what we are trying to achieve by giving the mandate to the 
committee to change our social security systems. He said that 
jobs were the issue. He then went on to list existing systems that 
must be overhauled in order to ``restore employment as a central 
focus of government policy''.
<P>
	I suggest one thing the committee also ought to do is examine 
the assumption that the purpose of the social security system is 
now to focus toward employment. Going one step further, it 
should even examine the assumption that we should look to 
government to guarantee that all Canadians have jobs.
<P>
	Government assistance to ensure that Canada has trained 
workers and to provide for labour force training and adjustment 
would probably be supported by most Canadians. However that 
is something far different from rejigging the whole social 
security system toward job creation.
<P>
	First, substantial numbers of Canadians think there would be 
a lot more jobs if government would just stop spending our 
money, mortgaging our future and creating a bureaucratic 
solution for every perceived need and demand. This viewpoint is 
large enough so that it ought to be represented and considered.
<P>
	Second, many Canadians view our social security system as a 
way for us collectively to care for the old, the young, the sick 
and the poor among us. It is going to be quite a shock and 
surprise to discover that the focus of social security may be 
shifted to something quite different.
<P>
	Canadians can see that our social programs are being eroded 
and that changes must be made if we want to be able to count on 
having a social safety net even a few years from now. To shift the 
focus from making programs sustainable and available to the 
truly needy, to using them primarily as a means to attempt to 
create jobs, has far reaching implications that require a clear 
public mandate, not just an assumed one. For these reasons, the 
new philosophy being now introduced by the government ought 
in my view to be examined by the committee, especially whether 
it carries the judgment of Canadians.
<P>
	I hope these comments will be of help in providing the best 
possible mandate to the committee on behalf of the country and 
its work on behalf of all Canadians.

<P>
	<B>M. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to follow up on the speech by the member 
for Calgary-North with a comment. Ultimately, I do not agree 
with her idea that the timetable planned by the minister is 
relevant.
<P>
	It seems to me that there is a sense of urgency in that whole 
issue of job creation and, also, in the insecurity that the people 
are feeling towards those changes. We need to get clearer and 
more rapid explanations instead of talking of years of reform, 
because, in the end, governments are elected to govern and not 
to conduct studies.
<P>
	On that, I would like to give a certain number-
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order, please. I wish to 
remind the hon. member that comments are to be made on the 
last speech and not on speeches made by ministers earlier.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I was just saying that I disagree 
with the hon. member who spoke last, because she said she 
supported the position taken by the minister about the timetable. 
I was saying that I do not approve of her supporting that stance.
<P>
	What I might also add, since I feel it is important, is that the 
social program initiatives which will be taken should include a 
regional view of the workings of these programs. I have 
experienced first hand the effects of overlapping in the area of 
manpower-and this is particularly true in the regions where we 
have witnessed a proliferation of organisations like Community 
Futures Committees, Business Development Centres and other 
provincial and even municipal organisations-and I do believe 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="648"> 648 </A></B>
<P>
that we should consider that manpower comes under the 
provincial jurisdiction, at least in Quebec. The  same with social 
services, because it is important to recognize what the 
government of Quebec has done in this area.
<P>
	I realized during the election campaign that it was more than a 
simple question of money, it was a question of being treated like 
human beings rather than social insurance numbers. In that 
sense, it will be important in this debate to go beyond the simple 
economics and into respect for people concerned.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments 
of my hon. colleague. As far as the timetable is concerned the 
preliminary report of the committee is to be brought down in 
eight weeks. I think that is lightning speed, for Parliament 
particularly. The final report is to be brought down just after the 
House resumes sitting in September.
<P>
	That is not really a lot of working weeks particularly, as the 
hon. member points out, in that we must have a good overall 
vision. Co-ordinating that good overall vision, bringing some 
consensus and examining the issues carefully, particularly when 
a very new direction is being sought, seem to me in the weeks 
allotted to be very reasonable and quite a brisk pace.
<P>
	I would stand by my assessment of the timetable, but I agree 
with my hon. colleague that we need to ensure we have the 
overall vision when we come forward with a very important 
restructuring program.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau-La Lièvre):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the hon. member. She mentioned what the 
government is spending. It is all true, but you have to remember 
that one of the big problems, one of the serious deficiencies of 
the system, is that the deficit does not really come from 
overspending by the government, since revenue is greater than 
commitments, if we set the deficit aside for a moment.The 
problem is that those who are very well off do not pay their fair 
share. I would like her party, the Reform Party, to recognize the 
fact that one of our biggest problems is that wealthy people and 
multinational companies do not pay their share. Social problems 
have no impact on the deficit.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Madam Speaker, I very strongly subscribe to 
the philosophy that we cannot strengthen the weak by 
weakening the strong.
<P>
	There are people in the country who have worked extremely 
hard and long to build security, assets and a life for themselves. 
If they are now to be penalized by taking away their ability to 
bring economic activity and jobs to the country and by saying 
that somehow what they have done is unfair to others, the 
government will be in very big trouble and will that cause a lot 
more problems than we anticipate.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> 
Madam Speaker, today I am going to direct my comments to the 
matter of Canada's cultural identity from the perspective of my 
constituents in Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt and all 
Canadians who are looking for fiscal responsibility.
<P>
	The arts is an area in which my family has been involved. For 
many years my mother operated an academy of dance in Alberta. 
My sister is still involved in that industry. My brother has been 
an actor on stage and in film in Canada and is now a producer in 
the Toronto area. My own background in commercial radio and 
the cable television industry has given me the perspective I 
would like to share with hon. members of the House.
<P>
	I congratulate the government for talking about our cultural 
heritage in the throne speech, although the two sentences were 
very vague and lacking any detail. It certainly left me feeling as 
though the government may feel it appropriate to spend more tax 
dollars in this area. This would not be something to which I or 
the average Canadian who realizes the fiscal dilemma we face 
would agree.
<P>
	First we must ask: What exactly do we mean by Canadian 
culture? I submit that where we live in Canada, our ethnic 
background and even the size of our bank account would have an 
impact on the answer. As Canadians we embrace individuality 
and freedom, caring and concern for other people. We embrace 
healthy competition as shown in the love of our sports. We 
appreciate our country's abundant natural beauty and as a people 
we have generously supported the arts. Therefore I ask again: 
What is Canadian culture?
<P>
	The answer is that culture is what Canadians consume, what 
we as a people in a free society choose on our own to read, watch 
and listen to. These things are consumed. Whether art, 
literature, music or theatre, they will not and should not survive 
if they do not appeal to the Canadian consumer. No matter how 
much money is given in the form of government subsidies, it 
will not encourage the consumer to enjoy the product any more.
<P>
	Our culture is as varied as the immense geography of our land. 
It defies attempts to reduce it to a common denominator. The 
things that are important in Port aux Basques, Newfoundland, 
are not necessarily the same things that are important to us in 
Summerland, British Columbia. Prairie communities have their 
own cultural values. The people of Quebec and the people of the 
First Nations have their own vibrant cultures and traditions, as 
do members of every ethnic community in our country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="649"> 649 </A></B>
<P>
	Canada's culture is not about some standard imposed on us by 
the culture bureaucrats. Too often in recent times someone 
else's idea of what is Canadian culture has been shoved down the 
throats of Canadians.
<P>
	It is in vogue in certain cultural circles to disdain producing 
art for public consumption. They call it commercialization. All 
art, however, is commercialized and destined for consumption. 
Giving government subsidies to artists without equal 
consideration to marketing and distribution of the product is 
giving money away to talented people to show their works to 
their closest friends. If Shakespeare were alive today his name 
would probably be Steven Spielberg.
<P>
	Canadians can be proud of the great achievements of many 
members of our arts community. These achievements stand out 
in the global community, not just on some national stage. The 
achievements of Alex Colville, or for that matter of Bryan 
Adams, stand out in a global context.
<P>
	These are achievements of individuals, not of national 
cultural institutions or organizations. These individuals would 
stand out in any culture, in any society. What made them great 
was the fact that what they produce is what many people want to 
see and hear, and will pay for.
<P>
	The Canadian taxpayer has generously funded the arts 
community for many years now. We have created institutions 
and a cultural bureaucracy that have a seemingly insatiable 
appetite for funding. In today's climate of mounting debts and 
out of control spending, we can no longer continue this. Every 
expenditure must meet the test of necessity. We have to set 
priorities.
<P>
	In this context we have the sacred cows of the cultural 
bureaucracy, and expensive cows they are too. We have the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In 1992 it gobbled up a 
subsidy of $1 billion and still turned a loss of $108 million. One 
of the mayors in my constituency after losing a battle for 
funding to clean up a lake pointed out that the CBC received 
more money than all the federal funding for environmental 
programs. This is just one crown corporation.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	We must priorize our spending.
<P>
	Then we have the Canada Council. This institution spent some 
$108 million last year. Over $23 million went to administration. 
The projects supported by the council have also been the focus 
of much discussion as to their actual worth. The National 
Citizens Coalition of Canada says: ``Actors, writers and poets 
all receive huge amounts of tax dollars to produce works that in 
most cases few want to read or hear''. Unfortunately hon. 
members in this place will never know the effectiveness of the 
council because it does not have to account to Parliament.
<P>
	The Auditor General has asked to examine the accounts of the 
Canada Council but under the exemption from part X of the 
Financial Administration Act the council does not have to 
submit to his scrutiny. That means that hon. members have no 
opportunity to evaluate this organization or the seven other 
crown corporations that are also exempt. This not only includes 
the CBC and Canada Council, but among others the Canada Film 
Development Corporation and the National Arts Centre 
Corporation.
<P>
	We also have the National Film Board with a budget of $82 
million. Can we justify this kind of spending when we have a 
thriving film industry? How many films does the National Film 
Board produce that Canadians will pay to see?
<P>
	We must ask ourselves in these times of huge deficits and 
burgeoning debt if this cultural bureaucracy can be tolerated. 
Can a country with a debt of half a trillion dollars afford to 
continue to pour money into the institutions that have little or no 
benefit for the average Canadian?
<P>
	I would also suggest that we concentrate on encouraging 
excellence in the arts, encouraging those Canadians who 
actually want to be listened to or seen on the global stage. We 
should be encouraging and assisting our best talents to reach the 
world stage.
<P>
	Although it received no mention in the throne speech, I 
applaud the Liberal government's commitment expressed in the 
Red Book to take measures to enable producers of Canadian 
cultural products to export their work to international markets.
<P>
	Sixty years ago people in remote areas had little access to the 
outside world. First radio and then television changed all that. 
Technology expanded the role of culture in Canada. With 
cablevision came community access channels which allowed 
local groups to reach a much wider audience. Satellite and cable 
technologies have allowed Canadians to watch the deliberations 
in this chamber via the CPAC network and they have taken us to 
the very scenes of world events as they unfold. Few will forget 
the drama and intensity witnessed at Oka or during the gulf war.
<P>
	In the near future as access to hundreds of channels 
approaches and as individuals are empowered to decide for 
themselves what they wish to watch through the power of 
interactive technology, we will see a global culture emerge. The 
opportunities for our best artists and our best writers will grow 
but only if we have encouraged excellence.
<P>
	The best assistance government can render our cultural 
community is to ensure that all Canadians do not face a future of 
national bankruptcy.
<P>
	In conclusion, I applaud the government's attention to culture 
although I doubt we will find much common ground when it 
comes to spending taxpayers' money. We must critically 
examine every aspect of spending in this  country if we are to 
avoid 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="650"> 650 </A></B>
<P>
the future of bankruptcy. Social and cultural policies cannot be 
exempt from this.
<P>
	While spending in this country is clearly out of control, it 
seems to me an obvious thing that representatives of the people 
must have the ability to examine for themselves whether our 
constituents' taxes have been used wisely.
<P>
	I do believe we can agree on this much. At the very least the 
Auditor General should be allowed to examine those 
corporations exempt from part X of the Financial 
Administration Act as part of his review of government 
programs and that he be asked to provide an interim report to 
this House as soon as possible.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to </B><B>Minister 
of Industry):</B> Madam Speaker, I have to say to the member 
opposite that I was a little disturbed by his remarks. I come from 
downtown Toronto where the largest employers are those 
directly or indirectly related to the motion picture industry. 
Many of these young men and women got their beginning in 
places like the National Film Board and the CBC. The programs 
and the apprenticeship training in these great national 
institutions that helped these young men and women to develop 
the world class skills which currently allow them to make 
movies.
<P>
	In my riding there are close to one million square feet of 
motion picture studio space. Right now, 5,800 people are 
employed with good paying, quality jobs. They make films for 
Disney and companies from Germany and all over the world.
<P>
	Quite often people are obsessed with looking into government 
institutions like the CBC and the Canada Council. They are so 
obsessed with deficit cutting they do not realize that these are 
incubators for great human development and ultimately serve 
the whole nation and allow for a variety of export potential.
<P>
	I share the concern of the hon. member about waste and 
making sure that we are getting a good bang for the taxpayer's 
buck. All too often the contribution of Canada's cultural 
industry to the whole macroeconomic equation is viewed in a 
deprecating way.
<P>
	We have to be diligent. We must keep our heads up and make 
sure that we never desert the cultural industry in this country 
because it represents a good part of our soul.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to reiterate to the 
hon. member that I come from a background in the arts 
community. My family spent many, many years striving for 
excellence in the arts. We did so by other means and with no 
subsidies from the government.
<P>
	I point out that it is not my contention that we simply abandon 
all the cultural programs. The thrust of my message is that we 
must be accountable. Those corporations must be accountable to 
the Canadian taxpayer. Right now the way it stands there are 
eight  crown corporations which are exempt from the scrutiny of 
the Auditor General. This is unacceptable to the Canadian 
people from coast to coast. It does not matter where you are, if 
you are involved in the arts or not, this is something that is 
wrong. It has to be changed and we have to address it 
immediately.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Madam Speaker, this morning the 
Minister for Human Resources Development launched us on a 
challenge and a journey that must succeed. It must succeed not 
only because the Liberal government was elected with an 
overwhelming message of hope and jobs, but most particularly 
because over the last decade we have seen a generation of young 
Canadians who are losing hope in the capacity of our country to 
survive and to provide them with the kinds of opportunities that 
were available to those of us who emerged in the 1960s and 
1970s.
<P>
	I was very pleased to be joined in this Parliament by a 
tremendous number from the generation of the so-called baby 
boomers and even some who are younger than the baby boomers.
<P>
	I remember that as a child growing up I came from a family 
where neither my mother nor my father had a university 
education. My mother quit school at age 15 to go to work and 
support other members of her family. Every single one of their 
children had the opportunity for a college or a university 
education and to better themselves.
<P>
	If there is a driving motivation that leads certainly Liberals to 
Parliament it is to create a climate whereby our children can at 
least meet or exceed the same level of life we have had.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Earlier there was a reference to our expectations and needs 
with respect to immigration. All those men and women who 
decided to come to Canada made that decision because they felt 
there was a place where they would be able to do better than their 
parents did, and that place was Canada.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The great challenge the minister of human resources faces is 
getting Canadians to believe in themselves and in their capacity 
to be the greatest country in the world. That requires innovation. 
That requires a capacity to stare change in the face without 
blinking.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This means all members of all political parties must be able to 
accept and welcome change, because the social programs that 
formed the basis of our society in the sixties no longer work. The 
members of the Bloc Quebecois know this. The members of the 
Liberal Party know that today, the training programs that are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="651"> 651 </A></B>
<P>
supposed to give our young people a chance no longer work. We 
can say it is a bureaucratic problem and that it is up to  the 
bureaucrats in Quebec and Ottawa to improve the way programs 
are managed. But that is not the answer. The real answer is to 
give people the tools they need to strike out in new directions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are entering into the year of the family. In 1994 the United 
Nations definition of the family has changed very much from the 
kind of family I grew up in, where my mother immediately upon 
getting married was required by the Steel Company of Canada to 
quit her job because in those days you could not be a secretary at 
Stelco and at the same time be a married woman. They were 
incompatible.
<P>
	Times have changed, thank God, Madam Speaker. We are 
seeing women who are able both to compete in the workforce 
and indeed to carry more than their share in the home in a way 
that we have never seen before. We are seeing blended families. 
Indeed we are seeing single parents, particularly women, in 
numbers greater than ever before and who in fact are emerging 
as one of the under classes of society.
<P>
	One question we have to ask ourselves is what kind of family 
do we want to support in terms of public policies. More families 
have both parents working outside the home. Indeed the 
proportion of working women has doubled in the last three 
decades.
<P>
	The family, the workplace and society have and continue to 
change. There are same sex partners. The world is a changing 
and evolving place and it is our responsibility, as the Parliament 
of Canada, to be on the cutting edge of change, not to merely be 
the tail wagging the dog.
<P>
	When we look at families we have to understand that the first 
transition we make is that from infancy to school. Those are 
crucial formative years. During this stage a child's capacity to 
succeed or fail in the future is very much underlined and 
dependent upon the support that he or she receives from family 
and from the greater society.
<P>
	We need an integrated approach and I believe that is the 
approach launched this morning by the minister for human 
resources. We need economic growth obviously to provide hope. 
We need economic growth in the short term so that we can 
address the very crucial issue of child care.
<P>
	As you know the Liberal Party made a commitment to child 
care that was dependent on economic growth. That is because we 
recognize the limitations in the pocketbooks of government and 
in particular, the pocketbooks of taxpayers.
<P>
	We want and need to have economic growth to increase 
substantially the kind of support we can provide to give young 
children from the ages of zero to five the kind of leg up they need 
to be able to take their fair place in society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Twenty years ago, Piaget realized that the most important 
years in a child's life were between the ages of 0 and 5. People 
who today have no respect for the law and believe that guns are 
the answer to all our problems are people who did not have the 
right kind of nurturing when they were young, and that is very 
important.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	How can people who are living in poverty get out of it if they 
do not have access to legitimate available community supports?
<P>
	The second transition outlined by the minister is the one that 
young Canadians make from school into the work force. This is a 
real priority for the government. The capacity of our young 
people to succeed and even to be welcomed into the real world is 
vital not only for individual self-esteem but also for the 
collective well-being and prosperity of our country.
<P>
	When a 17, 18 or 19-year old young person or even a 21 or 
22-year old has done all the things we have said such as get an 
education and then finds that the job market cannot be cracked, 
what kind of signal are we sending?
<P>
	The third transition and one that is most critical in industrial 
ridings like my riding of Hamilton East, is the transition that 
workers are making as they move from an industrial to a post 
industrial economy. Job security, benefits and liveable wages 
are no longer a given.
<P>
	That ties into the final transition and the one which will 
occupy a tremendous amount of the attention of this 
government. That is the move from the work force to retirement. 
Canadians are living longer. We have to be able to think about 
how we can most rapidly help an aging population.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is very troubling to realize that while we are talking about 
the circumstances of our children, who are the future of this 
country, there are more than one million families living in 
poverty in Canada and more than one million young people 
under 18 who are living in poverty. Children may become the 
poorest group in Canada. The repercussions of poverty extend 
into our classrooms, where in some cases 40 per cent of school 
children do not get proper nutrition and care.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="652"> 652 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In some instances 40 per cent of children are going to 
Canadian schools hungry.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Common sense tells us that children who are hungry cannot 
learn. They cannot pay attention on an empty stomach. We know 
that poverty among young people and children is caused by the 
increasing number of low-income families who are unable to 
break the poverty cycle. These families have little incentive and 
few opportunities to make a change in their situation. Social 
programs like unemployment insurance and welfare are 
supposed to help them break out of the poverty cycle and recover 
their self-respect, their independence and especially their 
dignity.
<P>
	Our social security system must change, both in the way it 
deals with families caught in the poverty cycle and with children 
who are disadvantaged from an early age. The transition from 
school to the job world is one of the most important steps in our 
lives.
<P>
	I am sure that everyone here remembers the experience: the 
hesitation mixed with apprehension. We may have felt the same 
way when we made the decision to get into politics, because we 
have a number of questions that have not been answered: will we 
achieve full employment? Will it work? Will we have the 
co-operation and resources we need?
<P>
	In some parts of Canada, up to one out of three students will 
drop out of high school. Employers tell us they need workers 
who know how to read, write, do mathematics and learn new 
skills. At a time when well-paying jobs require more and more 
skills, one-quarter of Canadians cannot read a newspaper, a 
book or a restaurant menu.
<P>
	In 1992, the Economic Council of Canada warned us that if 
this problem were allowed to persist, the next decade would add 
another million illiterate young people to the labour force.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I just said that according to a 1992 study done by the 
Economic Council of Canada, if the trends continue where we 
have one-quarter of young people leaving school without being 
able to read and write, we will be adding one million young 
people to the unemployment rolls who can neither read nor write 
nor add up the cost of items on the menu in a restaurant.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These young people are at the greatest disadvantage on the 
labour market. They realize they need to improve their skills, 
but sometimes they have no idea where to go for help.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is why we cannot fail in our mission to restructure social 
security, unemployment insurance, the whole social fabric, to 
give those young people a chance to get out there and to be the 
best they can be. Improved literacy and dropout prevention 
programs are part and parcel of the kinds of labour market 
programs that our new social security system must provide in 
concert with the provinces.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Including Quebec because that province is also looking for 
ways to improve the lot of its young people. We want to give 
them a second chance, not write them off by putting them on 
welfare, on B.S. as they call it in Quebec, and everyone knows 
what people think of B.S. By the way, the acronym B.S. does not 
stand for the same thing in French and in English. Those young 
people on welfare want concrete solutions to their problem.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Too many young people are falling into a black hole between 
high school and the workplace. The training opportunities we 
are identifying must emerge and we must expand into 
occupations where there will be good paying jobs at the end of 
the road. Environmental technologies, the information age and 
the electronic highway are opening up all kinds of avenues in a 
country that is as geographically and demographically diverse 
as Canada.
<P>
	Our guiding principle must be to remember that young people 
have the potential to learn, to improve and to succeed. We 
cannot afford to write them off like some sort of debt and deficit 
liability. That is why the minister of human resources said today 
that our concern is the deficit but our concern is also the human 
deficit that is creating a generation of young people who have 
lost confidence in the capacity of society to give them the kinds 
of chances that I had.
<P>
	When I graduated from university I applied to four 
newspapers for a job, two in Ottawa and two in Montreal, and I 
was hired by one of them. A young journalism graduate now 
coming out of university could send out 60, 100 or 200 job 
applications and would more than likely come up dry. That 
certainly has a real impact on self-esteem and the capacity to 
believe in yourself and your country.
<P>
	Let us seize the opportunity to turn the situation around and 
build a generation of hope, a generation of talented young 
people who envision chances for a better life or even a life as 
good as that which many of our generation have enjoyed. 
Education and training touch the lives of every worker. The 
work force as we know it is changing: contract work, part-time 
work, at home work. They are all potential fixtures in the new 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="653"> 653 </A></B>
<P>
and emerging economy. Restructuring, downsizing, 
streamlining, whatever the buzz word, they all mean the same 
thing: lay-offs.
<P>
	The economy is shifting. It is forcing more and more 
Canadians to face the prospect of frequent job loss, retraining 
and job hunting. Our social programs have not kept up with the 
workplace realities of the new economy.
<P>
	To put it in context, I remember during the election campaign 
I knocked on the door of a gentleman who lived on Nash Road in 
my riding. He had worked for 23 years. His daughter was in 
university. He was hoping to meet the dream of getting her into a 
university that he never could have gone to and he was on his last 
week of unemployment insurance. He was on the verge of going 
to apply for welfare. This was a person who wanted to work but 
after knocking on door after door, they were closed to him.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	The challenge is to get to these people and the doors that they 
need opened. We must help the displaced workers in 
manufacturing which I certainly know very well in my own 
riding. The fisheries and resource industries face a real tough 
reintegration into the work force.
<P>
	We are talking about workers who have contributed to our 
country and communities year in and year out. They are hard 
working people. They need our help to get them back on their 
feet. They do not want a permanent welfare cheque. What they 
want is a trampoline. They want a system that supports their 
efforts to try and face the challenges of a new economy. We must 
enable older workers to learn new skills and adapt to changes in 
the workplace.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are all aware of the changes our society is going through. 
More and more children will have to take care of their parents. 
The Canadian population is getting older. We must together find 
a way for the aged to keep their independence and their dignity.
<P>
	These transitions form our collective experience, shared by 
each and every Canadian.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I can speak to the situation in my own community where a 
citizen action group has been offering pilot programs to help 
workers over the age of 50 get back on their feet and into the job 
market. They are using a very creative pilot project where they 
top off welfare benefits and integrate people into working 
offices. That program has been working. What the Minister of 
Human Resources Development is asking Canadians to do is to 
get our collective heads together and find solutions that work in 
our communities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It does not mean that everything will be managed at the 
federal level. On the contrary, the experience of the last decade 
shows that solutions will have to come from communities. 
Whether manpower programs are changed in Quebec or in 
Ottawa, what is important is that people from Chicoutimi, 
Rimouski, Hamilton and Shawinigan have the opportunity to get 
directly involved in training. That is exactly what is proposed in 
the minister's plan.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I know that my community is already working to make sure 
that the minister's model for new employment works at the local 
and community level. We want to hear from Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must also try to implement an integrated approach to 
social reform. Naturally, we need the provinces in order to face 
that enormous challenge. We cannot and we must not act 
unilaterally in an area affecting the lives of everyone.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We need and want provincial support. The Prime Minister and 
the Minister of Human Resources Development have had very 
positive signals from the provinces that they too see the need for 
real reform.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The task is enormous and urgent. The government is 
determined to see it through, but we know it will be impossible 
without the support of each and every Canadian.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is why we want to hear from members on this issue. This 
is a monumental task. It is a real challenge. It is one we must 
succeed in, not so much for ourselves because obviously with 
the backgrounds we have and the support we have received, we 
have been able to benefit from living in a great country. But 
there are literally thousands of other Canadians who are asking 
us when will they benefit?
<P>
	This package and this initiative by the minister will set in 
motion the opening of doors for those Canadians who are 
looking for their chance into the 21st century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing):</B> 
Madam Speaker, let me thank the minister for her statements 
and her emphasis on job creation and developing hope, 
especially for Canada's young.
<P>
	Let me stress as she did the importance of job creation in our 
economy and let me ask her a question which flows primarily 
from the difference between words and action.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="654"> 654 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	If we look at the research, we will now see that while an active 
social program policy is important in terms of training 
Canadians to be better equipped to take on the jobs that might be 
there, we also know that this active social program approach 
will in the main create just more skilled unemployed people, 
unless we do something on the job creation side. Nothing that we 
do on the social program side will do anything to create jobs for 
those people.
<P>
	The minister will remember in the Red Book these words: 
``The Conservatives' single-minded fight against inflation 
resulted in a deep recession, three years without growth, 
declining incomes, sky-rocketing unemployment, a crisis in 
international payments and the highest combined set of 
government deficits in our history.'' The minister, along with 
others in the government, has said, ``Judge us by our red book''.
<P>
	The minister will know that her government has appointed to 
the Bank of Canada a John Crow think-alike, Gordon Thiessen. 
This particular comment that I read was targeted for Mr. Crow. I 
think the statement in the Red Book is right. Appointing Mr. 
Thiessen, I think the minister will agree, will make it almost 
impossible to create jobs on anything like the scale needed to get 
those 3 million or 4 million Canadians back to work.
<P>
	I wonder if the minister would like to comment on whether the 
Red Book was right or appointing Mr. Thiessen was right.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Madam Speaker, first of all I want to thank the 
hon. member for his question. In the last Parliament his party 
and my party were involved in many vigorous debates. I am 
happy to see that the Canadian people sent us to government in 
large numbers, but I know that he has certainly a record of being 
a social conscience on these issues and I hope he will continue to 
be that conscience.
<P>
	That being said, I think the decision of the Government of 
Canada to accept the resignation of John Crow is one that I 
thought the member actually would be applauding. I am a little 
bit surprised that he somehow is taking it from stage one to stage 
two. I do think also, in all seriousness, that the approach of the 
Government of Canada has to be to inject some hope in the 
economy first and foremost.
<P>
	Mr. Thiessen or Mr. Crow, single-handed, are not going to 
solve the problems of Canadians. I think we need job creation 
strategies. That is why the first thing we did was in fact to 
implement the $6 billion infrastructure program.
<P>
	There is another area where his colleagues from 
Saskatchewan may be able to help us. I have been working very 
closely with the Minister of Industry on the whole issue of 
environmental technologies. We are hoping at the same time to 
ensure that interprovincial barriers to job and economic growth 
are wiped out. I  know his colleague, the Premier of 
Saskatchewan, is going to want to hear his views on how 
important it is to ensure that we have a growing economy that 
basically breaks down provincial barriers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister for her 
speech. She drew a very interesting and penetrating, albeit 
alarming, picture of the social situation prevailing in Canada at 
the present time. However, I am concerned by the fact that when 
it comes to solutions, she is less than forthcoming, to say the 
least.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, I see three different options and I 
would like to know what she thinks of them. First, you cut social 
programs, as some recommend, that is to say that you go after 
those who are already in a weakened position.
<P>
	Second, you increase taxes, affecting the middle class who, as 
we know, is already heavily burdened. Finally, you can, as the 
member for Davenport suggested with a lot of courage, lucidity 
and insight, go after the rich who, in Canada as in the rest of the 
world, are hardly affected by incentives to fill the public purse. 
It takes a lot of courage for a government to tackle this segment 
of our society. First of all I would like to know where the Deputy 
Prime Minister stands on this issue.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Then, I would like to know where she stands, in reference to 
the remarks made by the member for Davenport, regarding the 
two main avenues offered to us concerning public expenditures 
and revenues. In other words, is the government spending too 
much or is it short of revenues? We know that in the last three 
years, it has shown that both spending and revenues have been 
decreasing.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to know what she thinks of an opinion 
held by some analysts to the effect that the hidden agenda of this 
gigantic exercise of co-operation, upgrading and restructuring 
we have been invited to participate in, is to suppress the middle 
class in the Western world so that there only remain a few rich 
and powerful people and a lot of poor ones, just as in the 
under-developed countries. Is it not what we can expect in 
Canada and, consequently, in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Obviously if we continue to do with the tax 
system what our predecessors did, we will have a society with 
some very rich people and some very poor people and no middle 
class. That is why I think it is very important for the initiative 
launched by my colleague to succeed. This issue does not 
concern only government taxation. You know very well that if 
we cut the Canadian government's budget by 6 per cent 
tomorrow, we would not be able to meet our commitments on 
spending, transfer payments and so on. I think that the Bloc 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="655"> 655 </A></B>
<P>
Quebecois is very aware of the need to give the provinces some 
assurance about their revenue situation.
<P>
	We recognize that cutting government spending will not solve 
the problem, nor will broadening the tax base. What will create 
confidence is training to prepare our young people for the job 
market. When they work, they will pay taxes and the economy 
will grow. I think that is where we differ, and I will take the 
beautiful riding of Bellechasse as an example. We can admire 
the lovely geese of Montmagny, which suggests very specific 
solutions in terms of expanding tourism. The solutions would 
not necessarily be the same for the riding of Lévis, which 
depends heavily on the Seaway.
<P>
	The important thing in the process is not only the sharing of 
responsibilities between the federal and provincial governments 
but also going directly to the people and asking them, ``Do you 
have solutions to offer that work?'' It goes from the grass roots 
right up to Parliament. Sometimes we are too caught up in issues 
of federal versus provincial jurisdiction; there are too many 
bureaucratic battles. The important thing is to have jobs and 
training to meet employment needs in all regions. That is what 
the Minister of Human Resources Development is looking for.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister for her 
comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There is something that is getting on my nerves and I would 
like to tell the hon. member about it. Some people say that the 
federal government wants to interfere in areas under provincial 
jurisdiction. If you look back on Canadian history, you can 
easily, very easily see that the federal government has 
constantly impinged on provincial jurisdiction, and I think it is 
because-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Madam Speaker, we should not be interfering in 
provincial jurisdictions. But then, when I read in the papers, for 
example, about toxic chemicals being found in the St. Lawrence, 
I wonder where they come from? They come from the Great 
Lakes, in Ontario, from my region. Every action induces a 
reaction. When the famous British North America Act was 
drawn up, nobody was concerned about the environment. What 
has to be done now, what is expected of us, is to stop arguing 
about who is responsible for what, and to fulfil the mandate we 
were given by the people, that is to take care of training and job 
creation. I think and we all think that the local authorities are in 
the best position to do this. Of course, they need support and 
harmonization at the federal-provincial level.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to start by thanking the hon. Minister of Human Resources 
Development for his kind remarks. Unfortunately, that is about 
as far as it goes. Since the very beginning of the session, the 
minister has shown no sensitivity to the specificity of Quebec as 
a nation, a distinct nation, one that has been hit particularly hard 
by federal policies. Quebec's backward economy and poverty 
cannot be measured against the economic conditions and 
poverty found across Canada, as the hon. minister did in his 
speech. To insist on doing so would be an insult to history, and 
even more so to refuse to yield to facts, facts which are 
measured and compared better and better by the day. Many 
people deny these disturbing facts because they would call for 
an explanation and, today as in the past, they constitue a strong 
incentive for action.
<P>
	You would think that statistics were conspiring to break the 
whole truth to the House of Commons about the relative 
economic backwardness of Quebec and the extent of poverty in 
Quebec. We have before us the annual reports that allow 
comparisons to be made and conclusions to be drawn.
<P>
	When the second largest province in Canada ranks first in 
terms of low-income families, it is out-of-place to state, as the 
minister did, that there is poverty in Quebec like everywhere 
else in Canada. The truth of the matter is that Quebec has only 
recently won this title, although it had always been in the 
running. It is the first time that Quebec takes this dubious 
honour away from New Brunswick or Newfoundland. Just for 
the sake of comparison, let us say that there are as many families 
below the low income cut-off in the Montreal area alone as in all 
of the Atlantic provinces combined.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the significance of this. If Quebec, with a 
little over 25 per cent of the population of Canada, has 31 per 
cent of low-income families living within its borders, this 
means that the rest of Canada, all of Canada minus Quebec, with 
75 per cent of the population, accounts only for two thirds of 
low-income families anyway. Poverty in Quebec weighs more 
heavily on Quebec than over-all Canadian poverty on Canada.
<P>
	We all know that unemployment and poverty are rampant 
almost everywhere in Canada. Millions of Canadians are 
without hope, if not to say living in despair. Without being 
unique to Quebec, the phenomenon has nonetheless hit Quebec 
the hardest in terms of intensity and numbers of people affected.
<P>
	We could expect the standard of living to be about the same 
for all the people living below the low income cut-off, thanks to 
the social safety net we have in place in Canada. For that to be 
true, the concentration of poverty would have to affect neither 
the people nor the region, which is not the case. The higher the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="656"> 656 </A></B>
<P>
level of poverty and unemployment, the more destructive the 
effects on the affected communities.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	These just-released census data show that, of all Canadian 
metropolitan areas, Montreal also comes first for the proportion 
of low-income families. These figures apply to the entire census 
area, so that we can say that the concentration of poor people in 
metropolitan Montreal is quite alarming.
<P>
	The concentration of poor people in large and small 
communities or provinces has a significant effect on the services 
these communities need and on their ability to pay for and obtain 
these services. It impacts on their ability to keep their young 
people and their more dynamic elements and, in turn, on their 
demographic development.
<P>
	The regions of Quebec are emptying faster because they are in 
a vicious circle of impoverishment.
<P>
	I want my position on the fight against poverty to be clear 
right from the start. As an Official Opposition critic and member 
of Parliament, I will make every effort to speak on behalf of 
those who are not here but whose hopes and future depend on the 
work done in this House and, in the end, on the vote of the 
majority.
<P>
	It is too easy for those whose income is a lot higher than that 
of the average Quebecer or Canadian, whose jobs are secure for 
at least five years, like the hon. members opposite and beside 
me, to look at budget constraints and forget about ordinary 
people who work for minimum wage or a little more, who would 
like to work for minimum wage or a little more but who cannot 
find jobs or who would not be able to raise their children on so 
little.
<P>
	Because of their insecurity and inability to plan ahead or to 
save money, a large number of Quebecers and Canadians depend 
on collective support. This support is being questioned by the 
government, and any attempt to sugar-coat it for Canadians 
would be misleading. The government got elected by promising 
jobs. It did not say that the unemployed themselves would be 
held responsible for not having jobs.
<P>
	Let us talk about poverty and unemployment, not in terms of 
statistics but of living conditions. Let us try to understand. 
When we talk about poverty and unemployment, we see two 
scenarios: the first is a low income level but the second must be 
called poverty.
<P>
	The first situation, simpler for lawmakers, is when people 
earn less money for a while because they have lost their jobs but 
hope to find new employment; because they are students in a 
sector where jobs are available; because they are ill or have just 
given birth. People temporarily earning less or no income: that 
is the kind of problems governments like to deal with. This lack 
of money does not mean poverty but, combined with other 
problems, it can lead to it. That is why we must make every 
effort to prevent people from getting caught in such a horrible 
trap.
<P>
	The second situation facing lawmakers could be called ``true 
poverty''; it is a horrible vicious circle experienced by people 
whose health, education, housing, addictions, repeated failures, 
depression, solitude, harassment or family responsibilities only 
aggravate their feelings of failure and powerlessness.
<P>
	In such cases, and they are becoming more and more 
numerous, lack of money turns into a chronic problem and life 
becomes worse than jail because many prisoners have a hope of 
getting out. Prisoners have the means to study or occupy 
themselves and even, ironically, a sense of security.
<P>
	This poverty is worse than jail because the outside world is 
there, just beyond the door but, with all its attractions, it remains 
out of reach. Except perhaps on the evening of payday, but those 
who want to forget for one night will have to pay the price all 
month. Yes, hundreds of thousands of Quebecers and Canadians 
are experiencing these awful feelings of failure and 
powerlessness.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	They accept and often internalize the judgment which they 
know is made against them, and they isolate themselves in their 
silence. These people need to be helped and not threatened with 
being deprived of the small pittance which is their only security.
<P>
	When we, members of the Official Opposition, defend 
existing social programs it does not mean that we oppose any 
amendment or reform of those programs merely for the sake of 
opposing them; rather, in these times of crisis and deficit 
cutting, it is to defend with constantly renewed energy our social 
security mechanisms and the principle of fairness, and also to 
reinforce social cohesion. To defend the existing programs is to 
oppose duality, to oppose the fact that hundreds of thousands of 
Quebecers and millions of Canadians will be left to fend for 
themselves with a pittance barely sufficient to ensure their mere 
survival.
<P>
	This is what fighting for existing programs is all about. But to 
do a good job at it, we must constantly demand that the 
government introduce an economic policy which will foster job 
creation, otherwise any social program, any new training, 
however good, will only be a makeshift solution which could 
make things worse, since people will be even more desperate if 
there is no job after this training and all their efforts prove futile.
<P>
	For more than 20 years Quebec has been asking for control of 
all social and revenue protection programs to make them more 
effective. The reasons mentioned today by the minister to justify 
his reform are far from being new ones. In fact, the Liberals, 
who today find nothing better to do than to undertake a 
restructuring of the social security system in Canada, were the 
ones who refused to give Quebec full responsibility for the tax 
points, something which Jean Lesage had negotiated at a time 
when the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="657"> 657 </A></B>
<P>
Liberals were still willing to negotiate, that  is before the arrival 
on the scene of former Prime Minister Trudeau.
<P>
	A social security system, no matter how good, cannot of its 
own give back hope and dignity to Quebecers and to Canadians. 
What we need more than anything is a true employment policy.
<P>
	Since 1990, the employment growth rate, to which research 
services in Ottawa do not often refer to but we will do so, is 
diminishing. Indeed, the number of Canadians able to work 
increases more rapidly than the number of jobs available.
<P>
	Why is this reform of our social security system suddenly so 
urgent? Why is the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
who is accountable to Quebecers and to Canadians for fostering 
job creation, not desperately trying to introduce a true 
employment policy, which is the only solution to give hope to 
young people and workers who have very little hope left indeed.
<P>
	Among all the testimonies to which he referred, the minister 
surely remembers that of the former deputy minister of 
Employment and Immigration, Mr. Arthur Kroeger, who 
strongly criticized Canadian governments. His comments were 
reported in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, last week. This is not a quote; it 
is an excerpt from the <I>Globe and Mail.</I>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	He said, ``Canada has never had a real employment strategy, 
even though the unemployment rate, especially long-term 
joblessness, has been climbing since the 1950s and the labour 
market is polarizing into well-paid jobs for those with solid 
skills at one end and low-paid jobs for those with little 
education at the other''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Later, he added, in his own words:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``What we are seeing is a growth of a Canadian under-class''.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In another article, which was reproduced in <I>Quorum</I> by the 
way, yet another expert, Mr. Lars Osberg, told the hon. Minister 
of Human Resources that social program reform is not what will 
create jobs, that reform and job creation should go hand in hand. 
He insisted on the necessity of an employment policy.
<P>
	If the minister is preoccupied by jobs, why did he increase 
unemployment insurance premiums as of January 1 instead of 
freezing them for now, while recovery is so slow, and increasing 
them later on when recovery has reached the level that 
economists are promising him? They all agree that these 
repeated increases have a negative impact on employment, that 
they constitute an employment tax.
<P>
	The answer is simple; with all its generous statements the 
Liberal government has but one purpose and that is to reduce the 
deficit. No, I am sorry, they have two main purposes: to reduce 
the deficit and to implement a system, and I quote from Mr. 
Axworthy's speech, on page 7, a typically Canadian system that 
will ``give Canadians a sense of their own uniqueness''.
<P>
	Therefore, it is not surprising that today, in the area of 
occupational training, as was the case yesterday with family 
allowances and as it will be tomorrow with welfare, Quebec is 
confronted with arrogance and an ever present desire for 
centralization. The important thing is not to find efficient 
solutions for people, it is to find a system ``which will give 
Canadians a sense of their own uniqueness''. Quebecers do not 
need programs to help them discover their own identity. Indeed, 
the central government and especially the Liberals have 
consistently tried over the years to suppress the very existence 
of that identity.
<P>
	Consider the incredible refusal on the part of the central 
government to give Quebec control over occupational training. I 
listened to the hon. Deputy Prime Minister talk to us about the 
great benefits of occupational training. We and indeed all 
Quebecers do not need to be convinced of these benefits and we 
have been waiting and we will have to wait two years. Because 
the most implausible of all detours is being taken, namely a 
comprehensive review of social and training programs, Quebec 
is being denied the means with which to launch a serious assault 
right away on some of its major problems. Yet, if we look at the 
Liberal program, we can find nothing in what Quebec is now 
doing that goes against what is advocated in the red book, except 
for one thing. Quebec wants control because it knows that the 
current mess only leads to wasted resources and energy and to 
dashed hopes. Quebec cannot afford to wait. In the face of 
Ottawa's refusal last week, labour, business and provincial 
government representatives had some very harsh words for the 
amazing ineptness of the government which is seeking ``a 
typically Canadian system''.
<P>
	Do we need to remind the government, or perhaps say it for 
the first time, that an employment policy is urgently needed, in 
Quebec more than anywhere else, because it is in Quebec that 
the employment/population ratio reflects a largely inadequate 
level of business activity.
<P>
	To clearly grasp the difference between Quebec and Ontario, 
let us say that if Quebec and Ontario had the same rate of 
employment, there would be hundreds of thousands more jobs in 
Quebec today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="658"> 658 </A></B>
<P>
	No doubt it is not merely a coincidence that for many years 
now in Quebec, labour, business, social agencies and 
governments have been working together to tackle serious 
problems and improve the situation. Responsibility for 
occupational training falls to them and to the <I>Société québécoise 
de développement de la main-d'oeuvre</I> to which the government 
refuses to hand control over training.
<P>
	Together-and this was not obvious at the outset-they have 
come a long way and acquired the necessary expertise. The only 
explanation for the minister's refusal can be found in his speech 
where he says he is looking for a ``typically Canadian system, 
one which gives Canadians a sense of their own uniqueness''.
<P>
	To delay action for two years on such a critical, fundamental 
matter as occupational training is a slap in the face for 
Quebecers. What kind of trust should they place then in the aims 
of the social security reform process?
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development wants to 
carry out a comprehensive reform. He wants the proposals and 
suggestions put forward to be Canadian solutions. He wants to 
institute a social security system that gives Canadians a sense of 
their own uniqueness. If the Minister of Human Resources 
Development refuses to see that the people of Quebec have their 
own identity which requires a made-in-Quebec solution, if he 
persists in wanting to encroach upon provincial areas of 
jurisdiction such as education and training, if he steadfastly 
refuses to transfer quickly to the Government of Quebec full 
responsibility for manpower development, well then he should 
expect vigorous opposition on our part.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	In point of fact, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development is in the process of demonstrating that Quebec is 
right to claim, as it has for many years, the right to manage its 
own income security system. That is what the minister wants, 
for reasons of efficiency. Yet, the same reasons can explain 
Quebec's position. The only difference is that Quebec wants a 
Quebec-style administration, while Canada wants a typically 
Canadian system.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women)): </B>Madam Speaker, I 
have listened to the hon. member's remarks with great interest. 
She has certainly made some valid comments on the structure of 
the family and the rather sorry state it is in.
<P>
	I would like focus my comments on my riding of Mount 
Royal, where young people between the ages of 15 and 24 in the 
Black community are facing a 60 per cent rate of 
unemployment. I must tell you that our party, this side of the 
House, this government wants to listen to everyone, whether 
they are from the City of Mount Royal, the riding of Mount 
Royal, downtown Quebec City, the Lower St. Lawrence, 
Newfoundland or  British Columbia. We are concerned with 
improving the well-being of families, young people, 
middle-aged people, that is to say people 45 and over, wherever 
they are in Canada. We are not concerned only with Quebec, but 
with Canada as a whole.
<P>
	You claimed, first, that we did not have a single idea. That is 
not true and you know it. You also said that we had done nothing 
so far and created no jobs. That is also untrue. We are setting up 
an entire infrastructure policy that the hon. member is well 
aware off.
<P>
	There were good points in the hon. member's speech, but they 
were set in a biased context that I find harmful to the people of 
Canada, including Quebec, because what matters is not whether 
you live in Quebec or in Canada, but that poverty should not 
exist in this country.
<P>
	If the hon. member has such good ideas and is so much on top 
of all to provincial responsibilities, I hope, Madam Speaker, that 
she will participate very actively and whole-heartedly in the 
projects we will be putting forward to ensure that all Canadians, 
young and old, are better off.
<P>
	I detect a certain narrow-mindedness when the hon. member 
says that we did not come up with a single idea when-and she 
knows full well-with regard to the Unemployment Insurance 
Program, we have a piece of legislation regarding the increase in 
the level of benefits. She failed to mention that we found money 
elsewhere in order not to increase Unemployment Insurance 
rates.
<P>
	I hope that the hon. member will contribute more positively, 
although she did note genuine facts in most of her remarks.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Madam Speaker, I did not want to interrupt the 
speech by the hon. member for Mount Royal. This is just a 
reminder, as the Speaker himself asked, to hon. members to 
address the Chair and not each other directly.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> That is for the Speaker 
to decide. I am sorry, I did not hear it.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mercier has the floor, to answer the 
minister.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, I went over all the points 
raised by the hon. member for-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Mount Royal!
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mount Royal. Of course! How could I forget? 
I already went to see her.
<P>
	Of course the government wants to listen to everyone. If we 
are talking about the proposal, you must talk about this 
proposal. The government allows two months for a 
parliamentary committee to hear all of Canada on a thorough 
reform, the modernization and restructuring of the whole 
income security system, and it announces that it will table a 
policy on April 1. That is what I heard this morning. That is very 
little time to hear everyone. I had several opportunities to sit on 
parliamentary 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="659"> 659 </A></B>
<P>
committees  studying much more restricted subjects. If the 
government has a plan, it should come out with it.
<P>
	Anyway, the government was elected to govern. I find this 
show of concern touching, but if you accept and are prepared to 
take power, you have some ideas. You do not just keep telling 
people what their problems are. However, I did not say that you 
did not have any ideas. I must have mis-spoken. Nevertheless, 
no one in this country can maintain that the infrastructure policy 
takes the place of an employment strategy. It is a short-term 
policy which will create 65,000 temporary jobs at best. It is 
better than nothing, but it is not what we call a jobs strategy 
when the needs are what they are now.
<P>
	You said that my way of speaking was harmful. I regret that 
deeply because what I tried to explain here, before the hon. 
members opposite and beside me, is the urgency of the situation 
in Quebec. This urgent situation which they-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Throughout Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> It is urgent in Canada, but let me say, because 
the Minister of Human Resources Development had me go back 
and say that there is poverty everywhere, that when it is so 
concentrated, it is urgent. This urgency explains the impatience 
of many Quebecers who heard-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> And Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, I listened to the hon. member 
with respect. This impatience, faced with new promises and the 
refusal to transfer immediate control of labour force training to 
Quebec, just fills us with doubt.
<P>
	I would add that many people from all quarters and groups 
said that increasing unemployment insurance premiums would 
be bad for employment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to direct a question 
to the member.
<P>
	I must say that I read the member's opening address last 
weekend when I was taking a bus to Belleville, Ontario. I 
brought it to the House today because I was struck by the second 
last paragraph in which she said, on January 20:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, you can tell the Minister of Human Resources and Development 
that he can count on my unqualified support whenever he wants to help people 
in need, but I will make every effort to be as fierce a parliamentarian as he was in 
the opposition, whenever he deviates from this path.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I thought that was a most constructive and supportive 
statement.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	Earlier in the member's speech she talked about the fact that 
there was inherent overlapping, duplication and consequential 
incapacity to make the right decision at the right moment for the 
maximization of social benefits. I thought this was just a great 
speech.
<P>
	When the minister responsible for human resources addressed 
in a speech today some of the very things the member talked 
about in her opening remarks, did she not see that eliminating 
some of the duplication or overlap and flushing out some of the 
waste in institutionalized bureaucracy would allow us to have 
further resources at the same time to help put people back to 
work? Is that not the way she sees the debate unfolding?
<P>
	I did not hear the minister talk today about cutting. The only 
deficit I heard him talk about today was the human deficit. That 
to me was the sense he was projecting. Could the member not try 
to see it as a possible approach of the minister?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry but the time 
for questions and comments has expired.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the 
House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Bellechasse-National Revenue; the hon. member for Thunder 
Bay-Nipigon-Grain transportation; the hon. member for 
Québec Est-Agriculture; the hon. member for 
Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing-Job creation.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women)):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
a particular privilege to join in this very important debate for the 
people of Canada and for members of the House of Commons. I 
would sincerely hope that as members of Parliament and 
Canadians from all regions and all backgrounds we are 
beginning to undertake an examination of our social safety 
system which will be in the best interests of all Canadians. This 
reform is the first step in making our programs more responsive 
to the social and economic needs of the people of Canada as we 
prepare to enter the 21st century.
<P>
	I pledge my support to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development who has the necessary courage and dedication to 
tackle such a complex and important task as this review. The life 
of every Canadian will be affected for many years to come by the 
results of this reform.
<P>
	This is why the minister is taking measures to ensure that all 
Canadians will be heard and that they will not be hurt by this 
initiative but will benefit from it. The minister has said he is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="660"> 660 </A></B>
<P>
asking each and every one of us in the Chamber to participate in 
the review so that the government is better able to serve the 
people through an open and transparent system.
<P>
	He asked us to sit down and speak with our constituents, to 
seek their opinion and to get their advice. He is also asking 
Canadians to come forward with their ideas and suggestions for 
solution. The time line is not just a short two months, as the 
member for Mercier seemed to suggest. The time line is far 
longer than that.
<P>
	If hon. members really are concerned about the people of the 
country they will get their business and information together. 
They will respond to the wonderful new transparency that we are 
presenting as an option for Canadians and will get their 
suggestions and their ideas to the parliamentary committee in a 
variety of different forms as will be determined by the 
committee.
<P>
	This reform of our social security system is of great 
importance to me and to all women in Canada. Women must 
participate in the process, and I am committed to doing whatever 
I can to ensure that they have that opportunity.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	It is my hope that Canadian women will seize this 
opportunity, will provide the guidance as to what kind of social 
security system they would feel comfortable with, what they 
think would be important for us to maintain, and where the sense 
of well-being will be ensured. They can in this way contribute to 
the progress, and to their own progress, toward equality.
<P>
	As the minister has pointed out, close to half of Canadians no 
longer have a sense of security about their lives, and that is 
dramatic. Many are afraid that the company they work for may 
close or restructure and as a result they will lose their jobs. They 
are afraid that should they have to look for another job, they 
would not have the opportunity, the training, or the education 
needed to find one. If they are over 50 years of age they are 
terrified that they may never find another job.
<P>
	Over and above the concerns that are being expressed, I think 
it is important to recognize that there has been a dramatic 
change in the structure of the family. There has been a growth in 
the single-parent family. There has been a change in what we 
would call the traditional two-parent, two-child, 
white-picket-fence image of that particular word ``family''.
<P>
	There has been a change in the work force. There has been a 
change in the workplace. There are too many changes taking 
place for many people, who seem to feel there is a loss of hope, 
and they do not understand where things are going. Along with 
the globalization of the economy, this change to a 
knowledge-based economy, this restructuring of our bigger 
firms and the growth of the small business sector are all 
undeniable elements of the new reality that confronts 
Canadians. As I said before, many are fearful of these changes.
<P>
	The consequences of these changes are wide-ranging and 
diversified in scope. We have to look at them from a different 
perspective from that of a company's bottom line. I think that 
people's lives and people's ability to live in this country have to 
be taken into consideration, not just, as I said before, the bottom 
line.
<P>
	We have to look at the social impact with respect to the issues 
we are facing, adjust our focus and redirect our very scarce 
resources. Men and women in Canada are proud, hardworking 
and dedicated people. Canadians want to be contributors, not 
dependants of our society.
<P>
	Collecting unemployment insurance cheques or living on 
welfare is not good enough for any of us. This is not our 
aspiration and our hope for ourselves, for our families or our 
children. We want to work. We want to feed and care for our 
family, and we want to be able to put a little money aside for 
some pleasure, as well as to protect ourselves in our older age.
<P>
	This is not a dream. This is the Canadian way of life. This is 
what has made Canada so rich and so appealing both for 
Canadian-born people and for all those who have chosen to join 
us over these years. Now we must take steps to ensure that the 
social programs that have helped guarantee our envious 
standard of living over the past decades will continue to serve us 
well for a long, long time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The last decade has undoubtedly been a lot more beneficial to 
the rich than to the general population. Individual purchasing 
power has fallen and the middle class, caught between tax 
increases and runaway inflation, has been hit hard.
<P>
	Food banks, which were the exception and only existed in the 
big cities 10 or 15 years ago, have now become a familiar sight 
and that is sad.
<P>
	I think that the most important and revolting sociological 
phenomenon to emerge in Canada in the last few years is the face 
of poverty. Poverty is increasingly taking on the face of a 
woman and, if that was not bad enough, of a woman carrying a 
child or of an old woman. That is the face of poverty here in 
Canada.
<P>
	When I talk about women, I think of women of all races and 
ages, but I must admit that our immigrant, native and 
handicapped women are in an even more difficult situation as 
they also face discrimination and poverty.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	In a country as rich and as fortunate as Canada, we cannot 
accept this disintegration of our social fabric or leave these 
hungry children and desperate women at the mercy of market 
forces. We cannot ignore the unemployment and poverty that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="661"> 661 </A></B>
<P>
contribute to such serious problems as violence against women 
and children or the formation of youth gangs usually leading to 
crime and violence. We cannot forget that racism, intolerance 
and discrimination are devastating parasites that we  would like 
to eliminate from our society but which continue to do a lot more 
damage than we are willing to admit.
<P>
	I feel very emotional when I think about this situation we 
must face, and I think that our Minister was very brave to 
implement global changes by listening to society in order to 
improve our current situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It seems to me that one of the single most important factor to 
take into account in this review of our social safety system is the 
situation of women. I say women because we represent the 
majority of the population, and I say women because we make 
an enormous contribution to our society and our economy. 
However, as women we are often economically disadvantaged 
due to the disproportionate responsibilities that we bear for both 
our homes and our families. I say women because we have 
diverse needs and concerns that are often overlooked and 
neglected. Our roles have undergone tremendous changes since 
the social security system was first established. I say women 
because we have to struggle for the right to have many choices in 
our lives: to pursue an education, a career, voluntary activities, 
caring for children and for our parents. We must continue to 
value and protect this right to choose.
<P>
	This is unpaid work that we take, and it does contribute very 
significantly to our collective wealth as a country.
<P>
	I say women, because the new social security system must 
take into consideration the economic and social realities of 
women today and our aspirations for tomorrow.
<P>
	Finally, I say women because it is still largely in our hands 
that the future of our children lie, and that is the future of 
Canada.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, the sad reality of the difficult situation of 
women is revealed in simple statistics; that is, cold, hard fact. 
Today women of all ages, cultures and backgrounds represent 45 
per cent of the work force. They are expected to account for 
almost two-thirds of the new entrants into the job market 
between now and the year 2001.
<P>
	Despite the unprecedented participation of Canadian women 
in the work force, most women work for low wages in 
low-status jobs. Almost one-third are still employed in clerical 
positions and, on average, Canadian women working full-time 
today earn just 72 cents of every dollar earned by men.
<P>
	In 1950 about 5.4 million income recipients received a total 
income of less than $10,000. Of this, 36 per cent were men and 
64 per cent were women. That is those who get $10,000.
<P>
	At the other end of the scale, looking at those who earn 
$40,000 or more in income, of these 78 per cent were men, 
whereas only 22 per cent were women. I would say to you that 
that is inequity.
<P>
	Women, especially women of child-bearing age, experience 
more career interruptions. In too many cases fathers do not share 
fully the financial responsibility of raising their children.
<P>
	In 1991, 82 per cent of all one-parent families were headed by 
women. They made up almost two-thirds of the 900,000 
families living in poverty. Those are chilling statistics.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	Children living with a single mother are five times more 
likely to live in poverty than those living with two parents. The 
vast majority of women have very little money to put into an 
RRSP or a pension plan. Only 48 per cent of women workers 
aged 45 to 64 can expect to receive company pensions upon 
retirement. So by the time they reach the end of their careers, 
only a small percentage of women are financially secure. All the 
others have to rely on government programs. For too many a 
lifetime of hard work and sacrifice is rewarded with poverty and 
deprivation.
<P>
	If we do not fix our social security system, we will pay a 
terrible price for our indifference. Women's poverty is not just a 
woman's problem, ladies and gentleman and colleagues; it is a 
problem that every Canadian has an interest in solving.
<P>
	As we initiate this social security review, it is time to 
recognize the extent of women's poverty in our country and to 
fully examine the basic cause: women's inequality.
<P>
	Any plan to end women's poverty must be pursued within the 
context of the overall efforts to promote the equality of women 
in all aspects of human endeavour. That requires broadly based 
co-operative efforts that involve Canadians from every walk of 
life.
<P>
	To change this we must place a higher value on the work that 
is traditionally performed by women. We must offer women the 
opportunity to diversify their occupational qualifications and 
seek advancement. They must have the ability to compete for the 
better paying, more challenging and responsible positions 
within the work force, because in many cases they are able, 
willing, ready and competent.
<P>
	Improving the education and training opportunities for 
women is central to achieving this goal and is central to sound 
employment practices. Issues such as training in non-traditional 
occupations, encouraging girls to continue with studies in math 
and science, support for school work and home-school 
transition, and better financial resources must all be addressed 
for men and for women.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="662"> 662 </A></B>
<P>
	I would say that the economic situation of women is such that 
should pay particular attention and make sure that it is 
addressed as we go forward with this review. This is true for 
all women, but particularly, as as I have said before, for 
immigrant women who have special needs such as language 
training and recognition of their credentials. They also need 
guidance to be able to access and use all the services available 
to them.
<P>
	I will work with my counterparts in the provinces and the 
territories, along with the minister, to improve women's access 
to education, training and retraining in order to give them equal 
opportunity to compete for jobs in the workplace of today and 
tomorrow. I shall work with these ministers and with our 
minister to ensure that our immigrant women are given equal 
access to federal government services as well as vocational 
training and language courses.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And finally, we must think of young people. We can never 
exaggerate the importance of our young people for a country 
like Canada. On them and in them we place all our priorities, all 
our hopes and all our dreams for the future. I have to say that few 
things are as painful for me as to see young people fall victim to 
violence, to discrimination, and to poverty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As the minister said so well, there is a human deficit in our 
country and we all have to realize that if we can deal with this 
human deficit and put Canadians, all Canadians, back to work, it 
will be much easier to deal with the financial deficit. I think 
there is a tremendous interlinking between both these things.
<P>
	I said in this House on Friday that from now on this 
government will follow a simple but important path, an 
action-oriented path. I also said that governments must deal 
with change in full partnership with Canadians. We have today 
the perfect application of these two principles.
<P>
	Yes, we are taking action to review programs that in some 
cases date back to 1942. Yes, we have refused to take the easy 
path of amending something here, increasing a part of 
something there, adjusting something here and imposing a few 
cuts there.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	I would suggest that any members who are really interested in 
this process read the minister's speech and get a fuller picture of 
where he intends to go in a large number of areas that are of 
importance to each and every one of us.
<P>
	I would suggest that instead of the easy path, we have chosen 
to remake our entire social security system after we have done 
the necessary consultations. Once change of this nature is made, 
one does not jump into it in two minutes flat. The minister has 
laid out a very comprehensive and intelligent plan of 
consultation, which will allow groups, including women's 
groups, to  get together, consult with their grass roots and feed 
back into the process.
<P>
	We have the parliamentary process, we have the standing 
committee process, we have members going into their riding for 
an open hearing in that way, and we have the standing committee 
to do something.
<P>
	We really must do something now and do it with full 
participation and collaboration for all Canadians. To do this we 
must ensure that organizations representing women-that is, all 
women, including immigrant and visible minorities, which so 
often have limited resources and broad mandates-have 
sufficient time and support to consult their grass roots and get 
back to us.
<P>
	Knowing that this government and this House are quickly 
confronting this complex and difficult issue facing this country 
hand in hand with all citizens I think should only assure and 
reassure even the most skeptical and bring hope of a brighter 
future for all in this nation. That is what we are in this House of 
Commons to do, address the concerns.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have to take into account the concerns of every Canadian, 
no matter where he or she may live.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is exactly what Canadians have elected the Liberal Party, 
this side, this government, to do, and that is precisely what we 
are going to do. Whether you live in Newfoundland with your 
problems, in Manitoba with your problems, Saskatchewan, 
Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, it does not matter. We are concerned, 
and certainly with the Northwest Territories and certainly with 
our aboriginal people, and we have a global view of society. 
That is how this government intends to allow us to bring this 
change; it is through consultation, through transparency, 
without dogma, without dictation, but with an open heart, an 
open ear, to effect the changes that the Canadian people want for 
themselves.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to follow up on the comments made by the hon. member 
who just spoke and who said that these are times of change. 
Indeed they are, as was also mentioned by the Minister of 
Finance during Question Period.
<P>
	This is a time for change in Canada, with the arrival of a new 
federal government, but let us not forget that things also 
changed in Quebec on October 25, when three million 
Quebecers elected 54 Bloc Quebecois members to represent 
them in this House, as well as to protect Quebec's interests and 
give it real power.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="663"> 663 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member raised the issue of poverty. In 1980, the 
Liberals took 74 ridings out of 75 in Quebec, the hon. Roch 
LaSalle from Joliette being the only Conservative member. At 
that time, the debt stood at $30 billion. In 1984, when the 
Liberals were ousted and replaced by the Conservatives, the 
debt had risen to $187 billion.
<P>
	From 1984 to 1988, the Conservative government enjoyed a 
strong majority, including in Quebec. From 1988 to 1993, 
Quebec gave a second chance to the Conservative Party. The 
debt, which stood at $187 billion when the Liberals left in 1984, 
has now climbed to over $500 billion under the Conservatives, 
and the Liberals are in charge again.
<P>
	We just talked about poverty in this House, but it should be 
pointed out that each day the debt now costs every Canadian and 
Quebecer $108 million in interest. With these $108 million we 
could build social housing. We could give some security to our 
young people in post-secondary education and prevent them 
from dropping out. We could provide vocational training, thus 
creating something between the dayworker and the university 
graduate. We will always need plumbers, carpenters, 
electricians and other tradespersons. Today, more and more 
women are seeking employment in non traditional jobs, in 
construction and in industry for example. It is something we are 
very aware of in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	We have heard talk about poverty in this House and bragging 
about how we were going to correct the situation with the 
infrastructure program. The Liberals had their chance, the 
Conservatives had their chance, but red or blue, they are two 
peas in a pod, there is no difference. I am convinced that at the 
end of the mandate of this government, the Canadian debt will 
not have shrunk a bit. Despite all the speeches that are made, 
things remain the same. We have heard about the minister's 
speech, which cost $173,000. It is only the beginning, we will 
see more of that kind of waste.
<P>
	A number of young graduates from universities or Cegeps 
must pump gas, because they did not get an education which 
would have prepared them to take over from those who were 
there before and built this country. This is why Quebec wants to 
take charge of itself, Quebec wants to be the master of its own 
destiny in the fields of education, manpower, health and 
municipal affairs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Madam Speaker, I realize the clock has run 
out, but I would just like to suggest to the hon. gentleman, our 
colleague across the floor, that the federal contribution to social 
security programs in Quebec is $14.6 billion.
<P>
	Quebec has a huge deficit. Canada has a huge deficit. We are 
now providing 28 per cent of all national funds for the work that 
has to be done in Quebec and that with these funds, with which I 
have no quarrel, we will be able  to fix the situation so that our 
young people can find their niche in tomorrow's society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is irrelevant to ask today who did what about the deficit. We 
are talking about young people and the fact that they want to be 
able to eat and earn a living and get proper training for the 
future.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is the Secretary of State 
aware that she has a 10 minute question and comment period?
<P>
	Therefore, I will allow further questions from the hon. 
member for Gaspé.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened to the 
hon. member for Mount Royal. I agree with her and I am sad to 
hear her talking about poverty in Canada and Quebec since it is 
now affecting women. I am very sorry to hear that. I heard a lot 
of descriptions of poverty in the hon. member's speech.
<P>
	However, I would like to ask her two questions. First, if we 
want to reform the social system or social programs in Canada, 
do we expect that we will have more poor people? Because, 
otherwise, I would have preferred that we used the time of the 
House to speak about job creation.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Second, I would like to make sure, through the hon. member 
for Mount Royal, the government representative today, that the 
reform will not be aimed at giving less money to the poor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> What I want to say with regard to the 
member's first question is that with job creation I think it is very 
clear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Job creation is a goal towards which the government is 
working at this time. Job creation has been the focal point of our 
Prime Minister's speeches. That is why we have been elected, 
all of us who considered in detail the Red Book of our party 
which says that job creation is our primary responsability. Both 
go together. If you do not have a well supported population, if 
you do not have a population that is in good health, it will not be 
ready and able to learn new trades, to change trade or to enter the 
job market. When you have a population that is working, the 
finance problem, the deficit problem can be solved in a better 
way. It is like a scale: one does not go without the other.
<P>
	To answer the questions asked by the Reform Party, I must say 
that our goal is not simply cutting for the sake of cutting. Our 
goal is to improve the present situation, because you know as 
well as I do that people on welfare, people who receive different 
kinds of assistance do not find their niche in the job market 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="664"> 664 </A></B>
<P>
because they do not have the necessary tools and because our 
labour force was not trained to face the changes required by the 
job  market today. And I hope that by working together we will 
find the right answers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Madam 
Speaker, since this is my historic first speech in Canada's House 
of Commons, I would like to congratulate you on your election 
to the Speaker's chair. Furthermore, I pledge my support and 
full co-operation to you and all of your colleagues who will be 
overseeing the proceedings of this House over the life of the 
35th Parliament. Yours is an exceedingly difficult task. The eyes 
of Canada are upon this Parliament and Canadians are expecting 
reform.
<P>
	As a rookie MP it has been my observation over the past two 
weeks that nowhere is change needed more than right here in this 
very chamber. Like millions of other Canadians, I am absolutely 
appalled at the behaviour of some hon. members. I appeal to 
you, Madam Speaker, to do all you possibly can to help restore 
the public's faith in this place. I sincerely hope the decorum in 
this House will improve rather than degenerate further. It is up 
to each and every MP to assist you in restoring the dignity of this 
House.
<P>
	To members elected or re-elected to this Parliament, my 
congratulations. It is my hope that all MPs will use their 
mandate wisely.
<P>
	No maiden speech would be complete without recognizing all 
of those people who support me, for no politician wins by 
himself or herself. It takes a dedicated team working together to 
win. I was very fortunate to have the best team possible working 
for reform in Prince George-Peace River. For many of my 
supporters their commitment began before the 1988 election and 
never faltered-more than six years of hard work and effort. I 
want to take this brief opportunity to salute them.
<P>
	A special thank you to Carol, my wife of over 20 years, and 
my three children for their ongoing love and support. To all my 
family, friends and supporters, thank you for this great honour 
that your dedication and sacrifices have bestowed upon me.
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not mention a man known 
throughout our riding and indeed much of northern Canada as 
Mr. Reform. Short Tompkins is truly a great Canadian 
committed to doing all he can to bring constructive political 
change to this country. I am proud to call him my friend.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	Although the riding of Prince George-Peace River is famous 
for its pristine beauty, wildlife and abundant natural resources, 
its greatest asset is the hard working people who inhabit it. 
These people have sent me to Ottawa because they have lost 
faith in the political system in Canada. The population of my 
riding feels alienated, not only from provincial but from 
national decision making. There is a growing concern in my 
riding about how the old parties have avoided making tough  
decisions on social spending. If this Parliament is to address 
these critical concerns of Canadians, the attitudes of 
governments must change.
<P>
	It is my belief that this reluctance by past governments to 
listen to Canadians demanding change is a reflection of the 
plague of political correctness that has infiltrated every segment 
of our society. If one speaks out against special status for one 
province, one is said to be out to destroy Canada. If one dares to 
question our immigration policy, one is branded a racist. If one 
objects to the legal system that protects criminals rather than 
holding them responsible for their own actions, one is labelled a 
dinosaur.
<P>
	I call on this government to reject political correctness and to 
instead listen to the wishes of the Canadian people. We cannot 
create sustainable social programs and safety nets for those truly 
in need if those programs are built according to the politically 
correct agenda of the day. The government must consider what 
is good for Canada, not what is dictated by the media or by a few 
outspoken interest groups.
<P>
	Will our social programs as they are currently structured be 
sustainable? Universality of access must be preserved. But if 
universality means a declining number of productive taxpayers 
paying all of the costs for all of the people all of the time, then 
certainly the programs are not sustainable. Reformers want to 
ensure that our social programs are sustainable and available for 
all Canadians when they need them.
<P>
	In this time of economic trouble caused by a quarter century 
of government mismanagement, my riding remains one of the 
few bright spots where hard work and entrepreneurial skills are 
still rewarded. But even there it is becoming more and more 
difficult for small business to prosper and expand.
<P>
	Small business today survives in spite of government, not 
because of it. Small business people are gravely concerned 
about the rumoured reductions to maximum RRSP 
contributions. If this reduction should become reality rather 
than rumour, this government will be reducing the ability of 
entrepreneurs in the private sector to provide for their own 
retirement while the pension plan for the public sector remains 
untouched.
<P>
	As of December 1992 about $150 billion were held in tax 
deferred RRSPs while $110 billion had been set aside for the 
pensions of government workers. If the finance minister is 
intent on reducing the maximum allowable contributions of 
private citizens, then perhaps he should also be looking at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="665"> 665 </A></B>
<P>
reducing the generous government public servant and MP 
pension plans that the rest of the taxpayers are helping to fund. 
The people of my riding are fed up with this double standard.
<P>
	Canadians are generous people. However they are concerned 
about whether our charitable but fragile social safety net can 
withstand the increasing pressures being placed upon it.
<P>
	Canadians are proud to be able to offer asylum to refugees 
fleeing political persecution and human rights violations in their 
home countries. However, is Canada's refugee determination 
system meeting its mandate? There has been some controversy 
surrounding the recent appointments to the Immigration and 
Refugee Board. While recognizing that many of these 
appointees have knowledge regarding issues relating to 
refugees, we question the current government policy of 
appointing persons from refugee advocacy groups.
<P>
	Can Canadians rely on these board members to make unbiased 
decisions? In future appointments it is imperative that the 
minister places the objectivity and decision-making 
capabilities of potential board members foremost in his 
considerations.
<P>
	Since the Immigration and Refugee Board began operations 
the recognition rate of convention refugees has declined from 76 
per cent in 1989 to 48 per cent during the first nine months of 
1993. Although there has been a steady decline in the acceptance 
rate of refugee claimants, there is still something clearly wrong 
with our determination system.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	Like Canada, most other refugee accepting countries 
determine whether someone is a refugee according to the UN 
convention but they accept far fewer claimants as legitimate. 
Canada continues to have the highest acceptance rate in the 
world. Many Canadians are wondering why this is happening.
<P>
	Recent refugee decisions have allowed women fearing 
spousal abuse or systemic discrimination in their home 
countries to stay in Canada. What will be the impact of this 
policy? Does this mean that every woman from countries that do 
not respect the rights of women or have different cultural norms 
should be granted refugee status in Canada? I certainly 
sympathize with the plight of these women. The solution 
however is not to bring all abused women to Canada but to assist 
them in promoting respect for human rights within their own 
societies.
<P>
	I commend the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration's 
recent decision to allow refugee claimants to work rather than 
being forced to rely solely on social assistance, but the granting 
of work permits does nothing to address another problem that 
has outraged Canadians in recent months. I refer to the reports of 
welfare fraud by refugee claimants. It was estimated that the 
cost of welfare payments to refugees in the metro Toronto area 
for 1993 would reach $209 million.
<P>
	The minister has removed one barrier for legitimate refugees 
seeking work but what is he doing to prevent the welfare fraud 
that his own department has reported? Canadians are 
compassionate and would like to open their doors to legitimate 
refugees, but this abuse is an unacceptable drain on our already 
overburdened social programs.
<P>
	In conclusion it is my fervent hope that this government 
listens carefully to the people, as government members have 
indicated today they are willing to do, and responds by 
restructuring social programs in ways that make sense to 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Madam Speaker, first I would like to say there 
were some aspects of the hon. member's maiden address which I 
really appreciated and support, especially those areas relating to 
support for small business.
<P>
	However, I have to deal with this issue of women who are 
victims of violence not being considered as bona fide refugees 
in our country. I have to make sure I understand the member 
correctly. Is the hon. member suggesting that if a mother and 
children who might be fortunate enough to get to our country 
and claim refugee status that part of the reason-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> I rise on a point of order, Madam 
Speaker. Simultaneous interpretation is not working.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We will look into the 
problem.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The interpretation is not working. We will wait until it comes 
back on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, 
could I please have the time to rephrase my question?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Thank you, Madam 
Speaker. I want clarification on the issue of women and children 
as victims of violence.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	If a mother and child come to this country and in claiming 
refugee status they claim that one of the reasons they want to 
stay here is because they are victims of violence, if they have 
categorical proof that they are victims of violence, is the hon. 
member suggesting that we should deport them back to that 
violent situation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> I thank the hon. 
member for his kind words about my address. As to his question, 
I think there is a bit of confusion. What he is trying to indicate is 
on an individual basis. I was suggesting that if there is 
something in the culture of a third world country which needs 
changing, we should be trying to change it over in that country 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="666"> 666 </A></B>
<P>
and not sending a message to all third world countries that these 
types of  things will provide an open door policy for people to be 
granted refugee status in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> To clarify a point, this 
is a very serious issue. In the last Parliament the issue of 
violence against women and children was something I spent a lot 
of time on.
<P>
	Let us say a mother from Trinidad has provided categorical 
proof, whether it is sworn affidavits or telephone messages, has 
given concrete evidence that she has been threatened by her 
husband and if she were to return she might not only be a victim 
of violence but possibly murdered. Is the hon. member 
suggesting that in any way, shape or form we should consider 
deporting that woman back to Trinidad?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> What I was 
suggesting is that if it is the sole criterion for granting the 
refugee status and the hon. member mentioned in his initial 
question if it was part of the refugee process of seeking asylum. 
It is a different thing if that is the only criterion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have a question for the member for Prince 
George-Peace River. I very much appreciated in his speech the 
way he mentioned his concern for the people in his riding. He 
also recognizes the enormous human resources contributed by 
those who supported him during his campaign. Here is a man 
concerned with human resources and I would like to ask him the 
following: Does he believe in a Pan-Canadian employment 
policy with the same criteria from St. John's, Newfoundland to 
Vancouver Island?
<P>
	If you compare, for example, his riding to mine, 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, there are important 
differences; working language, training, industrial structure and 
manpower mobility. Could he tell us if he believes a 
Pan-Canadian full employment policy can be efficient and 
implemented properly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, the time for 
questions and comments has terminated. Resuming debate, the 
hon. member for Wetaskiwin. The hon. member on a point of 
order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to ask the member 
for clarification. Unfortunately, I do not recall the name of his 
riding and it has already taken up a bit of time. Would it be 
possible to have an answer to my question?
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I cannot allow it. The 
question and comment period is definitely over; indeed it has 
gone on too long.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin):</B> Madam Speaker, let me 
say how pleased I am to participate in this debate on social 
programs. I would like to commend the minister for embarking 
on a path of consultation through the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development that will allow Canadians the 
opportunity to express their opinions and suggest ways of 
improving social programs.
<P>
	My colleagues before me have addressed some of the 
problems with the traditional income security program. I want 
to speak today about health care and health care spending.
<P>
	Let me make it clear at the beginning that the Reform Party 
favours the preservation of adequate health services for 
Canadians. We believe that no Canadian should be denied health 
care for financial reasons.
<P>
	The current level of federal funding should be maintained but 
we in the Reform Party believe that the time has come to make 
health care users more accountable and more aware of the actual 
costs of health care. How do we do this?
<P>
	The Alberta government's public round tables on health 
summary entitled ``Starting Points, a Recommendation for 
Creating a More Accountable and Affordable Health System'', 
dated December 1993 recommends: ``Other consumer education 
concepts should be considered to dispel the myth of free health 
services. For example, receipts could be provided to consumers 
immediately after receiving health services''. This in my 
opinion would let consumers know what these services cost.
<P>
	Under the Federal Provincial Fiscal Arrangements and 
Established Programs Financing Act or EPF as it is commonly 
known, the Government of Canada provides funds to the 
provinces to support and administer health services and 
education. The 1994 federal spending booklet states that the 
1992-93 EPF transfers amounted to almost $16 billion for 
health care. Ten years ago the total EPF entitlement for health 
care according to the Department of Finance was $8.7 billion. It 
has nearly doubled in 10 years.
<P>
	One would assume that the provinces would have the sole 
right to determine how to provide health services to the people. 
This is not the case. The previous government passed the Canada 
Health Act in 1984, eroding traditional provincial rights. In 
1987 all of the provinces complied with the criteria and 
conditions set out in the Canada Health Act. This was necessary 
if they were to receive their EPF funds.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="667"> 667 </A></B>
<P>
	What did the provinces give up? They gave up all rights to 
charge for health services. We believe that the provinces should 
have sole jurisdiction over the administration of health care. 
The provinces currently possess the legal and constitutional 
responsibility to provide health insurance and services. Federal 
funding and support of such insurance and services should be 
unconditional and should recognize different levels of economic 
development in the provinces.
<P>
	In 1991 total health care costs amounted to $66.8 billion. Put 
another way that is $2,470 for every man, woman and child in 
this country. Of every dollar spent 72 cents came from 
government revenues with the remainder coming from private 
insurance plans and individual taxpayers. We spent 10 per cent 
of our gross domestic product on health care in 1991. Compare 
that to 7.2 per cent in 1975.
<P>
	Why have costs escalated so dramatically? Is it possible there 
is more illness or is it possible there is some abuse of the 
system? We do have a larger population and I am happy to say 
that people are living longer. We also have more doctors and 
more hospitals. In 1979 the patient-doctor ratio was 656 to 1. In 
1989 the ratio dropped to 515 to 1.
<P>
	We do have better access to health care but does this allow an 
opportunity for abuse? Is it reasonable to ask the Canadian 
taxpayer to pay for unnecessary hospital procedures, 
unnecessary surgery or prolonged hospital stays? Is the average 
Canadian aware of what these services cost or even the cost of a 
visit to the doctor?
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	It is interesting to note that in the last fiscal year interest on 
the national debt amounted to some $40 billion or 24 per cent of 
government spending while transfers to the provinces amounted 
to 18 per cent of government spending.
<P>
	Imagine how much easier our jobs as members of Parliament 
would be if there was no national debt. For one thing we would 
not have those exorbitant interest payments to make. For 
another, we would not have to consider spending restraints for 
health care and social programs. That would leave us more time 
to deal with other pressing issues. In reality we are saddled with 
a $500 billion national debt and we cannot continue to live 
beyond our means.
<P>
	Health care is threatened because of the current financial 
crisis and the effects of 20 years of deficit spending. The 
government has an option: return the rights and responsibilities 
of administration of health services back to the provinces where 
it belongs.
<P>
	What effect will the foregoing have on our youth? What will 
they inherit? We have mortgaged the future of our youth. Canada 
has an aging population and the income support programs that 
those people have come to rely on are debt ridden. We cannot 
pay for them now. Therefore is it fair to expect our children to 
carry the burden of our extravagances?
<P>
	The best inheritance we can leave our young people is a 
country free of debt, a country where they can obtain training 
and education so they can become contributors to Canadian 
society.
<P>
	The Canadian youth service corps announced in the throne 
speech, according to the Red Book, will teach 10,000 young 
people a year work skills and provide them with valuable 
experience by engaging them in social and environmental 
programs that will improve the quality of life in communities 
across the country.
<P>
	This program is estimated to cost $10,000 for every 
participant. I hope this is not just another glorified grant project, 
another stop gap measure. What real training will there be for 
the participants? What skills will they learn that will land them 
real sustainable jobs?
<P>
	I was pleased to note that the motion before us today places 
time limits on the deliberations of the Standing Committee on 
Human Resource Development. We cannot afford to linger any 
longer over these problems. Now is the time for solutions. I ask 
that a meeting of the committee be convened this week so we can 
begin the consultation process without further delay.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to put a question to the member for 
Broadview-Greenwoods.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Your question must be 
for the speaker who has just had the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Very well, Madam Speaker. Then my question is 
for the last speaker. He talked a lot about social issues and a bit 
about human resources, towards the end of his remarks. 
Regarding social policy, he wondered if it would not be better to 
turn over all responsibility in that matter to the provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	My question deals with employment policy. Does he believe 
that a coast to coast employment policy, with uniform standards 
from St. John's, Newfoundland, to Vancouver Island, could be 
efficient when we know that the situation is completely different 
from one place to the next, in terms of language of work, 
training, industrial structure and labour mobility?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Madam Speaker, in my opinion, the best 
employment program is private enterprise, especially private 
enterprise that is not overburdened by taxation. That would be 
the only make work program I would support.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the member for Wetaskiwin on his intervention.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="668"> 668 </A></B>
<P>
	I felt compelled to comment on what he said concerning the 
Canadian youth service corps. The member needs to understand 
that these programs are just that. They are programs. As 
members we have a great opportunity to work with our local 
communities to ensure that the programs considered and used in 
our ridings do provide good quality opportunities for our young 
people.
<P>
	To my mind, that is part of the role of the member of 
Parliament. I would encourage the hon. member to consider that 
just because the government presents these programs, it does not 
mean that the government does not encourage and want the 
participation of all members of this House to make sure these 
programs work effectively and efficiently.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Madam Speaker, certainly we recognize what 
the government is trying to do with their program and we do 
recognize it as a program.
<P>
	My point was that we have 10,000 people at $10,000 each. 
This amounts to a fantastic amount of money. I think we are 
trying to push the chain rather than drag it which is ultimately a 
lot more simple, Madam Speaker, as you will know if you ever 
tried to push a chain.
<P>
	We should be trying to alleviate some of the tax burdens on 
Canadian business and they will provide 10,000 jobs and some 
to boot.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):</B> Madam Speaker, I too 
would like to address the remarks about the youth corps.
<P>
	It seems to me when the member says $10,000 a year, he 
simply sees that as a cost. In the various streams of the youth 
corps, for example, one stream will be sustainable development 
and the environment, another will be community development 
and learning involving young people with training, even 
younger people and less able people. Another one is the 
entrepreneurial stream where young people in the corps will be 
involved with private businesses in the various communities. 
Yet another is the military stream.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member one question. One thing these 
young people are going to get for this modest investment is their 
pocket money and their keep. My point is that we will have 
young people who will have worked in various parts of the 
country so when a position becomes available in Regina, for 
example, if they live in British Columbia, they will be more 
confident in applying for that position. They will learn about the 
country so that they can move around when an opportunity for a 
position arises.
<P>
	This is a very worthwhile investment in young people and I 
would like the member's comments on it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Madam Speaker, here again we are using tax 
dollars to do something that private enterprise can do very well.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific)):</B> 
Madam Speaker, as this is my maiden speech in the House of 
Commons I would like first to take this opportunity to thank the 
people of Richmond, British Columbia, for the trust they placed 
in me on my birthday, October 25, 1993.
<P>
	I am honoured to be serving Richmond and pledge always to 
work on behalf of my constituents. Furthermore, February 10 
this year will mark the Chinese new year of the dog and I would 
like to wish everyone a prosperous, happy and healthy year.
<P>
	Many challenges face us in the upcoming year. One of the 
most important of these is to utilize our most precious resources, 
human potential.
<P>
	As I said throughout the campaign, the best investment we can 
make is to invest in ourselves and our children. For too long 
Canadians from every region and every age group have faced 
unemployment, insecurity and disillusionment because of a lack 
of economic opportunity.
<P>
	That is why the government believes it is important to invest 
in our people, to prepare them to return to the workforce. It is as 
important as creating jobs through fostering economic growth.
<P>
	We believe this begins by better preparing the transition from 
school to the workplace, to provide a constructive outlet for the 
skills and talents of younger Canadians. Canada must become a 
learning society that empowers young people and adults alike to 
constantly upgrade their skills and aptitude.
<P>
	They must be able to meet the future with competence and 
confidence. So far we seem to have no systematic way of 
bringing young people into the working world.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	As the Economic Council of Canada reported in 1992, Canada 
has one of the worst records of school-to-work transition. 
Those leaving school find jobs by trial and error, often wasting 
their own time and society's resources in the process. Of the 
apprenticeship programs that do exist, many are outdated and 
irrelevant in today's high-tech marketplace.
<P>
	In Metro Vancouver, of which Richmond is a part, overall 
youth unemployment is an alarming 13.8 per cent. In fact, 15 per 
cent of males between the ages of 14 and 25 are unemployed. 
This is not acceptable.
<P>
	On October 25, 1993 Canadians gave this government a 
mandate to do something about this serious mismatch between 
today's jobs and the skills of the people who want to fill them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="669"> 669 </A></B>
<P>
	As we stated in our red book, we will work with business, 
labour and provincial governments to provide funding to 
establish relevant apprenticeship programs. Our focus will be on 
such growth areas as information technology, computer 
services, environmental services, and the growing fields of 
medicine and biotechnology.
<P>
	Common occupational standards for training certification 
will be established and set by businesses and labour. Employers 
themselves will create the course work associated with 
industry-driven apprenticeship programs. As a result, these 
programs will be better integrated in the specific needs of 
business. We will also provide funding for job training through 
private and public institutions.
<P>
	As the Minister of Human Resources Development has stated, 
our government is also committed to improving the Canada 
student loans program. We will consider changes to enhance 
short-term aid in collaboration with the provinces and other key 
stakeholders.
<P>
	Our partnerships will not end there. Canadians who have jobs 
also want to improve their skills. They want to be able to earn 
higher wages and achieve economic stability for themselves and 
their families. They seek greater job security and a chance for a 
more prosperous future for themselves and their families.
<P>
	The trend toward ever higher skills requires continuous 
education. Most workers realize they will change jobs several 
times in their lives. More than ever before jobs will require 
higher levels of literacy and numeracy skills, along with more 
technical training.
<P>
	More and more a continuous training and learning culture 
needs to be developed within companies and businesses 
throughout Canada. That is why this government is working 
with business, labour and the provinces to produce joint 
incentives to increase workplace training.
<P>
	This government is committed to economic growth in both the 
short and long term. We are working with the provincial and 
territorial governments for a joint 
federal-provincial-municipal infrastructure program. Besides 
providing much needed improvements to Canada's 
infrastructure, this program will help to stimulate economic 
activity and it will help to get Canadians working again.
<P>
	In another area we will focus on supporting small and medium 
sized businesses to create new employment through business 
networks, better management skills, financing, wage subsidies 
and accessing government services.
<P>
	Our government will work with Canada's financial 
institutions to improve access to capital. A Canadian investment 
fund will be created to help innovative technology firms obtain 
the venture capital they need to become Canada's industries of 
tomorrow.
<P>
	We will also improve training for the owner-managers of 
small business. Our government will develop plans for access to 
information on new technologies and new market opportunities.
<P>
	Jobs for Canadians will come by way of exporting goods. We 
have to look beyond the North American border for trade 
opportunities. We have to look for export markets, for example 
in the Asia-Pacific region, a region with the highest economic 
growth rate in the world, yet it remains a market scarcely tapped 
by Canadian industries.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	This government will focus on building partnerships with 
Canadians to develop markets for our exports around the world 
in order to provide meaningful jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	Social policy reform and creating jobs by fostering economic 
growth are both important to the future of Canada. However, the 
government cannot do it alone. In order to turn the economy 
around, Canadians must be prepared to play a large part.
<P>
	For the sake of Canada, I urge all hon. members of this House 
and all Canadians to be part of this process. If we are, I am sure 
that Canada can be strong and economically sound again.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Madam Speaker, 
thank you for recognizing my riding. I want to thank the hon. 
member who seems to be very much aware of the problems of 
young people. I don't know whether he is as knowledgeable 
about rural ridings.
<P>
	In my riding, I taught at a secondary school and occasionally 
at a CEGEP, where conditions are very bad. People talk about 
urban poverty, and I realize that poverty in urban areas may be 
worse than in rural areas. However, conditions in rural areas 
may be worse, to some extent, because our young people leave 
to go the city, and so we have fewer skills and resources.
<P>
	I had students of 16 and 17 who were very disturbed and had a 
lot of problems. There were cases of runaways and drugs, and at 
one point we had to call in the police. I know the hon. member 
opposite is aware of the problems, but not all members of this 
House know the rural dimension.
<P>
	That is why I would urge him and other members to think 
about what is happening in our schools in rural ridings. We have 
just one CEGEP. There is no university. This means students 
have to leave the area, for instance those from Mont-Joli. 
Amqui only has a secondary school which means that past the 
age of 16 or 17, after their Secondaire V, students have to leave 
town to go to the CEGEP. And of course the college is in Matane, 
so if they want to go to university, they have to leave town as 
well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="670"> 670 </A></B>
<P>
	Is the hon. member prepared to look at conditions in rural 
areas, and does he have any suggestions on how he could help 
our students, our young people overcome these handicaps?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chan:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his question. It provides me with the opportunity to 
expand on what we have seen as the way to solve the problems of 
Canada today.
<P>
	I appreciate the problems in the rural areas, but the hon. 
member does have a lot of richness in his community even 
though he is in a rural area. One of the most important things we 
have in Canada is agricultural products.
<P>
	I had a meeting today with a group from the beef cattle farm 
industry. We are planning to double our exports to the 
Asia-Pacific region, which will be comparable to U.S. exports. 
If we are successful we should be able to double the income for 
beef farms.
<P>
	I find there is a lot of hope for us. There is a lot of potential for 
us. Only when we can explore our potential and make sure of 
expansion in our economy can we transform this into jobs for 
our youth in the rural areas.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	The member talked about a problem with education. With the 
technology of today we could establish knowledge networks 
such that students, the youth in the rural area, could also tap into 
the knowledge resources provided by the government and other 
institutions.
<P>
	Sometimes it is not necessary to go through university in 
order to be a productive Canadian. I recommend the hon. 
member keep in touch with the government to make sure that it 
can be moved to provide the knowledge network required in 
rural areas. While I am from a more metropolitan area, I am also 
sensitive to the hon. member's region but the reason we are 
elected is to represent our regions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to address the motion calling for the 
modernization and restructuring of Canada's social security 
system. I will get right to the point, given we have limited time.
<P>
	I would like to address the two major elements central to the 
motion before us: the need for more public input in public policy 
and the need to change the very nature of our national social 
security net. On the question of public input I want to commend 
the minister on his leadership in encouraging Canadians to 
speak their minds on the issue. It is a very serious debate to all of 
us.
<P>
	In my riding we are organizing to debate social programs and 
human resource development in a comprehensive way. Further, 
the people of Fredericton-York-Sunbury appreciate the 
minister's approach since it gives more legitimacy to our 
efforts.
<P>
	Since last summer we have organized policy groups around 30 
public policy areas, including such areas as health, 
post-secondary education, senior citizens and so on. Each item 
will be examined by interested members of the public as well as 
by stakeholders within each area.
<P>
	Our first public policy forum is slated for February 27. It is 
designed for us to consider solutions to the problems now facing 
our health care system. A session dealing with social security 
will follow. These and all other public policy forums will be 
televised. A final document on our deliberations will be sent to 
appropriate federal and provincial ministers.
<P>
	I applaud all members of the House for the times I have heard 
reference to the need for greater consultation. Let us work 
collectively to see that changes are made here so that sound 
advice we receive back home will find its way to the floor of the 
Chamber before major decisions are taken and not after.
<P>
	The second issue I wish to touch upon is the need for a change 
in emphasis within our social programs. The Minister of Human 
Resource Development spoke of the need to change the way 
programs were designed to meet changing needs and conditions. 
I could not agree more.
<P>
	It is no longer good enough simply to provide financial 
support to unemployed Canadians so that they can subsist with 
the hope that eventually things will get better. Unemployment is 
no longer a cyclical phenomenon. In many parts of Canada and 
among certain Canadians it is systemic, a way of life. I am one of 
those Canadians not prepared to look the other way in the face of 
this national tragedy. The country is too prosperous and the gap 
between Canadians with wealth and those without is too great 
for us to accept the status quo.
<P>
	It is not merely a matter of money. Too many Canadians 
cannot read well enough to advance their own interests or 
improve their employability. Over the long term we have as 
much obligation to address the literacy problem as we do that of 
financial support if we want to offer a better future to the many 
who are chronically unemployed. I welcome the reference to a 
national literacy initiative contained in the throne speech and 
applaud the Prime Minister for his foresight in empowering a 
minister with special responsibility for literacy.
<P>
	Finally I wish to speak for a moment on a need for us to realize 
that we are not all equally equipped to handle change. Nor is 
everyone is a position to be retrained or re-employed. We must 
always remember there are some among us who are now and will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="671"> 671 </A></B>
<P>
remain dependent on the state. In our enthusiasm for reform let 
us not forget to reassure Canadians that our underlying 
philosophy  remains intact. We are not here simply to find ways 
to save money. We are here to improve the system.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	In some cases that may cost money. Training does not come 
cheap. Some health care costs are going to increase because of 
demographics. In some cases entitlements are insufficient to 
meet the needs of poorer Canadians and their children. Fiscal 
reality demands we be creative, but it can never become an 
excuse to become uncaring.
<P>
	One group of Canadians feeling uncertain is senior citizens. 
Many have spent a lifetime planning retirement based on a set of 
rules that now seem less certain. The earth is moving under foot. 
As we contribute to the efforts of the task force looking at social 
security reform, we must not lose sight of the significant 
contribution of Canada's social programs to Canada's standard 
of living for senior citizens. The introduction of programs such 
as the Canada pension plan and old age security programs has 
produced a substantial decline in the incidence of poverty 
among older Canadians.
<P>
	The next decade is going to redefine Canada. We will no doubt 
have to be more creative if we wish to maintain our quality of 
life, but let us not forget the fundamental values of generosity, 
diversity, compassion and justice that have served us all so well.
<P>
	Throughout last fall's campaign candidates who ran under our 
party's banner spoke of balance between fiscal responsibility 
and compassion. With this in mind I am pleased to recommend 
that members of the House support the motion for the 
modernization and restructuring of Canada's social security 
system. I offer whatever support I can to the minister and to 
members of task force.

deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALREVENUE">NATIONAL REVENUE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
January 20, in answer to a question asked by the hon. member 
for Saint-Hubert, the Prime Minister said in this House that the 
whole issue of the action brought by the Minister of National 
Revenue against the federal government of Canada should be 
settled once and for all.
<P>
	However, following question period, the Minister of National 
Revenue made a statement to the media, outside this House, as 
reported on Page B11 of the January 20 issue of <I>The Gazette</I>, and 
I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Obviously I am not the one who can terminate an appeal 
against a victory of mine in the court. The person who appealed 
has to do that''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The following day, on January 21, during question period, I 
asked the Prime Minister if the Minister of National Revenue 
was going to abandon the proceedings before the Federal 
Court-Trial Division, which the Crown had appealed. The prime 
minister told me that the Minister of National Revenue would 
not be getting any settlement from the government.
<P>
	I find particularly strange that neither the Prime Minister, nor 
the Minister of Justice, nor the Minister of National Revenue 
informed the House that the appeal of the lower court's decision 
had been discontinued.
<P>
	My question is really very simple. Is there, still today, before 
any court whatsoever, some kind of proceedings involving the 
Minister of National Revenue and the federal government of 
Canada?
<P>
	Given the openness the Prime Minister once promised us, I 
should be able to get a short and concise answer to my question. 
Could the Prime Minister, the Solicitor General or the minister, 
who is in the House, confirm that the Minister of National 
Revenue has withdrawn his action, and if not, if someone 
intends to ask the minister to fully withdraw his action? In case 
the minister answers himself, I would like to know if the 
complete withdrawal papers were tabled.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister):</B> Madam Speaker, in response to the member for 
Bellechasse, he implied in his question to the Prime Minister 
that the Minister of National Revenue dropped his case, as 
reported at page 151 of <I>Hansard</I>, ``so that he could receive the 
proceeds initially awarded to him''.
<P>
	Nothing could be further from the truth. As the Prime 
Minister noted in his response, the minister had instructed his 
lawyer to drop the case immediately and in a manner that the 
minister would no longer receive any settlement from the 
government.
<P>
	For the member's benefit I would like to read into the record 
the minutes of settlement between the minister and Her Majesty 
the Queen dated January 20, 1994:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The parties hereto agree that the appeal of the Appellant and the cross-appeal 
of the Respondent are as follows:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Respondent, David Anderson, will discontinue the cross-appeal herein 
forthwith.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Respondent, David Anderson, hereby releases the Appellant from any 
claim or obligation pursuant to the judgment of Mr. Justice Strayer dated May 
31, 1993.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="672"> 672 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not think the intentions of the Minister of National 
Revenue could be any clearer.
<P>
	I would also like to note for the record the minister's situation 
before he became a minister of the crown. The suit began when 
the minister was a private citizen and he did not lose his legal 
rights by virtue of his appointment as a minister of the crown. 
This was not a matter of ethics. It was a question of fairness.
<P>
	I would like to read to hon. members an important passage 
from Justice Strayer's ruling of May 31, 1993. In referring to the 
approach of the previous government's treatment of the 
Minister of National Revenue when he was a private citizen, the 
justice said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The approach was not only unfair and coercive from the standpoint of the 
plaintiffs; it was also in my view an abuse of power, in effect amounting to the 
attempted sale of public offices.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In effect these plaintiffs were being asked to pay for their new Order in Council 
appointment by surrendering any claim they might have against the government 
or its officials.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The plaintiff himself obviously was also a victim.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GRAINTRANSPORTATION">GRAIN TRANSPORTATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay-Nipigon):</B> Madam 
Speaker, on January 21 I asked a question of the Minister of 
Agriculture. The purpose of the question was to draw to his 
attention a flagrant abuse of taxpayers' money by way of 
subsidy through the Western Grain Transportation Act.
<P>
	The substance of my question was the fact that we had found 
out the CNR and CPR railways were using taxpayers' money by 
shipping grain into an area for the purpose of gaining a subsidy 
even though the eventual destination was not in that area.
<P>
	Let me give an example. We have found that grain which is 
subject to no subsidy and is for consumption in the United States 
has been transported from as far away as Alberta to the port of 
Thunder Bay, where it is subsidized if the eventual consumption 
is in the United States. Grain has been transported from as far 
away as Alberta to the Lakehead, to the port of Thunder Bay. The 
trains then turn around without unloading the grain, find their 
way back to Winnipeg and points west, and then go down into 
the United States. That is a flagrant abuse of taxpayers' money. 
That is what we were trying to point out to the minister through 
that question.
<P>
	We are trying to say that when we find these abuses in our 
system, we have to step in as a government and stop them as 
quickly as we can.
<P>
	As a result of that abuse I found out over the weekend that the 
city which I represent, the port of Thunder Bay, has not had a 
worse shipping season in the last 31 years as it experienced in 
the year just past.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	When there are abuses and irregularities in the system, it 
means one does not play on a level playing field with respect to 
shipping in this country. By the very fact that we have these 
regulations that set artificial means and  ways in which to ship 
grain in this country so that we do not have an actual cost, then 
the port of Thunder Bay and every port along the St. Lawrence 
Seaway suffers.
<P>
	That was my reason for bringing that to the attention of the 
Minister of Agriculture and to the Minister of Transportation. I 
asked them to review that abuse. To this day I have not heard 
whether they have started to review the abuse or not.
<P>
	Again, please review the abuses under the Western Grain 
Transportation Act and give every port in this country a fair 
opportunity to get into the proper business of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Madam Speaker, the member has 
indeed pointed out a concern about the operation and effects of 
the Western Grain Transportation Act.
<P>
	The previous government put in place and was conducting an 
ongoing review of the WGTA as we know it. I can assure the 
hon. member that our government is continuing those types of 
reviews. It has an ongoing study of the WGTA.
<P>
	The first action that was put in place by the previous 
government was a review by the grain transportation agency of 
the grain transportation deficiencies, which the member will 
agree will address his concern. That report has recently been 
received by the minister and is now being reviewed by the 
department.
<P>
	The other study is on the method of payment of the so-called 
Crow benefit, which in that study group is called the producer 
payment panel. That report is expected to be received by the 
minister a little later this spring.
<P>
	The government will be interested in the results of these two 
studies, improving grain transportation and the efficiencies in 
the grain transportation system in western Canada.
<P>
	I want everyone in the House to note that this government is 
not bound by the recommendations or reports of the two studies 
that were put in place by the previous administration. But we 
will be reviewing and observing those recommendations and 
taking them into account as we make ultimate decisions as far as 
the future of grain transportation in western Canada is 
concerned. We will also be conducting other consultations as to 
the efficiencies and effectiveness of grain transportation and act 
in the best interests of the industry for all of Canada.

am disappointed to see that the Minister of Agriculture is not 
here today to answer my question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order, please. It is 
customary in this House not to mention the absence of ministers

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> It is a new rule that I just learned. I 
apologize.
<P>
	On January 24, I asked the following question of the Minister 
of Agriculture:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Can we now conclude that the minister is still trying to protect supply 
management while he is currently negotiating with the Americans the complete 
abolition, in the next seven years, of tariffs on yogurt and ice cream?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister replied, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In whatever discussions we may have with the United States the interests of 
those producers will be front and centre in our thinking.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He also said: ``Again I assure the hon. member and all farmers 
that the interests of Canadian agriculture in all parts of this 
country are very much on the top of the government's mind.''
<P>
	He obviously did not answer the question and negotiations 
with the United States have since ended without the matter being 
resolved. Therefore, it seems to me that we have the right to 
know more about the negotiations on yogurt and ice cream.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	But first, to answer the minister's question, I will remind him 
that there is no mention of agriculture in the throne speech and 
that the Prime Minister himself seems not to know and to 
misunderstand agriculture, judging from comments he has made 
lately and the fact that he did not intervene in the crucial stages 
of the GATT negotiations-in fact, he was on holidays at that 
time-and so far, he has not done anything. He said nothing on 
behalf of farmers during crucial negotiations that were held 
recently, last week in fact, while the President of the United 
States spoke many times to defend American wheat producers. 
Therefore I would say that the comment of the Minister of 
Agriculture, to the effect that the vital interests of Canadian 
agriculture in all parts of this country are very much on the top 
of the Liberal government's mind, has no foundation 
whatsoever.
<P>
	To go back to the point I raised in my question and to which 
the Minister did not answer, now that negotiations have been 
completed, it should be possible to get some clarification 
because farmers, particularly in the dairy industry, are worried 
since it seems that the government of Canada and the Minister of 
Agriculture are knuckling under to American pressure.
<P>
	Can he tell us today, since the GATT takes precedence over 
NAFTA, that he will fight for the tariffs already put forward to 
protect ice cream and yogurt in Canada, i.e. 326 per cent for ice 
cream and 279 per cent for yogurt? Will the government of 
Canada keep fighting for these tariffs for those two commodities 
in Canada? And will they try to settle this issue by appealing to a 
panel with the Americans so that we get some clarification and 
some peace for farmers in that industry?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure 
to respond to the hon. member's concern.
<P>
	There have been bilateral negotiations on agriculture and 
agri-food trade between Canada and the United States for the 
past several weeks, and I would like to assure and clarify to the 
hon. member that those negotiations are not completed and are 
still ongoing.
<P>
	Many rumours have been spread about what is under 
discussion and what the outcome might be, and I stress they are 
rumours with respect to the commodities being discussed.
<P>
	I would like to say clearly that the government is working to 
defend the interests of Canadian agriculture in these 
negotiations and that all sectors of agriculture and agri-food 
production in all parts of Canada are being considered and are 
being addressed with high priority.
<P>
	There are a number of outstanding agri-food trade problems 
with the United States dealing with a number of commodities, as 
we know. The minister attempted to settle these in a bilateral 
framework in Geneva in December, but time did not allow the 
concentrated and detailed effort that was needed. Unfortunately, 
the situation was too hectic at that time, but of course 
negotiations have continued. That also did not mean that these 
problems went away.
<P>
	The minister met again with his U.S. counterpart on January 
8, and negotiations have been and are still continuing.
<P>
	I want to state clearly that Canada will not trade off one 
commodity against another. Negotiations for each commodity 
are taking place on their own merit and are self-contained.
<P>
	In this context we should recall that a GATT panel in 1989 
ruled that Canada's import quotas on ice cream and yogurt 
products were not consistent with article XI. Canada accepted 
that finding and sought to reach an agreement and a solution to 
this problem in the course of a bilateral trade negotiation.
<P>
	The government is seeking a solution that will provide 
stability for Canadian dairy farmers, producers, and processors.
<P>
	I wish to underline that the government's only priority is an 
agreement that is in the interests of Canada.
<P>
	The government remains committed to ensuring that our 
supply management system can continue to operate effectively.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	The government also remains committed to ensuring that we 
have the best possible access to U.S. markets for products we

export there. We will carefully examine any proposed 
settlement with the U.S. against these commitments.

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing):</B> 
Madam Speaker, on January 25 I asked the Minister of Human 
Resources Development a question that goes to the core of his 
government's commitment to job creation.
<P>
	I asked him about the setbacks that the job creation strategies 
had received as a result of four major government policies in 
particular, which will serve to do nothing but cost Canada jobs: 
the accession to NAFTA; the increase in UI premiums for 
employees and employers; replacing John Crow at the Bank of 
Canada with someone with the same frame of mind, with a mad 
obsession about inflation; and chopping $300 million from the 
UI training fund. We have also seen the Minister of Finance 
going across the country focusing mostly on listening to people 
who argue for cutting expenditures rather than arguing for any 
real commitment to jobs.
<P>
	The only way in which Canada will create jobs is to have an 
holistic approach to it in which trade, fiscal and monetary 
policies all ensure that job creation is the number one goal.
<P>
	Today we are talking about social programs. It is clearly 
useful to have active social programs whereby people who do 
not have jobs receive training, help with literacy, and so on.
<P>
	The minister would know, and indeed the government would 
know, that the research on active social programs in terms of 
solving the job crisis shows that we can only expect very modest 
gains in employment from that because the main problem is that 
we simply do not have jobs for people, no matter whether they 
are trained or not.
<P>
	The minister gave a rather odd response to my question. He 
said that we need to give real incentive to millions of Canadians 
to find a job and give real dignity to their lives. Canadians do not 
lack dignity and they do not lack initiative; they lack jobs and 
hope.
<P>
	It is odd and perhaps it is as clear here as in anything else, why 
the government is not focusing on job creation. I think we have 
five policy debates of a general nature, ensuring that all 
members of Parliament can communicate their views to the 
government on specific matters of policy. Today we had a debate 
about social policy, but we have had no debate, and we 
apparently will have no debate, about job creation. If that is the 
number one goal of the government, I presume that is where we 
would focus.
<P>
	We have heard much too, in particular from the Reform Party, 
about the importance of the private sector creating jobs. No one 
would doubt that most jobs are in the private sector, that most 
jobs will be created in particular in small and medium-sized 
business.
<P>
	We have had governments that have been particularly 
favourable to business over the last years in Canada, in 
particular in my province of Saskatchewan where businesses 
were given practically everything they wanted. Social programs 
were slashed; we ended up with a bigger deficit, with more 
unemployment and with more misery.
<P>
	Those policies will not work, not because we do not want 
them to work, but they will not work because the private sector 
is not in the business of creating jobs. The private sector is in the 
business of creating profits. If there is a conflict between job 
creation and profit, they of course will choose profit, as it is 
their objective.
<P>
	So we have a conflict here between a government, 
representing the people of Canada, that needs to create jobs and 
the private sector, which will if they can make profit without 
creating jobs. If they need employees in order to create profit, of 
course they will hire them, but if they can do without those 
people, they will. Indeed, any CEO's report across the country 
that anybody wishes to read will argue with pride that the reason 
for their improved profit picture is because they have in fact cut 
their work force.
<P>
	I ask the government to focus on job creation as its number 
one objective. That is the only way that we will reduce the 
deficit in Canada. We can do it two ways. When people make 
money, they buy the things they need. They provide their own 
services. They do not have to rely upon government programs to 
do that. It is not dignity and it is not initiative these Canadians 
lack; it is jobs.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would first like to point out to the hon. member that 
the government's number one priority is job creation. It is for 
this reason the government has introduced an infrastructure 
program which will generate thousands of jobs for Canadians. It 
also for this reason that we have moved very quickly toward the 
establishment of the Canadian youth corps for our young people.
<P>
	It is another reason why we have put most of the tools dealing 
with job creation into a single portfolio, namely the human 
resources development portfolio.
<P>
	I would also like to point out to the hon. member that he 
should be a bit cautious about throwing figures around, 
particularly when it comes to training. I am speaking of such 
numbers as the $300 million cut in training. In fact, our actual 
expenditure on training will be the same as last year. As the hon. 
member himself suggests and then proceeds to disregard, we 
need to look at the big picture.
<P>
	Training and job creation efforts need to be balanced. Many 
UI recipients need training but they also need jobs once they are 
finished. It is why, as mentioned earlier, we launched the 
infrastructure program where people throughout Canada; the 
east coast, the province of  Quebec or Ontario or British 
Columbia, will be benefiting greatly from this program.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="675"> 675 </A></B>
<P>
	Furthermore the Minister of Human Resources Development 
outlined this morning how we intend to proceed to rebuild the 
social security, labour market and learning framework of our 
country. This is at the core of job creation. By renewing and 
revitalizing the social security system we will be providing the 
right opportunities for Canadians to get jobs. We cannot 
stimulate employment if our systems do not reward effort and 
offer incentives to work.
<P>
	The social security action plan will also propose clear options 
for redefining and redistributing work to ensure that more 
Canadians have jobs.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The motion to adjourn 
the House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly 
this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at ten o'clock a.m. 
pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.26 p.m.)
<P>
