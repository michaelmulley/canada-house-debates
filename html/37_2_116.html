Art Eggleton (York Centre, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Chabad Lubavitch which is the world's largest network of Jewish educational and social service institutions. The Chabad movement was founded in the 18th century in the Russian city of Lubavitch.  The word Chabad is an acronym for the Hebrew words for wisdom, understanding and knowledge, representing a philosophy of life that integrates the spirit of humanity with the physical reality of the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chabad is a worldwide movement with 3,000 branches in almost 50 countries on six continents. Chabad operates  schools, youth centres, social agencies, summer groups, soup kitchens, medical clinics, and non-sectarian drug rehabilitation centres.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time, more than 100,000 children are being educated in Chabad schools. Chabad houses serve as a home away from home for college and university students. They offer food for the body, nourishment for the soul, and non-judgmental advisers always willing to listen.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, I acknowledged 20 recipients of the Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal from my riding of Okanagan—Shuswap who contribute to the community and society as a whole.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I was pleased to hear that the Kindale Development Centre in Armstrong which provides services to about 90 mentally challenged clients received a donation from Sun Country Cable, a donation that will enable the centre to continue its work in our community. Sun Country Cable donated the building. This building is next to Kindale's existing facility and both properties will eventually lead to construction of a new centre. In the meantime, the building will be used for training and respite suites.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to be part of a community that looks out for those less fortunate. Charity does begin at home.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to share some of my concerns about the recent decision by Société Radio-Canada to cancel its late evening sports news.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am worried, because last year this crown corporation had also decided to stop  broadcasting the Saturday night hockey games, <i>La Soirée du hockey</i>. Happily, that decision was reversed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Société Radio-Canada has a goal and a duty to reflect Canadian society. The late evening sports news is the only cross-Canada sportscast in French. Its impact is very great, not only in terms of professional sport, but also for everyone involved in amateur sports, especially the athletes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in the name of all my hon. colleagues in the Quebec Liberal caucus, I ask Radio-Canada to review the file, reconsider its decision, and maintain the service.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, history is alive and well in the city of Kingston, Ontario. On June 15, Kingstonians will gather together with family and friends in their city to  celebrate First Capital Day. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that day in Kingston in 1841, Governor General Lord Sydenham opened the first Parliament of the United Provinces of Canada. Eventually, Kingston's insufficient number of office buildings forced Parliament to move to Montreal, where it opened on November 28, 1844.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 160 years later, both the provincial and the federal governments have officially recognized Kingston as the First Capital of Canada. Thanks to the hard work of Mr. Ian Milne and Dr. Margaret Angus, the founders of First Capital Day, the occasion of Kingston's choice as Canada's first capital has been marked with much celebration for the past five years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of myself and the member for Kingston and the Islands, I would like to congratulate Kingston for this celebration, and invite all Canadians who take pride in our heritage to come and join in the festivities at Canada's historic first capital on June 15.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Chabad movement was born in Russia more than 200 years ago. Chabad worked to keep Judaism alive under oppression during the czarist and communist regimes. When the Soviet Union crumbled, Chabad emerged  from underground. Its work continues throughout the former Soviet Union where it has established some 200 institutions for Jewish outreach and humanitarian aid.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 72 Chabad centres in Canada. There are  37 centres in Quebec, 21 in Ontario, eight  in British Columbia, two in Alberta and Manitoba and one in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. These centres serve the needs of Jews no matter what their level of knowledge or observance. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few weeks ago for the first time ever, Chabad organized a reception here at the House of Commons commemorating the Jewish festival of Purim.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision and leadership for this vast network of activities and services was and is the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn of blessed memory.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  the decline of the stock market over the past several years has caused investors to become more wary of the advice they receive from their investment advisors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many are surprised to discover that investment advisors are paid sales commissions by fund companies to sell their products to their clients and later keep them from selling those investments.  These commissions and higher ones  paid to sell private placements represent a conflict of interest that investors need to be aware of.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for national standards to protect investors from commission-driven advice by requiring brokers working for federally regulated financial institutions to report to their clients the commissions they receive for recommending and selling investment products.  Transparency and full disclosure are essential to restore the investor confidence that our economy urgently needs.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, a few weeks from now, thousands of Quebeckers will be moving to a new home. But this year as last year, many families in Montreal, Quebec City, Gatineau and elsewhere will find themselves without housing, on the street. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1994 and 2002, the federal government deprived  inadequately housed Quebeckers of approximately 40,000 units of social housing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government must be reminded that nearly 1 million Quebeckers are inadequately housed, either spending too high a portion of their income on housing or living in substandard and often unsanitary housing. Statistics Canada reports that in 2001, nearly 218,500 households in Quebec    were spending some 50% of their income on rent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, hundreds of families and  individuals are already homeless, the vast majority being too poor to afford housing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the worsening crisis, the Bloc Quebecois asks that the federal government urgently make funding available for social housing. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois is pleased to  celebrate the life and work of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, “the Rebbe” as he was affectionately known.  Born in Nikolayev, Russia, on April 18, 1902, or 11 Nissan 5662, the Rebbe survived the Nazi regime and fled to the United States in 1941.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was definitely one the most influential Jewish  figures of the 20th century. The Rebbe was no doubt among those who fostered the awakening of the Jewish collective consciousness following the Holocaust. In 1950, he assumed the leadership of the Chabad movement and guided it toward international outreach. He has been described as an accomplished scholar,  statesman, administrator and teacher.

	Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Labour Congress National Women's Conference has once again succeeded in focusing attention on issues of vital importance to Canadian women.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conference studies show disturbing trends in women's employment that clearly point to the abysmal Liberal record on helping women gain an equal footing in the workforce.  The earnings gap between men and women actually grew between 1997 and 2002, with women earning only 63% as much as men on average.  Women of colour earned even less.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The percentage of women working full time has dropped from 51.6% in 1995 to 44.5% in 2002, even though a quarter of women working part time would prefer to work full time. Many are pinned down by the Liberal failure to bring in a meaningful national childcare program, as are many unemployed women.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The percentage of women in low paying jobs has also risen to 31.5%, with the majority still in clerical, sales or service jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's unions are fighting hard to improve this disgraceful record.  When will the Liberals put women's equality back on their agenda?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, on the day the Liberal government is forcing through a new law on election financing, the minister responsible for ACOA has already a unique way to get around the rules.  He just mailed out a letter asking constituents to send money to help celebrate the 1000th anniversary of Viking settlements in Newfoundland and to send all cash to his home address where he promises never to issue receipts or account for the spending.  For that matter, no public events will actually be held but what the heck, those are just details.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not only did the minister's fundraising activities violate the new political financing act,  they make a mockery of this new ethics package that the Liberals are ramming through the House today as well.  Rules look good on paper, but they really only work for honest people.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, that  is completely irresponsible. The Siyay is performing very well.  It is a reliable craft.  It will serve the people very well for a long time.  I have been working closely with the member for Richmond who wants to ensure that we have a second hovercraft there to help in the security of the people.  We will continue to do that.  We will get a temporary craft and we will start plans immediately to build a new replacement hovercraft.</p>

Elinor Caplan (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, this is in reply to a point of order that was raised by the member for St. Albert  and refers to the funding of relief for the home heating expenses program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2000, the government confirmed through an order in council that it would provide  ex gratia payments to individuals and families as a relief for heating expenses.  The eligibility to receive the payment would be determined similarly to the eligibility for the goods and services tax credit, with some exclusions for dependants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is the case for the goods and services tax credit, the eligibility is founded on the information contained in the income tax and benefit returns filed under the Income Tax Act, in this case the returns for the 1999 tax year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure fairness to all Canadians, payments after 2000-01 have been required for: all eligible Canadians filing a 1999 tax return; Canadians whose 1999 tax returns were reassessed and are now entitled to the payment; or eligible Canadians whose addresses were invalid at the time of the initial issuance of the payment and were subsequently updated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the RHE payments were made as ex gratia payments and charged to CCRA's Vote 1 operating expenditures, as approved by Parliament each year.  The ex gratia payments do not require specific parliamentary approval or authority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funds for the program were appropriated by Parliament and placed in the CCRA Vote 1 operating expenditures through two Governor General's Special Warrants.  No administrative or other limitations were placed on any of these funds other than the requirement to use them for operating purposes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection 30(2) of the Financial Administration Act deems the Governor General's Special  Warrants to be an appropriation, in this case to CCRA's Vote 1 operating expenditures.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection 60(1) of the CCRA act provides authority to carry forward its unused Vote 1 appropriations into the following fiscal year, and these carry-forward funds are the first ones to be used in any subsequent fiscal year, pursuant to subsection 7(2) of the Appropriation Acts. As mentioned earlier, the only limitation is that these funds had to be used for operating purposes.  All ex gratia payments made by CCRA for the relief  for heating expenses were properly charged in each year to general Vote 1 operating expenditures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, CCRA had the necessary authorities to make the RHE payments, both in terms of an order in council for ex gratia payments and the necessary appropriations approved by Parliament. In addition, there is no basis to reduce the CCRA's main estimates as Parliament has already agreed that CCRA may carry forward its unused appropriations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for the opportunity to respond, Mr. Speaker.  I have tabled my statement, in both official languages, with the Clerk.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am presenting a dissenting report and will be discussing this in full at the National Press Club theatre in a very short period of time, but I want to make particular note of the input of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned Mr. Roger Davies, who was a tireless volunteer.  He presented to the committee in March 2002.  Unfortunately he passed away last summer and so he will never see this report. I would say that I would like to dedicate it to him, except that he and I had some pretty significant differences of opinion on this kind of issue, but I do want to acknowledge that Mr. Davies, along with all of the other people who came before committee, gave us so much to chew on and so much good information.  I wish to thank all Canadians for their participation in this report.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, this private member's bill is my own initiative.  Frankly, it is my response to this government's approach to gun control via Bill C-68 and the registry.Currently the Firearms Act says that if in the past five years a person has committed a violent crime and has  been convicted of a violent crime or of threatening to commit a violent crime, that person cannot apply to own a firearm for five years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My private member's bill  does not say after five years: it says if a person has ever committed a violent crime in their life never does that person get to own a gun. If a person has ever beat his wife or ever committed rape or ever committed murder and is released from jail, never in his life does that person get to own a gun in Canada. This is effective criminal justice and this is something the Liberals should put into law.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to participate in the debate at third reading on Bill C-24, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Income Tax Act (political financing).</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key elements of this bill  are the result of a tremendous amount of consultation. An important part of the consultation process occurred during the hearings of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.  The committee heard from some forty witnesses representing a wide spectrum of political parties, interest groups and individuals. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my remarks today, I would like to focus on the key changes that have been made to the bill, all of which I believe have improved the legislation, while at the same time respecting the fundamental principles of this important initiative. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I move forward to examine some of these changes, I think that it will become clear that not only have those principles been respected, but that the government has also been very sensitive to the concerns of political parties and individual members. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of disclosure, I believe the discussion to date has clearly shown that there is a great deal of support for the extension  of disclosure requirements to electoral  district associations, leadership contestants and nomination contestants.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, apart from the supporting commentary, the comments on the disclosure provisions have come from two different directions. Some have argued that the provisions do not go far enough, while others feel the provisions place too much burden on political participants</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that, with the amendments, we have been able to address both of these concerns to a certain extent, while at the same time maintaining what are very reasonable requirements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, the bill now requires that political parties who receive the quarterly allowance would have to submit a quarterly report on the contributions they receive. This obligation would not come into force until January 1, 2005, to allow parties some time to gear up to this further requirement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there have been a series of significant changes, which I believe will go a long way to appeasing concerns about the increased burden.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, for very small donations, parties would not be obligated to provide receipts. Initially, the bill had proposed that all contributions of $10 or more would have to be receipted. Now, when parties have fundraisers where they pass the hat, no receipt would be needed for donations up to $25. I would like to thank the member for North Vancouver for his work in the drafting of this motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the threshold beyond which nomination contestants would have to file a report on contributions received or expenses incurred has been increased from $500 to $1,000. This change reduces the administrative burden imposed on nomination contestants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill has also been amended to simplify the registration rules for electoral district associations following a redistribution process. Existing registered electoral district associations would be able to continue their existence in a new district upon the dissolution of their old districts by application of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act.</p>


	<A NAME="T1545"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1545)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pre-registration process would allow other associations to pre-register so that they can come into existence immediately when the representation order becomes effective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, electoral district associations would be relieved from the obligation to report contributions received since the 2000 election, when they register.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limits on contributions from individuals and the prohibition on corporate and union donations form the backbone of the bill's measures, aimed at limiting the perception of undue influence from the wealthy, from corporations and from unions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the hearings, most witnesses made it clear that they felt the $10,000 limit for individuals was too high. The committee ultimately accepted an amendment that would reduce the limit to $5,000. I am confident that in the end the $5,000 limit will provide an appropriate balance between achieving our objective of removing the perception of influence while at the same time recognizing the importance of financial contributions for a healthy electoral system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add that another important amendment has been made to allow candidates to contribute an additional $5,000 to their own campaigns, the idea  being therefore concern about  people influencing government or candidates and so forth, and we do not see the need to be concerned about candidates influencing themselves. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment accepted by the committee provides that leave with pay given to an employee who is running as a candidate would not be counted as a contribution by the employer during the election period. I want to emphasize that it is only during the election period and not before the election period. Furthermore, party membership fees of up to $25 annually would not be considered to be a contribution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the prohibition on corporate and union donations and the $1,000 exception, we have seen a range of views expressed in the past few months. Some have  argued that there should be no limits or higher limits, while others have argued that corporations and unions should be banned outright from contributing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the minister and I have made clear all along, moving the prohibition or increasing the limit would in my view go against a fundamental principle of the bill. At the same time I recognize, as the government does, that the $1,000 exception is important to political participants at the local level.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking everything into consideration, it is clear that we must take the strongest possible measures to ensure that the perception of influence is removed from the system. That can only be achieved through the prohibition. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, there have been some significant amendments made to this section of the bill. Corporations, unions and associations would be allowed to make a second contribution up to $1,000 when a second election was held in the same riding in the same year. Furthermore, corporations, unions and associations would be allowed to make a further $1,000 contribution to a winning nomination contestant when a first contribution was made during that year to a nomination contestant who did not win the nomination contest in that riding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if one person runs for the nomination and loses and a company gives a contribution to that first person and the person loses, there should not be a concern about that first contribution influencing the person who won.  Therefore the ability is there to give a donation also to the winning candidate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to spending limits for nomination contestants, some members indicated the limit of 50% would still be too high to ensure that nomination contests were open and fair to all potential candidates. As a result, the committee accepted an amendment that would see the spending limit reduced to 20% of that limit allowed for candidates in the last election. This should result in a much more level playing field for nomination contest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard a great deal of concern about this issue from witnesses, especially from some of our colleagues in the House, particular those who are women. They felt that allowing large amounts of money to be spent on nomination races too often gave an advantage to male candidates and disadvantaged women candidates. By limiting the spending on nomination candidacies or nomination campaigns to 20% of the limit in the last election should be quite a reasonable limit and should stop that problem in the future, and provide a much more level playing field.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to turn to the issue of public funding which has received the most attention out of all the measures contained in the bill. During the committee hearings, public funding was clearly the key issue for many witnesses, and in particular, the public  allowance. Many witnesses pointed out the important role of public funding and, in particular, the need for ongoing public funding for parties so they could undertake the important work they needed to accomplish in between elections.</p>


	<A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1550)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the public allowance specifically, the discussion was not centred on getting rid of it but rather on different types of formulas that could be used.   The end result of this discussion did not really produce a unanimous opinion on the best formula or on the right level for that allowance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as I have maintained throughout the process, and as the minister has maintained, while one of our key objectives is to eliminate the perception of influence through contribution limits, and the prohibition on corporate and union donations, we must accomplish this in a way that ensures that parties and candidates do not end up losing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ensure that political participants have the funds they need to be compensated for the loss in union and corporate contributions.  Again, we have listened to their concerns and there have been a number of important amendments.  The quarterly public allowance has been increased from $1.50 to $1.75 per year per vote received in the previous general election.   Early in the process members expressed their concern that the allowance was not indexed.  Some were concerned about the level of it and whether it was sufficient.  We listened to those concerns and that resulted in the change in the level.  But also there was a concern about the fact that it was not indexed.  The minister has responded to these concerns and now the allowance would be indexed under the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Receiver General would be entitled to pay part of the public allowance to a party's provincial or territorial association if so authorized by the party leader.  As a transitional measure to assist parties, the 2004 allowance would be paid in a lump sum as soon as possible after the act comes into force.  Parties would be provided with a reimbursement of election expenses at a rate of 60% for the next election only, as a transitional measure.  Thereafter the rate of reimbursement would be at 50% as originally proposed in the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that this will be a substantial change in the way things happen.  Usually, during an election campaign, parties are able to raise a considerable amount of money with fundraising efforts.  In the past, money came from corporations, unions and so forth.  That will not be possible any more so instead we have this process where at the beginning of next year the amount for next year will be given out at the beginning rather than on a quarterly basis which should assist parties with the transition.  As well, we have the 60% rebate for the next election which should help with that transition process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of reimbursement of a candidate's election expenses has been raised from 50% to 60% across in all ridings.  We can all agree that these are significant amendments which recognize the important role played by parties and candidates in our political system.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the important amendments that have been made, I believe we have been sensitive to the concerns that have come forward, and we have acted on them.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like thank the parliamentary secretary for his acknowledgement of my help during some of the drafting of the bill. I would not want that to be interpreted as support for the bill because, in fact, we do not support the bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a shame that  we are not on questions and comments. I would have liked to ask the parliamentary secretary, when he mentioned the important work that parties do between elections that needs to be funded, what exactly is this important work that his Liberal Party does between elections that warrants the transfer of $9.5 million a year to his party's structure, not to the parliamentary wing but just to the administrative arm of his party?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have wanted to ask him that question because frankly I would have difficulty identifying anything that the Liberal Party administrative wing does for anybody in Canada between elections. Frankly, it is going to use the $9.5 million simply to run its offices and keep people on the payroll who are not actually contributing much to the running of the country at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure that this public funding can be justified on the basis of the important work. That is very self serving and it is certainly a judgment of the party itself. I would suspect that if we went out onto the street outside of this place and ask Canadians if they could identify some of the important work that parties do for them between elections, I bet they would not be able to identify a single thing. We may think it is very important, but I am not sure that the average taxpayer would think so. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had been able to ask him questions, I would have asked, what is the unholy rush to push this bill through the House? We barely had this bill back in the House from committee for less than three hours of debate and the government House leader was standing in his place moving time allocation on this bill and closing down the debate. What could possibly be the emergency that would require the closing down of debate in less than three hours? That averages out at less than half a minute of speaking time for every member of this place. Is that reasonable, Mr. Speaker? I think not and I can see you are almost nodding your head, so you probably do agree with me. It is unreasonable to be moving time allocation on a bill with less than three hours of debate in this place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is the bill would not be in force until January 1, 2004. There is a lot of time for further consultation and I will talk about the quality of the consultation of the government side a little later in my speech. There is plenty of time for consultation over the summer break while we are back in our ridings.  We can talk with  average Canadians instead of academics and interested parties or special interests. We could speak with our own constituents over the summer and we could come back here in September with the true message for the government.  That is when we should be continuing the debate and passage of this bill. It should not be rammed through as it will be tonight. We  are adding barely two hours this afternoon.  Frankly, it is a disgrace, Mr. Speaker, and I am sure you feel as embarrassed about it as I do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised that almost all of the members on the government side appear to feel no guilt whatsoever for the fact that they are making a blatant grab of taxpayers' money from the treasury to transfer it to the coffers of political parties. I cannot believe for a moment that average taxpayers would think that was a good thing to do. They would be shocked. I suspect many Canadians do not even realize what is happening with this bill.  They are being asked to pay to vote because when they go to the polling station and cast that ballot, it is as if the poll clerk was asking them to open their wallet, slap down the credit card so that they could put $1.75 on that credit card. That is the effect this bill would have. It would make voters pay for the transfer of money to political parties.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose that taxpayers could protest this bill by not turning out to the polls because if no one turned out none of the political parties would get any money.  In actual fact, this bill could have the opposite effect to the one that the government claims.  It claims that it would reduce taxpayer or voter cynicism and encourage more people into the political process, and get them involved in the voting process. There is a potential for taxpayers to perhaps give us the Pierre Trudeau salute and not turn out at the polls.  Thus they can deprive us of that $1.75 that is going to be transferred.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there was another question I could have asked the parliamentary secretary when he was up, it would have been about the nomination contestant rules.  He mentioned the reporting requirements that would be required now for nomination races. The fact is they are very complicated.  It  would often require an auditor or a special agent.  Records must be kept of all the types of donations, by category and class of donor.  Reports must be filed with the Chief Electoral Officer.  A special bank account must be opened to administer the files, records must be kept,  and bank statements sent to the Chief Electoral Officer.  This is an extremely complicated process.  In fact,  even for those of us who are used to working within a bureaucratic environment, it is quite a daunting piece of legislation when we look at what we would have to go through for our nomination meetings next time around.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the parliamentary secretary claims that it would make it easier for women or any traditionally disadvantaged people to get involved in the race because they have restricted the amount of money people can spend, he completely fails to mention that the increased bureaucracy would turn off a lot of people.  It would actually discourage them.  In fact, I took a section of this bill home with me last weekend to north Vancouver and I showed a few lay people that section of the bill.  I asked them if they would be interested in running for office if they had to do this.  Every single one of the people said that it would be a discouragement to run for office because of the amount of paperwork that would be required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly those who do not have a business background would be further discouraged.  Someone who is used to working as a receptionist and might like to run for office or give it a try would take a look at this and say that what is being proposed in Bill C-24 is an administrative jungle.  It may be too complicated for people to bother. We may be eliminating a number of people from the possibility of running for office who have the sorts of skills that would be useful here, but will not run because they do not have the skills that would enable them to run these complicated bureaucratic reporting rules.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk about the consultation process because the parliamentary secretary mentioned that the key elements of this bill are a result of a great deal of consultation.  The fact is there was virtually no consultation with taxpayers.  I sat on the committee.  In fact, I have been the  Canadian Alliance critic for this bill ever since it was at second reading in this place.  I sat on the committee with the other members, so I saw all of the witnesses who came forward.  I even put forward a list of people to invite.  The fact is the academics and special interest groups who came before the committee were not necessarily representative of average Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last weekend while I was back in my riding I asked a few average taxpayers, friends, and relatives how much they knew about Bill C-24 and whether or not they felt comfortable with the notion of taxpayers' money being transferred to political party coffers. Again, people rejected this notion that it was a good idea to take taxpayers' money and transfer it to political parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the government side says there has been consultation, it was very selective in who it consulted.  It brought in a bunch of academics.  With all due respect to academics, the fact is academics rely on taxpayers for their salaries and many of them have spent their entire lives being paid by the public purse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Geoff Regan:</b> Like the Fraser Institute.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ted White:</b> The parliamentary secretary yells out the Fraser Institute, but the Fraser Institute solicits for donations quite extensively for the work that it does, so I am not sure we can compare it directly with academics.</p>


	<A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1605)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the academics who came before us claimed to know what was good for taxpayers and supported the idea that political parties should be funded by taxpayers, but I am not sure these academics really know what is good for the average taxpayer because they do not actually pay taxes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know many of them would take offence to that by     brandishing  their paycheques and saying “Look, there are deductions there, I do pay taxes”.   However the fact is that professors, publicly paid workers,  people like myself,   members of Parliament in this place, do not pay taxes  because the money  we receive in our paycheques comes out of this big pot of taxpayer money. We take some money out and we put some money right back in. That is not paying taxes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who pay taxes are the private sector workers, the people who create the wealth in this country, and it is the deductions from their paycheques, it is the corporate taxes from the private sector that goes into the big pot from which  we take our salaries. Those are the ones who are paying taxes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these academics come along  and say  that they pay taxes and they think it is a good idea that taxpayer money should be used to fund political parties, I think they have a conflict of interest. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I have always thought it would be a good idea if public sector workers did not pay any taxes at all and were only paid the net amount of their paycheques. Therefore   professors, members of Parliament and public sector workers would only get the pay that comes in their net paycheque. They would pay no taxes and they would not have to file tax returns. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can only think how much money the government would save every year if none of the public servants had to file tax returns because we were not playing this silly game of pretending that they pay taxes when they do not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think   the government's side has consulted with real taxpayers, the people who create the wealth in this country, who actually will  be paying the cost of Bill C-24. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government would have given  us this summer to go back to our ridings and talk to the people in our ridings about the cost of this bill, I think there would have been a huge public uprising against it, and by the time we returned here in September the Prime Minister would not have been able to get his pet project through this place because there   would have been too much public reaction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday, as I mentioned, less than three hours after we had begun this debate, the government House leader was up on his feet moving an end to the debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that Bill C-24 was the brainchild of the Prime Minister. It was clearly for him the most important piece of legislation on the agenda. That is incredible because we have issues like SARS, mad cow disease, youth crime, the definition of marriage and enormous budgetary overruns with the gun registry, into which  we keep finding new amounts of money disappearing but for    which the government failed to tell us.  We also have the issues of   corruption and bribery charges at Citizenship and Immigration, the need to establish a national sex offender registry, which has been dragging on for years and years, and an urgently needed revision of the Indian Act.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of those things were taken off the table so  the Prime Minister's bill, forcing taxpayers to pay for the day to day operations of the political parties, could be rammed through the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill will soon be in the other place.  However,  once it   receives royal assent, the voters of Canada will have been placed in the position of having to pay to vote in a federal election. This will not be handing over cash to the poll clerk at the polling station. They will not have to pony up with their credit cards or open their wallets and bring out a toonie. It will not be by direct payment at the polling station but it will be via a raid on the public treasury by the government subsequent to election day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each and every vote cast, $1.75 will be taken from taxpayers to be shared among the major political parties based upon their percentage of the vote. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What that means, if we use the year 2000 election figures, is that the Liberal Party will receive more than $9.5 million from taxpayers starting in the year 2004 when this bill comes into force.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew:</b> Who will pay for your party?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ted White:</b> I heard a member from the other side ask what the Alliance will get. I am more than happy to tell him. My own party, the Canadian Alliance, on a percentage basis would be one of the biggest beneficiaries because the entire formula for this bill is based upon corporate donations.</p>


	<A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal Party, which   looked at its own corporate donations and realized that it would  lose  those   donations because it was going to ban them,      created  a formula to replace, in fact more than replace,  what it would lose in  corporate donations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the Canadian Alliance has traditionally relied more on individual donations. In fact, our average contribution from corporations, in the five years to the year 2001, was only 25%, whereas the Liberal Party was well up around 60%.  We can see why the formula worked in our favour.  On a percentage basis, we benefit a lot from the bill.  In fact, the Canadian Alliance will receive about $5.5 million.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However  that does not mean we support the bill.  In fact, we have vigorously opposed this raid on the public treasury from the moment   the Prime Minister introduced the draft.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Geoff Regan:</b> How much will you give back?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ted White:</b> I hear  the parliamentary secretary asking  how much we will  give back,   as if that is  even relevant to this discussion. How does that justify a raid on the public treasury to pay the day to day operations of a political party?  How does that justify it?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However  I will answer his question as to whether we will pay it back.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not make the rules of the game and we do not control the rules of the game.  The government side makes the rules and if it thinks  we are so stupid that we will  not play by those rules and  put ourselves at a disadvantage   while it collects $9.5 million and completely cut ourselves off from funding, well, give me a break.  The government  is just grasping at straws trying to justify the position it has taken.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear one of my colleagues talking about the bill being as dumb as a bag of hammers.  There is a misconception out there that Stephen LeDrew, the president of the Liberal Party, called the bill dumb as a bag of hammers.  However he did not actually say that.  What he said was that the concept was as dumb as a bag of hammers. He did not like the idea that there would be no corporate donations. I am pleased to get that on the record.  I am sure it has been very hurtful for the Liberal Party to have its president constantly misrepresented that way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However let me get  back to the transfers from the federal treasury.  The position of the Canadian Alliance is that we believe that special interest groups and political parties should raise the money that they need for their day to day operations from the people they purport to represent.  They should face their membership eyeball to eyeball, explain why they need the money and ask them for the money.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not good enough to simply stand in this place, the way the parliamentary secretary did, and say “Well, parties do important work between elections so we should have $9.5 million a year to do that”, without ever explaining what this important work is.  I am certain there will be plenty of wining and dining on that $9.5 million.  I will  bet there will be a lot of bottles of French champagne cracked open for that one. It will not  be very good at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Geoff Regan:</b> How many at Stornoway?  Tell us  about Stornoway.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ted White: </b> I hear the parliamentary secretary interrupting again and crying out and asking how many bottles of champagne   there are  at Stornoway.  Obviously  I do not have an intimate knowledge of the wine cellar at Stornoway, but I would expect the Leader of Her Majesty's Official Opposition, just as I would expect the Prime Minister, to have an appropriate amount of appropriate liquors, wines and foods for the times when he entertains heads of state and important people from around the country.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of my party has an important job to do as Leader of the Official Opposition and it is entirely appropriate that he have the correct tools to do his job.  Part of that toolbox involves  the wine cellar at Stornoway for  the sorts of events that he might hold.  He  has to interact with the movers and shakers of the business community of the country, with international heads of state and with important people who are interested in the political process and who may want to make representations to him about the way the government is handling the portfolio.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, if the minister over there  or in fact any of the members on that side think they can rattle me by throwing these things at me, they are completely wrong   because I feel perfectly comfortable with the positions  we take on  bills.</p>


	<A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1615)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to get back to  fundraising.  Raising   money eyeball to eyeball from individuals is the way the Canadian Alliance has always done it. We have been  very comfortable with that  and we would have been happy to continue to work under those rules.  Even the 25% average that  we have collected from corporations over the past five years, most of it  was from small corporations giving $1,000 or less, which is the amount  allowed in the bill anyway.  When we look at those small contributions, the $1,000 to $1,100 amounts, they are often from mom and pop-type businesses that  give a corporate cheque because their accountant  only decides at the end of the year whether the money will  go under  their individual incomes or under corporate spending.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was one reason that  our party supported the $1,000 figure for corporate donations, even though, on  principle, we were not opposed to the idea of no political donations. We felt it facilitated individual donations to have that small limit there. I am not sure if it will necessarily stand up to a charter challenge  but, nevertheless, the concept is not particularly offensive to us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned, the Canadian Alliance has always raised its money directly from its supporters.  When I joined the Reform Party back in 1987   it was very small party and it  did not have the benefit of tax deduction status.  We had to  start from nothing    with nothing and within 10 years we  became the official opposition in the Government of Canada. That was a big achievement because a party needs  a lot of passion from supporters behind it to raise the money to achieve that.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am actually very disappointed in the bill that the government did not accept some of the recommendations that  I made to make it easier for small parties to get started.  One of those recommendations was the 50 candidate rule.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has consistently tried to prevent parties from having registered status,   tax receipt status, by requiring them to run 50 candidates in ridings in a general election.  The fact is that when the Reform Party first started we could not do that.  This is unfair.  It penalizes small parties.  The fact  is  that a party needs 12 members for recognition as a party in this place, </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the hearings on Bill C-2, which was the overhaul of the elections act in 1999 and 2000, the  committee, on which I was a member,  had representations from most of the small parties operating in this country, the Green Party, the Communist Party, a whole list of them, and  I had discussions with them.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There actually was a court case in Ontario that ruled that a party was actually two persons and that running two candidates was sufficient.  Even the small parties agreed that was going to the other extreme from the 50 candidates.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our committee  reached an agreement that it should be 12 candidates.  I went to the minister with that and said that in order to avoid any more tax challenges, which have  already cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars fighting a ridiculous fight, why do we not make it    12 candidates.  I told the minister that all the small parties had agreed to that number, that we could be put it into Bill C-2 and the issue would be finished. There would be no more court cases. The minister was absolutely bullheaded and  would not do it.  This fight has continued on and will go all the way to the Supreme Court and cost us an absolute fortune.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-24 gave us the opportunity to revisit the issue.    I tried in vain to get the minister to go back to this and change it to 12 members  but he would not do it.  I cannot help but feel that he has not properly assessed the risk here and that he just does not care about taxpayer money.  He seems oblivious to the fact that he is wasting millions of dollars fighting these battles which he cannot win.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other battles in which  he is currently involved   and one which he cannot win is the one having to do with third party advertising. This is the right, in a free and democratic country, for third parties, that is people outside the political process, to bring up issues and spend money on supporting candidates or issues during election campaigns completely outside  the electoral process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has fought that for at least 15 years.  First it was the Tory Party and now it is the Liberals.  This has been ongoing.  The minister has spent tens of millions of dollars fighting against this third party advertising which the courts keep striking down.  His argument is that because of a ruling in Quebec, which had  to do with the Quebec referendum and that  there should be spending limits on the yes and no side in a referendum and no third party interference,  that this is justification for applying the same rules to an election.</p>


	<A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1620)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that is faulty logic.  A referendum has a yes and a no question on the ballot.  A person either votes yes or no.  There is no other issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a person gives some money to a yes side and some money to a no side to fight the battle leading up to voting day, I think most people, and perhaps all people, would agree it is entirely fair to then exclude third parties from that.  Then it becomes unfair. If we want a fair fight, then we allow the yes side and the no side to fight fairly with limitations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this is applied to an election, an unlimited number of issues  will come to the fore during an election.  Political parties will not bring up the things they do not want to talk about.  Therefore, it is only fair that third parties be allowed to intervene and spend some money on themselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go on, Mr. Speaker,  might I ask for unanimous consent of the House to split my time with the member for Surrey Central.  If there is unanimous consent for that, I will split my time; otherwise I will not.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will go back to talk about the raising of money.  As I said earlier in my speech, we just simply do not believe that political parties should take money from taxpayers.  They should be required to raise the money from the people who they claim to represent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said that we needed the legislation to remove the perception that the Liberal Party was giving lucrative contracts, grants and loans to political supporters, and he is right.  Bill C-24 would remove the perception that these things are not happening because there will not be any corporate donor trails for the Canadian Alliance to follow  to reveal the corruption.  However Bill C-24 would not change the reality of political patronage and untendered contracts being awarded to supporters of the Liberal Party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will still be untendered contracts awarded to friends and relatives.  There will still be payments for reports that do not exist.  There will still be ministerial interference in the approval of loans and grants by government agencies, and it will be almost impossible for us to trace those connections.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister will still be free to make phone calls to the Business Development Bank of Canada and order them to give loans to his friends.  It will not change any of that at all.  The bill is a fraud.  It is an excuse to take taxpayer money and give it to political parties, and it will  not make the slightest bit of difference to the awarding of untendered contracts and improper practices that are occurring daily on that side of the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While all this is going on, it will be taxpayers who will be watching the Liberal government shovelling money out of the treasury and into the coffers of political parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, the Liberals claim they introduced Bill C-24 to deal with the perception that there were problems over there, but there are problems over there.  Many of those problems  are presently with the RCMP for investigation.  The problems were revealed for the main part in response to attacks by opposition parties, particularly the Canadian Alliance, over what appeared to be links between the donations made by corporations and individuals to the Liberal Party of Canada and the subsequent awarding of contracts, grants, loans and special deals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example.  The industry minister recently announced a $60 million handout to two private companies in Ottawa headed by an Ottawa billionaire.  He should be embarrassed to even ask for the $60 million.  A billionaire asked the government over there, the Minister of Industry, to give him $60 million.  He is Terence Matthews, an identified Liberal donor.  He donated $25,000 recently to the Deputy Prime Minister's leadership campaign.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister has claimed that the $60 million awarded to the two companies of Terence Matthews is not a gift, that he expects every nickel to be repaid.  How many times have we heard that.  Unfortunately, the Technology Partnership Canada program, under which the $60 million was awarded, has a less than satisfactory history of success.  It has handed out close to $2 billion but has only been repaid $35 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hard for the average Canadian taxpayer to imagine how the government could have the gall to give $60 million to a billionaire to fund something that he should have funded himself.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the handout was not bad enough just in itself, in return for the generosity, the minister and Technology Partnership Canada have agreed to accept share warrants for a pre-determined number of shares in Mr. Matthew's companies.  Now we are in the share market business with taxpayer money.  The problem is  those shares do not trade on any stock exchange because they are shares in private companies.  Their value will be decided at some point in the future by financial institutions and the government.  It is unbelievable that we give $60 million to a billionaire, then we take shares and we do not even know what they are worth.  It is an absolutely incredible thing.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I figure that if and when Mr. Matthews takes his companies public, which he might do, either we will make some money on these shares or we will lose our shirt.  Either way, we really have no business being in this part of the business.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, my very next sentence was leading up to what all this really illustrates. There are problems on the government side and that is  what Bill C-24 is really about. The Prime Minister is trying to deflect these problems by claiming that there is a perception of problems and that he has introduced this bill to take care of all those problems, but in fact it definitely will not take care of them. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Chair's generosity is appreciated, except  that certain agreements will enable me to share my time with my hon. colleagues in other parties. So, I will be very brief.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I simply want to review some of the arguments made by my hon. colleague who spoke before me. To those  listening who might be outraged by the previous speaker's comments, I would say that it is important to consider the bill before us in its context.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, since 1993, the Bloc Quebecois has been demanding that the House pass legislation to make political party financing democratic. Such legislation exists in Quebec, and all the Quebeckers listening are well aware that this legislation is now part of our legislative heritage and that it is appreciated because it has helped avoid so many excesses with regard to political party financing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as a result of our experience, we have made many recommendations to this House and to the government to encourage them to proceed with this kind of legislation. Today, as I said at second reading, I am pleased to confirm that the Bloc Quebecois supports this government bill, given the positive effect it will have on restoring order to Canada's political mores.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to complain, on the one hand, that political parties will be financed in part using taxpayers' money—it would be hard to get upset with a bill that democratizes funding and prohibits companies from giving $25,000, $50,000, $75,000 $100,000 and more to a political party—and, on the other hand, explain to the public that we do not really agree and  disapprove of the government and the Deputy Prime Minister having received $25,000 or $50,000—I am not sure exactly, but it was an impressive amount—from a billionaire for his leadership campaign.  We cannot have it both ways.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can make the choice in this country to prevent anyone, whether businesses or individuals, from gaining undue influence and control over the political parties. If we do, we must accept the bill before us. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do abuses come from? They come from businesses that in the past, gave $250,000 or $300,000. We have discussed examples of such abuses in this House. We have identified the businesses and major banks that give impressive sums to the government and political parties and who, consequently, have enormous influence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that everyone understands, if I am the president of a large corporation and I give $250,000 per year to the Liberal Party of Canada, the odds are good that if I want to fix some problems politically, I will find a sympathetic ear on the government side. There is nothing strange about that. If someone gives $250,000 per year and has a problem that needs fixing, they will expect  their problem to receive attention commensurate with the amount of their contribution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be understood that this kind of abuse must be avoided. When the citizenry is stirred up with cries of, “Listen, it is going to be awful. Public money will be used to finance some of the expenses of the political parties” and there is a public outcry, we must say that the corollary is that the undue influence exercised by a limited number of people will disappear. That is what will enable the citizens to take control of their democratic institutions.</p>


	<A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1635)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the financing is shared among the general population and is provided in large part from public funds, in accordance with specific rules,    clearly this will give people the influence they thought  they did not have or might not have had when individuals were financing political parties to the tune of $25,000, $50,000, $100,000 or $300,000. It seems to me that that should not be difficult to understand for our listeners,  the members of the Canadian Alliance and the other members of this House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing large donations inevitably results in those making  donations having an influence over the government  which those who cannot afford to make donations  do not have. If large donations are prohibited, the political parties must nevertheless be able to finance their activities. We cannot  turn off the funding tap and at the same time announce that we will not be providing a cent, that political parties are expected to operate with so little funding that it would be tantamount to killing them. Their very existence would be jeopardized.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to take positive action to   ensure that political parties remain healthy and operate relatively at arm's length—everything is relative of course.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is therefore the kind of action we applaud. What the government did here took courage. It could not have been easy. Witness the fact that, within government, there is opposition to this bill. It is public knowledge.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those opposed are probably right in terms of being true to themselves, when they make comments like, “We do not want our own government to  pass this bill because it is taking away too much leeway. We will not be able to operate anymore. What is provided in terms of public funds is insufficient and at the same time we are not allowed to raise money”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is this kind of reluctance coming from the government side about a bill, it generally means that a worthwhile effort has been made. The bill will ensure that from now on, the members of this House, cabinet members and members of  the various parties will  be more independent vis-à-vis large corporations, big labour unions and all sorts of lobby groups which could previously  have strong leverage through financing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who could argue against the principle of democratic institutions becoming more independent? Who could argue against citizens having greater influence over political parties? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to point out that the reality is that the citizens are well served by a bill such as this one.  It will improve political mores.  We will likely no longer have to rise in this House, as we have done in the past, to criticize the government for awarding contracts to firms that hand a large chunk of the money back to the Liberal Party, or other parties in this House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will no longer happen.  It is already no longer happening in Quebec.  The situation was regularized 25 years ago in Quebec.   Everyone is pleased with that way of doing things. The cost of implementing this bill is around $21 million, or $22 million if we prefer a round figure.  In a country the size of Canada, $22 million to ensure independence for political parties, to preserve the quality of democratic representation, strikes me as very affordable.  It seems to me that $1.75 per voter is not a huge sum to ensure that our parties are less beholden to those who provide funds to them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say in conclusion that I believe we are serving our fellow citizens well by voting for this bill. On the basis of principles, it is unassailable when we consider that we are preserving the quality of democracy. It is unassailable considering that the purpose of this bill is to prevent  excessive financing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also extremely important that this bill prevent examples such as those we denounced earlier  of leadership campaign contributions to the tune of $250,000, $100,000 or $25,000, depending on the situation.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a major victory for the Bloc Quebecois because we have been trying to have this type of system implemented here in  the federal government since 1993. This is a good thing that this is happening for democracy in the rest of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no opposition to this bill in Quebec, but in the rest of Canada, in some areas, there is. However, today, we can tell people who are listening that this type of legislation has been very much appreciated for 25 years now in Quebec and in some other provinces where financing rules   are a little more civilized than they were here. We can certainly tell our fellow citizens that we are doing something positive, responsible and respectful of democracy, something that will guarantee that politics will be better in the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we would all like to see is legislation based on honesty, justice and democracy. That is why we are pleased to support this bill and invite all our colleagues in the House of Commons to do likewise.</p>

	<A NAME="Int-604330"></A><a HREF="#Int-604561"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-604323"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a sad duty for me to rise today to speak to a piece of legislation that is being imposed on the people of Canada in the dying days of the spring session of the House. This is one of those bills on which we must all agree in principle but in which we find the real devil in the details.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a previous stage it was my right hon. colleague from Calgary Centre who spoke to  this legislation. He argued, and I agree, that had the government truly been interested in the process of reforming our system of political donations, it would have introduced this legislation in a manner that would have better ensured the full consideration of this great Parliament. Instead we have again  been  rushed in our deliberations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most significant concerns that I have about this legislation relates to the fact that it would put into place a formula by which the amount of money that a political party would receive would be based upon their results in the last election. As my friend, Mr. Irving Gerstein, has said, that would be the same as saying that we would calculate one's next mortgage based upon the value of one's last house.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process would give the party of government a clear advantage over all the rest of the parties in the House and in Canada, even if its popularity had fallen significantly since the time of the last election. If the government of Kim Campbell had introduced this legislation prior to the 1993 election, the current Prime Minister would have opposed it vigorously. He would have said that given the place of the parties in the polls at the time, it would have been grossly unfair to award them funding based upon the results of the 1988 election.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter here that strikes me as being equally unfair. As the legislation currently provides, it will be the tax dollars of the people of Canada that will effectively  be used to fund our political parties. In the past, we have said that people had a democratic choice in Canada. If one had wanted to support the Progressive Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, the Alliance Party or the Bloc, one had the choice to do so as a free-minded Canadian citizen. Now however, we are saying that the Canadian people will have to donate to every political party through their hard-earned tax dollars, even if they would never have supported four or five of the parties in a million years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are saying that the tax dollars of my son, who lives in Calgary, would go to the Bloc, to the Alliance, to the Liberals, to the PC Party, to the NDP. That is not how he feels about this, I can say that. He would pick and choose himself whom he supports. They are saying that Lucien Bouchard's tax dollars would go to the Canadian Alliance. I am sure the Bloc wants that and I am sure he does as well. My tax dollars would go to support the Liberal Party. Mr. Speaker, do you want to ask me if  I agree with that? I can tell you right now  it does not seem very fair to me.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did we lose the freedom of choice in our democracy? When did we give that up in Canada? When did we lose the right to support our political party of choice and only our political party of choice?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the government House leader would argue that all of us who received 15% or more of the popular vote in the last election received a certain refund from the government, but that was based upon the results of that election. The money returned was based upon the costs of that election, not of the 1997 election or even the 1957 election. There was a direct relationship between that rebate and the election at hand. This bill offers something completely different.</p>


	<A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1645)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an issue that I have not heard discussed in this debate prior to today.  It is the power that the bill gives to the Prime Minister and a select handful of people, the power to eliminate with the  stroke of a pen any Liberal association that he wishes.  That is not democracy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a leadership convention taking place on the government side at this point in time.  We know that if we pass the bill,  the Prime Minister can eliminate a lot of the businesses that supported those who are running in the leadership.  That is not right.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section  403.2 allows, on the application of any party leader and two of its officers, the deregistration of one of the party's registered associations by the Chief Electoral Officer. This puts too much power in the hands of party leaders.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that this important issue has been significantly considered by the House.  We should not be making a decision on this at this time.  We should be sitting down and discussing it.  I think that if we went across this nation we would find that Canadians are very upset about the bill.  Canadians do not believe that this is right.  They  never thought that in Canada the day would come when  legislation such as this would be before the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if the Prime Minister wanted to deregister all of the riding associations organized by the member for LaSalle—Émard?  He could do it if we pass the bill.  I cannot believe that anyone sitting on either side of the House could agree to this.  It could be done and certainly we could conceive of it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that the Progressive Conservative Party is very concerned about the bill.  We are very concerned about the fact that it takes away from us our rights that we have had in the past for those people who wish to support my party.  It takes away the rights of people who  feel that some of us do come here to the House of Commons to represent them and our citizens back home.  They feel very strongly that they want to support us. I have to say there are many people who do not  feel that their tax dollars should be coming here and given to the parties in the House of Commons.  That is now how many people see this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are people out there in the private sector who want to support a party.  I am not opposed to the fact that perhaps the Liberal Party gets a whole lot more support than some of the rest of us.  That is the system that is out there.  That is the democratic system that is out there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, passing Bill C-24 and going to all Canadians is not right.  I have stated that I do not think  Lucien Bouchard wants his tax dollars to go to the Canadian Alliance or the PC Party or the Liberal Party.  No, that is not what he wants.  That is the situation with a lot of Canadians. I have used Lucien Bouchard as an example.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am saying I want to see an honest and democratic process in place.  If the Prime Minister feels that what we have had as a process is not fair and just, then there are ways to make changes.  There are amendments that have been put before the House with regard to the bill.  One was  just moved.  I also had an amendment, but  because of the amendment that has been put forward I will not place my amendment on the floor.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say that having spent 10 years in the House of Commons, I really am dismayed that  Bill C-24  is before the House.  I ask that we not  endorse the bill at this time.  I ask that all members go back to the process that we had which was fair and  just, and Canadian.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, first I want to heartily thank the hon. member for Roberval, who is the  Bloc Quebecois House leader, for having allowed the other parties to have a few minutes to speak on Bill C-24.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final moments of this debate I  want to say to   the House leader of the Bloc Quebecois that  I appreciate that he    shortened his remarks in order to give the member for Saint John and me  an opportunity to speak, because of course the bill is  under time allocation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to speak at third reading of  Bill C-24, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Income Tax Act. It is  a bill  that changes how we finance elections and political parties in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We as a political party  have long called for the removal of big money from politics, so we have supported this legislation in principle throughout. Having said that, we recognize and will be pointing out that we still find there is some unfortunate and glaring errors with it, but on balance we believe it allows for better democracy and certainly greater transparency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to  the clause-by-clause proceedings, when the committee on procedure and House affairs was meeting to discuss this in the spring, we heard from more than 70 witnesses. A number of them came forward and said that on balance this is good, supportable legislation. Many Canadians will have read the remarks of Ralph Nader who said that  it is another example of Canada being first and should be quickly emulated in his country, the United States of America. When we see senators running for that institution in the United States, spending $30 million and $31 million to get themselves elected, Americans certainly need to see some urgent reform of their elections act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation goes a good distance toward getting big money out of politics. There has been a lot of big money in politics over the years. In the last election campaign, campaign 2000, the Liberal Party, which was returned as the government, took in almost $12 million from corporate donations. Sixty per cent of the total that the Liberals raised was from the corporate side. They received almost $700,000 from the chartered banks alone, another $100,000 from Bombardier, almost $100,000 from Canadian National and the list goes on. I would not want to lose sight of the fact that the Canadian Alliance, which claims to be the grassroots party, raised $7 million from corporate Canada in that same election campaign.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equation is quite simple, especially when a party is returned to the government benches. The companies hand out big money and they expect something in return. They hand a cheque to the Liberal bagman with one hand and expect to receive a lucrative contract almost immediately with the other. The Prime Minister has admitted as much with his ethics package of a year ago. Indeed, the heritage minister, who is seeking to replace the Prime Minister, has said from her perch within cabinet that  the ratification of the Kyoto accord was delayed in this country because big money does matter and does talk at the cabinet table.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal Party  has been the party of big business. As I mentioned, big business  accounts for  60% of its donations. The situation is somewhat reversed for the New Democratic Party. It is  significantly reversed perhaps because we received 60% from individuals. They are modest amounts in the range of $50 or $100 for the most part. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the financial returns that parties have to post every year, we will see that the New Democratic Party has far more individual donors than any other political party in this country. That will come as a surprise to those who claim that the New Democratic Party is financed only by big labour. We have a long and proud tradition with the labour movement. That is certainly true. When the party was founded in 1961, it was founded on a partnership between the old Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and the Canadian trade union movement. That has remained and it will continue to remain as a partnership, I am sure, once Bill C-24  takes full effect. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour will continue to work with the New Democratic Party and vice versa, but the focus in future I believe will be to encourage union members to become more directly involved in the party and, if they so choose,  to make donations on an individual basis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Democratic Party supports getting big money out of politics.  Our party convention in January instructed us to pursue that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation before us today allows individuals to donate $5,000 a year to a party.  It was set at $10,000, which was reduced.  We would have preferred a more modest amount  of $3,000, which corresponds to the limits that are permitted in the province of Quebec and the province of Manitoba, the two other jurisdictions in Canada that have legislation along these lines, which essentially prohibits corporate and trade union donations from going to political parties.  We would have preferred $3,000, but certainly reducing it from $10,000 to $5,000 is a step in the right direction and  is certainly supportable.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our concern, however, is that if they so choose, people with deep pockets can  donate $5,000  to the Liberal Party and donate another $5,000 to the New Democratic Party or the Alliance or any of the other registered parties.  We would have said that this should be an amount in total, an aggregate amount of $5,000, and  all in and not spread around.  I tend to agree with those who say this is unlikely to happen, but nevertheless it would have been better to close the gate before any chance of the horse getting out of the barn. Overall, this is a good improvement in the Canadian political system, because before this anybody with deep pockets could really have a significant influence on an election campaign and certainly in an individual  election campaign.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned, there is a prohibition on contributions to political parties from corporations and trade unions or associations, but there is a small exception.  This legislation does permit organizations to contribute a maximum of $1,000 annually to the aggregate of candidates, local associations and nomination contestants of a registered party so that all the contributions are combined under the $1,000 limit.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first preference would have been that this not be in  there at all.  We do not think this is required. This is something that was not in the Prime Minister's mind when he floated this bill last fall.  I think it is fair to say that some backbench members of his party were concerned, so this came back as an opportunity for trade unions, associations and corporations to still participate, but  to a much more limited extent than they have been able to heretofore in the political process.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first inclination was to get rid of that altogether.  We were not successful.  Our second suggestion, then, was to level the playing field. We said that if franchised corporations  like Dairy Queen or Tim Hortons, with units owned by different franchisees, if that is the right legal terminology, could each give $1,000 then trade union locals should be able to give $1,000.  However, we have been unable to persuade the members opposite of the wisdom and the good sense of having that level playing field. As a result, unions are considered as one unit for the purposes of donations no matter how many locals they may have, but corporate franchises like Tim Hortons or Dairy Queen or car dealerships are each considered as separate units for purposes of political donations and each of them is able to make a separate $1,000 donation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of all this has been to weight this class of political donation heavily in favour of corporations as opposed to trade unions.  We think that will be proven very quickly when we look at this as the procedure and House affairs committee or some other committee to see the ramifications of Bill C-24. This will stick out like a sore thumb.</p>


	<A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1700)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 16,000 locals in total in national and international unions in this country and the vast majority of them, we believe, will be excluded from contributing to and playing a part in the political process. We have put forward amendments on this, as I have indicated, and they have been voted down by members opposite. To add insult to injury, the House leader said in debate yesterday in this chamber that there is a fundamental difference between union locals and corporate franchises when it comes to exercising local control and independent judgment.  I think in effect he was saying that local businesses have minds of their own and that local unions are simply sheep that follow the edicts of their national or international offices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> That's repugnant.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Dick Proctor:</b> It is repugnant, and as the House leader considers those remarks I think he owes an apology to people in the trade union movement in this country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to the member for Elk Island a couple of days ago on this subject  in debate on the bill. He was expressing his distaste for the fact that as a former member of the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees he had no choice in that some of his dues went to the New Democratic Party of Alberta. He was insisting how unfair that was.  Let me say to that member of Parliament that it was a  decision made by the local union of AUPE at the institution at which he apparently worked in those days.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obverse of that is to suggest that a board of directors at Bombardier, for example, is giving $100,000 of shareholders' money to the political party of its choice. Does he really think there is more democracy in that situation than in a trade union local deciding by a democratic vote of its members at a general meeting which political party it chooses to support? I think the member for Elk Island needs to reflect on that matter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of public funding for elections and between elections, which is an important aspect of the bill, if we take corporate and union money away from parties, as Bill C-24 would do, then some of that money, we believe, has to be replaced.  For the last almost 30 years, individuals have received a tax deduction when they donate to political parties but Bill C-24 would also provide for an annual public grant for parties based on each vote they received in the previous general election.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous proposal, up until last weekend, provided for an annual public allotment to parties of $1.50 per vote, per year, for every vote they received in the previous general election.  Based on the election in November 2000, the Liberals would have received $7.8 million annually, the Canadian Alliance $4.9 million, the Progressive Conservatives $2.4 million, the Bloc Québécois $2.1 million, and the New Democratic Party $1.6 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were assured that this had been looked at by the government, that it was revenue neutral and no party would suffer as a result of this $1.50 per vote, per year, to replace moneys lost from corporations and trade unions.  Now suddenly it has come back in at $1.75.  We have difficulty with that.  We felt that if $1.50 was good enough and revenue neutral in March when the bill was introduced, then surely it is good enough in June.  We do not understand why the price of democracy has suddenly risen by 25¢, but that is what we will be voting on today at third reading.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think it occurred because various Liberals rebelled.  They sent their president to testify before the committee on procedure and House affairs, which was looking at this issue.  They said it was not enough and they needed more money.  As a result this amendment was pushed through and introduced early this week. We think the Liberals are used to relying on a rich corporate diet and seem concerned about being weaned away from it in any way.  They apparently fear perhaps going out and having to go door to door to raise money from people  on the doorstep and elsewhere.  We believe that a public contribution of $1.50 per vote to each political party is a fair and reasonable replacement for the loss of corporate and political donations.</p>


	<A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an aside, I note that the Canadian Alliance opposes this modest amount of money going toward political parties.  I think it had an amendment to reduce the 43¢ roughly per quarter that would go to each party to 1¢.  I just do not understand it.  These folks stand up every day and grill the government about the latest scandal of  Groupaction in accepting government money on one hand and getting a contract on the other.  Perhaps the Canadian Alliance is concerned that it will actually have to get out and do some of its own research as a result of this cleaning up of the Canada Elections Act and the introducing of public money, which will have to be transparent at the local level and at the national level on a regular basis. But we can be sure that in any event, like the gold plated pension plan, the Canadian Alliance will vote against it but certainly take the money. On the matter of pensions, we happen to believe that people are fully entitled to pensions but the hypocrisy of the Alliance members on that issue, and again on this issue, is breathtaking.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only a couple of minutes left, and we are under time allocation, but we are saddened that we are unable to deal with current trust funds.  I know that come January 1 everything will be transparent under this bill and trust funds will no longer be able to exist.  We felt there should have been a way to have some reporting from the relatively few members of the House, as I understand it, who are in the business of trust funds, some reporting of trust fund money flowing in.  We wanted to reinstate clause 71 on that.  We debated it at report stage yesterday and we were ultimately unsuccessful in persuading the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On third parties, we all know about the destructive effects that third party money and interventions have had in the United States where groups like the National Rifle Association and others have intervened in a very undemocratic and unaccountable way in the political process.  We all know about the soft pacts that have occurred there.  Earlier I mentioned the enormous, unbelievable amounts of money that it takes to run for and win political office in the United States. In this country, the National Citizens' Coalition, just as secretive and unaccountable, has made similar interventions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-24 does not deal with third party expenditures in any way.  The assumption is that third party expenditures are going to be dealt with at the court level and the government is convinced that it is going to win that debate.  I am not as confident, but we will have to wait and see.  There was no opportunity to deal with that because these are amendments to the election financing act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once Bill C-24 comes into effect in January 2004, it will confine political parties to accepting only individual donations.  Accordingly, it should follow that judges will find it more difficult to rule against legislation limiting spending by third parties in election campaigns.  We hope that is the case but certainly there are no guarantees. I look forward to the first review of Bill C-24, and I hope and expect that by the time the courts will have ruled, the National Citizens' Coalition will have a much reduced role in the Canadian political electoral system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the New Democratic Party believes that big money should be removed from politics and it largely will be removed from politics.  Our party passed just such a resolution at its leadership convention in Toronto five months ago.  Canadians are tired of a political system where money has bought influence.  They want the government and political parties to clean up their acts, and I fully concur.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is not perfect. We think there are obvious flaws in the bill.  We tried to get those flaws dealt with in clause by clause and at other stages, but there is no question that overall this will provide a big improvement over the system as it exists now.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance it is a significant step toward getting big money out of politics.  It also provides for greater transparency and accountability for our political system. For that reason the New Democratic Party will be supporting Bill C-24.</p>

The House resumed from June 6  consideration of Bill C-250, an act to amend the Criminal Code (hate propaganda), as reported (without amendment) from the committee, and of the motions in Group No. 1.
</p>


	<A NAME="Int-605245"></A><a HREF="#Int-605270"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-605238"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am  proud today to speak to Bill C-250.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to recognize and compliment my NDP colleague, the member for Burnaby—Douglas, for his courageous and tireless life's work in seeking equality for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered people in this country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to stand with him today and support Bill C-250 as a significant step in what I see as perhaps one of the last great civil rights struggles of our time.  I wish to thank him for giving us all the opportunity to end this parliamentary sitting on a positive note by voting for an issue that I can be proud to support.  I believe all of us should be proud to support the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-250 seeks to amend the Criminal Code to include sexual orientation under the categories of hate propaganda.  I think it is useful to examine what we mean by hate propaganda.  One legal definition states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Hate propaganda, as an exercise of expression, seeks to incite and encourage hatred and tension between different social and cultural groups in society.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a disreputable passion.  Its purpose is to inflame,  intimidate, and  marginalize the individuals and the community at which it is directed. Hate speech serves to vilify and to undermine the dignity and self-worth of members of the target group, and erodes Canada's constitutional commitment to equality and multiculturalism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, it is all the more important and admirable that we deal with this issue today in Parliament, hopefully before we adjourn for the summer.  Every day in Canada, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered people are at risk of being verbally harassed, physically assaulted, and discriminated against because of their perceived sexual or gender orientation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes this violence is extreme and culminates in murder.  In November 2001 Aaron Webster was brutally murdered in Vancouver's Stanley Park and police believe the perpetrators beat Webster to death simply because he was gay. On December 4, 2002, the badly beaten body of Christopher Raynsford was discovered in his Ottawa apartment.  It appears Raynsford was also murdered because he was a gay man. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verbal abuse, whether it is taunts, epithets or threats often precede episodes of violence.  In fact, verbal abuse is the best predictor of the physical violence that gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered people are subjected to based on their sexual orientation. This fact points to the urgency of Bill C-250 which would make illegal the promotion of hatred against these Canadians.  In doing so, I predict this will save innocent lives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under current federal legislation it is illegal to incite hatred on the basis of race, religion, colour or ethnic origin, but not, incredibly, sexual orientation, even though the empirical evidence shows that over 62% of incidents of violence against identifiable groups in society are those incidents against the gay community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of prohibitions under law, incitements to hatred against LGBT Canadians are able to flourish with few, if any, real consequences to the perpetrators.  In fact, the absence of Canadian law that prohibits the promotion of LGBT hate propaganda lends license to the perpetrators of such abuse, both within and outside our borders.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I point to the tactics and the website of American Fred Phelps, the so-called reverend of the Westboro Baptist Church.  Phelps and his followers routinely picket the funerals of LGBT people with signs that read “God hates fags” or “AIDS cures fags” or “No fags in heaven”.  These  are some of their popular slogans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phelps' website features a memorial to Matthew  Shepard, the Wyoming youth who was savagely tortured and murdered in 1998 because he was gay.  The website features a photograph of Shepard burning in the fires of hell and stating the number of days he has been supposedly in hell since his murder.  This is incredible.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian police have been unable to do anything to prevent Phelps or people like him from entering Canada and inciting hatred against LGBT Canadians because of the absence of this reference in  the Criminal Code. In 1999 Phelps visited Ottawa and prompted this response from Sergeant Pat Callaghan of the Ottawa-Carleton Police Hate Crimes Unit. He stated:</p>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>If this was done against a Catholic, a Jew or a black person, charges could be laid. If we had that legislation, we wouldn't have to put up with his nonsense on Monday. We could have told him, “If you show up and start spreading this hate, we'll arrest you”.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Criminal Code amendment would allow police the ability to charge and arrest people like Phelps, who incite hatred against LGBT people. One bystander at the Phelps demonstration in Ottawa said that in Canada we can be whatever we want and we do not like it when people come into our quiet community and spread their hatred.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The critics of Bill C-250 claim that religious teaching and expression would be severely curtailed by the Criminal Code if it were amended in this way.  This argument is patently false. The fact is that religious freedom and expression are protected under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and, furthermore, the Supreme Court of Canada has established strict criteria for the prosecution of suspected hate crimes.  For example, before a prosecution of offences can proceed, the Supreme Court requires the consent of the attorney general in the province in which the alleged hate crime has occurred.  The Supreme Court criteria also ensure that prosecution of suspected hate crimes occurs only when the situation is serious enough to warrant such an intervention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further to that, even though we do not believe it was legally necessary, there is an amendment to Bill C-250 which would specifically, once and for all, state clearly that quoting from any scripture is not to be considered a hate crime for the purposes of this act. That should give comfort to those who have raised the concerns that their freedom of speech regarding religious matters may be somehow infringed upon by this bill.  It is simply not true.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protecting LGBT Canadians from hate propaganda has gained widespread support.  In 2001 Canada's provincial and territorial attorneys general urged the federal government to implement legislation to include sexual orientation as a prohibited ground under federal hate propaganda legislation.  Alberta Attorney General Dave Hancock stated:</p>

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current hate propaganda laws in Canada that ban the incitement of hatred should include sexual orientation because of the overwhelming evidence that gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered people are the object of what we already considered a hate crime and these crimes should be prosecuted under hate crimes legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is a proud day for the House of Commons to add to the issue of equity and equal treatment for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered people.  It is an honour for me to support Bill C-250 and I am proud to stand with my colleague from Burnaby—Douglas in his pursuit of equality for gay people in this country.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise to give support to the amendment moved by the member for Scarborough—Rouge River which would add to paragraph 319(3)(b) of the Criminal Code   the words:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>...or an opinion based on a belief in a religious text;</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe   it addresses concerns raised by religious communities that  presented to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights regarding Bill C-250.  They were concerned that  Bill C-250 would cause negative consequences for those who base  their beliefs or opinions on religious texts.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However  let there be no doubt whatsoever about my wholehearted support for Bill C-250, the private member's bill put forward by the MP for Burnaby—Douglas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would provide  for the inclusion of “sexual orientation” within the already existing definition of an identifiable group found in subsection 318(4) of the Criminal Code. Subsection 318(4) reads as follows:  </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>...“identifiable group” means any section of the public distinguished by colour, race, religion or ethnic origin.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that Bill C-250 would do is    add “sexual orientation” to that list.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the bill for many reasons. First, because of the hundreds of letters I have received from Canadians and organizations across Canada urging me to support the bill.  Public health officers have written identifying gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered communities, especially youth, as  priority groups that  are specifically vulnerable, especially to suicide and depression.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 2001 Ottawa wellness project found that 36% of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered youth had seriously contemplated suicide compared with 26% of other high risk teens.  A 1995 University of Calgary study found that over 30% of gay male adolescents had attempted suicide.  This is three times higher than the average for adolescents who are not gay.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health status is as much dependent on social justice and mental well-being as it is on clean water and smog free air.  I have had letters from jurists from across Canada.  I will  quote one such group, the Canadian Bar Association which represents 38,000 jurists.  It feels that the bill, and I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</td>
<td><small>--would provide...complementary components of an effective legislated response to violence based on sexual orientation and to the fomentation of hatred which  breeds that violence.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is about equal protection under the law for all vulnerable groups and, as a member of a vulnerable group, I understand that need.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the specifically homophobic nature of violence and harassment experienced by this community is unaddressed in Canadian law.  I say  specifically because many of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms advocates cite the Canadian Human Rights Act as being  sufficient protection.  However  there is a provision in the Criminal Code that refers to hate crimes and hate propaganda in which specifically it lists historically vulnerable groups but it does not name sexual orientation as one such group, yet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Vancouver police department, which also  advocates support for the bill, states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td width="15" align="right">

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According  to a two year study conducted on hate and bias type crimes over the period of 2001 and 2002 in Vancouver, it showed that “sexual orientation represents 38% of reported incidents, which range  from homicide through  assault, harassment,  robbery,  threats, theft and arson”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vancouver police cites that “in Vancouver sexual orientation forms the basis for 62% of the assaults and robberies against the groups protected under s 718.1”.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vancouver police go on to say:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk to persons on the basis of sexual orientation extends to others and is entrenched through a pervasive stigma that could be corrected by government action to support Bill C-250.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are not my words.  They are quoted verbatim from a brief presented by the Vancouver police department to the justice committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution 02-15 of the Canadian Association of Police Boards specifically urged the passage of the bill.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I have also heard from family service organizations in Canada, such as the Family Service Association of Toronto, which  states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case I am accused of only listening to the advice and arguments made by special interest groups, I want to say that I have also heard from St. Mary's Catholic Church in  Yukon.    Father Timothy Coonen states: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>I urge you in the strongest terms to support this bill. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the United Church, I quote Minister Warren McDougall who states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Violence and other expressions of hatred directed toward people because of their sexual orientation is absolutely unacceptable.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, as a member of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, it would be unfair of me not to mention that we also heard from many religious bodies that were concerned that the addition of sexual orientation to identifiable groups in section 318(4) would have severe and negative consequences on their beliefs and opinions of homosexuality as it is derives from religious text. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that section 319(3)(b) of the code addresses that concern adequately.  However the amendment  by the member for Scarborough--Rouge River  does specify belief based on a religious text, which some have argued is not fully covered in the clause as it currently exists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sensitive to these concerns and I therefore support the member's motion  but I want to return to the principle of Bill C-250.  I fully support it based, not only on the reasons given earlier  but also because as a physician for 23 years I have seen firsthand and counselled many gay, lesbian and transgender patients, mostly youth who have suffered as a result of the discrimination, the name calling, the shunning, and especially the many of whom were depressed and often contemplated suicide. As I mentioned earlier, statistics show this to be true.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Canada is a signatory to the United Nations convention on human rights. Like all signatory states, Canada has an obligation under international law to exercise due diligence in preventing homophobic acts, investigating them and ensuring that the perpetrators are brought to justice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due diligence describes a threshold of efforts which a state must undertake to fulfill its responsibility to protect individuals from abuses of their rights. Canada has consistently shown due diligence in protecting most minority rights. The time has come for this extremely susceptible group to become part of that group and to be under the umbrella of Canada's protection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to end by quoting Gary Reid who is a survivor of a nail bomb explosion at a gay pub in London in 1997. He says:</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of thousands of people across the land who have written and stated their opposition to this bill perhaps more than any other bill that has passed through this place in the last few years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state  first  that the Canadian Alliance is against the promotion of hatred against any individual or group in society.  The member opposite was right when she said that   the Bible does not promote hatred toward any individual, and that is very true.  It is sad, indeed, when people  claim to be   against these kinds of rights, such as  Reverend Phelps   who was mentioned earlier.  I am sorry  we have those kinds of people who take it over the top.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance does not support that kind of action because we believe  every human being has the right to be respected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, although we respect them and even though   the Bible  teaches us to love them, it does not  teach us to love things that are against the principles of God's word. Therefore we are not instructed to love the wrong that we might see but we are instructed to love the person.  I have great respect for some of the people in this House.  They conduct themselves as gentlemen and as ladies in many situations  but I do not have to agree with their lifestyle.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance believes that all individuals should be protected by law against hate crimes.  In fact, we believe   all groups  are already adequately protected under the Criminal Code.  For instance, let us think of all the people who would  speak evil of politicians.  There are many people in this land who basically stir up hatred against politicians and yet we would not want to be added to that group.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we do believe in the freedom of religious expression and  conscience according to section 2(a) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe in free speech.  I personally am concerned about this.  For the past 30 years I have stood in the pulpits across this land and in other places and have preached from the Bible text.  I am concerned because it is my duty as a minister of the gospel, when I am fulfilling that position, to speak truly according to the Bible, which is the book that I view as the word that teaches us rightly how to live.    I am concerned that some day I would not be allowed to read and speak freely from that book.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are concerned that Bill C-250  would  not ensure adequate protection for the freedom of religious expression;   for teaching,   preaching or speaking in these terms;  standing up for what we believe is morally right   or wrong; and that in some way those freedoms would be taken away from us in the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the sponsor of the bill, the member for Burnaby—Douglas, tries to convince Canadians that his bill  would  not threaten or impede religious expression, we all know that if the bill passes it will   just be a matter of time before some pastor, some priest  or some rabbi  will   be hauled  before a human rights tribunal and    prosecuted for promoting hatred based on his religious beliefs.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not believe the assurances of the member for Burnaby—Douglas and I will explain why.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time ago the former justice minister gave her assurances that the definition of marriage would not be changed.  In this House, on February 15, 2000, the former justice minister said:  </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>This definition of marriage, which has been consistently applied in Canada and which was reaffirmed last year through a resolution of the House, dates back to 1866. It has served us well and will not change. We recognize that marriage is a fundamental value and important to Canadians. That value and importance is in no way undermined by recognizing in law other forms of committed relationships.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a few days later, February 29, the minister also said this, “The common law of this country is equally authoritative with legislation.The courts have said over and over again that there is no need to make it any clearer because I think they cannot make it any clearer.  They have said that marriage is the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are facing an attack on this traditional definition of marriage. Why do we not just lean on the assurances of the former justice minister that it will not change?  However we cannot do that.  No person can give anyone the absolute guarantee that things will not change.  Not even the justice minister can do that.  Nor can the member for Burnaby—Douglas give us those kinds of assurances that religious freedoms will be protected, nor that holy books of the different religions will be protected if Bill C-250 is adopted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen too many changes in my lifetime to things that seemed to be motherhood and apple pie, but they changed.  We cannot buy that line of a personal guarantee or guaranteed protection.  There is no assurance of protection of any kind.  The fact is  we are already losing many of our individual rights and religious freedoms.  Let me just share a few examples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me mention a group in Canada called the Gideons  The Gideons, because of their religious conviction, like to hand out the new testament scriptures to grade six students  in the schools across our nation.  They no longer can do that on school property.  They must do it outside of school property.  They have lost that right to exercise their religion in that way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last Christmas season, the Christmas tree in Toronto was not allowed to be called a Christmas tree.  It was called the “Giving Tree”.  Anyone knows that at Christmastime it is a Christmas tree and that right of expression has been removed.  “Merry Christmas” was removed the year before, in 2001. A friend of mine put on 80-some commercials on the radio station in Ottawa, Ontario, and that is somewhere near here.  After they were recorded, he was called back to the studio and had to redo them. They could not use the words “Merry Christmas” on the radio station in this town.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997 in London, Ontario, Mayor Haskett was found to be in violation because she refused to declare a gay pride day because of her religious beliefs.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002 an Ontario superior court judge ruled against the Catholic school board of Oshawa, preventing it  from carrying out its religious beliefs at one of its own school activities.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A printer in Ontario was fined $5,000 and ordered to do work for a gay group, even though this was against his religious convictions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Saskatchewan, a man named Mr. Owens printed some old testament verses in an advertisement that he paid for in the newspaper.  These biblical quotes were ruled to be hate literature.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is already happening.  We are losing the right to express ourselves according to our religion and according to the books that we believe are given to us by God and that will direct us in life.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can talk about the hierarchy of rights.  Why is the first section, section 2(c) granting religious rights in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, subservient to down the line section 15, which mentions these hate crimes?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can talk about free speech and guaranteeing it all we want but I do not believe there is any guarantee, even with the  amendments.  The three amendments are not written strongly enough to assure us of guarantee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of religious freedom is already taking place.  People are losing their right to practise their religion and to speak freely, It is about words. It is not about hate. It is not about crime. It is about words.  This bill is suppressing free speech.  words that enable one to freely express religious opinion or conviction on their issues of morality.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The religious rights of people in our country are being trampled on at the insistence of a very small group of people associated with some very vocal special interest groups. Thousands of people have written to members of the House. Thousands of people have signed petitions.  Not one member in the House can ignore the fact that the overwhelming majority of Canadians oppose the bill. I will join them in the opposition of the bill.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by saying very clearly and plainly that the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill and will support it wholeheartedly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When deciding whether or not to introduce a bill, there are two questions that need to be asked. The first one is whether there is a need for a bill. The second is whether the bill in question meets the need that has been identified by the first question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us start with the need. I remind hon.  members that Quebec is recognized around the world as a place of tolerance, a place that accepts and defends rights and freedoms. Quebec was the first jurisdiction in Canada to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation, back in 1977. Quebeckers are very proud of this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, despite the fact that Quebec and Canadian society is more tolerant when it comes to homosexuality, there are still groups and individuals that perpetuate ideas that promote hate toward  homosexuals. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of hate must be punished in a society that calls itself free and democratic. If we do not tolerate hate propaganda based on colour, race, religion or ethnic origin, then it makes perfect sense that we should do the same when it comes to sexual orientation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are five groups that are targeted by hate propaganda. Of these five groups, four are protected. The one group that is not protected is made up of gays and lesbians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting, and particularly relevant, to note that according to Inspector Dave Jones of the Vancouver Police, in Vancouver, 62% of hate crimes target homosexuals. This percentage, 62%, is high when we consider that gays make up only one of the five groups identified as targets of hate crime. According to Dave Jones, it is unacceptable that sexual orientation is not considered an identified factor targeted by hate propaganda.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all kinds of examples of hate propaganda. The Internet site, www.godhatesfags.com has been mentioned several times. On this site, there is a picture posted of the young man who was beaten to death and who is allegedly burning in hell because he was gay.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that subject, I would like to reiterate what Pat Callaghan, from  the Ottawa-Carleton police hate crimes unit, said about the visit to Ottawa by some followers of the godhatesfags site creator, the so-called Reverend Fred Phelps. He said: </p>


	<p>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>If this was done against a Catholic, a Jew or a Black person, charges could be laid. If we had that legislation, we wouldn't have to put up with this nonsense. We could have told him, “If you show up and start spreading this hate, we'll arrest you”.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my first criterion has been met; there is a need to protect a group that is being subjected to hate propaganda.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the second criterion, when we analyze this type of bill, we have to ask ourselves whether it meets the need identified in the first criterion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom of religion is what is at issue here. It is the primary objection to this bill. It was the objection raised by my  colleague from the Canadian Alliance who spoke before me.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I think it is important to say that not all religious groups or religious individuals oppose this bill. I will not repeat what my Liberal colleague said before  me about the letter from Timothy Coonen from St. Mary's Catholic Church in the Yukon, or the letter from Thomas Adams, the pastor at the Baptist church in Richiboucto, or even the editorial—to use another religious denomination—from the Jewish Bulletin of January 3, 2003 pointing out that the Bible is not hate literature. I would only ask people to read what was said.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do not entirely agree with my Canadian Alliance colleague who spoke before me. He said that he would no longer be able to speak freely from the Bible to condemn homosexual activity—for lack of a better word.</p>


	<A NAME="T1855"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1855"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1900"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1850"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1855)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was baptized Catholic. I was raised in that faith and I even went to private Catholic school. At school, in our religion courses, we were taught—I am making an analogy; and I know that analogies are often less than perfect, but bear with me—that the Jews made a mistake in not accepting Jesus as their saviour. The theological position of  the Catholic Church—and I think it is the same in all the Christian churches—is that Jesus is the Messiah. Thus, accepting Jesus as our saviour leads us to eternal life. The Jews, who did not accept him, committed a theological error.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what I was taught and perhaps they still teach it. It is possible to say, with respect, that one believes the Jews made a mistake in not accepting Jesus as their saviour. But to go from that to saying that because the Jews made a supposedly theological error, they can be subjected to hate propaganda  is a major leap that our society has refused to make for a long time, for instance when provisions against hate propaganda were included  in the Criminal Code.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday, I attended the opening of the Holocaust Museum. It is easy to see how far hate propaganda can lead. One can see the depths of baseness and darkness that human beings can descend to when hate is involved. I am very much aware of the hate that has been directed against the Jews.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, someone who believes in  a particular interpretation of the Bible, a holy book, may well say, “We condemn what homosexuals do”. Someone might very well say that. But to go from this interpretation in good faith of a religious text to an incitement to hatred based on hate propaganda is, once again, a step that must not be taken.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was using the example of the Jews who are protected by the Criminal Code because they are an identifiable ethnic group. Quite simply, the same reasoning applies in the case of homosexual, lesbian or transgendered persons. It is simply a matter of not crossing the line between interpretation of a religious text, with which one may agree or disagree, and incitement to hatred.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know full well that freedom of religion is well protected in Canada. There is section 2 of the Canadian Charter, section 3 of the Quebec Charter    and the supremacy of God, as stated in the preamble to the Constitution. No right is an absolute right in our legal system, but the only possible limitations are those necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because these are factors that may affect a freedom very well recognized in our legal system, these limitations must be clear and  narrowly interpreted to ensure that the freedom in question is subject to as little limitation as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, freedom of religion is given prominent status in our law; nevertheless, it is not absolute. It is subject to limitations which must be clearly justified in law and come with safeguards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude by reminding the House of three things. First, so far, there have been very few prosecutions under the hate propaganda  provisions of the Criminal Code because the test is very difficult to meet.     The disclosure that results in an infraction must be specifically designed to promote hatred against an identifiable group. The  message heavily laden with contempt must spread hatred according to factors very clearly defined by Justice Dickson in the Keegstra decision.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will let a non-partisan analyst, namely the Parliamentary Research Branch, conclude for me:</p>

<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The drafting of the Code's hate propaganda provisions with respect to specific intent, the definition of hate propaganda by the courts, the special defences and the fact that the attorney general of the province needs to approve prosecution all contribute to ensuring that this kind of prosecution will be possible only for the most blatant cases and that the act is consistent with the Charter.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we wholeheartedly support Bill C-250.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-605329"></A><a HREF="#Int-605350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-605309"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the Progressive Conservative Party has decided to lead by example. There is often talk of a free vote but, over the past two years, our party has held the most free votes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, I hope that most of the members of my party will support Bill C-250. I believe that this bill is a step, and I have never pretended otherwise. Personally, I am very open to same sex marriage and even allowing same  sex couples to adopt.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I think that Bill C-250 is an essential step in  accepting same sex marriage. But I hope that this debate will be quickly followed by a vote in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill—and I do not want to repeat what my hon. colleagues have already said—updates the Criminal Code. Thirty years ago, no one ever talked about gays, lesbians, transgendered people and so forth. Today, they do, as we are doing now. So, there is an evolution in  acknowledging people who are part of this country. Gays and lesbians are an integral part of this country and of our reality. So, this is an important subject. This group has a place and is making its own way. However, this group is the victim of hate propaganda and violence too.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people will say, “This means no more gay and lesbian jokes”. Gays and lesbians in Canada and Quebec have the same sense of humour as straight Quebeckers do. This does not change anything. We are talking about hate propaganda. In my opinion, this is an acknowledgment, and a signal that the Government  of Canada has to give as soon as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that everyone will agree with me: whether we fear for religious freedom or not, whether we support the bill or not, it is essential to ensure that all the political parties in the House agree, before the summer recess, to hold a vote on this bill. Whether the members support or oppose this bill, they must vote and quickly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course there is the whole issue of religious freedom.  Everyone has received an incredible amount of  e-mails.  I would, however, remind hon. members that the principle of the separation of church and state has been around for a very long time.  Parliament is neither a church nor a synagogue.  It is the forum for democracy in a country.  I know that some of us hold to our convictions, but Parliament is not a Catholic or Protestant church, nor is it a synagogue.  Everyone is welcome here.  It is up to parliamentarians to decide on this matter, in accordance with their principles, of course. There is no question of blocking or delaying, a decision must be reached.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amendment has been moved, and I personally believe it was unnecessary.  But if more detail can be added in order to protect religious freedom, so be it.  I would, however, remind hon. members that defining religion is a problem in and of itself.  We must be careful.  When  reference is made to the Koran or the Bible, there is agreement.  There was reference just now made to the Gideons.   We in Quebec have the Raelians. Determining whether or not something is a religion could lead to very lengthy discussions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, I agree that there should be more protection for freedom of religious expression.  Exactly what would adding sexual orientation to the list take away from anyone?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this mean that the priest who has been camping out in front of Parliament since 1997, ever since I first came here as an MP, will be taken off to court?  Absolutely not.  He is speaking out against homosexuality.  That is fine.  “So what?” as they say.  He is against abortion, and has a right to be.  He has been camped out there since 1997 and is entitled to do so.  This is just one example.  And none of that will change.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1905"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1905"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1910"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1900"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1905)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will not be charged under  Bill C-250. Often, people need concrete examples, and I think this is a good one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I want people to understand is that everyone has an opinion when it comes to same sex marriage, but that is not the issue here. That is not what the member for Burnaby—Douglas is asking for. What he is asking is that this important group in Canada, which  has a different sexual orientation from others,  no longer be subject to hate or hate propaganda. That is all he is asking. I hope that there will soon be a debate on the other issues, but that will come later.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can anyone argue against Bill C-250 based on the principle of freedom of religion, when freedom of sexual orientation also needs to be protected? We cannot limit one freedom to uphold another. Too many wars have been waged because of that. It may seem silly to say, but this propaganda exists, it is out there, and we must protect these people against it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to maintain freedom in Canada, we must protect this freedom and the ability to enjoy it. Religion should not be called into it. Absolutely not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I understand people's hesitancy, but with the amendment before us, we should be able to vote on it easily. We should be able to explain to our constituents, to those who send us e-mails and letters, that we want to ensure that people who are different by their sexual orientation are not subject to hate propaganda.  It has nothing to do, at this point, with one's position on marriage or adoption. That can be explained.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to take the time. My colleagues and I did that this morning. The leader of my party, who is still our justice critic, explained it; he supports Bill C-250. He explained this to people, and yet they are aware of his opposition to same sex marriage. However, this bill is not about that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to explain to people that their freedom of religion will always exist and will not be threatened. It is set out in the Criminal Code.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that there are problems. We heard from the Vancouver police. We see that regularly. It is time for action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our colleague from the New Democratic Party has been fighting for this for years. I know that it bothers some people when the member for Burnaby—Douglas rises in the House and rattles our cage with regard to these issues. It is somewhat disturbing for certain people. They say, “Oh, it is him, we must be careful.  There must be something fishy here”. Absolutely not.  He has this unique personality as a parliamentarian and his qualities have been recognized for years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he brings us today is strikingly realistic. It is very simple. If it gives people the opportunity to discuss the issue of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered persons, all the better. As heterosexuals or religious people, we cannot hide in the closet. Absolutely not. We have a role to play as parliamentarians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, with all due respect, I was telling my colleagues two things. We must vote. We know that Friday, Monday or Tuesday at the latest, we will be going back to our ridings to be with our families and friends. Let us vote quickly. I am convinced that, during the summer, we will have the opportunity to discuss this issue with our constituents. We will be able to tell them that Parliament has provided protection by adding sexual orientation to the definition of identifiable group in the Criminal Code of Canada. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, Bill C-250 which we are debating today proposes to extend the application of the hate propaganda provisions to groups distinguished by sexual orientation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the hate propaganda provisions is to prohibit the public communication of hatred against an identifiable group.  An identifiable group is currently defined in the Criminal Code as any group distinguished by colour, race, religion or ethnic origin.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill came back to the House by means of new procedures adopted to ensure that private members' bills are given appropriate attention by the committees they are referred to.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Bill C-250, the bill was examined by the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. The committee held meetings and heard from different witnesses. However due to unfortunate circumstances, the committee was not able to complete its study and conduct a clause-by-clause study of the bill. As a result, Bill C-250 was deemed to have been reported without amendments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the committee hearings, witnesses and members alike expressed concerns that excerpts from the Bible on homosexuality would be found to be hate propaganda if the hate propaganda provisions were extended to a group distinguished by sexual orientation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee also heard testimony from  Department of Justice officials who advised members that it was unlikely that anything in the Bible could meet the threshold established by the jurisprudence for deciding that a statement constitutes hate propaganda. Their comments were based on the interpretation of the elements of the offence by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Keegstra decision.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court of Canada also stated that the statement had to be made for the conscious purpose of promoting hatred.  The Supreme Court said that promoting had to involve active support or instigation to hatred. The Supreme Court said that hatred connotes emotion of an intense and extreme nature that is clearly associated with vilification and detestation.  I am not aware of any part of the Bible that would meet this threshold.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More important, justice officials brought to the attention of the committee the existence of a specific defence against the charge of hate propaganda. This defence exists currently in subsection  319(3)(b) of the Criminal Code and it applies to an opinion expressed in good faith on a religious subject. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence provision says clearly that no person shall be convicted of an offence of promoting hatred if, in good faith, he or she expressed or attempted to establish by argument an opinion on a religious subject.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of example, I am certain that the Bible is a religious subject. Therefore, the existence of this defence comforts me in the belief that quoting from the Bible would fall under this defence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am convinced that the Bible would not be found to be hate propaganda if Bill C-250 became law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the committee hearings it became apparent that Canadians want it to be crystal clear that it will be possible to continue quoting and teaching the Bible or other religious texts without being concerned about being accused of propagating hatred. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion No. 1 as drafted provides this kind of reassurance. This amendment would clarify the application of the defence to an expression of opinion based on a religious text when the opinion is expressed by a person who believes in the text.  I support the intent of this amendment and hope it will help to further reassure all those who have expressed concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion No. 2 would extend to an offence under subsection 319(1) the requirement that any attorney general consent to the prosecution of this offence. The offence under subsection 319(1) is different from the other hate propaganda offences for which the attorney general's consent is currently required.</p>


	<A NAME="T1915"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1915"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1920"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1910"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1915)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, the offence in subsection 319(1) is that of incitation to hatred which could result in a breach of the peace.  Although at first glance this would seem positive, requiring the attorney general's consent for this offence could result in delaying police intervention in circumstances where physical violence against victims is imminent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, this provision could impact on provincial and territorial attorneys general, and they have neither been consulted nor given an opportunity to consider the implications of this amendment.  In order to maintain positive relations, it is essential that they be consulted and be allowed to comment on a proposal such as this.  With this in mind, I cannot support Motion No. 2.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third motion amends the definition of hate propaganda in subsection 320(8) to exclude any religious text for the purposes of seizure and forfeiture of hate material.  I submit that  this motion is unnecessary and could result in excluding unintended material.  Section 320 allows seizure and forfeiture of texts only where “the communication of which by any person would constitute an offence under section 319”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the only texts that can be seized are texts which meet the high threshold established by the Supreme Court of Canada for hate propaganda offences and to which none of the defences, including the religious belief defence, apply.  Under existing legislation, a text that expresses a bona fide religious opinion would therefore not be seized. Motion No. 3 might open the door to abuses in the interpretation of religious texts.  It proposes to protect all religious texts from seizure, without a definition and without a bona fide test as exists in section 319.  As a result, it would protect any writing that is claimed to be a religious text.  It would not allow a distinction between bona fide religious texts and bogus religious texts.  They would all be equally protected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amendment with such serious implications requires further examination to assess its impact, not only on hate speech based on sexual orientation but also on hate speech based on the existing criteria, that is, race, colour, religion or ethnic origin.  This amendment should also be discussed with the provinces and territories because of the potential for negative impact.  For these reasons, I cannot support Motion No. 3.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, with the amendment from the member for Scarborough--Rouge River so that the necessary balance is struck between adding protections for this identifiable group and on the other hand ensuring that those who quote or teach in good faith the Bible or other religious texts are not accused of inciting hatred, I accordingly ask members to consider doing the right thing for all Canadians.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told a long time ago that if one refuses to stand for some things, one may fall for everything. There comes a time when people need to take a stand, not only to represent their constituents but to take a stand for what they believe is the right side to stand on. That is what we are doing here tonight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law that has been proposed in Bill C-250 promotes the interests of some people over the interests of others. It poses a significant danger to freedom of speech and freedom of religion. This bill, as brought forward by the member for Burnaby--Douglas, is a “trust me” bill. Everyone we have heard speak in favour of Bill C-250 has said, “Just trust me”. They have told Canadians to trust them that there is a need for the bill and to trust them that there is a huge bitterness and hatred toward a certain segment of our society, basically the homosexual segment. They have said, “Trust us that we need something extra in the Criminal Code. Trust us that if someone is brutalized or assaulted  we need this because there is no power in the Criminal Code at the present time”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That “trust me” is not going to hold up here today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Canadian Alliance do not support anyone making statements promoting hatred toward any identifiable people, to any group. The proposed amendments to the law raise a number of very serious concerns about which thousands of individuals have written and called. Tens of thousands of petitions have been brought forward in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that my time is up. The Canadian Alliance is proud to stand and say we will oppose this bill.</p>
