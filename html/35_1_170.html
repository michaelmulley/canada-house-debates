	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in light of the very serious rail strike that is currently 
tying up the rail system in our country, I seek the unanimous 
consent of the House to introduce a bill, notice of which was 
given Sunday morning by means of a special Notice Paper, 
entitled an act to provide for the maintenance of railway 
operations and subsidiary services.
<P>
	I seek the unanimous consent of the House to permit the bill to 
be introduced and given first reading at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I wish to inform the House that 
in accordance with a representation made by the government, 
pursuant to Standing Order 55(1), I have caused to be published 
a special Order Paper giving notice of introduction of a 
government bill. In just one moment I am going to lay upon the 
table the relevant document.
<P>
	However, I have a point of order from the member for 
Kingston and the Islands. Is there any comment? I invite 
comment only for the reason that I thought the hon. member for 
Laurier-Saint-Marie was rising to his feet before I put the 
question. There being no comments, is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker:</B> Unanimous consent is not given for the 
introduction of the bill at this time.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GRAINEXPORTPROTECTIONACT">GRAIN EXPORT PROTECTION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from March 2 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-262, an act to provide for the settlement of labour 
disputes affecting the export of grain by arbitration and to 
amend the Public Service Staff Relations Act in consequence 
thereof, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the 
honour and privilege today to speak to a bill introduced by the 
member for Lethbridge. The bill seeks to make it illegal for 
anyone, employee or employer, to cause any cessation of work at 
any stage of the progress of grain from the premises of the 
producer of the grain to export.
<P>
	It should be obvious that the bill would affect a large number 
of Canadians, indeed everybody who comes near the grain, from 
the farmer who grows the grain to the trains and ships which 
carry the grain. It would directly affect my riding of Erie whose 
economy includes the entire spectrum from grain production to 
the marine industry.
<P>
	I wish to focus on one aspect of the bill and what it brings to 
the labour relations atmosphere with the government's own 
employees. That is the provision in the bill which would amend 
the Public Service Staff Relations Act by adding new criteria, 
limiting the right to strike.
<P>
	The bill seeks to add to the Public Service Staff Relations Act 
in section 2 and subsection 78(1), words which have the effect of 
prohibiting employees from engaging in any strike activity in 
areas related to ``the orderly progress of grain from the premises 
of the producer of the grain to export''.
<P>
	When the Public Service Staff Relations Act was introduced 
almost 30 years ago, legislators included a unique concept to 
labour legislation. This was the notion of designating employees 
as essential and denying them the right to strike. That is to say 
that employees whose duties included functions which were 
performed in the interest of the safety and security of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10690"> 10690 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian public, those employees could not engage in a strike. 
If one was to search the Canada Labour Code or other labour 
codes, one would not find many examples of such a concept.
<P>
	In my opinion, this is a good, reasonable and justifiable 
concept. Employees of the federal government and numerous 
other federal institutions should not be in a position to withdraw 
services which would cause harm to the safety or security of 
Canadians.
<P>
	This provision has stood the test of time. When public 
servants engage in strike activity, a number of their colleagues 
continue to work and provide essential services to the public. 
The last public service strike provided us with many examples 
of this provision.
<P>
	Both air and marine search and rescue operations continued. 
Ice breaking continued. Mariner's charts and maps continued to 
be produced and updated, and the all important function of 
providing notices to shipping carried on. As well, the fisheries 
patrols were maintained and employees involved in this 
function continued to provide a service to the public.
<P>
	Air operations continued and airport facilities were 
maintained. Weather observations continued. Forecast were 
prepared and communicated to users. Of great comfort, 
notification bulletins affecting aviation safety continued to be 
produced and disseminated.
<P>
	Naturally prison guards and correctional services are deemed 
an essential service and continued to perform their tasks. All 
those employees, including those who provide care and security 
for inmates, medical care, food, heating and all those functions 
necessary to maintain the system, continued to perform their 
duties.
<P>
	Health care was maintained by designated employees in such 
areas as poison control, hazardous product identification, 
medical support at federal hospitals, ambulance drivers and 
dental and chronic care in isolated areas. Also designated were 
some employees who were involved in research related to health 
care which used laboratory animals.
<P>
	Essential to Canadians, income security programs such as UI, 
family allowance and the Canada pension plan continued. This 
included the processing of new claims as well as issuance of 
benefits.
<P>
	Employees involved in customs and immigration control 
remained on the job. Included among these essential jobs were 
employees responsible for the primary inspection of meat and 
fish products imported to Canada.
<P>
	Not surprisingly, the provisions of the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act also preluded those involved with national 
security from striking. Included among these were the civilian 
and federal employees who provide support to RCMP 
operations.
<P>
	Of interest to members, parliamentarian operations were 
designated an essential service. <I>Hansard</I> continued to be 
printed, along with commission reports and other parliamentary 
publications. As well, simultaneous translation services 
continued to be offered.
<P>
	These are some of the examples of services considered 
essential for the safety and security of the public, and for which 
the public service employees could not withdraw services.
<P>
	The central theme throughout this list is: these services are 
essential for the safety and security of the Canadian public. It is 
evident that the current provisions of the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act have by and large served the Canadian public 
well. By tinkering with these provisions and including the 
notion of economic hardship in the grain industry, are we trying 
to fix what is not broken?
<P>
	It is an unfortunate but accepted reality that strikes will cause 
inconvenience and maybe even economic hardship to some. If 
we are to accept that employees have the right to strike to put 
pressure on their employer, then we must accept the results. If it 
is our view that strikes should not cause hardship to anyone, then 
it is my suggestion that all strikes be declared illegal.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	This bill starts along this road. It is heading toward a 
destination that can only bring grief to employer-employee 
relations in the country. I would not argue that the movement of 
grain is not important to Canadians. Obviously it is. However, I 
do not believe that the production or movement of grain is 
essential for the security of the public. The movement of grain 
is, like many other commercial activities, an important 
economic activity in the country.
<P>
	If we were to introduce the idea that there can be no strikes or 
lockouts in the grain industry which sector would be next? Is it 
the auto industry? Is it the shipping industry? How about 
forestry services? In certain sections of the country ore 
production is extremely important. Should we consider banning 
work stoppages there? If we are to use economic criteria I am 
confident that every member of the House could cite an 
enterprise worthy of consideration for a bill such as this.
<P>
	I would like to remind members that in many jurisdictions 
police are given the opportunity to withdraw from their jobs. 
Medical practitioners and teachers also have this ability.
<P>
	As I mentioned, if we accept that employees have the right to 
strike and to exert pressure on their employer, then they must be 
permitted to do so. The introduction of a provision in the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act prohibiting strikes in one specific 
area, be it grain handling or some other industry, begins to erode 
this right. Employees either have the right to strike or they do 
not.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10691"> 10691 </A></B>
<P>
	The provision restricting the right to strike in the federal 
public service to those performing services essential for the 
safety and security of the public is a restriction but I think it 
can be reasonably argued. In addition, this provision has been 
in place for almost 30 years and still allows the public service 
employees to withdraw services. As we saw during the last 
public service strike, employees still have the ability to exert 
considerable pressure on the employer.
<P>
	Seeking to expand restrictions to cover economically 
important services, first one and then many other industries or 
activities, will ultimately remove the right to strike effectively.
<P>
	I can envisage the time when any strike which puts any 
pressure on any employer or others will then be proposed for 
exclusion under public service staff relations and the Canada 
Labour Code. Legislators will slowly and painfully remove the 
right to strike from any employee as a means of exerting any 
pressure at all. Is this what our country has to offer its workers 
and its representatives? I think not.
<P>
	The introduction of further restrictions to the right to strike 
will, without any doubt whatsoever, worsen labour relations in 
the country. As we all know, these relations are already strained. 
It is my personal belief that after a number of years of difficulty 
it is time for all parties to labour relations to bring a positive and 
constructive approach to them for the future.
<P>
	Times are changing and everybody must change with them. I 
do not feel that the way to begin a positive and co-operative 
renewal of labour relations is by introducing legislation which 
begins to erode what labour considers a basic right. If we are 
going to give labour the right to withdraw services in order to 
exert pressure in collective bargaining, then we must allow this 
withdrawal of service to have some effect. We either fish or cut 
bait. To carry the analogy further, we cannot tell employees that 
they can fish but they cannot have worms.
<P>
	I am sure the member for Lethbridge did not intend anything 
sinister but was simply advancing a proposal which would 
protect the interests of the grain industry and this is to be 
commended. However, I believe the results of considering this 
bill cannot but lead to other interested parties looking to protect 
another and then another and no doubt an important industry 
through labour legislation. While the reasons for desiring 
protection from strikes or lockouts are noble in themselves, we 
must look at how we propose to do this and the results such a 
proposal would bring.
<P>
	In conclusion, while I agree with the member that the grain 
industry is important to Canada, as are many other industries 
and activities, I cannot accept the notion that Parliament 
legislates protection at the expense of the rights of other 
Canadian citizens. Despite what I believe are good intentions, 
the results would be inappropriate and I cannot support the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to what the hon. member had to say, 
and I realize that the grain industry is very important to the 
Canadian economy and to western Canada in particular. But I 
would like to say that grain is surely not more important than the 
lives and health of our fellow countrymen.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	But people's lives and health, and these are under provincial 
jurisdiction, can also be affected by a labour dispute. What was 
the best solution found after a lot of research and trial and error? 
In order to strike a balance between the right of workers to strike 
and the priority right of individuals to health and safety, it was 
determined that the best solution was to establish the principle 
of essential services. Essential service does not mean the right to 
strike is taken away.
<P>
	Those who dream of the day there will be no more strikes 
should realize that taking away the right to strike does not 
guarantee there will be no more strikes. In fact, history has 
shown that before the right to strike existed, there were many, 
extremely rough strikes, for the simple reason that there was no 
legislation. The strikes were there before the right to strike. If 
we want labour relations to be more harmonious, if we want 
grain and health to be priorities, we must ensure that labour 
relations are more conducive to dispute settlement.
<P>
	We must not forget that, especially at a time when for more 
than ten years, in many cases, workers have had to tighten their 
belts, make all kinds of concessions and pay more and more 
taxes, when the economy starts picking up, these workers would 
like to have their modest share, at least. We must not forget that 
in this country, we see executives of private companies getting 
outrageously high salaries and benefits, although they are 
hardly as productive as Japanese companies. In Japan, the gap 
between the salaries or incomes of executives and employees is 
much narrower than in this country.
<P>
	We cannot afford an economic model where executives can 
earn whatever they please and workers will just have to tighten 
their belts and watch others take their share of the profits. We 
must not forget why we have labour legislation. We have labour 
legislation because we had to deal with the flagrant injustice that 
existed at the time. And if we think that bringing all this back 
will lead to prosperity and harmonious labour relations in this 
country, I have got news for you. It will not happen.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kilgour):</B> As we are at the 
beginning of the week, I would ask each of you, in so far as you 
can, to co-operate and always address your remarks to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Clearly, I could not use these words in 
reference to you. This is not news for you, because you already 
know full well that this sort of unfair situation cannot be allowed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10692"> 10692 </A></B>
<P>
to develop so blatantly on the  assumption that the workers alone 
will always be asked to contribute an ever increasing share.
<P>
	Today, tomorrow and in the coming days, we will be talking 
about railway workers. We will see that they too, with each 
successive collective agreement, have had to forgo working 
conditions they previously enjoyed. This is the truth. They have 
done so in order to take refuge in what they considered essential 
in a time of unemployment-a sort of job guarantee.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	And now, because the employer is not budging-and we will 
have to see what the government does in this-we are about to 
see these workers as well lose some of their working conditions.
<P>
	As regards this particular bill, I understand and I share the 
desire for harmonious labour relations. However, when it is 
unreasonably assumed that the right to strike may be withdrawn 
without provision being made for sufficient means to settle 
working conditions, I do not expect grain transportation to be 
harmonious and secure. This will not be the case. History has 
shown us that this has not been the case in the past; it will most 
likely not be the case in the future.
<P>
	I would add, particularly since the government has not seen fit 
yet to propose anti-strikebreaking legislation, which would 
allow re-establishment of a balance of power. If we want to 
establish labour relations, and in the area of essential services as 
well, which permit a balance-and not only the appearance of a 
balance but real healthy labour relations-attention must be 
paid as well to the balance of power. Many provinces have a 
provision for this, and it has proved its worth.
<P>
	As for our case, the work that remains to be done at the federal 
level to ensure labour relations that permit public enjoyment of 
the services they are entitled to, but without the cost of the cuts 
we must face being passed on to the workers concerned, will 
involve paying greater attention to finding this balance. This is 
the only way to ensure that the same protection accorded to grain 
in Canada is accorded to health and life in the provinces.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> To meet the test of 
fairness and the spirit of fairness I must humbly submit that I 
failed to recognize the proper sequence of speakers, not having 
taken into account all the speakers who spoke previously in this 
debate.
<P>
	For the next two interventions I will go to the Reform Party if 
there are two speakers. Then I will be back on track.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today, 
March 20, 1995, marks a very troublesome day for those who 
depend on the railways and for those who must use the port of 
Montreal to get their products to customers.
<P>
	Canadians are feeling the full effects of strikes and lockouts, 
and back to work legislation for the railways is in the works. We 
have been in this situation before. Last Wednesday we sat late 
debating Bill C-74, back to work legislation to settle the labour 
dispute on the west coast.
<P>
	A little over a year ago we also debated back to work 
legislation with Bill C-10 to handle a similar dispute which 
lasted for 12 days.
<P>
	Unfortunately these are not isolated incidents. Canadians 
have felt the effects of similar disruptions many times. I believe 
13 have ended with back to work legislation in the past 30 years.
<P>
	Unless both sides in the CP Rail dispute can reach an 
agreement some time very soon, we will be debating back to 
work legislation again today, tomorrow or soon.
<P>
	I find it ironic that components of the grain handling and 
transportation system are consistently treated as essential 
services when work stoppages occur. I am here today to ask the 
government not to provide essential service legislation. I am 
asking the government to carefully consider the very positive 
impact of Bill C-262; the impact it would have in ameliorating 
recurring problems between labour and management.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Currently there is no effective collective bargaining taking 
place between labour and management. Both sides know they 
can depend on government to legislate them back to work. Let us 
not pretend we have productive collective bargaining taking 
place right now. We do not. Let us end the charade and do what 
Reformers called for in last year's emergency debate and what 
the hon. member for Lethbridge is currently calling for in his 
private member's bill, Bill C-262.
<P>
	Bill C-262 provides a tool for both labour and management to 
prevent these disruptive and expensive work stoppages which 
affect people all across the country when they occur. The current 
work stoppage at CP Rail and at the Montreal port would not 
have happened if Bill C-262 were in place. These disruptions in 
grain handling and grain movement and in the movement of 
other goods must not be allowed to continue.
<P>
	The collective bargaining process must be allowed to work 
where it can work. In the vast majority of cases, in situations 
between labour and management, they do reach agreement and 
the process works fairly well. In other cases the process does not 
work well. When this happens labour and management both 
lose. Unless an agreement is reached the operations will close 
down.
<P>
	The case of grain handling and shipping is unique. It is unique 
because the cost of a disruption can and will be borne by farmers 
in three ways. First, added costs cannot be passed on to the 
consumer because farmers are price takers in a very competitive 
marketplace. Second, there is a loss of revenue in present sales 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10693"> 10693 </A></B>
<P>
and, more important, in future sales through the loss of long 
term customers. Third, farmers have no real alternative. They 
have no  way to get around the system. They must ship through 
the rail transportation and grain handling systems currently in 
place. They cannot choose to use another system which is 
offered by someone else because it does not exist.
<P>
	That is why work stoppages should not be allowed in the grain 
handling system. I hope the hon. member for Mercier will now 
understand why stoppages in the grain handling system are so 
important and why they are every bit as important as the welfare 
and health of members of labour unions. The welfare and health 
of farmers is directly affected by these work stoppages. This is 
coming from someone who has lived and worked in agricultural 
communities through these disruptions over the years.
<P>
	The extra stress caused by farmers being deprived of income 
makes one of the most dangerous businesses in the country 
today even more dangerous. By allowing these disruptions to 
happen continually farmers' health and welfare is affected every 
bit as much as members of the labour unions. I hope the member 
will now understand that the concerns of farmers and the stress 
and the danger to their health are every bit as important as that of 
labour union members.
<P>
	How do we deal with the situation in a way that is fair to 
labour, to management, to the all too forgotten party, grain 
farmers, and alfalfa shippers and other shippers? Bill C-262 
provides a solution through final offer selection arbitration. 
This process is triggered upon request by one party if the parties 
concerned are unable to reach an agreement through the 
collective bargaining process. The key features of this process 
as outlined in Bill C-262 are as follows.
<P>
	The trade union and employer are requested to provide the 
minister with the name of a person they jointly recommend as 
arbitrator. The trade union and employer are required to submit 
to the arbitrator a list of matters agreed on and a list of matters 
still under dispute. For disputed issues each party is required to 
submit a final offer for settlement.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	The arbitrator then selects either the final offer submitted by 
the trade union or the final offer submitted by the employer. In 
the event that one party does not submit a final offer, the other 
party's offer is automatically accepted. The arbitrator's decision 
is binding on both parties.
<P>
	As you can see, final offer selection arbitration does not 
prevent the collective bargaining process from following 
through to a conclusion. It simply speeds the process up. 
However, it does prevent the very few from doing unacceptable 
damage to so many.
<P>
	There are the other workers and the loss of work and income 
for the other workers shut down by the stoppage. There are the 
other businesses involved in grain handling and movement. 
There is the damage done to business enterprises and Canada's 
now faltering reputation as a reliable grain exporter. There are 
the  farmers who must shoulder most of the costs for short and 
long term damage resulting from lost markets. They have no 
way of passing those costs on to the consumer or of recouping 
those losses.
<P>
	Legislation that provides a long term solution to this problem 
should have been passed years ago. In this regard I would like to 
pledge continued leadership by Reform members of Parliament 
in continuing to press for long term solutions to this and similar 
problems in the grain handling system.
<P>
	We cannot afford to have disruptions continue in the grain 
handling and transportation systems. I am asking for support for 
Bill C-262. Indeed in the past, several members of the 
government side and others have provided support for final offer 
selection arbitration.
<P>
	I do not have time to read all the quotes, but these quotes are 
from the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food himself, and 
the Minister of Human Resources Development, and from the 
chief commissioner of the Canadian Wheat Board, Lorne Hehn. 
He stated that the grain industry cannot afford any more strikes 
and lockouts and said: ``We cannot afford to shut down a 
multibillion dollar industry for the sake of a few people. I think 
that we have to do something about this situation''.
<P>
	Mr. Hehn went on to state that he would favour a first offer 
selection. ``If an agreement could not be reached through the 
collective bargaining process,'' he said, ``I think that would 
bring people to the table in a more honest fashion. We could 
settle these things without shutting the system down''. I believe 
this first offer arbitration is much like the final selection process 
we are proposing here today.
<P>
	The senior grain transportation committee voted on October 
14, 1994 to support a system of final offer arbitration. It is down 
in black and white from members of this government.
<P>
	The most effective way I can present the importance of 
stopping these disruptions in the future comes from farmers. My 
father lived through these disruptions in his farming career and 
each time I saw the stress and the pain. I know the hurt that 
caused him and his neighbours. As for myself, in my farming 
career I have lived through several of these disruptions. I know 
the pain and the loss these have caused my neighbours and 
myself.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to stress that it is not only labour unions 
that are being tough on this issue. Farmers have threatened in the 
past-and there could come a time when this will happen-to 
take over the process of grain movement in any way they can on 
their own. Farmers will not let these disruptions continue 
indefinitely. They must stop. I encourage this government to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10694"> 10694 </A></B>
<P>
support Bill C-262 to ensure this is the end of these disruptions 
in grain handling and grain movement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very proud and honoured today to rise in this 
House and give my full support to Bill C-262 which was 
presented by the hon. member for Lethbridge.
<P>
	The timing of this particular debate in the House is absolutely 
perfect. We are sandwiched between back to work legislation 
which occurred last Wednesday and certainly the potential of 
another forthcoming round of back to work legislation in the rail 
industry. We could not have asked for a better time to talk about 
this ongoing problem which has occurred many times in the 
history of western Canada as far as the agriculture business 
goes.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	Today I would like to do something just a little bit different. 
Rather than dwell on how the innocent third party is affected by 
this proposed legislation, I would like to look at all aspects. I 
would like to look at how this would affect labour and 
management and also of course, how it would affect the third 
party, in this case, the shipper.
<P>
	I want to talk about how this would affect the shipper in this 
case. In my position I am most familiar with how it would affect 
the agriculture industry in Saskatchewan particularly in Moose 
Jaw-Lake Centre.
<P>
	I want to look back at the labour dispute in Vancouver a little 
over a year ago. We looked at something like 11 days of tie ups. 
The grain industry never recovered all summer from that labour 
dispute. I know that firsthand. I live about two and a half miles 
from the grain elevators in my home town and our community 
never recovered and Saskatchewan never recovered from that 
short labour tie up.
<P>
	I also looked at some of the evidence I received in the last few 
days. There is a statement from Mr. Blair Wright of Olds, 
Alberta, an alfalfa dehydrator. He said that his company was just 
beginning to make inroads to Japan. He estimated that he lost 
$500,000 in revenue during that shut down in Vancouver last 
year.
<P>
	He also said that the Japanese businessmen he deals with 
stated they cannot understand why Canada allows such 
destruction of its export business. Mr. Wright is obviously 
concerned that he will lose his Asian markets entirely for this 
emerging product. He also stated that the American ports on the 
west coast are actively promoting their continuous delivery to 
Asian markets. The port of Vancouver has the potential to lose 
major customers if this government does not take legal means to 
prevent further labour disruption.
<P>
	I also talked to alfalfa dehydrators in Saskatchewan last week. 
They told me that a labour dispute of one week is an annoyance. 
A labour dispute of two weeks inflicts serious pain on their 
industry. Anything longer than a two week labour dispute is a 
complete disaster to the industry.
<P>
	With regard to things like canola prices, although they may 
not be directly affected, on Monday, March 13 the price of 
canola was $9.44 in my hometown. By Wednesday morning it 
had dropped to $9.20, a drop of some 24 cents. Is that directly 
related to labour problems? Perhaps some of it could be related.
<P>
	Having said that, I look at the innocent third party, the 
shipper. I know this piece of legislation would do the job to 
alleviate those types of problems and frustrations. I look at 
labour and the unions. There have been arguments in this House 
that it is not fair to labour to have final offer selection. I do not 
agree with that. I see what long term labour disputes do to 
labour. I have seen it in my home area of Moose Jaw.
<P>
	There have been two major strikes at Moose Jaw Sash and 
Door. The people were on strike or locked out for more than 
three years. The company ended up closing its doors. Did that 
help labour? No.
<P>
	Moose Jaw meat packers were on strike for some 18 months 
recently. I had the opportunity to drive by their strike location 
many times. These people were playing horseshoes and cards 
because there was no work to do. Did that help those people? No. 
The labour dispute did not solve one thing for labour in that 
instance. I talked to many people on the line. They were willing 
to go back to work. They wanted to go back to work, to some real 
work. There is no way in the world they could ever hope to 
recoup any of the financial loss they faced by being out on strike 
for so long.
<P>
	Looking at that, labour is in a no win situation. In a discussion 
paper written by Mr. Errol Black and Mr. Jim Silver, they quote 
the idea of final offer selection. They say: ``The fact is that final 
offer selection is aimed at a real need, namely, the problems of 
workers in weak bargaining units''.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	They go on to say: ``Final offer selection provides such 
workers with an alternative to strikes which they have little 
chance of winning. Any repeal of final offer selection'', which 
by the way is in place in Manitoba, ``and this 
problem-unionizing and winning gains for workers in weak 
bargaining positions-will remain''. This is more evidence that 
long labour tie ups have a harmful negative effect on workers.
<P>
	I want to talk about management, or the businesses and 
companies. When they face long term labour disputes either by 
strike or lockout it really disrupts the orderly flow of any 
product. Again, in this case I look at agriculture products from 
Saskatchewan to either Vancouver or Thunder Bay. When we see 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10695"> 10695 </A></B>
<P>
a tie up like  that, there is no way in the world to recoup 
financially those losses faced in a very short period of time.
<P>
	I look back to last year's labour dispute and remember talking 
to people in the grain industry. They said there was no way in the 
world they could catch up to what they had lost in a very short 
time. Those effects are felt immediately.
<P>
	I spoke earlier about the labour dispute at Moose Jaw Sash and 
Door. That company was locked out and on strike for so long that 
it closed its doors. The company is no longer in existence. Did 
that solve any problems for the good of business? I do not think 
so. That is why we have to look at some alternative to bring this 
thing together so that we do not have these problems as time 
goes on.
<P>
	If we talked to all three parties we could sell them on the idea 
for final offer selection and for this bill. In my mind, as a farmer 
from central Saskatchewan, as my colleague mentioned before, 
I have seen the effects firsthand of these types of labour 
disputes. We never recover from them.
<P>
	My colleague across the way said we cannot call this an 
essential service. I am not calling it an essential service, but it is 
essential to the livelihood and future of those people in my 
province. Their financial lives, perhaps not their physical lives, 
depend on getting their products from their farm gate to the port. 
That is the way we do business in Saskatchewan. That is the way 
we make our living. If that is interrupted then it is essential in 
my mind because it has a very far ranging, serious effect on my 
livelihood.
<P>
	In conclusion, again I would urge all members of this House 
to support this legislation. It is the first real positive step I have 
seen since I have been in this House to eliminate a big, broad 
problem with a wide ranging approach, a fair approach and an 
approach that makes a lot of common sense to me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my privilege and pleasure to rise this morning and 
speak on Bill C-262 which is before the House. As a former 
member of a trade union for many years, I find it interesting that 
this bill would be put forward at this time, although the issues 
before us are very serious.
<P>
	The bill calls for amendments to some sections of the Canada 
Labour Code which impact labour dispute settlement 
mechanisms. Specifically, the title of the bill states that it is 
intended to provide for the settlement of labour disputes 
affecting the export of grain by arbitration and to amend the 
Public Service Staff Relations Act in consequence thereof.
<P>
	I strongly suggest the bill is not appropriate both in the 
legislation and in its timing as it would introduce an unfortunate 
mechanism. The government is currently in the process of 
making unprecedented changes to the grain transportation 
system which will have far reaching  effects, rather than 
bringing yet another complex mix and not bringing about the 
change we are looking for.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	This is not the way we want to solve the problems we are 
experiencing in the grain handling system. It is important to 
note that we already have the means to alleviate the problems. 
Recently introduced legislation meant that dock workers had to 
return to their jobs in Vancouver and grain and other shipments 
were moving.
<P>
	The issue demands more than just a temporary measure. The 
labour minister has introduced a commission to study labour 
relations at established ports. The commission will look into the 
long term solutions to this dispute and similar ones in the future. 
The commission, I should add, is only part of the government's 
ongoing efforts to streamline Canada's grain handling system.
<P>
	These problems do not go unnoticed. As a result the Minister 
of Agriculture and Agri-Food on May 16 gathered a group 
together to examine many of the issues. The group was formed 
to look at short term grain movement, the problems of long term 
resolution and of recurring difficulties. It included labour 
unions representing the grain handling and transportation 
system.
<P>
	The movement of grain is not done in isolation by any one 
collective workers group. That is why the team approach has to 
be taken. For further proof we need only to look at the records or 
the grain shipments to many terminals in this crop year.
<P>
	We recognize that we have had labour problems in the past 
with grain handling. I believe the way to resolve the problems is 
not by providing arbitration to prevent strikes and lockouts. 
Rather labour must be productive and constructive and become a 
partner in developing an effective process for the movement of 
grain.
<P>
	There is no doubt that it is a serious problem. We are prepared 
to respect the collective bargaining process to promote 
co-operation between the parties in a dispute either through 
mediation or conciliation.
<P>
	My colleagues at human resources development have 
indicated that 90 per cent of collective agreements referred to 
conciliation are resolved without a work stoppage. In instances 
that result in negative impacts on entire sectors the government 
has demonstrated as recently as in the past week it is prepared to 
step in and break deadlocks. As such there is no need to 
introduce amendments to the Canada Labour Code. If we look at 
the experiences of countries in which compulsory arbitration is 
widely practised we see that strikes continue to occur.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10696"> 10696 </A></B>
<P>
	Grain transportation is a very large and very complex 
industry involving numerous trades. For instance, 12 
companies are operating terminal elevators, 14 companies are 
operating transfer elevators and 19 elevator companies are in 
the prairies. In addition we must add the two major railways 
that move our grain products by vessel to the Great Lakes and 
to our external ports.
<P>
	Are we prepared to remove the collective bargaining rights of 
all these people? There is an enormous degree of complexity and 
we understand the concerns of all. To single out one group of 
men and women, the vast majority of whom have never had an 
industrial dispute through Parliament, strikes me as less than 
fair. Co-operation is the way to establishing partnerships 
fundamental to the economy and the well-being of society.
<P>
	The adoption of Bill C-262 is not likely to produce results 
even close to what is desired. Rather I would suggest members 
support the efforts currently under way to reduce problems in 
our grain transportation system.
<P>
	It is fundamental that changes have to take place in the 
western grain transportation system. These changes were 
recently introduced in the federal budget. They will create a less 
rigid and more responsive operating environment in which a 
faster, lower cost and more efficient system may evolve, the 
benefits of which will be shared by all.
<P>
	Therefore, for all these reasons I do not feel I could support 
introduction of new legislation at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
me start by pointing out that I think it is important to put into 
context the whole debate about back to work legislation, the 
shutdown of the railway system and best offer arbitration.
<P>
	Let me do so by pointing out that Canadian farmers are 
probably the best farmers in the world. They are the most 
productive and the most efficient. If it were just on that basis 
they had to make their living everything would be fine; they 
would be extremely prosperous and the country would benefit as 
a whole. However there are all kinds of other issues that raise 
their head and stand in the way of farmers actually being able to 
earn a proper living.
<P>
	One of them is the trade war that seems to be ongoing with the 
U.S. and Europe. At the same time we have huge government 
debts and deficits that contribute to high input costs, high taxes 
and high interest rates which all conspire to make it very 
difficult for Canadian farmers to compete particularly against 
Americans.
<P>
	Meanwhile we have farm institutions like the Canadian 
Wheat Board and the transportation system that are in desperate 
need of reform. There is tremendous pressure on the wheat 
board to change, not only from Americans, our competitors, but 
from inside, from people who actually support the wheat board. 
They want to see change. The hon. member for Vegreville has 
been at the  forefront of pushing for a democratic wheat board 
elected by farmers and with farmers on the board. That makes 
sense to me.
<P>
	I want to talk for a moment about the history of the 
transportation system in Canada. Even when it is not shut down 
by a strike it is at best inefficient and slow. I do not know how 
many calls I have received over the last year and a half from 
people asking: ``Why are there no cars at my elevator? What 
happened to my grain as it disappeared down the track?''
<P>
	We need Bill C-262. There is no question in my mind. It is one 
thing the government can do to bring to an end the problem we 
face today. As fate would have it, we are debating Bill C-262 on 
a day when we have a rail strike in the country. It will also 
provide a long term solution.
<P>
	I encourage the government across the way to set aside 
partisan differences, to consider what is for the greater good and 
to consider farmers across the country. Actually the unions and 
the employers will benefit by this type of legislation, by best 
offer selection arbitration. We encourage the government to set 
that aside and to join with Reform today, the hon. member for 
Lethbridge, to bring the whole issue to an end by supporting Bill 
C-262 and by bringing some sanity back into the transportation 
system.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 11.53 a.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 93, the time provided for debate has 
expired. Accordingly the question is on second reading and 
reference of Bill C-262. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt 
the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those in favour of the

	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the paralyzing effect of the national railway strike 
requires urgent action by Parliament. Pursuant to Standing 
Order 53, I move the following:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the forty-eight hours' notice be waived in order to permit the Minister of 
Labour to introduce immediately a bill entitled an act to provide for the 
maintenance of railway operations and subsidiary services; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House not adjourn this day except pursuant to a motion by a minister 
of the Crown.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Debate is allowed for a 
period of not exceeding one hour.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Robillard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to give members 
of this House the background which I feel is important regarding 
the negotiations in the railway labour dispute. As you know, 
most of the collective agreements, with very few exceptions, 
expired on December 31, 1993. Therefore, we have been without 
collective agreements per se since December 31, 1993, and 
negotiations have been ongoing.
<P>
	We have tried to help the parties to find a solution. First, a 
conciliator was appointed, and then, in November 1994, my 
predecessor, the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
appointed a conciliation commissioner, Mr. Hope, to work out a 
solution with the parties. He submitted his report to the parties 
in February 1995.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Since then, negotiations have continued, but they have been 
strained, and, as you know, the unions decided to concentrate 
their efforts on pressuring Canadian Pacific. Fortunately, last 
week, three unions, representing approximately 3,000 people, 
reached an agreement in principle and Canadian Pacific was 
able to continue all of its other activities.
<P>
	Unfortunately, last Saturday, there was a full work stoppage at 
Canadian National and VIA Rail. Following this work stoppage, 
I called all of the parties, that is the three companies and the 
union representatives from these companies, to a meeting. I met 
with them yesterday afternoon and I asked them to resolve all of 
the issues in dispute, or, at the very least, to reach an agreement 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10698"> 10698 </A></B>
<P>
on  the process which will lead to a solution to the dispute, which 
will be binding on the two parties.
<P>
	I told them that the current government has faith in the 
collective bargaining process and, therefore, that we would 
regret being obliged to step in if the parties were unable to reach 
an agreement. I even advised them that it would be in the best 
interest of both parties, as much the companies as the unions, to 
agree at the very least on the process to be used to resolve the 
dispute, which would be binding on both of them.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the parties did not come to an agreement, so 
that we find ourselves in this House at 12.30 p.m. on a Monday 
without any CN or VIA Rail services in operation as we speak, 
although some operations are still under way at CP. Even though 
some operations are affected, some others are still being carried 
out.
<P>
	What is the impact of a complete work stoppage as we speak? 
Let us first look at the VIA Rail situation. The impact on the 
majority of passengers using VIA Rail services is, I think, quite 
obvious. I would remind the members of this House that VIA 
Rail serves at least 500 communities from coast to coast, which 
means that all its passengers have been paying the price since 
Saturday, especially those who commute to work by train. This 
morning, we witnessed the possible consequences for the 
population, especially in densely populated urban areas.
<P>
	True, there are other means of transportation but when we 
look at what is happening, for example, around Toronto and 
Montreal, it is clear that not all passengers can be 
accommodated by public bus or even private car transportation. 
On this Monday morning, all these passengers, all these people 
were penalized by the work stoppage. I think that we should 
allow VIA Rail workers to go back to work as soon as possible, 
so that these people are no longer penalized.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	It is true that the situation is different at CP Rail. Canadian 
National is not an operation serving the public but rather 
providing transportation services essential to the Canadian 
economy.
<P>
	Needless to say this will have tremendous financial 
implications for the various train transportation users and 
industries that ship their goods by train. Many Canadian 
industries depend on the railway system. The impact of this 
withdrawal of transportation services may vary from industry to 
industry depending on the availability of alternate means of 
transportation.
<P>
	Of course, bulk commodity shippers in 
general-commodities such as sulphur, potash and grain as well 
as mining companies, major electrical household appliance 
manufacturers and car manufacturers-are the main users of the 
train system. Many transport companies and associations, 
including the Canadian Industrial Transportation League, the 
Canadian Wheat Board and several car manufacturers, have 
indicated that  a prolonged work stoppage would be extremely 
prejudicial to their operations.
<P>
	It is clear that at the industry level, in various sectors like 
Western grain, this work stoppage may have a very major 
economic impact. As we speak, we are told that Canadian 
National is losing between $9 million and $10 million per day.
<P>
	We can see right away how serious the situation is and how it 
can compromise this country's credibility as a reliable supplier, 
even on the export market. The impacts are tremendous. On the 
one hand, you have impacts affecting the public at VIA Rail and, 
on the other hand, economic impacts for several industries.
<P>
	While we regret having to bring in back-to-work 
legislation-I repeat, regret, because we continue to believe that 
a negotiated settlement would be better-the government must 
assume its responsibilities and take action. That is why I hope 
that the opposition parties will realize what is at stake and give 
consent so that we can debate this bill today.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I simply want to clarify a 
point. Pursuant to Standing Order 53, the debate may not exceed 
one hour. No member may speak more than once, nor longer 
than ten minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Bloc Quebecois is opposed to passing that legislation today. We 
are aware of the impact of a work stoppage in a sector such as 
railway operations. The minister said that Canada must be a 
reliable supplier and she also pointed out the economic 
consequences of such a conflict. However, she did not say 
anything about the plight of those who-and they did not do it 
for the fun of it-had to walk out under very unpleasant 
conditions.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	As far as I know, Canada has a labour code. If back-to-work 
legislation is tabled every time the Labour Code is invoked by 
workers who have no other means to negotiate a settlement, this 
means that the mechanisms required to ensure strict and fair 
labour relations do not exist.
<P>
	What this bill really does is prove the employers right. I wish 
that were not the case, but just take a look at the newspapers and 
read the recommendations made by commissioner Hope, who 
reviewed the issue. He says that the employers were very 
uncompromising and that, in fact, the unions' demands were 
never taken into consideration.
<P>
	It is very easy to speak against a given union or union 
member. However, let us not forget that company managers and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10699"> 10699 </A></B>
<P>
executives often enjoy personal benefits, salaries, bonuses and 
stocks which do not make any sense and which do not exist in 
other countries. I always think of Japan, where the gap between 
employers and employees' salaries is much narrower than it is 
here.
<P>
	Canadian workers are in a difficult situation. No one mentions 
the fact that, over the years, they waived many rights to preserve 
a single one: the right to a job. It is important that these workers 
can tell all Canadians that they made concessions, but that they 
are not prepared to lose the essential in an industry which needs 
skilled workers.
<P>
	It is important to remember, although this is not necessarily 
popular, that workers have acquired certain rights and that, at 
the very least, they have the right to exercise this kind of 
pressure-not an easy thing to do-to show that they exist and to 
avoid being crushed by the system.
<P>
	I would have liked to hear the minister talk about people. If 
the government decided to intervene every time certain 
behaviours were found to be harmful to the economy, it would 
often have cause to do so, not only in labour disputes. It would 
intervene in the case of companies whose practices do not 
promote productivity. Workers are not pawns, they are people. If 
a company is to be productive, workers must have working 
conditions that reflect a minimum of fairness, otherwise the cost 
will be far greater than that of a strike that does neither party any 
good.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Yes, some workers are on strike, but others have been locked 
out. And others were swept along because they refused to cross 
picket lines. All things considered, we are not very happy about 
the situation.
<P>
	However, this does not mean we should deny these workers 
their rights. Canadians should at least be told about the 
conditions they gave up for the sake of one, and that these 
workers should have access to a fair and equitable settlement. 
Today, we should confirm their right to use pressure to defend 
their position and to engage in free collective bargaining. 
Otherwise, if employers can always count on the government to 
deal with their problems, they will never agree to a fair 
settlement.
<P>
	Sure, they have certain constraints. Sure, these constraints are 
genuine. But in a situation like this, there are always two parties, 
and employers cannot take the position that only their interests 
should guide Parliament and the government. For these reasons, 
because we want to encourage free collective bargaining, 
because we want workers to be able to stand up for their rights 
and because we want Parliament to respect its own 
legislation-I am referring to the Canada Labour Code-we will 
not agree to fast tracking this legislation today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak today. The whole transportation system in 
Canada being tied up is a matter of pressing concern.
<P>
	These services are never considered to be essential until after 
the services are withdrawn. We are not talking strictly about a 
strike. We are talking about a work stoppage. A work stoppage 
can be brought about whether it is a strike or a lockout. 
Whenever I refer to this situation I am talking about the work 
stoppage. People will understand we have work stoppages 
taking place in two separate areas. One is the withdrawal of 
services and the other is an area where the people are actually 
locked out.
<P>
	These work stoppages result in a lot of lost jobs. My friends in 
the government party have campaigned vigorously on restoring 
jobs. This is certainly an opportunity for them to put up in this 
case, put their best foot forward and come up with legislation 
that will put these people back to work.
<P>
	This is a stop gap measure. This is not a solution for the long 
haul. My party has been encouraging the government to come up 
with some long term solutions. For labour and management to 
have the possibility of back to work legislation constantly a 
threat they do not exactly sharpen their pencils and come to their 
best position. A case in point is where we have these contracts 
expiring up to 27 months before the actual work stoppage takes 
place. That is not collective bargaining at its best. That is not the 
process working.
<P>
	In the House on March 3 I asked the minister what she was 
prepared to do in order to come up with some long term 
solutions. I was assured the collective bargaining process was 
working wonderfully and could expect it to work that way in the 
future.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	Obviously it has not. Here we are once again trying to get 
unanimous consent from the House. I hope we do so we can get 
the parties back to the table, the rolling stock moving on the rails 
again, the passenger trains running again and the freight moving 
to its customers. That is of utmost importance. It is not just that 
we are looking at losses to farmers. We are looking at losses to 
farmers, huge losses, but there is a great spinoff of lost jobs as 
well.
<P>
	Once these jobs are lost it will be impossible to get them back. 
Once the buyers of our services and our goods have decided they 
can get them from other sources it will take a lot of negotiation 
and a lot of proving that we will not put up with this kind of 
labour disruption in the future to prove to them that we are a 
reliable supplier of goods and services.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10700"> 10700 </A></B>
<P>
	The people in the Bloc seem not to support the notion of 
introducing this legislation. It is of utmost importance to 
introduce this legislation today. I call on my colleagues from the 
Bloc to give their consent to this legislation so that we can 
debate it properly and get the parties back to the table and the 
freight moving again. To do otherwise is partisan politics at its 
worst, not looking at Canada's overall benefit.
<P>
	Our colleagues in the Bloc could easily dismiss this as one of 
Canada's problems. After all, their ultimate goal is to separate 
from Canada. They could implement any kind of labour 
legislation they like. I would plead with them to support the 
introduction of this legislation today.
<P>
	I assume me colleagues in the NDP will not support the 
introduction of this bill today. It would be extremely difficult 
for them to justify to their constituents how they could hold up a 
bill for another 48 hours which would effectively bring to the 
market the goods their constituents are producing. This is an 
extremely costly situation. It is not just the direct jobs, but the 
spinoff jobs. The long term effect of this has not been addressed.
<P>
	Many customers of Canada's goods in the past have put up 
with disruptions of this type and are counting on back to work 
legislation. If this is not dealt with, to get these people back to 
the table and to get these parties talking again and the stock 
moving at a reasonable pace, our customers will say this is the 
last time they are prepared to put up with this kind of here today, 
gone tomorrow freight service. They will start looking for 
alternate routes to ship their goods.
<P>
	Mr. Lorne Hehn, chief commissioner of the Canadian Wheat 
Board, said we cannot afford to shut down a multibillion dollar 
industry for the sake of a few people. These services are never 
considered essential until after they have been withdrawn. 
Suddenly these are essential services.
<P>
	When will this government come up with legislation to deal 
with these problems over the big picture, rather than this crisis 
management attitude?
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	At the moment crisis management is something we must 
consider in order to get us over this hump. I implore the 
government to come up with similar legislation to what it so 
very efficiently defeated here, presented by my colleague in Bill 
C-262.
<P>
	The senior grain transportation committee voted on October 
14, 1994 to support a system of final offer arbitration for all 
labour negotiations affecting grain movement. I have heard 
some of my colleagues in the Bloc say this effectively bans the 
collective agreement process. This is absolutely ridiculous. It is 
an augmentation to the collective bargaining process. This is not 
something imposed on the partners in the collective bargaining 
process from on high. It is something either one of the parties 
can invite.
<P>
	It induces those parties to come up with a reasonable offer, 
their best offer to begin with. Instead of having negotiations 
or pseudo negotiations for 27 months, as in the case of one 
union, they could get their heads together and figure out their 
final position and present that position to begin with, rather 
than to parley back and forth for 27 months without getting 
anywhere.
<P>
	This is a controversial bill and some of my colleagues in the 
House are philosophically opposed to having this bill presented. 
I implore them to allow it to be presented. I passionately ask 
they allow first reading of the bill so we can at least debate it and 
get it on the floor of the House where it belongs and to do what 
we can to begin to replenish or regain our reputation as a 
reputable supplier of goods.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
first like to thank the Reform Party members who have already 
indicated they would further support this bill. I would ask the 
Bloc Quebecois members to think a bit before maintaining the 
position they have taken.
<P>
	I could talk to you today of the disastrous effects this crisis is 
having on large businesses such as General Motors, Hoechst 
Canada, Canadian Celanese, Ford and others, but who in this 
House is speaking on behalf of all Canadians, not just those in 
my own riding, who have no means of defence?
<P>
	As we talk, Canadian National is, to all intents and purposes, 
closed down; so is VIA. Canadian Pacific is operating at barely 
85 per cent capacity.
<P>
	With each hour we waste, the impact grows more serious. 
Certain grain exports have frozen. Last week, the minister 
tabled a bill for a return to work in the port of Vancouver. It 
seems to me that the political stand taken by the Bloc Quebecois 
members will hamper the settlement of this dispute and an 
eventual return to work.
<P>
	With the tabling of the budget, last week, I got barely one 
phone call in my riding. With this dispute, however, which has 
gone on for months already, I have received calls from all sorts 
of people, including ordinary businessmen and businesswomen 
who are unable to go and collect the raw materials they need and 
whose business, therefore, could well close tomorrow, because 
the production line is stopped. It seems to me the problem is 
serious, serious enough for us to give thought to it and to put an 
end to the dispute.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Bloc Quebecois members accuse us of robbing these people of 
the right to negotiate. The bill that we are introducing today does 
not, as they claim, violate their freedom to resolve this dispute, 
when we consider that they have been trying to work their 
problems out for fifteen months now. It is true that they were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10701"> 10701 </A></B>
<P>
unsuccessful, however, this bill does not rob the various parties 
concerned of their freedom to go back to the bargaining table.
<P>
	The minister herself made many personal attempts. Last 
night, she met with the three unions. Last night, the three parties 
admitted themselves to the media that they have come to a dead 
end. Is it advisable to wait another day or two? Is it advisable, as 
the New Democrats and the Bloc Quebecois advocate, to vote 
against this bill simply in order to forestall the inevitable?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to speak for the average Canadian who is 
affected, whether as a commuter on the Rigaud line or the Deux 
Montagnes line to Montreal, who relies on the rail service to get 
to work every day and who does not have the benefit of a second 
or a third car. Who speaks for them? Who speaks for the small 
entrepreneurs who are trying to get their imported goods off the 
docks in Montreal?
<P>
	It is very easy to convene a press conference when you are 
General Motors or Ford Motor company. It is for those small 
business people that I feel we have to solve this problem.
<P>
	It is true this has a tremendous economic impact, not only for 
the large rail companies but for the local economy in the 
Montreal area for which I speak with great vigour. The port of 
Montreal has paralysed shipments and the railway has paralysed 
shipments across Canada. I take my hat off to the Minister of 
Labour who has only been here a short while but has certainly 
been indoctrinated very quickly. She has done an excellent job 
and has introduced two very difficult measures.
<P>
	As the minister said in her preamble, as a government we 
would have preferred not to introduce back to work legislation. 
It is always more desirable when both parties can agree. But 
both parties have not been able to agree. They have been trying 
for almost 15 months.
<P>
	I would like to quote a report in this morning's <I>Gazette</I> by the 
federal conciliator, Mr. Allan Hope, who is quoted as saying: 
``All three railways have tabled extremely controversial and 
provocative demands that they see essential to their financial 
health and viability''. He wrote in February: ``It would be 
difficult to conceive of an bargaining initiative more likely to 
provoke an impasse''. The parties have tried. Right now we are 
at a standstill. It is not going to get any better.
<P>
	From talking to various people and watching television 
reports yesterday with stranded commuters about the threat of 
the possible shutdown of suburban railways, people will have 
more difficulty getting to work. I would ask all members on both 
sides of the House to support legislation so we can adopt it as 
quickly as possible.
<P>
	It may not solve the deep rooted, underlying problems in the 
railway industry which we have discussed before. But I hope 
that despite this return to work legislation that all parties on both 
sides will continue to try to solve the long lasting dispute, put 
aside their differences for the betterment of the country, for the 
establishment of a reliable service that Canadians, importers 
and exporters,  that small as well as large businesses can rely on. 
We do not have a law-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
-like we have in Quebec, an act on essential services. It would 
be ideal if the federal government had similar legislation, but it 
does not.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	For example, when there are municipal disputes, basic 
services still have to be provided.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In this case we cannot provide a reliable service where there is 
ongoing, continual labour conflicts. It puts in jeopardy not only 
the economic viability of the country but the local economy as 
well. The local economy in Montreal has suffered enormously.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In closing, I would like to ask my colleagues from the Bloc 
Quebecois to reconsider the impact which this dispute has 
already had and will continue to have on the province of Quebec 
and on the Montreal region especially and perhaps decide to 
vote in favour of this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to register my objection to the process that is 
unfolding here this morning. I do so on the basis of the fact that 
the government has had an alternative in this regard for some 
time, ever since its election in October 1993. The government 
could have been moving on the policy front toward a 
transportation system or policy which would have reassured 
people working in the railways that there is a future for them and 
the railways in this country.
<P>
	If rail workers had that assurance and did not feel that in some 
ways the rail industry was not targeted for total extinction or 
anything quite like that, but nevertheless not being enhanced by 
the appropriate policy decisions and therefore suffering over 
time continuous decline, then perhaps rail workers would feel 
more confident in their negotiations with the company in the 
context of negotiations about job security and employment 
security and a variety of other things. Because they feel that one 
decision after another seems to point to an increasing 
downsizing and diminishing of the role of rail transport in our 
overall transportation policy they are obviously not willing to 
accept that when push comes to shove it is their particular 
economic self-interest that has to be sacrificed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10702"> 10702 </A></B>
<P>
	I will go back to something I said last week when we were 
debating back to work legislation. If there was a capital strike in 
this country, as there sometimes is in various ways, would we 
have an emergency debate? Would we have an emergency 
motion? Would we have long and sober debates on trying to 
make capital pay attention to the national interest and to the 
needs of the Canadian economy? It would be quite the contrary.
<P>
	We are forever exalting such decisions as good business 
decisions that we have to somehow appease, the decisions that 
investors make, money speculators make, currency traders 
make or others make when they do not take the national interest 
into account and when they do things that destabilize the 
economy, put people out of work or advocate a high real interest 
rate policy that maybe causes people to lose their homes. All 
kinds of things happen because of the decisions that other people 
make in their economic self-interest and we simply say: ``That 
is the way it is. That is the marketplace. That is life so get used to 
it. Let us see if we cannot do something to give these people 
what they want so they will not make these kinds of decisions''.
<P>
	When working people strike we see how important they are to 
the economy, do we not? The whole thing depends on day after 
day people getting up and doing their jobs, whether it is running 
trains, maintaining the tracks or whatever the case may be. But 
when working people strike all of a sudden the full force of the 
law is brought to bear on them.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	Opposition members of Parliament are expected to walk 
freely into the tent, consult with the government and then do 
whatever the government wants them to do. Two weeks ago if I 
had had an opinion on railway concerns I might as well have 
spoken it into the great white telephone, for all the attention I 
would have received from the government.
<P>
	Now the government wants me to agree. Now it wants workers 
to agree. In the meantime it has no qualms about getting rid of 
the Crow rate, or deregulating, or privatizing CN or doing all 
kinds of things like that. That is okay.
<P>
	It is in protest of that and not just on some kind of a principle 
having to do with back to work legislation that I object to the 
process this morning.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since I am 
a former FTQ trade unionist, I must rise to tell you that 
compulsory back-to-work legislation does not solve the 
problems. I was active in the FTQ for 19 years. Despite the many 
laws passed at both the provincial and federal levels, the 
problems continue to exist and sometimes even get worse, 
because this is not the way to resolve labour relations problems, 
especially since this goes against the principles adopted by the 
government and supported by both union and management.
<P>
	The right to negotiate, which has been recognized by the 
International Labour Organization, the Government of Canada, 
the provincial governments, the employers and the unions, must 
be fully exercised. I think that until now, the unions did not 
have the opportunity to negotiate with the employers. I think 
that the companies have acted in bad faith toward the 
employees in these negotiations. The companies have tried to 
dictate the issues to be negotiated, to impose their strength and 
arrogance on the unions. The unions are not responsible for the 
negotiations dragging on, because it is the companies that want 
to go against the basic principle of job security.
<P>
	No union or employee in the world can say yes to employers 
who want to cut thousands and thousands of jobs in an attempt to 
make mobility one of their labour relations goals. Workers want 
a certain level of job security and some protection with regard to 
their job descriptions. Of course, all strikes present 
disadvantages, but the right to strike is a universal right which is 
exercised in every country, including the U.S.
<P>
	Disadvantages are part of the rules of the game which, again, 
have been recognized by international organizations, the 
employers, the government and the unions. I was surprised that 
the minister would make a speech on her bill but not say a word 
about the workers' legitimate demands or to condemn 
companies for trying to impose their views knowing that the 
government will protect them, this Liberal government is 
behind them.
<P>
	We want these 7,000 workers on strike or lockout to also be 
afforded representation, to have someone speak on their behalf 
in Parliament. That is what we, the Bloc Quebecois, are doing 
and we do not want to debate this back-to-work legislation 
today. Even Commissioner Hope said, in his report, that the 
companies did not bargain in good faith. He did not use these 
very words but when he said that the companies are trying to 
impose their own agenda and ignore union demands, that is what 
he meant.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	I am surprised that the hon. minister did not say a word about 
labour relations in the rail transportation industry, not 
mentioning that problems exist and that the government has 
neglected to deal with them because the collective agreements 
expired on December 31, 1993. That is why I fully support the 
remarks made by our critic in this area, the hon. member for 
Mercier.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to stand in support of the government on this measure.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10703"> 10703 </A></B>
<P>
	It is very interesting that we should get this impassioned 
defence.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Why did you not vote on the other bill?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I did not vote for that bill because this is a much 
better bill. If the member will read them both, he will see it. 
Perhaps that may be a difficulty for him.
<P>
	At any rate, with regard to this legislation and the response of 
the official opposition, Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, may I 
say that it is very interesting. I stand here as the member for 
Halifax, the city with the great port which needs the railway to 
ensure that the port continues to bring prosperity to the people of 
the metropolitan Halifax area, to Nova Scotia and to Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
	It is very interesting that we hear from the members of Her 
Majesty's Loyal Opposition all this rant about the workers. The 
hon. member for Bourassa who just spoke chose to come to this 
country and we are so glad he did. While we are glad he chose to 
come here in one way or another, the answer too is that he 
obviously chose Canada because of the way we do protect 
workers but we protect the peace, order and good government of 
this country as well.
<P>
	A rail strike such as this is not the kind of protection or the 
kind of activity that means this country will continue to be 
prosperous. Look at a few of the things that are taking place 
because of this industrial action.
<P>
	There is the loss of $10 million per day to Canadian National 
alone, a permanent loss of rail traffic to truck, therefore sapping 
the financial viability of our rail system. As one of the members 
opposite actually said-and I agree, do not faint-once these 
jobs are gone, it is very difficult to get them back. There is also 
the adverse image of Canada as a reliable supplier to world 
markets, Japan, for example.
<P>
	As I said before, the problems of the ports and most 
particularly the port of Halifax in my estimation is something 
we could no longer let go by the boards.
<P>
	May I offer my congratulations to the Minister of Labour who 
has certainly come through in an amazing way. She has had her 
baptism by fire as a new member in this House. We on this side 
are very proud of the minister. We want to congratulate her. I 
certainly want to congratulate her on behalf of my constituents 
and the people of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	She has been a lucid voice in an otherwise overly emotional 
debate. The minister stood up this weekend and prior to it and 
asked people to do the right thing, to think of the country as a 
whole and to come back to the table. Only when all else failed 
did she say that the answer was back to work legislation.
<P>
	The minister met with representatives of all companies and 
unions to urge them to resolve their disputes, or at least to agree 
on a binding process to resolve their disputes. When the parties 
reported that they were  unable to reach such an understanding, 
when they reported that collective bargaining negotiations had 
reached an impasse, she knew that nothing could be gained by 
further delay.
<P>
	Most of these collective agreements expired on December 31, 
1993, well over a year ago. For some others it was as long ago as 
December 31, 1991. Extensive federal assistance has been 
provided to the parties including the assistance of conciliation 
officers and a conciliation commissioner. The process has been 
going on for well over a year.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	This government acted and will continue to act in the best 
interests of the people of Canada. It does not act with a hidden or 
secret agenda. It is absolutely necessary that the railway 
business continues, that it goes on for the proper commercial 
work to be done in this country. Whether one lives in my riding 
of Halifax with a port, or anywhere across this great country, the 
railway has been and will continue to be an absolutely essential 
link in the commerce of Canada.
<P>
	To do this is not in any way, shape or form-as has been 
suggested in a manner I find distasteful-contrary to the 
interests over the long term of Canadian workers. It is not so and 
cannot even for a moment be considered to be so because the 
health and prosperity of this country is the first and foremost 
concern of this government, beginning with the Prime Minister 
and working down to everyone who sits on this side of the 
House.
<P>
	Action on the railway bill is absolutely urgent because CN is 
shut down, VIA is shut down, and CP is operating at 85 per cent 
capacity or less. The impact grows with every day and every 
hour. That impact is bad for every Canadian from coast to coast.
<P>
	Grain shipments are compromised. Auto plants depend on just 
in time deliveries that will not make it. Layoffs can be expected 
to start today. That is not very good for the workers of Canada. I 
would like to know what my hon. friend on the other side would 
say to that.
<P>
	Raw materials movement will be minimal while this goes on. 
As I said before, our reputation as an exporter is at stake. That is 
certainly not good for anyone who works in this country, be it 
someone who labours in the particular field or be it a member of 
Parliament. People are affected, especially commuters around 
Toronto and Montreal. With 50,000 who use commuter rail 
every day, the result is traffic chaos in two of our major cities.
<P>
	Is there any value to waiting any longer? The process between 
the parties is at an impasse. Negotiations, as I have said, have 
gone on in the shortest of cases for over a year, in the longest for 
over three years. There have been conciliation officers and a 
conciliation commissioner. The minister has listened and has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10704"> 10704 </A></B>
<P>
made a decision. The government and members on this side of 
the House support her decision and we will continue to do so.
<P>
	This is an absolute necessity for the people of Canada, for the 
health of this country. I am proud to stand and support this 
legislation, to support this government, and most particularly to 
support our newest Minister of Labour.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am somewhat disappointed by the hon. member's 
comments to the effect that the member for Bourassa was not 
born here, but came to Canada later. She wondered if he was 
aware of the working conditions here.
<P>
	I believe he was very aware of those conditions; in fact, he 
probably knows them better than she does. It is deplorable that 
such a distinction be made by a member of this House.
<P>
	As regards the port of Halifax, I want to point out that the Bloc 
Quebecois took the same stand in the case of both Vancouver and 
Montreal harbours. I did not hear the hon. member allude to the 
port of Montreal, where a lockout has been in effect for some ten 
days now. Is this because it was just fine with the people in 
Halifax? Some of her Liberal colleagues told me: the strike or 
lockout in the port of Montreal can go on because, in the 
meantime, Halifax is doing very well. Things were going well, 
but this is no longer the case.
<P>
	In Montreal, the union proposed to go back to work if a 
mediator was appointed. Last Wednesday, the labour minister 
promised that such a mediator would be appointed, but she has 
not done so yet. Part of the problem in Montreal is that one 
employer, Calmar, which belongs to CP, refuses to let normal 
activities resume in the port of Montreal.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Is that so?
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Yes, they are opposed to the resumption of 
normal activities in the port, something the longshoremen are 
prepared to do with a mediator. It has been 20 years since there 
was a labour dispute in the port of Montreal. A tradition of good 
bargaining. At Canadian Pacific, the current attitude to labour 
relations has been to take a hard line and let labour disputes 
fester without resolution and then ask for special legislation.
<P>
	I heard the chairman of the Quebec Liberal Caucus say 
earlier: ``But there are no essential services''. And why not? Do 
you know why? Because there is no anti-scab legislation. There 
are no anti-scab provisions in the Canada Labour Code. This 
government came to power a year ago. It promised to introduce 
legislation but it never did. It was in favour of such provisions 
when it was in the opposition but not any more. We have seen 
nothing so far. Sure, a working paper was distributed with 
several proposals for anti-scab legislation where it would take 
60 per cent and scabs would become legal. Quite something. 
They call it anti-scab legislation, but they would allow scabs 
under this proposal.
<P>
	One last comment, since my time is almost up. I agree there 
may be emergencies and I agree that from time to time we may 
have to consider legislating workers back to work. But after 15 
hours, in one case, and 24 hours, in the other? Let us get this 
straight: Either they have the right to strike or they do not. If 
we want no more strikes, we should pass legislation 
accordingly, but we should not give the parties the impression 
that this right exists-if they have that right, they should 
exercise it-while resorting to special legislation. We cannot 
have it both ways. Either the right to strike exists and it may 
be exercised, or it does not. Let us stop resorting to special 
legislation. Let us put our cards on the table and be logical 
instead of pretending to support public service employees 
during the election campaign and then doing what they are 
doing now.
<P>
	This party talks like the New Democratic Party during the 
election campaign and acts like the Progressive Conservative 
Party once it is in power. That is the Liberals for you.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was not proposing to take part in this debate. 
However, since there is time, I am quite happy to say something 
in response to the ridiculous comments we have heard from 
opposition members as to their excuse for not supporting this 
urgent and important legislation that really should be dealt with 
in this House.
<P>
	Many of my constituents are gravely inconvenienced by this 
strike. They are more than just inconvenienced. The question 
which arises in respect of this strike is the economic loss to our 
country as a result of the failure to ship the things that have to 
get to port to be exported from Canada. This country is going 
through an export boom. To have a serious disruptive strike, 
whatever the problems that may have arisen to cause it and 
whatever the reason, is a serious economic loss to Canada at this 
stage in our economic cycle.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance recently tabled a budget. Clearly, the 
success of that budget depends in part on the export growth that 
is booming in Canada today and which should be supported by 
every member of this House. We have an obligation to see to it 
that Canada's prosperity is not obstructed by some serious work 
stoppage which is preventing one of the most important things in 
our country, that is, exports which are going on at this moment 
and every hour of every day. They are being blocked because the 
opposition is unwilling to bring an end to this strike through 
some lawful means.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10705"> 10705 </A></B>
<P>
	We proposed a fair solution to it. Members may not like it but 
it is a fair solution. Opposition members know that perfectly 
well, yet they persist in obduracy and say they will not allow us 
to change the rules in respect of this bill. They allowed the rules 
to be changed last week and I grant that, but they will not do so 
with respect to this bill to ensure that these people are put back 
to work so that jobs are not lost to Canadians.
<P>
	We believe in creating jobs in this country. That is part of the 
philosophy of the Liberal government. I am surprised the 
opposition does not share that philosophy. One of the ways we 
create jobs is by exports. This strike is stopping exports. It is 
costing Canadians jobs. We should end it right away and the 
faster the better. The opposition knows it perfectly well.

	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today, March 20, is the Journée internationale de la 
Francophonie.
<P>
	Moreover, this year is the 25th anniversary of this celebration 
of French culture and language, which was marked by the 
creation of the Cultural and Technical Co-operation Agency.
<P>
	The Francophonie, which unites 47 countries, can be 
described as the community of peoples who speak French to 
varying degrees.
<P>
	Since 1970, Canada has played a leading role in the 
development of the Francophonie. Through its membership in 
the Francophonie, Canada shares with the rest of the world our 
physiognomical traits and gives French speaking Canadians, 
who number 8.5 million, access to the world and development 
possibilities in a wide range of countries located in all parts of 
the world.
<P>
	I would like to wish all francophones and francophiles in 
Canada a happy Journée internationale de la Francophonie.

francophones the world over celebrate the Journée

cultural changes shaping our societies.
<P>
	Despite the fact that parliamentarians observe this day each 
year, Bloc Quebecois members deplore the omission of any 
mention of the Francophonie's flag in the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage's document entitled: ``Canadian Flag, Flag Etiquette in 
Canada''. However it does describe the flags of three important 
international organizations, the United Nations, NATO and the 
Commonwealth, of which Canada is a member.
<P>
	The Francophonie, must we remind the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, is celebrated in all countries of the world, starting with 
Canada.
<P>
	We send our best wishes to francophones the world over.

abandoning the Crow benefit it had stood up for the necessity of 
rail subsidies. Imagine if instead of continuing with 
deregulation and commercialization in the transport sector it 
had reregulated in favour of rail, an environmentally superior 
form of transport. Imagine if instead of keeping and adding to

<P>
	Across Canada learning disabilities associations and schools 
perform vital work. Without their success in generating greater 
public awareness and without their preventive efforts to 
diagnose and assist those with learning disabilities, school 
dropout rates would dramatically increase. The number of 
juvenile offenders would be on the rise and the long term costs 
of Canada's social programs would spiral.
<P>
	I offer my support particularly to the Learning Disabilities 
Association of Nova Scotia. The many hours offered by 
committed volunteers and staff have made a tremendous 
difference in the lives of those who live with learning

	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise

was started by the Canadian Children's Foundation back in 
1989. Since then Kids Help Phone, which offers 24-hour 
bilingual counselling service to troubled youth, has grown 
tremendously. Kids Help Phone receives over 3,000 calls a day 
from frightened, lonely and often abused children.
<P>
	Just last month Kids Help Phone received an astonishing 
2,041 calls from troubled youth in my home town of Hamilton. 
Unfortunately, however, Kids Help Phone only has enough staff 
and telephone lines to handle about one-quarter of the calls. 
Who knows what kind of a crisis each one of those unaddressed 
calls for help might entail on a daily basis?
<P>
	Although Kids Help Phone does not solicit government 
funding, I call upon my colleagues in the House to lend their 
support and raise awareness of the Kids Help Phone line 
1-800-668-6868. After all, helping a young person in trouble 
can make a difference that will last a lifetime.

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business 
recently released a report stating the Canadian banking industry 
has a bias against women entrepreneurs because women had a 20 
per cent higher refusal rate than men on commercial loans and 
paid 1 per cent more than male entrepreneurs on average.
<P>
	It could be argued the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business is wrong. A Statistics Canada national survey of small 
business in November 1994 said the difference was 6 per 
cent-18 per cent for males, 24 per cent for women-and the 
difference may be reflective of industry preference and not 
gender bias. In August 1994 an Industry Canada report 
concluded that gender did not influence interest rates charged on 
commercial loans.
<P>
	We should be careful not to create problems. We have enough 
as it is. Engendering a victim mentality based on gender will do 
nothing to inspire men or women to become entrepreneurs.

from March 7 to 9 the permanent joint board on defence between

<P>
	The permanent joint board dates back to a 1940 agreement

Canadians had the opportunity to review the U.S. national

discussion and strongly encourage continuing support for these

tions of the Canada Health Act were not negotiable. As it turns 
out however, the national forum on health, chaired by the Prime 
Minister himself, has a mandate to review this act without the 
full participation of the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	The only legitimate players in the health field, namely the 
provinces, have been excluded from this process. The true 
meaning of the Prime Minister's ``not negotiable'' therefore 
becomes apparent.
<P>
	Moreover, the last federal budget called for major budget cuts 
in transfer payments to the provinces. Again, this is not 
negotiable.
<P>
	Are we to understand that this so-called flexible federalism 
means that nothing is negotiable? Transfer payments are cut, yet 
the provinces must comply with standards dictated by Ottawa. 
Now, they are being excluded from the national forum on health. 
And that is not negotiable either.

used to pay a penny for our thoughts, but thanks to an artist in 
Halifax we are now paying a nickel.
<P>
	The artist, Stephen Ellwood, is an American who came to 
Canada because we give more money to artists than do our 
southern neighbours. Today Mr. Ellwood will be throwing away 
$300 in nickels-6,000 nickels-some off a building, others 
discarded on the street, to make a politically artistic statement. 
All of this money is at the expense of the Canada taxpayer 
thanks to the Canada Council.
<P>
	I believe in the freedom of expression in Canada. I do not 
believe Canadian taxpayers should be left on the hook for every 
political and artistic problem we have. The Canada Council 
needs to overhaul its granting practices to ensure greater 
accountability as to how funds are distributed. It is time we 
looked at the current structure of the Canada Council and ask 
how it can continue to exist as we know it today.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, CN, CP and VIA Rail management responded to 
the strike called by rail unions on Saturday by locking out over 
10,000 workers, thus paralysing the whole Canadian 
transportation network. According to Commissioner Hope's 
February 6 report, these three employers have refused to back 
down from any of their demands as employers.
<P>
	Given the employers' attitude, how does the Minister of 
Labour explain that, in the night between Saturday and Sunday, 
barely 12 hours after the dispute started, she prepared, at the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10710"> 10710 </A></B>
<P>
employers' request, to legislate employees back to work and to 
make arbitration compulsory?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my first reaction to the work stoppage at CN and VIA 
Rail was to meet with the parties, that is, the three companies 
and all the unions, yesterday at 3 p.m. in Montreal, to try to 
convince them to settle the dispute themselves by telling them 
very clearly that it would be much better for them to solve the 
problem themselves than to let the government legislate.
<P>
	We still believe that it would be much better for both the 
employers and the unions to find their own solution to the 
problem, and I hope that they still have time to do so before we 
legislate.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister's comments are very enlightening; she 
has delivered an ode to free collective bargaining, after giving 
notice at 9.04 a.m. on Sunday, about 12 hours after the dispute 
started, that she would break up the strike.
<P>
	How can the minister explain that, over a month before the 
dispute started, Commissioner Hope recommended 
back-to-work legislation although, according to his own report, 
the current stalemate results from the intransigence of the 
employers, who are trying to impose ``extremely controversial 
and provocative'' demands?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if we have to bring a back-to-work bill before the 
members of this House, it is because the impact of this work 
stoppage requires the government to take action.
<P>
	There is first of all an impact on all the people who use VIA 
Rail services. All the passengers faced a significant problem 
this morning. As far as the rail transportation network is 
concerned, this strike also affects an important part of the 
Canadian economy, not only rail companies but also all the other 
companies that depend on this form of transportation to speed up 
their operations.
<P>
	Therefore, I think that it is in the public interest for the 
government to take action in this matter.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, after listening to the minister, we must conclude 
right away that there is really only one fundamental question: 
Does the right to strike still exist in Canada? If it must be taken 
away, a bill to that effect should be introduced and debated.
<P>
	If this right to strike still exists, and it does, why does the 
minister refuse to consider a back-to-work bill that would 
provide for mediation instead of imposing work conditions and 
that we would support?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the right to strike and to lock out workers still exists 
under the Canada Labour Code. In fact, over 60 per cent of 
labour disputes are settled without government or departmental 
intervention. Over 90 per cent of cases referred to the Minister 
of Labour are settled without strikes or lockouts. Our current 
system is  very effective, except in emergency situations with a 
major impact on the economy or the population, as is now the 
case. We must strive to achieve results.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the parties have been negotiating for months 
without reaching an agreement. The time has come to achieve 
results in this dispute.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PORTOFMONTREAL">PORT OF MONTREAL</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Labour. The port of 
Montreal has been paralysed for thirteen days. Last week, the 
minister announced that she intended to appoint a mediator to 
help settle the dispute.
<P>
	Could the minister explain why she was in such a hurry to pass 
back-to-work legislation only a few hours after a lockout was 
declared in the railway transportation industry, but has yet to 
appoint the mediator requested by the workers to help settle the 
dispute at the port of Montreal?
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, action has already been taken. I met both parties, the 
employers and the union, this morning. I asked them to go back 
to work immediately and to resume negotiations. I also 
appointed a mediator who is to report to me in ten days' time.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad that the minister has finally responded to the wishes of the 
union, which has been asking for a mediator for quite some time, 
because previously, labour relations have been excellent. What 
is needed is a permanent solution to the dispute.
<P>
	Why did she not take similar action in the case of the railway 
transportation dispute?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, each situation must be considered separately, 
especially where labour relations are concerned, and I think the 
hon. member for the Bloc Quebecois will agree that no two 
situations are alike.
<P>
	In the case of the port of Montreal, no conciliation 
commissioner had been appointed. There had been only one 
conciliation phase, so this is entirely different from the situation 
at the railways, where we had another very long phase, from 
November 1994 until February 1995, when a conciliation 
commissioner intervened.
<P>
	So I assume the hon. member for the Bloc Quebecois is quite 
satisfied with the decision I made today.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, for weeks a rail strike was expected. Now, after 
millions of dollars in lost wages and profit, and aggravating 
delays for commuters, farmers, and exporters, the Liberal 
government is finally ready to heed Reform's call for back to 
work legislation.
<P>
	The Bloc and the NDP are holding up speedy passage of the 
legislation, adding to the loss of Canadian jobs and exports. It 
should not have come to this and it need not, had the government 
acted.
<P>
	Since Reform knew weeks ago that legislation would be 
necessary to end this dispute, since the unions knew it, CN-CP 
knew it and the government knew it, why did the government not 
act sooner to avert this costly rail strike?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government still believes in collective bargaining. 
It still believes that the best solution is when the parties 
involved reach an agreement. And in every situation, we will do 
the impossible, before we consider legislating.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, unfortunately millions of Canadians are held 
hostage by this work stoppage and they need to be heard as well. 
It is the government's shortsightedness and bumbling that is to 
blame for the rail stoppage.
<P>
	Thirty-six hundred people in Montreal and Toronto are 
stranded because of the government. Farmers cannot get their 
grain to market because of the government. Manufacturers are 
shutting down production and workers are being laid off because 
of the government.
<P>
	What is the government planning to do to ensure rail 
stoppages will be a thing of the past?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are very much aware of the economic impact of a 
work stoppage. However, one of the principles of good 
government is that a way must always be found to establish a 
balance between the forces involved. It is certainly not the intent 
of this Liberal government to side against the workers, as the 
Reform Party is doing. We want collective bargaining that is fair 
to both parties in the majority of cases.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if the government was serious about preventing 
future transportation stoppages, it would have supported 
Reform's private member's bill this morning.
<P>
	The Minister of Labour floated the idea of binding arbitration 
last night. If she had really believed what she was saying, the 
minister would have stood in her place and voted for the best 
offer selection bill introduced by the member for Lethbridge.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Labour this. What steps will the 
government take to prevent future rail disputes? Please, no 
speeches and no lectures about the collective bargaining 
process. It rings pretty hollow to 45,000 public servants.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, most disputes are resolved without government 
intervention. We must be aware of this. Secondly, when the 
government does intervene, most disputes are resolved without 
a strike or a lockout. We therefore have a very good system. 
There is always room for improvement, but we are not going to 
change it 150 per cent as the hon. member for the Reform Party 
would have us do.

Pineault, vice-president of CBC planning and regulations said 
that the future of CBC regional TV stations had become 
uncertain following the funding cuts announced in the last 
federal budget.
<P>
	Since the CBC decided against asking the CRTC to renew its 
regional stations' broadcasting licences because of the 
uncertainty created by the Minister of Canadian Heritage, can 
the minister confirm or deny once and for all today-and could 
he please be clear-that the CBC is facing cuts of $44 million, 
$96 million and $165 million over the next three years, as Mr. 
Manera was told by his deputy minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage,

to the figures available concerning the CBC. I have already 
covered this ground and I have nothing to add.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
budget calls for $40 million in cuts next year. That much we 
know and is clear. But does the minister not realize that 
Radio-Canada has announced that more than 750 positions will 
disappear in the next few years, and now that the entire regional 
network will disappear as well? Does he? And having 
undertaken to provide multi-year funding to this crown 
corporation, does he not think that his first duty today is to make 
things clear, to put things plainly and honestly to the CBC, to 
allow for sound financial planning?

the press and certain statements made by a vice-president of the 
CBC's French network. I would like to quote what she said with 
respect to the number of job cuts. She said that it was ``an 
estimate, not a firm figure''. She also said that this estimate will 
have to be approved by a board of directors. That is exactly what 
I said last week.
<P>

Solicitor General admitted that the minister of public works was 
conducting his own investigation into the incident.
<P>
	What type of investigation is this? What assurances will the

non-partisan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
inform the hon. member that I am monitoring the situation and 
reviewing a number of allegations that have been made.
<P>
	This event occurred well before our mandate commenced. It 
was back in 1991. It is the subject of litigation. A number of 
accusations have been made by a variety of different parties. In 
fact the CBC had made an allegation against two of the 
individuals.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	For the benefit of all members, Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
read the retraction which was published: ``Last week the CBC 
broadcast a story which implied payments had been made to 
Senator Pierre DeBane and to Canada Post Corporation 
President, Georges Clermont, in connection with the awarding 
of a contract for construction by Perez Construction of the new 
headquarters building of Canada Post in Ottawa. On 
investigation, CBC has determined that that story was false and 
unjustified. CBC retracts the story and apologizes to Senator 
DeBané, Georges Clermont, José Perez and the Canada Post 
Corporation for any embarrassment caused by the erroneous 
report''.
<P>
	I anticipate that additional allegations will come forward. 
Until such time as the litigation comes to a close, we will 
continue to monitor the situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this event 
sounds an awful lot like the Pearson airport deal which was also 
started by the previous administration.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister for some clarification on 
behalf of Canadian taxpayers. Will he, when he conducts his 
investigation, also make public to the Canadian taxpayers who 
are footing the bill the terms and conditions of the lease 
agreement?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can well 
understand the desire of the hon. member to try to raise some 
public attention.
<P>
	I want to share with him that the Auditor General, in March 
1994, in a special examination of the Canada Post Real Estate 
Group said he ``was satisfied with the decision making process 
throughout the project. The process provided for many counter 
checks of information, ensuring that cost effective alternatives 
were well identified and documented''.
<P>
	Furthermore the Auditor General went on to note: ``Therefore 
it was found that the facility planning process as it affects cost 
controls issues for the corporation-(were) based on sound 
information and realistic market assumptions''.

Speaker, the Quebec Minister of Income Security recently 
highlighted the negative effects of the Liberal government's 
cuts to the unemployment insurance system. One of them was 
that, as a direct result of the cuts to unemployment insurance, 
between 6,000 and 8,000 households in Quebec will be forced to 
join the welfare lines each month.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Will he confirm 
that the additional $2.4 billion in cuts to the unemployment 
insurance fund, of which $700 million is for Quebec alone, will 
only increase the number of families collecting unemployment 
insurance which have to switch over to welfare?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

point out to the hon. member who asked the question what I 
think is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10713"> 10713 </A></B>
<P>
most important statistic from  last year. If we look at the 
question of those people who exhausted their UI benefits, the 
number dropped by more than 86,000 over the year before. 
There was a very substantial gain of employment in Quebec 
which enabled far fewer people to reach a stage where they had 
to exhaust their UI benefits.
<P>
	That is the real statistic the hon. member and the hon. minister 
for Quebec should be looking at. We are creating jobs in Quebec. 
People will be able to stay at work longer and not have to 
exhaust their UI benefits as a result.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the only statistic that people are going to remember is 
that, last year, the government implemented $675 million in cuts 
to the unemployment insurance fund, that this year's cuts 
amount to $2.4 billion and that it plans to cut $3.5 billion in the 
next. That is what people are going to remember.
<P>
	My second question is also for the Minister of Finance. Will 
he admit that he is condemning thousands of families to despair

again offloading his financial problems onto the provinces by 
forcing them to spend larger amounts on welfare?

	As a result of the unemployment insurance changes, close to 
200,000 Canadian families receive the additional benefit of 60

We are now spending more millions of dollars even though the 
fleet is grounded and up for sale. The last time we tried to sell 
fighter planes we ended up giving away 39 of them to Turkey. 
What assurances can the minister give us that the Canadian 
taxpayers will not again get a bad deal and be up for another 
financial loss?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, the CF-5s were bought 
some years ago as the main fighter and were superseded by the 
CF-18. As he also knows, the CF-5 fleet is being retired as a 
result of the white paper on defence and policy review. The 
intent is to sell them to another country, if possible.
<P>
	Some countries have indicated some interest, but there is one 
country in particular where we believe there is a good 
opportunity to sell the CF-5s. The negotiations are continuing 
and we hope to have positive results in the near future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs would agree that the most likely 
candidate to buy the CF-5 fighters is the Turkish government.

civilians. Given these concerns, what reassurances can the 
minister give us to ensure that these fighters will never be used 
to bomb civilian populations?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is right. Turkey is the country we 
are negotiating with. The sale of these aircraft to Turkey or to 
any other country will be subject to the strict rules and 
regulations that are applied by the Department of Foreign

department can get actively involved in Quebec matters, given 
the discretion normally expected from public servants at that 
level?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the National Capital 
Commission is not an official of my department. He presides 
over a fully independent government agency, which operates at 
arm's length. Consequently, I have no authority over that 
official, since he is not a member of my department. I should 
also add that this person is free to use his leisure time as he 
pleases.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the fact is that the National Capital Commission is a

<P>
crown corporation accountable to the Department of Canadian 
Heritage. There are all kinds of leisure activities in life.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Canadian Heritage not agree that this 
case should be reviewed by the ethics commissioner, so that we 
know to what extent such leisure activities, as the minister calls 
them, are acceptable, based on the ethics rules mentioned at 
length in the red book?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Beaudry is a very respectable person 
who does not engage in activities without first making sure that 
they are compatible with his duties.
<P>
	I am surprised to hear members opposite criticize federal 
public servants and agencies, considering that they encourage 
Quebec public servants to actively participate in the referendum 
campaign.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley,

segment on Fernand Auger. We heard about Auger picking up a 
14-year old prostitute in Toronto 10 years ago, putting a gun to 
her head, threatening to kill her and then raping and sodomizing 
her.
<P>
	The program then had an employee of Correctional Service 
Canada state that Auger's convictions were not viewed as being 
violent because the victims were prostitutes and this implied 
a level of consent.
<P>

reflective of the position of Correctional Service Canada and 
this government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

situation. Those comments, if accurately stated, do not reflect 
the position of this government.
<P>

the allegations of crime are investigated, prosecuted and 
punished without reference to the lifestyle of the victim.

distinguished and widely known individuals. We will judge the

than give the mandate to a small group of government's friends 
who will work on the sly, if the minister was not satisfied with 
the work of the CRTC and wanted an objective opinion on the

where interested parties in Quebec and in Canada could have 
been heard?

might be taken as directing by the military. The second one is 
that not all the members who have appropriate testimony are

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	A recent report of the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business shows that banks have a double standard when lending 
money to businesswomen. It suggests higher loan refusal, 
higher interest rates and less financing available to women 
entrepreneurs.
<P>
	Will the minister investigate this apparent discrimination 
when in fact women entrepreneurs have a higher success rate 
than do men?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the questioner points out, it is a very important fact 
that women entrepreneurs do have a very high success rate. 
Their efforts are contributing significantly to the creation of 
jobs in Canada. Their success in small business is an important 
component of the overall development of jobs within the 
country.
<P>
	The question also reflects the suggestion in the CFIB study 
that perhaps women have a more difficult time obtaining 
financing than do men. I know members of the Reform Party do 
not agree with that as they have already spoken on it. Those facts 
are open for review.
<P>
	However job creation by entrepreneurs of either gender is 
going to happen best when the banks come to the table and 
answer the needs of small business. The government is going to 
be working very hard with the banks and the industry committee 
to see to it that we establish benchmarks that are usable and 
useful in measuring the success of the banks in responding to 
these needs.

that we have heard a lot last week and this week surrounding the

<P>
	Given the fact that we now glorify an international economic 
order in which notions of national interest are seen to be 
romantic, why do we bring the full force of law to bear on 
workers who are seen to be not acting in the national interest, or 
so the argument goes, when we do not take any legislative action 
either nationally or internationally with respect to currency 
traders, money changers, multinational corporations or others 
that act against the national interest?
<P>

will the Minister of Finance and the Canadian government, with

<P>
	It was announced in the budget that the air navigation system, 
or ANS, would be privatized this year. The minister went as 
far as to say that negotiations are well under way with a non 
profit group made up of representatives of the air transport 
industry, and that an agreement could be announced shortly.
<P>

Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr.

<P>
	Can the minister give us guarantees to the effect that the

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr.

forth, along with the deliverers of the service, the air traffic 
controllers, the radio operators and so forth, input into the

<P>
	I ask the minister this very simple question: Is the final Crow 
payment intended to benefit the landowner or the actual 
producer?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. gentleman will 
know, the freight rate in western Canada has in one form or 
another been subsidized or kept at an artificially low rate for the 
better part of 100 years. When that occurs for that long period of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10717"> 10717 </A></B>
<P>
time the value of the freight rate becomes capitalized into the 
value of the farm land.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	For example, when the capital gains tax valuation day came 
around in 1971 the value of the farm land was higher than it 
otherwise would have been because the produce off that farm 
land had been subsidized for a long period of time by means of 
the predecessors to the WGTA. The value of the farm land was 
higher because of the subsidy.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Goodale:</B> You asked the question; wait for the answer. 
When the subsidy is removed and the freight rate goes up, 
obviously there will be an impact upon farm land and it is that 
impact toward which the payment is directed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
heard from the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, the Minister of Transport and now the 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, and from our different 
ministers we have had four different answers.
<P>
	I would like an answer, please. Will this payment absolutely, 
for sure, be made to the landowner or as some of the other 
ministers have said possibly to the renters or lessors?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the budget documents and all 
the answers offered by various ministers of the government have 
indicated the payment being directed toward the landowner.
<P>
	A number of farm organizations in western Canada have 
asked for the opportunity to provide advice to the government 
with respect to the administrative arrangements surrounding 
that payment so that we could ensure as far as is humanly 
possible that the benefit from the payment is spread as broadly 
as possible and as fairly as possible in good common sense.
<P>
	Despite the representations of the Reform Party, I intend to 
listen as closely as I can to the advice from farm organizations 
and take their representations into account.

	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Madam Speaker, in 1990 the 47 countries and governments of 
the francophone community declared March 20 the Journée 
internationale de la Francophonie. It was on March 20, 1970 that 
the Agence de coopération culturelle et technique (ACCT) was 
founded in Niamey, Niger. This year, the Journée internationale 
de la Francophonie marks the 25th anniversary of the ACCT, 
which, as it happens, is directed by a Canadian, Jean-Louis Roy. 
It is interesting to remember that the first secretary general of 
that organization, Jean-Marc Léger, was also a Canadian.
<P>
	Today, I would like to pay tribute to the visionaries of the 
Francophonie, men like Senghor, Diori and Bourguiba from 
newly independent countries who dreamed of an assembly that 
would establish new lines of dialogue, co-operation and 
solidarity between French-speaking nations. Madam Speaker, 
let me quote Léopold Senghor, who attributed to the 
Francophonie ``an all-encompassing humanism that encircles 
the planet''. Today more than ever, we must be guided by this 
humanism if the Francophonie is to become an even more 
dynamic forum.
<P>
	The recent tragic events in French-speaking countries 
concern us directly, indeed command our attention. The 
Francophonie is being called upon to take a stand and I give my 
word in this House that Canada will support it in its efforts.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Next week, as I said in reply to a question from a colleague in 
this House during question period, I will have the honour of 
meeting my colleagues from French-speaking nations around 
the world. Together we will discuss ways of strengthening 
French-speaking institutions in preparation for the next Summit 
of heads of state and government in Cotonou, Benin.
<P>
	These summits provide an opportunity to promote common 
objectives. Canada plays an important role at the summits, 
represented by the Canadian government, and also of course by 
the governments of Quebec and New Brunswick, who play a 
very important and useful role there.
<P>
	This felicitous formula, which led to harmonious relations 
between France, Canada and Quebec, was the result of lengthy 
negotiations by intelligent, resourceful people respectful of the 
interests of the parties concerned.
<P>
	Because he is here with us in this House, I would like to 
mention the exceptional contribution of one of the great archi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10719"> 10719 </A></B>
<P>
tects of this historic success, the present Leader of the 
Opposition, who as Canadian ambassador at the time, did an 
outstanding job of resolving this matter satisfactorily in the 
interest not only of Canada  but also in the interest of Quebec 
and of the good relations we have always had and wish to 
maintain with France.
<P>
	This felicitous formula enabled all speakers of French in 
Canada, and especially in Quebec, to play a role internationally. 
This formula still allows Quebec to play an important and vital 
role within the Francophonie.

	We will continue to promote, within the Francophonie, the 
basic values which are so dear to our fellow citizens. Earlier, in 
answer to a question in the House, I mentioned the values of 
democracy, human rights, equality for women, child welfare and 
education.
<P>
	To mark this important day, we had the pleasure to participate 
in a ceremony where we unveiled, along with officials from 
member countries of the Francophonie, their ambassadors and 
several fellow citizens who are active in that field, a postage 
stamp commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Canadian 
Technical and Cultural Co-operation Agency.
<P>
	I also had the pleasure of handing out Francophonie awards to 
deserving students and teachers from across Canada. This 
initiative is a reminder that the vitality of our linguistic and 
cultural heritage was, and remain, essential to our unity, our 
specificity and our existence as an independent entity.
<P>
	Canada is well aware that the Francophonie is not a territorial 
issue. The greatest lesson we learned is that Francophonie 
knows no boundaries: It is a universal reality. The Francophonie 
in Canada, which thrives in Quebec, New Brunswick, Ontario, 
Manitoba and other regions, and which I salute, must of course 
rely on a strong, dynamic and credible worldwide francophone 
movement.
<P>
	Let us not forget that over eight million Canadians can speak 
French. This number includes of course close to 75 per cent of 
Quebecers, but also over 25 per cent of the other Canadians, 
including close to 1.2 million in Ontario, half a million in 
western Canada, and some 400,000 in the Maritimes.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	In closing, today, we celebrate the Francophonie and a 
language which is so dear to us. The French language spread 
throughout the world and is enriched by the different accents 
from various islands, plains, ricefields and bushes, where it is 
thriving.
<P>
	I invite all members in this House and in other Canadian 
legislative assemblies to celebrate together this Journée de la 
Francophonie internationale, which marks the beginning of a 
week dedicated to the Francophonie in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> On behalf of all my 
colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois I am especially proud today 
to mark the Journée internationale de la Francophonie.
<P>
	On this day, it is fitting to point out that Quebec's opening up 
to the world has been nowhere more evident than in its 
participation in the international francophone community. Since 
the early sixties, Quebec has been forging special bilateral links 
with France. This intense co-operation between Quebec and 
France has contributed significantly to the strengthening of 
multilateral contacts with francophone communities, resulting 
in numerous exchanges between Quebec and its main 
francophone partners, especially Europe and Africa, in many 
areas such as culture, education, scientific development, high 
technology and industry.
<P>
	The Journée internationale de la Francophonie is especially 
significant this year as it happens to be the 25th anniversary of 
the founding of the Agence de coopération culturelle et 
technique. In the early seventies, the agency provided the focus 
for the development of the international francophone 
community. Quebec's right to formally participate in the 
agency's proceedings was quickly recognized, as was its right to 
sit as a participating government in the francophone summit.
<P>
	There is no doubt that Quebec's participation in the 
international francophone community is vital to its opening onto 
the world. Moreover, rediscovering the way to a vibrant 
solidarity with francophone and Acadian communities in 
Canada, Quebec will be able to play a central role in building a 
francophone space in North America.
<P>
	Last May, while making public the Bloc's commitment to the 
American francophone community, the Leader of the 
Opposition rightly pointed out that by building bridges between 
francophone communities in North America and the rest of the 
world, Quebec will be able to help make the voices of 
francophone and Acadian communities in Canada heard in the 
concert of nations, and will be thus in a better position to 
promote their cause.
<P>
	Francophones in America have a common future and, when 
Quebec becomes a full partner on the international scene, freed 
from the constraints of being a mere province, it will be able to 
play this role fully. We are eagerly looking forward to that day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as critic of the Reform Party for official languages, I 
am pleased to commemorate this Journée internationale de la 
francophonie.
<P>
	The Reform Party recognizes how much the French-speaking 
population has contributed to the development of our great 
country, which continues to be enriched by them. Conscious of 
that fact, the Reform Party supports the principle of using 
English and French within key federal institutions such as 
Parliament and the  Supreme Court. We also support the right of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10720"> 10720 </A></B>
<P>
all Canadians to speak in either of these two beautiful 
languages.
<P>
	By being part of an organization like the Francophonie, 
Canada maintains relations with 46 other member states having 
a combined population of 400 million people. As a member of 
this organization, Canada can play an active role at the 
international level, whether it is in technological and medical 
breakthroughs in some African countries or in promoting 
democracy in certain Caribbean states such as Haiti.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Although this international co-operation offers limitless 
opportunities, we must remain conscious of our responsibilities 
towards taxpayers.
<P>
	In this regard, most Canadians support our efforts to restore 
democracy in Haiti. However, there are those who question the 
$9 million spent by the Agence de coopération culturelle et 
technique in French-speaking countries, as well as the $7 
million allocated to the implementation of projects and 
development activities agreed upon at the Francophonie 
summits.
<P>
	What we have to do, in fact, is balance our responsibilities 
towards our partners in French speaking countries and those 
towards Canadian taxpayers. This is a difficult exercise which 
warrants special attention. On behalf of the Reform Party, I 
congratulate francophones all over Canada and around the world 
on this day celebrating the Francophonie. I would also like to 
take this opportunity to challenge the government: Let us hope 
that it will be bold enough to ensure some balance between its 
commitments to this alliance and its responsibilities towards 
taxpayers.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.): </B>Madam 
Speaker, today marks the beginning of la Semaine nationale de 
la Francophonie, and this year's theme is ethno-cultural 
diversity. One of the awards this morning was made in 
recognition of a multicultural and anti-racist educational 
project called Leadership Camp.
<P>
	Tomorrow, March 21, we celebrate the International Day for 
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
<P>
	These two events will be an opportunity to celebrate the rich 
diversity of this country.
<P>
	The Prime Minister of Canada has often said that the unity of 
our country is based on diversity, and that diversity is also our 
strength. It is, in fact, the fundamental characteristic of our 
nation. A country based on diversity cannot afford to let racism, 
hatred and intolerance to take root in its soil.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To do otherwise would be to jeopardize a social peace for 
which Canada is envied around the world. Social peace does not 
come from wishing it. It comes from hard work and from 
vigilance. The duty to be vigilant carries  with it the 
responsibility to address racism by public response or by force 
of law.
<P>
	The greatest asset of any country is its people. The challenge 
is not to assimilate this diversity into a simple mould, but to 
weave its many varied strands into a distinctive national culture. 
Canadian culture is much more than the sum of its many parts.
<P>
	From a global perspective Canada is seen as a role model, a 
country united through common values based on fairness, 
equity, democracy and respect for human rights.
<P>
	While racial, religious and ethnocultural discrimination have 
helped to make the 20th century a byword for inhumanity and 
violence, Canada is exceptionally fortunate in the extent to 
which it has been spared the worst of these excesses.
<P>
	We must do more than trust our luck. We must work very hard 
to make sure our country is not open to racist sentiments, 
whatever their form and whatever their source.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	It is in this context that I hope all members will see the March 
21 campaign on their screens and in their movie theatres. It will 
be a campaign asking Canadians to stop and think about the 
harm that racism does to others and to society. Understanding is 
the key to eliminating racism.
<P>
	What better way to encourage Canadians to think about the 
effects of racism than to put themselves in the other person's 
shoes. Mettez-vous dans la peau des autres. Only then can we 
learn what it means to live in a society of mutual 
interdependence. Sometimes we need to be reminded of what we 
so often take for granted.
<P>
	Such a reminder came very recently from President Bill 
Clinton of the United States who in addressing the House lauded 
our nation: ``as a model of how people of different cultures can 
live and work together in peace, prosperity and understanding''.
<P>
	The message of the March 21 campaign embodies the 
sentiment expressed by the Prime Minister of Canada, 
reinforced by the President of the United States.
<P>
	I urge all members to join with me in carrying this message to 
the people of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
tomorrow, March 21, 1995, Canadians and Quebecers celebrate 
the International Day for the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination. As pointed out by the Secretary of State for 
Multiculturalism and the Status of Women, this event coincides 
with la Semaine internationale de la Francophonie.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10721"> 10721 </A></B>
<P>
	It is therefore a time to think about this social and cultural 
dimension of our individual and collective lives. Quebec and 
Canada are societies in a state of flux that are facing many 
challenges. One that is of particular interest to us in this House 
is the contribution of immigrants and their participation in the 
development of our social fabric.
<P>
	However, there are two visions of Canadian society: The 
Canadian vision that favours unity in diversity, and the Quebec 
vision that favours integration while respecting cultural 
differences. These two opposing social concepts are based on 
two different political visions of our world. In Quebec, since the 
initial Quebec-Canada agreements on immigration, the 
linguistic and economic integration of newcomers in the host 
society has been an imperative for the development and growth 
of the majority culture, in other words, the French-speaking 
majority. The very survival of our culture, the cultural heritage 
we received from our ancestors, is at stake.
<P>
	In Canada, multiculturalism has been repeatedly analysed, 
criticized and challenged, especially in recent years. I may 
recall that this policy, which was intended to impose a political 
vision of Canada instead of reflecting the place that cultural 
communities occupy in Canada, was developed at a time when 
Quebec nationalism had reached a decisive turning point in its 
history.
<P>
	It was an attempt to diminish the position of Quebec within 
Canada by relegating to the past the concept of two founding 
peoples and two dominant cultures. That is why 
multiculturalism never took root in Quebec, despite the claims 
of the present federal government and its Prime Minister.
<P>
	We could quote, on this point, a letter by the former Premier 
of Quebec, Mr. Robert Bourassa, who said in 1971, replying to 
Mr. Trudeau on the question of multiculturalism: ``The 
document tabled in the House dissociates culture and 
language-Quebec does not agree with your government's 
approach on the concept of multiculturalism. That notion hardly 
seems compatible with Quebec's reality where there is one 
predominant presence of a French language and French culture 
majority and an important minority of English language and 
culture among many other minorities''.
<P>
	Mr. Bourassa ended his letter by stressing the fact that the role 
of the Premier of Quebec was to ensure that the French culture 
would radiate within North America and that he intended to go 
on doing just that, with all he had available to him, while 
respecting others.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	However, we do believe that the integration of communities 
into the common public culture of Quebec does have a positive 
impact on racism and intolerance.
<P>
	This position was supported in Quebec yesterday during the 
opening ceremony for the Semaine de la Francophonie, when 
the president of the Maison internationale de Québec, Mr. 
Augustin Raharolahy, who immigrated to Quebec 20 years ago, 
said: ``Mastering a language is central to the integration process 
and is a prerequisite for a full participation in the economical, 
social and political life. Furthermore, it also gives a feeling of 
ownership in our society. Mastering the French language as a 
common language is fundamental, but it does not mean 
linguistic and cultural assimilation''. He then concluded by 
saying that: ``A common language, the French language, 
solidarity, and the pride of being a Quebecer are the strengths 
with which we can build a country, a modern society''.
<P>
	One can hardly find a better description for Quebec's policy 
and reality. However, like all other nations, Quebecers and 
Canadians must increase their efforts in order to fight against 
racial intolerance and all the prejudices that invariably come 
with it.
<P>
	The fight is a constant one, but a victory against racism would 
result in a better quality of life for future generations.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is an honour and a pleasure to rise and speak in 
acknowledgement of the International Day for the Elimination 
of Racial Discrimination which takes place tomorrow.
<P>
	Recently I had occasion to speak in Kingston, Ontario to a 
group of seniors about my vision for Canada. I received from 
one of those who was in the audience that day a most remarkable 
letter. She called it ``Acceptable Behaviour in a Global 
Village''. I would very much like to share it with members 
because it gives expression to what we are addressing today and 
tomorrow.
<P>
	She writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The world of human beings has grown smaller and populations all over the 
world have become so mixed that we have to learn to get along peacefully with 
each other. The global village is no longer somewhere else. It is here and all of 
us are mixed in with it. It does not matter whether someone of a different race or 
nation lives next door or down the street or in a different part of town or half 
way around the world, we have to learn to live peacefully with all of those 
peoples whose racial or national origins are different from our own. To do 
otherwise is to bring about an end to our world. The intolerance, conflicts, 
fighting and wars between peoples will bring an end to our civilization and the 
earth as a planet much quicker than any pollution or natural disaster.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All peoples have some members who are great people, who have accomplished 
things which are beneficial for all humankind. All peoples have some members 
who are difficult people who make life miserable for those around them. No one is 
perfect. Most people of all races are a mixture of good and bad. It is necessary to 
recognize the best and the positive in others regardless of what they look like, what 
language they speak or where they have come from. The positive values of honesty, 
integrity, the ability to do the job required of them, the ability to  care for family and </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10722"> 10722 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>other people, and the ability to live peacefully together with others; all provide the 
basis for a good and worthwhile society.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every race and nation of people has those individuals whose performance is 
excellent in all of those values. Every race and nation has many who fail to uphold 
those positive values. We need to change our attitudes to become more objective 
and non-judgmental. We need to become more accepting of all people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The woman concludes her letter with the thought that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is not an easy thing to do but if enough of us who feel this necessity start to 
put these attitudes into our own lives and encourage others to also do so, we will 
have a better world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These are the sentiments of an ordinary Canadian with some 
considerable life experience. Her words echo not only my 
thoughts but also those of all of us here in the House who have 
given expression to our basic belief in human dignity and the 
equality of others.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BORROWINGAUTHORITYACT,1995-96">BORROWING AUTHORITY ACT, 1995-96</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for the Minister of Finance and 
Minister responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-73, an act to 
provide borrowing authority for the fiscal year beginning on 
April 1, 1995, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is for me a great pleasure to 
give today my support to Bill C-73, the Borrowing Authority 
Act, which has reached the third reading and final concurrence 
stage in this House.
<P>
	This bill is in fact an internal economy measure which is 
introduced once a year to allow for the continuation of the 
permanent operations of the government. This does not mean 
that the government does not consider this measure seriously, 
quite the contrary.
<P>
	This bill follows the presentation by the Minister of Finance 
last month of the most important and significant budget for the 
future of this country since the Post-War years.
<P>
	This budget brought in-depth changes to the nature of federal 
spending. Its provisions were adopted because the need for a 
sound administration has become incompatible with a growing 
national debt that has a destructive impact nation-wide.
<P>
	This bill provides for a borrowing authority of up to $29 
billion. A large portion of this amount accounts for the appalling 
and unacceptable gap that has developed between projected 
federal expenditures and revenues.
<P>
	Canadians are well aware of the situation. They understand 
that the cost of outrageous deficits means higher taxes and 
interest rates and less economic growth in the future.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	These same reasons explain why the 1995 budget and its harsh 
measures have had so much support from the people.
<P>
	In the 1994 budget, we undertook to keep the deficit under 
$32.7 billion in 1995-96 and to reduce it even further to 3 per 
cent of the GDP, that is $24.3 billion in 1996-97.
<P>
	This budget contains harsh measures that will make sure we 
reach those goals despite higher interest rates than expected.
<P>
	However, this budget goes much further than the goals set for 
the next two years. Our reforms will continue to be productive in 
the following years and will allow us to go on and hit the final 
target of this government, that is a balanced budget.
<P>
	We will be able to claim that our mission has been achieved 
the day this kind of bill is no longer necessary.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To hit our deficit targets we are implementing cumulative 
savings over the next three years of $29 billion. This is the 
largest set of actions in any budget since the demobilization 
after World War II.
<P>
	These actions mean changing the size and shape of 
government. By 1996-97 program spending will fall from $120 
billion last year to just under $108 billion this year. The 
structural changes we are making will ensure significant deficit 
reduction continues in 1997-98 and beyond. The bottom line 
benefits of this will be dramatic
<P>
	The deficit will fall to $32.7 billion in 1995-96 and to $24.3 
billion the year after, as we promised. With the deficit in 1996 at 
3 per cent of GDP, this will be the lowest level since 1974-75.
<P>
	By that time our financial requirements, the new money we 
have to borrow from the markets, will drop to $13.7 billion. That 
will be just 1.7 per cent of GDP, lower than any currently 
forecast for any other G-7 nation. We are again backing up our 
prudent economic assumptions with substantial contingency 
reserves; $2.5 billion in 1995-96 and $3 billion the year after. 
This means we can still come in on target next year, even if 
interest rates are 1 per cent higher and growth half a per cent 
lower than our forecast.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10726"> 10726 </A></B>
<P>
	Our contingency reserve can do more than protect our target. 
If it is not needed it will not be spent. It will go to reducing the 
deficit even further. This underscores another benefit our 
prudent planning could deliver.
<P>
	If interest rates and growth do better than are forecast and just 
conform to the private sector averages, the 1996-97 deficit 
could drop below $19 billion. That is $5.5 billion less than this 
budget projects. That would bring our deficit down to 2.3 per 
cent of GDP.
<P>
	Even if we do no better than our projected targets, 1996-97 
will be an important milestone since the debt will no longer be 
growing faster than the economy. The debt to GDP ratio will 
have begun to decline at last. That is the key to fiscal 
sustainability, to put our debt ratio on a permanent downward 
track.
<P>
	I need not go on summarizing our budget plans and the 
promise they carry. The House has heard days and days of 
budget debate. The court of public and market opinion has ruled 
strongly in favour of our courageous strategy.
<P>
	Let me turn briefly to the thrust of Bill C-73. I again ask the 
House to support and speedily pass this bill.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	If borrowing authority is not in place early in the new fiscal 
year there will be severe constraints placed on the government's 
financing program. Without passage it could lead to a situation 
in which no government bonds could be issued except to fund 
maturing issues. The bottom line here could be increased costs 
to taxpayers because it would expose the government to the 
additional interest rate charges and risks implied by increased 
short term funding.
<P>
	Bill C-73 contains three basic elements: authority to cover 
financial requirements for 1995-96; a provision for exchange 
fund account profits; the renewal of a non-lapsing amount. In 
total we are requesting authority to borrow $28.9 billion for the 
1995-96 fiscal year.
<P>
	The largest element is the provision for $24.9 billion of 
borrowing to meet the net financial requirements as set out in 
the budget. There is a provision to cover $1 billion of exchange 
fund account earnings, earnings which would make necessary 
additional Canadian dollar borrowing requirements. These 
earnings, although reported as budgetary revenues, are retained 
in the exchange fund account. They are not available to finance 
ongoing operations of the government.
<P>
	There is the well established, over the last seven years, $3 
billion non-lapsing amount. This sum can either be used during 
the course of the year to manage contingencies such as the 
unexpected foreign exchange requirements or it can be carried 
forward into the next fiscal year.
<P>
	There are some technical provisions in Bill C-73 that more 
clearly link fiscal year borrowing authority with fiscal year 
borrowing requirements.
<P>
	For example, one provision provides that the 1995-96 
borrowing authority may only be used after the new fiscal year 
begins. Another provision stipulates that for the purpose of 
calculating borrowing authority usage the effective date is April 
1.
<P>
	Until the bill is passed the government may continue to use 
the $3 billion non-lapsing amount provided for in last year's 
Borrowing Authority Act. Any portion of this non-lapsing 
amount used will be deducted from the basic amount of 
borrowing authority being sought today. This prevents the 
non-lapsing amount from effectively adding to the borrowing 
authority next year. Once it is passed, this bill will also cancel 
all borrowing authority remaining from fiscal 1994-95.
<P>
	This bill is a regular feature of each year's legislative agenda. 
It contains no remarkable or unexpected provisions. Its 
supporting background was fully documented in the budget, the 
main estimates and related documents.
<P>
	However, what is remarkable in both senses of the term is the 
clear, courageous and concrete action the Minister of Finance 
set out to set the federal deficit on the fast track. By doing so, our 
government is laying the foundations for continued national 
economic renewal and restored national unity.
<P>
	I therefore encourage the House to approve Bill C-73 post 
haste so the new borrowing authority will be in place at the 
beginning of the new fiscal year, 11 days from now.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is with pleasure that I participate in the third reading 
debate on Bill C-73, concerning the federal government's 
borrowing authority.
<P>
	From the outset, we must say that the official opposition is 
against this bill. We are opposed to it because it flows from the 
last budget presented by the Minister of Finance of Canada.
<P>
	So, logically, we are against the borrowing authority because 
we were opposed to the finance minister's budget. It is with 
great pleasure that, during the next few minutes, I will remind 
you of why we are opposed to the bill and of why we were so 
opposed to the finance minister's budget.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to make it clear that we have never 
been against putting the fiscal house in order, on the contrary.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	If you have an opportunity of rereading the Hansard for the 
last year, you will see that every time we had a chance to do so 
we asked the finance minister to have an item by item review, in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10727"> 10727 </A></B>
<P>
the normal course of activities of a parliamentary committee 
made up of parliamentarians,  not of experts nor officials 
working on the sly, of all the federal budgetary expenditures, 
including tax expenditures, that is the various provisions of the 
Canadian tax legislation that allow certain individuals or 
corporations to avoid paying income tax.
<P>
	That is absolutely not what we are challenging in the last 
budget, nor therefore in Bill C-73. We are against two specific 
elements of the budget. First, we oppose the means to be used to 
stabilize public finances, because we cannot agree with them. 
Those means include a downright offloading of the federal 
government's deficit problems onto the provinces, and also a 
downright offloading of the federal public financing problems 
for the unemployment insurance account, because year after 
year billions of dollars are taken off the UI account in order to 
address the public finance problem, and also budget cuts made 
at the expense of the neediest members of society, that is cuts in 
the transfer payments for social assistance and post-secondary 
education.
<P>
	The second element of the federal budget we cannot agree to, 
and the second reason why we therefore cannot agree with Bill 
C-73 providing borrowing authority, is related to the fact that 
the real problem of Canadian public finances is hidden from the 
people of Quebec and Canada, and that is the explosive problem 
of chronic and massive debt, a problem that is likely to stay with 
us for the next few years.
<P>
	If I may, I will take the next few minutes to review our major 
objections to the budget, and therefore to Bill C-73. As I said 
earlier, the first of these budgets over the next three years will 
offload the federal government's deficit onto the backs of the 
provinces. For the government of Quebec alone, this represents 
over the next three years a shortfall of almost $3 billion. In 
addition, not content with cutting transfers, the federal 
government is still attempting, even though it can no longer 
afford to do so, to impose its view of things on the provincial 
governments and on the government of Quebec in particular by 
imposing standards in all the areas where it has made cuts and 
where it is going to continue to cut in the coming years. These 
areas would include health, post-secondary education and 
social assistance, as I mentioned.
<P>
	Just as he did last year, the Minister of Finance again this year 
went after the unemployed. Over the next two years, he will cut 
$7.5 billion in the unemployment insurance fund. Out of this 
fund, to which the federal government no longer even 
contributes, he will take $7.5 billion. What is this if not an 
indirect tax, because only employers and employees contribute 
to this unemployment insurance fund. And for three years now, 
the federal government has been merrily dipping into this fund, 
although it should not be doing so.
<P>
	I would remind you that $7.5 billion in cuts represents 120 
times what is being asked of the banks over the coming years. 
They are being asked to cough up $100 million as an additional, 
temporary tax over the next two  years. The government is 
laughing in our faces when they leave the banks intact in this 
cost-cutting exercise and ask the unemployed, who did not 
make a profit of $5 billion last year, to contribute $7.5 billion to 
social assistance programs. This is how this government defines 
social justice and fairness.
<P>
	These cuts are part of a vision of economic and social 
development that does not correspond with Quebecers' view of 
society. I would remind the Secretary of State, who said earlier 
that everyone was happy with the budget, that that is not the 
case. In Quebec, 58 per cent of Quebecers have just said that 
they are against this budget, that they are not confident that this 
budget can even begin to bring about job creation. So he should 
check his polls and he should also verify elsewhere than in 
financial circles the reaction to this budget.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	I would remind you that, in the last budget, this government 
had so few concerns regarding jobs and unemployment that, for 
the only program of any interest-the infrastructure program-, 
it found a way to cut $200 million from this fund which had been 
set aside for investment in infrastructures across Canada.
<P>
	I would also remind you that, in terms of employment, more 
than 800,000 jobs still need to be created, with all the jobs we 
have lost since the big recession in the first quarter of 1990. For 
this government, unemployment is not a problem, as the 
Minister of Finance indicated in his budget speech, but jobs are 
not a priority either.
<P>
	We oppose Bill C-73, since, as it stems from the budget, it 
does not directly attack the duplication that is costing taxpayers 
billions of dollars. Moreover, as we have said in recent weeks, 
this duplication and overlap will continue. Members opposite 
who say this is not the case should have a look at the budget and 
note that nothing has changed in terms of expenditures or tax 
revenues.
<P>
	They should also look at all of the departments. Not one 
department has been cut. Not one. If duplication and overlap 
were being eliminated, departments would be cut, because 
expenditures are being cut, and 45,000 people are being laid off. 
Where is the big machine being restructured? It is not. It 
remains intact and will continue to generate billions of dollars in 
wastage paid for with the income and other taxes of Quebec and 
Canadian taxpayers. This is the fine way the Liberal government 
manages public finances.
<P>
	We oppose Bill C-73, because the budget is silent on one 
serious problem in the Canadian tax system: the many tax 
inequities. The budget contains no tax reform that would allow 
for a reduction in government borrowing on the capital markets. 
It contains only taxation measures and measures that will 
perpetuate the wastage, as well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10728"> 10728 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister of Finance is not going after the tens of 
thousands of companies that pay no income tax. We have been 
drawing this problem to his attention for months. We have been 
saying for months that some 70,000 profitable companies in 
Canada do not pay income tax. The minister has done nothing to 
correct this tax inequity, this preferential tax treatment given 
business.
<P>
	Neither does the budget contain any provision concerning 16 
tax conventions entered into between the federal government 
and countries considered as tax havens for hundreds of millions 
of unpaid corporate taxes. In the end, the budget offers only 
superficial changes aimed at hiding the $7 billion cut in 
transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	For instance, while the government announces that it will 
make permanent cuts to the unemployment insurance program, 
it is increasing, on a temporary basis, for two years only, the 
capital tax imposed on banks, which will raise approximately 
$100 million. This represents a fortieth of the profits made by 
Canadian banks as a whole, in 1994-95. Imagine the fiscal effort 
required of banks. Imagine the fiscal effort required of the Royal 
Bank, for instance, which last year recorded profits of $1.2 
billion.
<P>
	As far as family trusts are concerned, we are told that the very 
rich who, in Canada, do not have to pay any capital gains tax, for 
a maximum period of 80 years, on assets worth hundreds of 
millions of dollars held in family trusts, will see their benefits 
diminish slightly.
<P>
	In his budget speech, the finance minister told us: ``Do not 
worry. We will eliminate the undue benefits available to the very 
rich in Canada''. He gives them four years to dismantle their 
family trusts, put their wealth somewhere else, and ensure that 
for the next four years they will not pay their rightful share of 
federal tax. This is a reflection of the inability and lack of 
political will on the part of the federal government to close the 
tax loopholes which benefit very high income earners, and 
explains the financial predicament it is in.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	We oppose Bill C-73, which is a spin-off from the budget, 
because Canada still operates its farming sector with a double 
standard. To compensate western farmers for abolishing the 
western grain transportation subsidy, which enriched Prairie 
farmers by $560 million, they offer a direct subsidy of $1.6 
billion to offset the decline in land values.
<P>
	When a ways and means motion was introduced last week 
concerning the Crow's Nest Pass agreement, it was a replay of 
the problem we had in 1982 when another Liberal government 
attempted to abolish the same agreement and to compensate 
western grain producers without compensating those in the east, 
in particular in Quebec. They want to base compensation to 
western producers on cultivated acreage, not on whether 
producers exported their grain in the past and even  benefited 
from the Crow rate. They want to compensate all western 
producers based on cultivated acreage.
<P>
	On top of the $1.6 billion, western farmers will receive 
another $1 billion in loan guarantees and $300 million 
specifically earmarked for diversification. They are subsidizing 
the diversification of western farm products outright. These 
products will directly compete with Quebec products and this is 
what makes no sense: that close to $3 billion, of which 25 per 
cent comes from Quebec, will be dedicated to the cause of 
diversifying the economy in the west, which will eventually 
impinge on Quebec's share of the market.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We should give ourselves a good swift kick 
in the behind.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> That is the idea. And that is what the federal 
government is doing when it cuts some advantages and 
compensates one part of the country more than it should in a 
budget, while another region must content itself not only with a 
neutral budgetary position but must also assume some budget 
cuts without any compensation, as has happened to it time and 
time again. For example, the 30 per cent cut in dairy subsidies 
will hit Quebec the hardest. Why the hardest? Since about 50 per 
cent of dairy products, including cheese, yogurt and ice cream, 
are processed in Quebec, a large proportion of dairy producers 
live in that province. So let me tell you that the federal 
government's $35 million cut to dairy subsidies over the next 
two years is hitting Quebec hard.
<P>
	It could even be said that this is a special measure against 
Quebec and its dairy producers. Where is the compensation for 
this $35 million cut? Do you know what this represents, Madam 
Speaker? In Quebec, this represents dairy production losses of 
around $4,500 per farm on average. In ridings with many dairy 
farms, like my riding of Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, this 
represents losses of about $8,000 per farm.
<P>
	With annual net revenues of $25,000 per farm at the end of the 
fiscal year, you can say that this federal measure without any 
compensation, unlike what is being done in Western Canada, 
reduces Quebec dairy farmers' net revenues by about 25 per cent 
to 30 per cent. That is the federal budget for you, and that is why 
we are opposing it, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Shame!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Yes, it is a shame, because they tell us we must 
tighten our belts, while cutting $560 million in Western Canada 
but compensating by injecting $3 billion in that region. This 
does not make any sense.
<P>
	We are also opposed to the proposed measures related to 
international aid. They are cutting the international aid budget 
by $532 million, thus placing Canada, which already ranked 
pretty low in terms of the assistance provided to the millions of 
children who starve to death every year, at the bottom of the list 
of donor countries. When I see that, despite Canada's tradition 
of compassion, the federal government is maintaining until  
1997 the $1.5 billion in direct subsidies to business while 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10729"> 10729 </A></B>
<P>
cutting by $532 million the budget to help reduce child mortality 
around the world, I find this simply revolting.
<P>
	We oppose Bill C-73 resulting from the last budget because 
this budget forgets a fundamental consideration: the federal 
government's chronic debt problem.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	With the national debt currently standing at $548 billion, the 
federal government is responsible for over 70 per cent of the 
public debt burden in Canada. In terms of the size of the overall 
public debt, the debt of all levels of government put together, 
Canada ranks first among G-7 countries. Not a very enviable 
position.
<P>
	Just at the federal level, the debt is so huge that debt charges 
alone presently account for more than one third of the taxes paid 
by Quebecers and Canadians. In the case of Quebec, for 
example, this means that of the total amount paid by the people 
of Quebec in taxes of all sort, which is about $30 billion, $10 
billion goes to pay debt charges, that is to say the interest on this 
huge debt.
<P>
	The last budget does not provide any relief, none at all. To the 
point that, next year, the portion of the taxes paid by all the 
taxpayers in Quebec and Canada that will be required to service 
the debt, just to pay the interests on the federal debt, will be 
more than 37 per cent, or a 4 per cent increase in just one year. 
Before you know it, in four or five years, nearly half of the taxes 
paid by the taxpayers in Quebec and Canada will go to servicing 
the debt. If you extrapolate these figures, five or six years from 
now, the federal debt, which will have increased steadily since 
the Minister of Finance tabled this budget, will be between $750 
and $800 billion.
<P>
	If the federal debt is already a huge problem at $548 billion, 
you can imagine what a problem it will be at $800 billion. It will 
be a nightmare in terms of public financial management. It will 
be such a nightmare that the Minister of Finance tried-we can 
talk about the response of the financial markets-to do some 
window-dressing. He does not talk about the debt any more. He 
does not talk about it. But based on the assumptions and growth 
rates contained in his budget, you get this $800 billion figure. 
This is not a figment of our imagination: it is reality.
<P>
	Similarly, using the Minister of Finance's own calculations 
and the same growth rates, we arrived at the following 
conclusion: in five years, the percentage will be 50 per cent. In 
other words, the proportion of tax revenues allocated to federal 
programs, including transfers to provinces and individuals, and 
the proportion used to pay the interest on the debt will be the 
same. One year later, the tax revenues used to pay the interest on 
the debt will be greater than those allocated to federal transfers 
to provinces and individuals.
<P>
	In the private sector, if we had a product to sell and if interest 
costs related to that product were greater than its value, we 
would have declared bankruptcy a long time ago, we would have 
gone belly up as they say. That will happen in five or six years, 
and this is what the Minister of Finance tried to hide from 
Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	There are two major reasons for this enormous, chronic and 
inescapable federal debt. First, the federal system is obsolete. It 
can no longer meet the challenges of the nineties and of the year 
2000; it does nothing to help the country adjust to the new 
international economy by being productive and competitive, by 
having the best possible products and skilled workers, and by 
striving to provide humane conditions in this new competitive 
environment. Such support is greatly lacking in Canada right 
now, but we hope to find in Quebec.
<P>
	The second main reason why we have such an enormous debt 
is what is called the structural deficit. We are not making that 
up: it is mentioned in the Minister of Finance's documents and it 
has been for about seven years in the documents released by his 
department. What do these documents say?
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian economy does not generate enough jobs. Since 
the unemployment level for the next three years is expected to 
reach 9.5 per cent in Canada and about 12 per cent in Quebec, it 
is obvious that we have a problem here. The annual deficit and 
the debt increase are caused by the fact that the people who do 
not work do not pay taxes, which means a loss in tax revenues. 
This loss of revenues is reflected in the deficit and then in the 
debt. This is the structural component of our deficit and our 
debt.
<P>
	What does it do? It creates a spiral: we have foregone tax 
revenues, a higher deficit, a steadily increasing debt, higher 
interest rates following incursion into the capital markets and 
foreign borrowing, investors demanding incentives because our 
debt in not under control, which means we pay more interest and 
our debt service costs are on the rise.
<P>
	Our debt service costs are rising, which entails another 
increase in interest rates, the expected investments are not 
forthcoming and all the jobs that we were promised and that we 
need-we are 800,000 jobs short-will not be created. This is 
the structural component of our deficit and our debt, and it never 
changes.
<P>
	Why? Because there is no major change to this structural 
component in what was tabled by the finance minister. It 
remains with all the duplications, overlapping, federal 
interference and, now that the federal government can no longer 
live beyond its means, it is reducing its vision to its means. It 
goes after the provinces, imposing national standards and 
pretending 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10730"> 10730 </A></B>
<P>
to have the right to do so for ever and ever. That is what flexible 
federalism is all about.
<P>
	For all these reasons, the official opposition will reject Bill 
C-73 at third reading. This bill to provide borrowing authority 
stems directly from the budget. We, and Quebecers with us, have 
enough reasons to reject this bill. I remind you that 58 per cent 
of Quebecers are against this budget. They are convinced that it 
undermines job creation and economic recovery and that it does 
nothing to solve the basic debt problem, as I just explained. 
Therefore, we will reject it.
<P>
	I would like to send a message to my fellow Quebecers. I 
would like to ask them what they want for the years to come. Do 
they want to continue to live in a system which will at best make 
decisions they will not necessarily agree with, because the Bloc 
represents only 25 per cent of the votes in this Parliament? 
Twenty-five per cent of a board of trustees, that is not much.
<P>
	Do they want to go on within a system which has nothing to do 
any more with the image we have of a government of the 90s and 
beyond, with how we have been been percieving our society for 
the last 30 years? An image that we have tried to fashion through 
various constitutional conferences, through various 
negotiations, through various submissions in the history of 
Quebec?
<P>
	Quebecers have been very patient. One could hardly be more 
patient than we have been over the past 30 years, trying to 
change the system a little so as to better reflect a reality that we 
have wanted to see reflected since 1867, that is the reality of two 
founding nations with some kind of recognition of Quebecers' 
legitimate aspirations.
<P>
	Finally, we have two choices. We can stay in a system that is 
sinking-a big boat that is taking in water on all sides-a system 
that neither the federal government nor English Canada want to 
reform. This system may be satisfactory for English Canada, but 
it cannot be satisfactory for Quebecers with their particular 
aspirations.
<P>
	Do we want to stay in this system or seize the opportunity that 
is offered to us this year to leave it voluntarily, maintaining the 
peace of mind that has motivated us over the last seven years 
since the failure of the Meech Lake Accord?
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Would it not be preferable to get out of this system in a 
democratic way and to envision a less morose future than what 
we have had for several years with a system that is continually 
slowing down and that is becoming a burden, a ball and chain for 
Quebec and Canada's economic advancement?
<P>
	I would say that if my fellow citizens get out of this system, 
they must do so by ignoring the fear-mongering campaigns and 
also ignoring the distorted analyses based on dubious 
methodologies and often containing a web of untruth.
<P>
	Last week-end, I had the opportunity to take a look at one of 
these truncated analyses, one that distorts reality. I am talking 
here about the analysis made by Mr. Marcel Côté, from SECOR, 
and contained in a book entitled <I>Le rêve de la Terre promise ou le 
coût de l'indépendance</I>. That gives me an opportunity to digress 
somewhat, using the distorted elements of this analysis. Mr. 
Côté presents 15 questions on sovereignty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If the 
hon. member wishes to send a message to his constituents, he 
could probably use the post office or Statements by Members 
and not when commenting on a borrowing bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry but that is a 
point of debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, I fully intend to prove that 
what I am saying is relevant to the budget.
<P>
	I will not deal with all fifteen points raised and agreed by Mr. 
Côté. One is entitled to query these, however. I did select five 
which deserve a somewhat different treatment based on facts, on 
the truth, on genuine scientific methods and not on political bias 
and the kind of methods for which Mr. Côté is unique or 
occasionally, on a tissue of lies.
<P>
	I will address point six in Mr. Côté's document.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, since you asked the hon. member to sit down 
and show respect for the official opposition, I think he should 
show some respect for your decision as well.
<P>
	Point six. Mr. Côté wonders what was the net benefit to 
Quebecers from the federal budget. You know what he said? 
Three billion. In other words, Quebecers get three billion more 
from the federal government than they contribute to the federal 
treasury. I say that is not true and is not borne out by the facts.
<P>
	In 1991, when the Bélanger-Campeau Commission 
conducted its hearings, even André Raynauld, who is not known 
for his sovereignist views, concluded on the basis of a genuine 
analysis of public finances in Quebec and Canada that at the 
time, we were receiving more or less what we were paying to the 
federal government. In other words, the taxes we as Quebecers 
paid into the federal treasury and the transfer payments made by 
the federal government amounted to about the same, until 1988. 
Subsequently, we started getting less. And now, after the last 
two budgets and especially the last one, we see that, according to 
the experts where there used to be a surplus, there is now a 
deficit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10731"> 10731 </A></B>
<P>
	Take the Unemployment Insurance Fund. There is no surplus 
over what employers and employees in Quebec pay in to the 
fund. There is now a potential loss of $118 million. In other 
words, what the federal government pays in the form of 
unemployment insurance benefits in Quebec will be $118 
million less than was contributed by Quebec employers and 
employees. The same applies to transfer payments. Mr. Côté is 
definitely out to lunch.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Federal transfer payments to Quebec were cut by 32 per cent 
for the three year period from 1994 to 1997. Therefore, in my 
opinion, Quebecers are currently in a deficit position when we 
compare the amount of taxes and income taxes that they pay to 
federal coffers with what the federal government spends and 
invests in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	So, why did Mr. Côté say what he did? Do you know why? 
Because he took federal spending as a whole and divided it by 
the population. This methodology is not only dubious, it is also 
dishonest. As an economist, Mr. Côté has no right to make such a 
calculation. He does not have the right and, what makes it worse, 
he knows it. He knows, for example, that Quebec never gets one 
quarter of research and development spending or agricultural 
spending, and that, from 1984 to 1993, the federal government 
only spent 16 per cent of its total investments in Canada in the 
province of Quebec, although Quebec accounts for one quarter 
of the population. He knows this but it did not stop him from 
saying such rubbish.
<P>
	I am happy to see that I have a few minutes more. I will go on 
to point 7. What does Mr. Côté say a sovereign Quebec could 
hope to save by eliminating overlap? No more than $500 
million.
<P>
	How did Mr. Côté arrive at his figures? I am going to let you in 
on it. I would like to say, though, that I am almost ashamed to 
tell you because it puts economists in such a bad light. He took 
10 per cent of the federal government's operating budget, so 10 
per cent of $18 billion is $1.8 billion, and he multiplied it by 25 
per cent, which is the population of Quebec, and he got $500 
million. Just imagine, Madam Speaker! I have never seen such 
an analysis, except the utterly preposterous one which the Royal 
Bank delivered during the Charlottetown debate, according to 
which almost one half of Canada's population would flee to the 
United States. Mr. Côté's calculations are not any better.
<P>
	In 1991, the Bélanger-Campeau Commission, which used 
exact and scientific sector analysis methods, calculated that, for 
three items of expenditure alone, Quebec would save $800 
million: $289 million in tax and income tax administration; 
$233 million in the communication and transportation sectors; 
$275 million in the job training sector (this figure was issued by 
Gil Rémillard and Marcel Bourbeau).
<P>
	Using a ludicrous methodology, Mr. Côté says that we will be 
lucky if we save $500 million overall.
<P>
	When we speak of duplication and overlap, we are not just 
speaking of administrative expenses. We are speaking of 
inconsistent policies, manpower policies that have the federal 
government going in one direction and the government of 
Quebec going in another, with the result that at a certain point no 
one knows what anyone else is doing and there is no more 
sustainable job creation. These are more of the costs of 
duplication and overlap.
<P>
	The endless negotiations on regional development are another 
example of costly duplication and overlap. They go on for years 
and years, while entire regions are left hanging. This is the cost 
of duplication and overlap, not just ordinary administrative 
costs, especially according to the arbitrary and completely 
ridiculous method used by Mr. Côté.
<P>
	Mr. Côté's eighth question was what percentage of the debt 
would Quebec inherit? He starts out by saying that it will be 
according to population, therefore 25 per cent. Why would we 
pay more than our share of the debt today? Why, when 
Quebecers are covering 23 per cent of the cost of servicing the 
debt now through the taxes they pay, would they take on 25 per 
cent the day after sovereignty? Here, already, Mr. Côté seems 
intent on artificially inflating the figures he is presenting. We 
are paying 23 per cent of the cost of servicing the debt at the 
present time and it is too much.
<P>
	Why is it too much? Because our assets in Quebec do not 
justify our paying 23 per cent annually to help service the debt. 
And the Bélanger-Campeau Commission made it very clear, 
with three international observers who confirmed the 
commission's calculations. The proportion of assets in Quebec 
is 18.5 per cent, and it is therefore 18.5 per cent of the debt that 
the government of Quebec would inherit, with sovereignty.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	So, why did Marcel Côté ignore this fact? Why did Mr. Côté, 
who has a degree in economy, choose to ignore a basic fact, 
unless he has forgotten what he learned in his economics 
classes, in which case he can no longer claim to be an economics 
expert or write books on the costs of sovereignty with titles such 
as <I>Le rêve de la Terre promise</I>.
<P>
	One last thing. I would like, at this stage, to say that this man 
really talked through his hat. He does not know the first thing 
about the subject and it shows. Third, Mr. Côté wonders if 
Quebec dairy producers could continue to sell their products to 
Canada at twice the world price and expect to receive what 
amounts to several millions in subsidy from Canadian 
consumers every year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10732"> 10732 </A></B>
<P>
	Three things are incorrect in this short statement. First, it is 
incorrect to say that the price of dairy products in Canada and 
Quebec is twice the price on the international market. It is not 
true. Second, dairy production, which is subject to 
interprovincial distribution through quotas, is centred on 
processing milk to make cheese, yogurt, ice cream, mozzarella 
and what not. This is the part to which an act of Parliament and a 
federal milk subsidy apply.
<P>
	If our products in Quebec were not competitive, if they were 
not competitive in price and quality, they would not sell on the 
Quebec market, they would not sell on the Ontarian market or 
even in some specific segments of the American market. They 
would not anywhere. The fact is that Quebec's milk production 
is quite competitive and if 50 per cent of all the industrial milk 
produced in Canada is currently produced in Quebec, it is 
because we have great producers in Quebec. We have the best, 
and I dare you to compare the productivity of Quebec milk 
producers with that of American producers.
<P>
	What we have been presented with is basically a tissue of 
fabrications, as a scare tactic, and let me tell you that while 
cut-throat competition may have characterized international 
trade before 1947, it is no longer the case. It is no longer a free 
for all. There are specific rules, the GATT rules or the rules of 
the World Trade Organization. According to these rules, no 
GATT member, whether it is Canada, Quebec or the United 
States, regardless of its size or importance, can block the export 
of dairy or other products to its territory, for reasons of politics 
or resentment following a democratic vote by Quebecers in 
favour of sovereignty. So, Mr. Côté can go back to the drawing 
board.
<P>
	As regards the issue being debated here, the official 
opposition will oppose Bill C-73, which provides borrowing 
authority to the government, since it is the direct consequence of 
the Minister of Finance's budget, which is fundamentally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Sherbrooke-Stay in School Program.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a privilege and probably an honour to stand in the 
House and speak to this borrowing bill.
<P>
	I have heard a number of comments from the Liberal side and 
also from the hon. Bloc people. During my speech I will point 
out that sometimes we in the west also feel that we are 
mistreated and we have some reasons to gripe about things.
<P>
	By now we are probably all aware that Liberal governments of 
the past owned the patent on borrowing. It has become clear that 
they know how to borrow and they love to borrow.
<P>
	My brother who is a medical doctor always tells me that when 
you have a problem with a patient and you cannot pinpoint what 
exactly his ailment is you should look back into the medical 
history of that person, a generation or two, and see what the 
family history tells of their previous problems. After looking at 
the Liberal government we start to realize that it has a borrowing 
problem, probably called spendingitis. It seems to be more or 
less the system that it used during the seventies and early 
eighties.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	I would like to go back to a few comments on Liberal 
governments of the past so that we can put into context why we 
are having this problem.
<P>
	When I came home from the Soviet Union in 1981, where I 
saw my $3.50 wheat was being sold for $20 a bushel to the 
citizens there so they could keep their livestock alive, it 
bothered me. What bothered me more was seeing in the local 
paper shortly after I got back that the Soviets were applying for 
credit from the western nations to a tune of $40 billion for a 
period of 30 years at 4 per cent.
<P>
	I thought that sounded interesting. The Liberal government at 
that time in 1981 were trying to bring down inflation and we 
were saddled with 24 per cent interest rates in the farming 
community. I wondered how the Soviets could try to coerce us 
into borrowing money at that rate.
<P>
	I thought it might be interesting to read through <I>Hansard</I> and 
see what really happened with that request. This is what I found. 
This is the hon. member for Winnipeg-Assiniboia speaking on 
Bill C-130, an act to authorize continual financial assistance to 
be provided to certain international financial institutions. This 
is from <I>Hansard</I>, so it is recorded in history and will probably 
stay there for all time. It states: ``I have considerable experience 
with CIDA and foreign aid going back to 1975 when the Liberal 
government tried to conceal information regarding loans to 
Cuba. It provided public information that the loans were being 
made at an interest rate of 6 per cent and higher.
<P>
	However, I obtained internal documents which showed that it 
was concealing the interest rate being charged on loans to Cuba 
which was zero and 3 per cent. Also we are well aware of the low 
interest rate loans to the Russians for the building of a gas 
pipeline.
<P>
	The Liberal government is borrowing money at 17 and 18 per 
cent and lending it to the Russians at 12 per cent. This is a great 
loss to the Canadian people. In addition loans are being made for 
the building of statues in other countries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10733"> 10733 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1975 I presented a motion to the Standing Committee on 
External Affairs and and National Defence calling for a full 
scale investigation into foreign aid. I did this because of all the 
secret documentation which had come into my hands with 
regard to hidden loans, hidden percentages with regard to Cuba. 
This of course was defeated by the Liberal members on the 
committee. The last thing they wanted was an investigation into 
CIDA. I certainly commend you, Mr. Speaker, because you were 
the lone Liberal to vote with the Conservatives in the committee 
calling for a full scale investigation into CIDA''.
<P>
	Does that not remind us all of what we have been hearing in 
the House the last while? Spend more, borrow more, try to 
justify it by covering it up a bit.
<P>
	When I hear the Bloc members today complaining about the 
bad treatment they have had in the east, I would like to remind 
them that during the Liberal regime of the seventies, which was 
called the just society, we very quickly learned in the west that it 
meant just the east, not the west. One hundred billion dollars of 
national energy money was siphoned from the west into the east. 
If that is mistreating the east, I cannot really say where that 
theory came from.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Not only was the Liberal government not too concerned about 
the west, but to give us a goodbye it aimed its guns at the Crow 
and killed it dead. However it felt a little regret so it gave us the 
WGTA, which I consider as the Liberal vulture of this century. 
What did this Liberal vulture do for us? It gave us subsidies that 
guaranteed railways a return on investment and also a return on 
operations, no matter how efficient they were. That is why today 
we have strikes like the one presently going on.
<P>
	During this era the railways siphoned off $7 billion in 
subsidies. These subsidies did not go into the pockets of 
farmers. They probably went toward purchasing rail lines in the 
U.S. Today they own more track in the U.S. than they do in 
Canada. The CN and the CP can deliver grain on their tracks all 
the way to Mexico.
<P>
	The WGTA allowed the railways to enter into contracts with 
its workers where after eight years of work for the railway there 
was a lifetime guarantee of a job and pay. I wonder where the 
farmer has been considered and where these subsidies have 
gone.
<P>
	During all these years of Liberal and Conservative 
governments, we borrowed and borrowed. That is what we are 
debating again today. As farmers in the west we had to contend 
with the dusty red grain beetle. Today another insect has entered 
our grain bins. I want to call it the red book worm.
<P>
	This red book worm is not just eating up the grain, it has taken 
our bins, our machinery and our land. How we are going to 
exterminate it, I do not know. I do know we have to put up with it 
for at least another three years.
<P>
	In 1984 when the Liberals turned their patent on borrowing 
over to the Conservatives, the national debt was $200 billion. 
During the nine years of Conservative government, it was 
increased to $450 billion.
<P>
	It is interesting. I do not think the Liberal members in the 
House did too bad at that time. For their troubles and their 
efforts in the House, they somehow continued to build up MP 
pensions which today are worth $120 million, according to the 
National Citizens' Coalition.
<P>
	Is it any wonder that we have to borrow and borrow instead of 
paying some back? It makes me wonder when the taxpayer is 
finally going to stand up and say: ``This is enough''. We heard 
quite a bit of that recently. Maybe it is sometimes wise to let a 
symptom grow until it finally busts a vein or kills the whole 
system. That is probably what we will experience in the next 
Parliament.
<P>
	Last session this Parliament was controlled by a party that can 
now get into a Honda Civic. Soon we may have another one that 
only needs a table for one. It is almost enlightening to witness 
that.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	During 1993 we in the west heard so much about this 
tremendous Liberal machine, this red book machine that was 
going to change things around just like the Mulroney 
government was going to do. The Liberals claimed they had the 
people, they had the plan: jobs, jobs, jobs. I wonder what those 
at the research station in Morden say after losing 40 per cent of 
their jobs and PSAC losing 45,000. The plan got sidetracked a 
little bit.
<P>
	The Liberal ticket in 1993 was to jump on board; get on the 
Liberal train. ``This is the train that is going to board at the land 
of opportunity and take you to the promised land of milk and 
honey,'' as the Quebec members would say. After two budgets, I 
think we should rename the train the Liberal train to ruination. 
Board at Fantasyland; pass through Hooterville and Never 
Never Land; final destination: Poverty Point, the land without 
milk, bread or money.
<P>
	I had the pleasant experience of getting a phone call just 
before the break from the Manitoba dairy farmers and milk 
producers. They wanted to talk to me all of a sudden. During the 
election all I heard was to vote everything else but Reform. All 
of a sudden, these people wanted to talk to me.
<P>
	I made the effort and said I would talk. I appreciate visiting. I 
asked them what was the concern. They said that during the 
election they heard the Liberals promising how they would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10734"> 10734 </A></B>
<P>
protect article XI and how they would support the dairy farmer, 
and how they would make this thing as golden as they could for 
all the dairy producers. I was told that the Liberal dairy policy 
kicked the farmer's milk bucket over into the gutter.
<P>
	They have lost 30 per cent of their subsidies. That is 
protecting the dairy farmer. They told me I had warned them that 
subsidies would have go to, that they would have to go 
tariffication. It makes me feel pretty good that once in a while I 
do seem to side with the right people. It is not very often when 
you are a farmer, but in this instance I was right.
<P>
	What the dairymen told me was astounding. They said they 
did not mind losing 30 per cent of their subsidies but the Liberal 
dairy policy took its dirty ugly tail and hit them another swipe 
right in the eyes. The Liberals did away with the funding for the 
genetic recording and milk allocation programs, while the 
United States increased the program by $600 million. This is the 
level playing ground that the Liberals are giving to the dairy 
policy.
<P>
	I can assure you I think these people will make an <I>x</I> twice 
before the Liberals in the next election, striking out the name 
and not voting for it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crawford:</B> Never.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> We will see. I think there will be some 
changes made. Who knows what can happen?
<P>
	I would like to clear up a few misconceptions this 
afternoon-if I have the time but it could take more than I 
have-that farmers have been getting all these transportation 
subsidies. I have learned a few things since I have come to sit on 
the transportation committee. I hope the hon. members from 
Quebec are listening.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	I really love Thunder Bay port because while I was farming, 
every time I turned on the combine it went on strike. You can see 
my love for that nice little port. In testimony before us at 
Thunder Bay, as the witnesses came before us, I was astounded I 
had never heard about some of these things.
<P>
	Do you know that a pilot who gets on a ship at Montreal and 
takes that ship through the locks and the lakes up to Thunder Bay 
charges just approximately $2.65 a tonne for his services? This 
is 15 per cent of the total freight cost from Thunder Bay to 
northern Europe. These pilots-I call them pirates, not 
pilots-charge a range of from $3,800 to $5,000 a day. That is 
where grain transportation subsidies are going. No farmer, no 
manufacturer, no producer or processor ever can expect wages 
like that. That is not the whole side of that story.
<P>
	This pilot association is run by a federal crown corporation 
which over the last 20 years has cost the taxpayer $50 million. 
This year, that corporation is going to be in debt to the tune of $5 
to $7 million. Are you surprised why we have to continue 
borrowing? This borrowing disease, this spending-itis is going 
to bankrupt this country one of these days. I am wondering what 
labour unions will say then.
<P>
	Another few interesting facts I found out, usually when we 
talk of $500 million in transportation subsidies to farmers, that 
is all somewhere in the farmer's pocket or bankbook. I will 
throw in a few more figures and tell you what fair treatment we 
do get by some of our terminals.
<P>
	In Thunder Bay, Cargill Grain pays $1.002 million in property 
taxes. A couple of hundred kilometres down the road at Duluth, 
$64,000 is paid. Then we wonder why farmers are looking south 
of the border to try to move some grain.
<P>
	I will give some stats I received at these hearings. They are 
based on tonnages of storage and property tax per tonne. At 
Vancouver it costs $6.27 per tonne of storage for property taxes. 
At Thunder Bay it costs $8.03 per tonne of storage for a 
terminal. At Duluth it costs the American farmer 27 cents. AGP, 
Inc., another grain terminal, is paying 15 cents. And we as 
farmers are being accused of taking subsidies. These subsidies 
are going to taxes that have been developed by overspending, 
mismanagement and corruption.
<P>
	I want to tell the Liberal members from the west coast when 
the transport minister talks of becoming a market economy and 
becoming more efficient, the farmers with some government 
help did build the Prince Rupert high throughput elevator so that 
we could move grain faster. But what has happened there? 
Because we can move it faster than Vancouver, we are not 
paying $6.27 per tonne. We are paying $16.43 per tonne for 
property taxes. Now tell me, how do you think the producer can 
stay alive with those types of inconsistencies and 
discrimination?
<P>
	The story does not end at Thunder Bay. Manitoba Pool 
Elevators testified and pointed out that for the same type of 
operation in Thunder Bay, it also paid $110,196 in corporation 
taxes. In British Columbia $18,615 was paid for the same 
amount of operations.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	After hearing these figures when the labour unions came 
before us I could hardly sit still. I told those gentlemen that I 
knew a lot of times we in the west were being downtrodden but I 
never thought it was that bad. I said that when I went home I 
would tell every grain farmer not to ship one more bushel of 
grain through Thunder Bay because I am fed up with it. If I have 
to, I will take every bushel of grain to Churchill by dogsled 
before I will ship a bushel to Thunder Bay. Something people 
have to start realizing is that things have to change or there will 
be no producers left.
<P>
	If they want to realize why we have to borrow because of this 
WGTA, which I called the vulture, in testimony before the 
standing committee on agriculture Ted Allen said that they have 
not rationalized the rail system or the elevator system in a very 
significant way or as significantly as they should have for about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10735"> 10735 </A></B>
<P>
10 years because the Western Grain Transportation Act 
encouraged them not to make those changes.
<P>
	Now we have a system that is 10 years behind the American 
system. This Liberal government is throwing the whole mess on 
the farmers' backs saying: ``Fix it. We got you into the mess. 
Here it is. Help yourselves''. It astounds me that politicians 
cannot see that if they do not have producers or manufacturers 
they do not need a rail system. One of these days we will smarten 
up and realize that.
<P>
	How inefficient is this system? I would like to read a few 
statements made by Ted Allen. Last summer he said: ``We 
moved two vessels seven times to different terminals for a load 
of barley. It took a long time. Every time one of these vessels 
moved one way, it cost $18,000''. Now you are trying to tell me 
that is the farmers' way of doing business?
<P>
	A 25,000 tonne vessel went to Mexico in November 1994 on 
which there was loaded 9,000 tonnes of No. 1 Red, 5,000 tonnes 
of No. 2 Red and the balance, less than half, was No. 3 Red. Who 
do you think paid for that? The western farmer.
<P>
	This government tries to tell us that Mexico is dictating to us 
telling us to take the subsidies off grain transportation or it will 
not buy. Something is wrong in this country when a government 
that has a $2.5 billion trade surplus with us tells us what we have 
to do.
<P>
	I have raised four children and four grandsons. When I see my 
wife giving an equal number of crayons to the youngsters to play 
with and one of them says: ``My colour is not right, I want 
yours,'' and the other child does not ask for one in return, very 
soon one of the kids is without crayons. That is exactly what has 
happened to our agriculture policy. Everybody has taken our 
crayons and now we have nothing left to colour with. It is sad but 
it is a fact.
<P>
	There are a few other statements I would like to read. I was 
pleased last December when the transport minister 
acknowledged that labour on the Canadian railways was 64 per 
cent as efficient as the U.S. We were losing about 40 per cent 
efficiency in the labour force on the train system.
<P>
	Using simple mathematics, I have used 50 per cent, giving 
them the benefit of the doubt. If 50 per cent of the labour costs 
are wasted, out of the 22 million tonnes of grain we export and 
the $10 million we ship internally farmers lose $220 million. 
That sounds as if the farmers are getting rich on transportation 
subsidies.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Not only that, there is good reason to wonder why the grain 
elevator system tariffs are as high as they are. When we compare 
the results of shipping through the U.S. on terminal and primary 
elevator tariffs, we lose roughly another $360 million. There is 
over $500 million gone right there. Where are farmers putting 
the money into their pockets? I hope someday we become honest 
enough to look at these problems and address them so we can 
resolve them.
<P>
	It is always encouraging to see some people trying to solve 
these problems. I am impressed with some of the statements we 
have heard from members on the opposite side. I think if they 
would really buckle down and do what they are saying, a lot of 
things would get resolved.
<P>
	Verbal agreements or promotions of some things are not as 
good as the real thing. I was not surprised by some of the 
statistics in the papers when Team Canada went off to Europe. It 
was to really promote some industries and get some extra 
business for this country.
<P>
	I could not believe some of the results that came back from 
that meeting. I had been talking in the House about the 
agriculture subsidies, the boneless beef coming into Canada and 
how the GATT had more or less set quotas of 75,000 tonnes. 
Then I saw the trade minister in Australia and New Zealand 
promoting more offshore beef into this country while we were 
being told at the same time to diversify by increasing beef and 
pork production.
<P>
	I have seen them over import 30-some thousand tonnes of 
boneless beef which was more than the GATT organizations had 
set for a quota; 30,000 tonnes went straight from Canada into the 
U.S. It reminds me very much of the cap that was put on our 
wheat because of our wheat board and grain companies dumping 
grain.
<P>
	The problem here again is that Australia and New Zealand 
have a $300 million trade surplus with us. We are borrowing this 
money. What are we paying for interest? What is it costing us for 
jobs? Five jobs are lost for every boner cow exported to the U.S. 
instead of doing it ourselves. Is this job creation?
<P>
	It really took the cake when Xcan, which I imagine was a 
member of the Team Canada approach, went to China and 
probably started looking at investment opportunities. There was 
a news release on March 2. This astounds me: ``Pools pull out of 
China project''.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	The three prairie wheat pools have decided to drop out of a 
malting barley plant development in China. The pools, along 
with the ITI world investment group, were negotiating with the 
Chinese to build a $58.8 million malting plant in Quingdao, 
China. Barley would be sourced in Canada and Chinese beer 
would be brought back into this country. That is diversification. 
That is the type of support we get from our own agriculture 
community. Where do we go next?
<P>
	I would like to dwell for a few minutes on an issue that has 
been very near and dear to my heart, the inquiry I asked the 
justice minister to make into the dumping of Canadian wheat 
into the U.S. I provided the facts I had from farmers who had 
taken samples and had given me the information. I acquired the 
documents from the U.S. customs people on what had happened. 
When I found out that $3.50 a bushel of wheat was being 
exported into the U.S. by Sask-Pool at $2.02 to $2.05, I could 
not believe it. For every bushel of grain that we are exporting at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10736"> 10736 </A></B>
<P>
that price into the U.S. we are hurting our own  economy because 
we are losing millions of dollars that could be running our 
country and promoting more industry.
<P>
	When this hit the news the co-operator phoned Lorne Hehn, 
the chief commissioner for the Canadian Wheat Board. Mr. 
Hehn said: ``Sales of 1992 wheat to American companies could 
have lowered prices or plugged individual elevators, but I don't 
believe our sales into those areas really impacted on the price in 
a negative way''. One can dump grain at lower prices and plug 
elevators and it is still not impacting in a negative way. This is 
his reason: ``We were very careful about that factor. Prices for 
feed wheat rose during the year, while large Canadian sales were 
being made so that proves that price pressure was not there''.
<P>
	When in an up market we can dump grain into the U.S. at half 
price and the market continues to go up, how is that helping our 
country? Can members see why American farmers are furious? I 
do not blame them one bit. It is unbelievable but those are the 
words of Mr. Hehn.
<P>
	What do we do about it? I have waited for two months now to 
see what is going to happen and so far nothing has happened. I 
made a challenge under that news release on behalf of the pasta 
producers in western Canada. They came to see me around the 
middle of November, claiming this heavily subsidized pasta 
from Italy was coming into our country and they could not afford 
to process at that price any more.
<P>
	When I showed my facts and figures to the prairie pools which 
were a little upset about my claims, I do not know what 
happened. They all of a sudden sat back and had no answers. 
This is what is happening in our pasta industry today.
<P>
	We sell durum wheat to the Americans for the pasta industry. 
We sell it to the Italians. The Americans bring back into this 
country on a yearly basis about 40.896 million kilograms of 
pasta for a value of $84 million. This pasta is costing us about $2 
per kilogram. The Italians ship in 17 million kilograms of pasta 
at $19 million, about half the price the Americans are putting 
their pasta into this country for.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	I asked representatives at the prairie pools if they could 
explain how we can sell durum wheat to Italy, ship it over there, 
have it manufactured and bring it back into this country for half 
the price. It is not subsidized. They just shook their heads and 
said they have no explanation.
<P>
	Do we know what that means in Canadian dollars? I wish 
somebody would figure it out. Italy has a $982 million trade 
surplus with Canada. We are borrowing almost a billion dollars 
to have the Italians process pasta and then ship it back into our 
country and we pay the interest. That is supposed to build a 
country? That is supposed to help us diversify? I wonder how. I 
hope somebody can explain that to me.
<P>
	We have heard so much about R and D, about where the money 
is really coming from. The Reform Party has said time and time 
again that R and D is one of the most important things and we 
will never cut that back.
<P>
	Here is a statement a Liberal member made in Manitoba. I feel 
these people do have a grip on things but they are afraid to stand 
up for what they believe in. The government member needs to 
focus on the fact that dollars spent on research and development 
are returned 10:1 in the livestock field and 40:1 in grain. He said 
currently only 17 per cent of government spending on 
agriculture goes to R and D. What an enlightening statement 
from an hon. Liberal member.
<P>
	I will point out what the government has done for R and D. 
While a budget background document cites a 11 per cent cut to 
agriculture research, almost half the total, 2,069, job cuts came 
in research; 779 research scientists will retire or join the UI 
fleet; 138 vacancies will not be filled. While the white coats may 
have been hit hard by the budget, the white collars survived 
relatively unscathed; 149 full time positions were removed from 
the corporate services. The fat in Ottawa continues while people 
in the rest of the country get cut.
<P>
	I encourage members to not only stand up and make 
comments but provide action. History will record it, no matter 
how we joke about it. When I read in <I>Hansard</I> about what took 
place in the 1970s and 1980s, it is there forever, and that is 
exactly what is going to happen here.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I wish to remind the 
House that we are now starting the five hours of debate. Each 
speaker will have 20 minutes followed by a 10 minute period for 
questions and comments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
be sharing my time with my hon. colleague for Waterloo. I have 
been listening to my fellow colleagues from the Bloc and the 
Reform. I felt very depressed when they talked about history and 
all the things that have gone wrong in the country.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	The reality is we have a very good and very strong country 
with a bright future. It is five years before the 21st century and it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10737"> 10737 </A></B>
<P>
is time to focus on how we need to change. We have had a good 
history together but there are things that have to change in the 
country. That is what the budget and the borrowing authority are 
linked together to do.
<P>
	My colleagues have possibly missed the real point of the 
budget. I became involved in politics and came to the House for 
some of the very fundamental reasons we are discussing today. I 
was very concerned about where our country was going 
economically.
<P>
	I can see where we have overborrowed and where we have 
made lots of mistakes. We made genuine mistakes because we 
wanted to do the right things. In some ways they went askew but 
we are learning the process of government. The budget is an 
attempt to address how we will change. I would like to deal with 
the basic concept of how the budget is about change and about a 
new future for Canada.
<P>
	I took the time to go to my riding where I conducted a number 
of tax forums with the professional community and lay people. 
While there were some exceptions to parts of the budget, they 
were all very supportive. They said that it was about time a 
government had taken leadership to try to move us away from 
our debt and deficit problems to a new tomorrow. The younger 
generations were concerned that they would never have better 
incomes or a better way of life than their parents. These negative 
aspects existed prior to the budget. The country feels a lot better 
today because of the actions of the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In what ways are we changing? We could talk about the 
history of the country which is good. I am a great believer in 
history. The lessons of the past teach us a lot about the future. 
Also some of the things we did in the past have not worked very 
well.
<P>
	Basically the budget is about seeing government a little 
differently than we possibly have in the past. We see 
government today as being a referee of the country, a referee 
between business groups and individuals, making certain that 
people disenfranchised by the system become part of the system 
and making certain that the wealthy do not abuse their power. 
Some things in the budget try to strike a path toward the 21st 
century in which all Canadians can share.
<P>
	How is the budget different? I do not remember a government 
bringing in a budget like the one for this fiscal year which was 
$2 billion lower than projected. I do not remember that in my 
lifetime. We have developed a whole culture of assuming that 
every time a government brings down a budget it will overshoot 
it. The government did just the reverse and the people of Canada 
are happy about it.
<P>
	How are some of the things we have done in the past being 
addressed in the budget? We have a bloated civil service. It is 
not the fault of people in the civil service. Nor is it the fault of 
anyone in particular. It just happened. It happened in all other 
governmental administrations in the western world.
<P>
	Technology has caught up to Canada. Sometimes it caught up 
with us a lot faster than we wanted it to. In some ways people are 
having problems with job security because the country is being 
pushed into a technological framework with which we have to 
deal. It is global. It not only affects Canada. It affects all 
countries of the world. We will either be part of it or we will be 
washed up on the shores of disaster by not taking it into account.
<P>
	We need to restructure the civil service in fundamental ways. 
Not only do we need to reduce some of the numbers within the 
civil service. We need to do it equitably as well.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	There is a human side to the downsizing buzzword. There are 
real people involved. The government is committed to finding 
approaches to retraining and to finding new entrepreneurial 
skills so people will be able to share in the massive expansion of 
our labour market which saw over 422,000 new jobs created last 
year.
<P>
	By restructuring the civil service we are also talking about a 
new way of government. We want the civil service to be more 
responsive to the needs and the desires not only of government 
but of the people generally. It should be responsive to the needs 
of the community. We need more quantifiable measurement 
tools to remunerate people and progress them based on their 
success. This is healthy for government and for the civil service 
because it gives them a future and it gives them a challenge. 
After all, that is what most human animals really want.
<P>
	What other areas do we need to change? The government has 
come to the conclusion that it cannot be an interventionist in the 
economy any more. In past times it has worked; new industries 
and so forth have been created. Today we simply cannot afford it 
and it has not been very efficient. I think governments are 
realizing that business can run business a lot better than they 
can. That does not mean we give a total licence to business. It 
means that we temper it and recognize the rights of citizens. At 
the same time we realize that governments should simply 
govern and business should do business.
<P>
	How is this affected by the last budget? Clearly privatization 
of CN is one such aspect. Another one is the possible sell off of 
Petro-Canada. In a number of other areas the government will 
gradually withdraw and allow the private sector to make up the 
difference. It is good for the economy and it is good for the 
taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
	That came through loud and clear before the budget, indeed in 
the last two or three years. Canadians feel overtaxed. They do 
not think they are getting value for their tax dollars. They want 
us to be more efficient. That is what the budget was all about.
<P>
	We are downsizing. We are also cutting out subsidies to 
industry. Different types of people are living off the 
governmental system. One is industry living on subsidies and 
getting grants. These things will be curtailed. Most  people in 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10738"> 10738 </A></B>
<P>
business community recognize that it is no way to run a 
business.
<P>
	I referred to subsidies. We talked about rail subsidies with 
which I will deal in a minute. There are also grain subsidies. The 
first intentions of a subsidy program are usually good. We want 
to encourage some kind of action. Unfortunately what 
invariably happens-and history has told us-is that it becomes 
a dependency. It distorts trade.
<P>
	We have heard from many members about grain travelling all 
the way to Thunder Bay when it is on its way to California from 
Regina. These are some of the ridiculous aspects of 
subsidization. We need to create value added products in Canada 
and I believe by reducing subsidies we will do just that.
<P>
	Industrial milk production is another area that will be 
curtailed by subsidy programs. We need to become more 
competitive. GATT has told us that we will have to be part of an 
international marketplace. Gradually reducing tariffs is a way to 
make the Canadian economy much more efficient.
<P>
	The rail industry is on our mind these days. Much like 
government it has some prehistoric systems within its 
employment structure. Some of the contracts entered into 
hearken back over 100 years to a guild system. I understand 
there are still blacksmiths in some machine shops in Toronto. 
We pay people to be blacksmiths even though the whole industry 
has disappeared. We must revisit the contracts that people have 
with the government through crown corporations. We cannot let 
job security ruin the security of the whole country.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	We have to revisit these matters. We have to retool the 
country. We have to make it whole again. That is what the budget 
was all about. It was positive in terms of change for Canada and 
for the people of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I listened with great interest to my colleague from the 
government party. It is quite surprising since on the front page 
of this morning's <I>Le Droit</I>, a veteran of this party is described as 
a lion that turned into a mouse.
<P>
	How things change. When the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell sat on this side, he was a member 
of the so-called ``rat pack''. He was a very dedicated member, 
especially for his constituents, including the many farmers in 
his riding. The article says that the hon. member ``was 
uncompromising on agricultural issues, denouncing all the 
measures likely to affect the farmers making up a large part of 
his constituency. Today he never opens his mouth''.
<P>
	My colleague from the Liberal Party has 1,001 good things to 
say about the budget tabled a few weeks ago, for which we now 
have to provide borrowing authority. He is currently sitting on 
the government side. In four or eight years at the most, he will 
find himself on this side of the House, or elsewhere looking for 
employment. However, with some members of his party finding 
themselves again on the opposition side, he will rediscover his 
old rhetoric as a member of the opposition. I ask him whether he 
is really sincere in listing all the good things about the budget?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member of 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is still very much a lion in the 
House. I have heard him at various times assaulting the policies 
of the member's party and I think he does it quite well.
<P>
	Talking about absenteeism, we have in our minds how much 
space we will have on this side of the House at the end of June. 
We are certainly looking forward to it. I could certainly use a lot 
more space when I conduct my business. I would be happy to 
observe that when we come back.
<P>
	It is a borrowing bill. I would be happy to stand in the House 
some year when there is no borrowing bill. That is where the 
budget is taking the country. It will reduce the need to borrow on 
the market and hopefully get the country in the position where it 
can actually calculate surpluses.
<P>
	That is what this is all about. I am sorry if my colleague has 
missed that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak in favour of Bill C-73 
and to express my thoughts on the budget delivered by the 
finance minister on February 27.
<P>
	I will make a short response to the comments made by the 
Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party in debate. It is worth 
recalling the climate or the mood in the country before the 
budget was brought down on February 27 and the political 
instability posed by the possibility of Quebec separation, which 
continues to be a problem.
<P>
	The BQ complains that we cut too much and that we singled 
out Quebec for the cuts. The Reform Party claims we did not cut 
enough and that we were unfair to western Canada. If Bob Rae, 
the New Democratic premier of Ontario, had his say, he would 
tell us the budget was unfair to Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	These three groups were disappointed by what happened in 
the budget. The BQ is disappointed because the budget is no help 
to it in the upcoming referendum, where it will destroy Canada 
as we know it, as well as the economy of Quebec. The Reform 
Party found that its tax revolt did not materialize. The Reform 
Party has been doing its best to add a couple of percentage points 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10739"> 10739 </A></B>
<P>
to borrowing costs by forever preaching that our fiscal  situation 
is not sound. As for Bob Rae, he is also disappointed because he 
does not have a launching pad for the election in Ontario.
<P>
	The finance minister is putting Canada's fiscal house in order. 
The budget outlines concrete measures for real deficit reduction 
and fulfils commitments made by the Liberal Party during the 
election campaign. The government had to make difficult 
decisions in the budget process. The Kitchener-Waterloo 
<I>Record</I> from my community said the budget showed how tough 
it is to eliminate the deficit. The budget is tough but it is also 
fair. Everyone must share the burden of deficit reduction.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has worked hard to ensure that 
spending reductions are balanced evenly in all regions. The 
government's deficit targets are reasonable and achievable. The 
Reform Party should learn from the lessons of previous 
governments. We cannot balance the budget with unrealistic 
deficit targets.
<P>
	Over the last few months I have spoken to many constituents 
about what they wanted in the budget. They wanted the 
government to reduce the deficit through spending cuts and not 
through tax increases to the average citizen; do not tax health or 
dental plan benefits; do not tax RRSP contributions; increase 
taxes on large and profitable corporations; make the public 
service more efficient and effective; eliminate the waste of hard 
earned tax dollars.
<P>
	The budget shows the government has listened to the concerns 
of ordinary citizens. The Minister of Finance has focused his 
efforts on spending cuts. He recognizes the heavy tax burden 
borne by average Canadians. The minister has not raised 
personal income tax rates and has not taxed health or dental plan 
benefits. For most Canadians the RRSP contribution limit has 
not changed. The budget also makes taxation more equitable. 
Large corporations will pay their fair share of taxes. The 
profitable banks will pay a new temporary tax. The taxation of 
family trusts will be tightened. Individuals will no longer be 
able to defer tax on business or professional income.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has also made a commitment to 
reduce the size of government and eliminate unnecessary 
expenditures. The minister has said a basic philosophy of 
program review was the federal government should not be doing 
what someone else can do better.
<P>
	I urge the government to stop the military's rip off of 
taxpayers' dollars by inefficient management of government 
moves. The government should implement its own reports and 
contract out move management, as was recommended by so 
many of the government's committees.
<P>
	The government has consolidated its transfers to the 
provinces for health, post-secondary education and social 
assistance. The new Canada social transfers will be more 
effective and more sustainable than the old program funding. 
The CST will mean a drop of about 3 per cent  of provincial 
revenues. However, it will also give the provinces more 
flexibility to structure and innovate their social programs.
<P>
	This small change in funding to the provinces will not affect 
medicare. The federal government will still enforce national 
standards for health care. Medicare will continue to be 
universal, comprehensive, portable and accessible.
<P>
	The government has protected the average senior citizen with 
full indexation to protect them from inflation and old age 
security on the basis of family income.
<P>
	Education is an important concern to my constituents. The 
riding of Waterloo includes the campus of Conestoga College 
and two of Canada's leading universities, the University of 
Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University. The concentration of 
post-secondary students in the Waterloo region is the highest in 
the country.
<P>
	Post-secondary institutions have played a crucial role in my 
community's economy. The residence of the Waterloo riding are 
proud of Canada's record of excellence in post-secondary 
education. They also know our education system must continue 
to develop in order to meet the challenges of the next century.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	I am pleased the government has reaffirmed its commitment 
to our internationally renowned system of higher education. We 
need to ensure our post-secondary institutions are accessible to 
our youth who must compete in the international marketplace. 
We must maintain accessibility through the income contingent 
loan repayment scheme.
<P>
	The University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University 
are renowned for excellence in research. Because of their efforts 
the Waterloo area has become a breeding ground for 
entrepreneurs and information technology.
<P>
	Waterloo riding is home to 125 export oriented information 
technology companies. These companies have revenues of more 
than $600 million annually and employ 5,500 people in 
knowledge based jobs. By the year 2000 they project that 25,000 
to 30,000 people in the Waterloo region will be working in the 
area of information technology.
<P>
	It is imperative when we talk about wealth generation that we 
recognize our post-secondary institutions are vital to this effort. 
The government must make a strategic long term investment in 
wealth creation through research funding. The government has 
worked hard to limit the cuts to research and development. This 
is not enough. I encourage the Minister of Finance to do 
everything possible in these difficult times to continue to fund 
vital research that will help us compete in the next century.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	My constituents and all Canadians demanded a fair and 
equitable budget. This is what the government has delivered.
<P>
	There is an area in the budget on which I must express a bit of 
personal disappointment, the budget of the Solicitor General. 
That is one area which was not cut. There was a slight increase.
<P>
	I am concerned that there is more and more push in the climate 
of the House for longer sentences and putting more people in 
jail. This is a waste of resources. It costs much more to keep 
somebody in a federal penitentiary than to put somebody 
through a Ph.D. program. There are far too many people serving 
time in jail for non-violent crimes.
<P>
	There are much better ways of dealing with that. I hope in this 
session we will start working toward that and start 
implementing some programs we have talked about in the House 
such as crime prevention and community safety. We know every 
dollar we spend on prevention results in savings of $5 to $6 at 
the end of the line and we are not wasting the money on 
penitentiaries.
<P>
	Last year Canada once again was declared the best country in 
the world in which to live. The job we in the House have, not just 
the Liberals but all parties, is to make sure Canadians from coast 
to coast and in every province enjoy that kind of lifestyle in the 
future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the remarks of my colleague. I will 
especially dwell on his two or three first sentences. He said 
without any distinction that the current instability in Canada 
was the result of the actions of the Bloc Quebecois here, in this 
House. I am sorry but I think that all the Bloc Quebecois has 
done since its advent has been to inform Canadians of the 
position they are really in.
<P>
	I say that the political instability in Canada only reflects the 
situation of the federal system. I do not want to address again 
here all the issues that we raised, but I will simply go back to the 
theme of the debt.
<P>
	The debt has become so huge that the federal government is 
forced to borrow overseas to meet its commitments. It is as if 
one of my constituents visited his or her bank manager each and 
every year to ask for a loan to be able to keep afloat and assume 
his or her family obligations.
<P>
	The instability also stems from the written word, from the 
daily newspaper reports.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Instability was created, in January 1995, when the <I>Wall Street 
Journal</I>, New York's main financial newspaper which investors 
from all over the world refer to, compared Canada to a third 
world country. It openly evoked the possibility that Canada 
could go bankrupt. The Bloc Quebecois did not bring Canada to 
that level. No.
<P>
	My question is this: It is easy to see that, due to the budget, 
Canadians are now taxed more, $2.2 billion more. One cannot 
deny that, or that cuts of $13.4 billion will be made over two 
years. This is not the work of the Bloc Quebecois. Cuts will be 
made, but not in the right places.
<P>
	The government also offloaded some expenditures onto the 
provinces, so it taxed, cut and transferred other things, raising 
the debt by 17.4 per cent over three years. So much for putting 
our financial house in order according to the current 
government. Is this the direction in which the federalism will 
go? If so, the solution we have in Quebec is to become 
sovereign.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to thank my hon. friend 
for his question. There is no question there is instability when 
we are talking about the political liability of Canada.
<P>
	Let me refer to something which appeared in the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> today: ``Quebec's economy would collapse like a house of 
cards after a yes vote in the referendum, and Canada's would not 
fare much better, a respected economist predicts in a new book. 
Marcel Côté, a senior partner with Groupe Sécor and a former 
economic adviser to Canadian Prime Ministers and Quebec 
premiers, writes that a sovereign Quebec would be pummelled 
by an unprecedented convergence of negative economic 
factors''. Of course it would not help Canada either.
<P>
	We have some negative forces, one being separation. It hurts 
the average citizen who tries to borrow money. It hurts 
government but it hurts the person who has a $100,000 mortgage 
and has to pay a higher premium. It is not assisted any by the 
Reform Party which is trying to say our economy is unstable.
<P>
	We are not a third world country. The member is gravely 
misinformed if he believes we are. We are a country that was 
judged by the United Nations for the second time as the best 
country in the world in which to live. That is what Canada is.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, one 
thing we have to realize, when we talk about a bill to provide 
borrowing authority to the government, is that the borrowed 
money will be used to implement the measures announced in the 
government's budget. So, you will understand why most of my 
comments will focus on the budget that was tabled in this House 
by the finance minister and that has been the topic of a lot of our 
discussions these last few weeks. It is important to demystify a 
few things, because Canadians no longer know what to think 
about the budget that was tabled.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10741"> 10741 </A></B>
<P>
	First, I want to make my position very clear: The Minister of 
Finance has not reduced the annual deficit enough to deal with 
the public debt. I will elaborate on this a little later on. In order 
to reduce the annual deficit, the finance minister offloaded the 
federal expenditures onto the provinces, which does not do a 
thing to improve the debt situation of the Canadian people.
<P>
	Thirdly, the Minister of Finance and the Liberal government 
have cut federal expenditures, but for the most part, they did not 
cut in the right place. I will show in which areas the members of 
the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, would have liked 
the government and the finance minister to cut.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Lastly, the Minister of Finance missed a really good 
opportunity not to increase the tax revenues from large 
corporations in a way that would have protected the average 
citizens, the middle class and the underprivileged in our society 
who, unfortunately, have always borne the brunt of the decisions 
made by the various finance ministers over the years.
<P>
	Let us go back to the deficit issue. I said earlier that we think 
the Minister of Finance did not reduce the deficit enough. If we 
use the federal finance minister's own figures, we can see that, 
by the year 2000, Canada's total debt, including the present debt 
and the annual deficits forecast by the minister, will have 
reached a staggering $800 billion.
<P>
	It must be understood that this $800 billion represents an 
increase compared to the recent estimate of the debt at $300 
billion. So an extra $300 billion will be added to the debt 
between now and the year 2000, plus annual interest payments 
of, say, 8 per cent on this $300 billion, which is a rather 
conservative assumption.
<P>
	It is not difficult to understand why anybody in Canada and 
elsewhere in the world-my colleague from Chicoutimi 
mentioned the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> a while ago-who watches 
closely what is going on on the public scene can see that, under 
the existing structure, Canada's uncontrolled and almost 
uncontrollable debt will become such a heavy burden that it will 
gobble up most of the money we hope will be generated by 
economic growth, money that would normally be used to create 
jobs, to stimulate research and development, to promote 
economic development and to provide services to Canadians. 
According to the finance minister's own figures, the federal debt 
will reach $800 billion, which is beyond comprehension at this 
point in time. So that is one problem.
<P>
	Interestingly enough, the Minister of Finance did manage to 
reduce to $25 billion an astronomical deficit of some $38 or $40 
billion. That target is commendable and worthwhile. Yes, this is 
interesting; and no, it is not an easy task. But he may have been 
prevented from doing even better by the sheer weight of the 
federal system. Or his efforts may have been thwarted, as I am 
trying to demonstrate, by the government's refusal to really deal  
with the ills that are eroding our financial situation in Canada. 
Because of that, the debt burden will grow heavier as years go by 
and will soon become unbearable.
<P>
	I said at the outset that, when the government reduced its 
deficit, it did not go about it the right way. In fact, the most 
important and significant move of the Minister of Finance and 
his government to reduce the deficit was to transfer to provincial 
governments expenses of some $7 billion that will no longer be 
met by the federal government. But the Canadian government 
will still set national standards, shift its own responsibilities to 
provinces, cut their funding and leave them scrambling to deal 
with that $7 billion loss.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	What a lack of courage on the part of both the minister and the 
government. Instead of taking the drastic measures that are 
needed to reduce the costs of its own administration, the 
government simply decided-this was really too easy-to 
reduce funding by $7 billion and shift the burden to the 
provinces. It leaves that problem in the hands of provincial 
governments which will have to do what it did not have the guts 
to do.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister know 
perfectly well that, this year and more particularly next year, 
provincial governments will have to do the work the government 
of Canada refused and did not have the courage to do.
<P>
	Just imagine the reaction of the citizens listening to us when 
the Canadian Minister of Finance tells them there will be $7 
billion less spending in the federal budget and that he feels the 
government has done its job.
<P>
	As for the ineffable Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, he 
simply stated on one of his visits to Quebec City: ``We have done 
our job; now it is up to the provinces to do theirs. Our clean-up 
job is done''. Can you imagine: ``Our clean-up job is done. We 
swept the dust into the neighbour's apartment''. That is the 
original way the federal government has found to reduce its 
deficit: offloading it onto the provinces.
<P>
	What is the difference, as far as the citizen of Quebec, for 
example, or of any other province is concerned? Deficits are run 
up at both the provincial and the federal levels, and they add up 
to a deficit he still has to pay in full. Just imagine that citizen 
today when the Canadian Minister of Finance tells him: 
``Rejoice, my dear fellow citizen, we reduced our share of the 
deficit''. He should continue, saying: ``Sorry, my dear fellow 
citizen, I just shifted that share to the provincial government, in 
your name''. What a great operation. It reflects an unspeakable 
lack of courage.
<P>
	Furthermore, for the last 15 months, the opposition has been 
constantly asking the government to take the drastic measures 
needed to reduce this tremendous deficit. We have constantly 
asked the government to sit down with members from all parties 
to set up a working committee to undertake an item by item 
review of all government expenditures. One has only to look at 
the  Auditor General's report to notice the wasting of tens of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10742"> 10742 </A></B>
<P>
millions of dollars through mismanagement. The government 
never took any heed of that suggestion.
<P>
	Instead, it is the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs who 
took charge of the exercise and ended up finding some things to 
cut here and there. He finally decided to cut 45,000 civil 
servants, and this was the biggest part of the budget. The federal 
government will lay off 45,000 civil servants.
<P>
	What it forgot to ensure is how the work will be done after 
these 45,000 civil servants have been laid off. The government 
will do what it has always done, that is turn to contractors in 
order to do the job usually done by regular employees. What will 
be the result of these cuts? The savings made by the left hand 
will be spent by the right hand a few months later.
<P>
	How do you want the people who are watching us, who are fed 
up with these hollow words, not to get worried when they see 
this government bragging about the fact that it has succeeded in 
reducing the size of the public service, and know that it will 
probably rehire as contractors friends of the regime to do the 
same job.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	In reducing the public service, the government should have 
met the following conditions: first, that it be done after a large 
consensus had been reached in society as a whole, including the 
unions concerned by this operation. The unions can also 
understand that the government has objectives to reach. And I 
believe that we could have formed, in a common effort with 
employers and unions as well as representatives of the 
government and the opposition, a discussion group which would 
have taken on the task not of eliminating a certain number of 
civil servants to be replaced by an equivalent number of 
contractors, but of eliminating unnecessary government 
activities.
<P>
	Government employees are aware of dozens and dozens of 
areas where the government is literally wasting taxpayers' 
money through duplications and by putting in place a process so 
cumbersome and so complex that it is a waste of efforts and 
money. Instead, we should have worked with all those concerned 
to scrutinize government spending in order to find waste and 
mismanagement within the huge federal government machinery.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the government is saying: ``We are going to 
put 45,000 civil servants out of work. Give us the credit. We 
have done our job''. And the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs adds: ``We did our job and now the provinces have to do 
theirs''.
<P>
	Frankly, one must know nothing about public administration 
to address problems in such a casual manner and to make 
speeches in order to put forward great principles like those 
which make nice headlines but which, in fact, do not bring any 
solutions.
<P>
	Let us look at another area where the government has decided 
to make cutbacks. I was saying that the government had made 
cutbacks in the wrong areas. What was its main target in the last 
budget and the previous one? The unemployed, the most 
vulnerable members of our society were the most affected. And I 
challenge all the Liberals opposite to tell us that the unemployed 
were not the main victims of this government in the last two 
budgets.
<P>
	I remember quite well Liberal Party speeches, and letters 
signed by the present Prime Minister, who was then Leader of 
the Opposition, where unemployment insurance cuts, 
implemented by the Tories, were condemned in no uncertain 
terms. The Liberals said they were outraged to see the Tories so 
lacking in imagination that they found no other way to solve the 
fiscal problems of the country but to pick on the have-nots of 
our society.
<P>
	In my region, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, I remember the 
member for Jonquière almost left the Conservative caucus 
because he disagreed so earnestly with the proposals of his 
party. The Liberals disagreed with these proposals and 
denounced them. They made several promises to the Canadians 
during the last election campaign.
<P>
	And, in their last two budgets, the one group they treated most 
harshly were not the civil servants, not the banks, not the rich 
families who profit from the family trusts, and not the 
businesses which often pay no taxes at all, but the unemployed 
Canadians.
<P>
	Allow me to say, since there is so little imagination on the 
other side, that the Minister of Finance seems very proud of the 
cuts he made in some government expenditures. Why did he not 
cut in the army reserve force when we all know it is the second 
most expensive in the world? It is very simple, we have the most 
expensive reserve after Switzerland, an extremely wealthy 
country compared to Canada. The Canadian reserve is the most 
expensive; it costs nearly one billion dollars, and that amount is 
spent very inefficiently.
<P>
	Why? Instead of taking $700 million away from the 
unemployed, why did we not think about the Canadian reserve? 
Why did we not try to get 300 or 400 million dollars out of a 
reserve force which is totally inefficient, according to the 
Auditor General and the observers?
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Why not? God only knows. The Minister of Finance's 
conscience is clear. He did his job of making cuts. However, we 
keep saying he cut in the wrong place. How do you explain the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10743"> 10743 </A></B>
<P>
Auditor General's criticism, month after month, year after year, 
that it is impossible to establish with certainty which native 
populations are  receiving fairly major funding through 
agreements with the federal government for native businesses? 
Everyone is wondering why the federal government does not 
take an exact census with native bands before transferring the 
money.
<P>
	Nothing has been done. What effort have you seen the 
government make to try at least to ensure that this money is 
properly spent, that the native people are receiving their due and 
that the money is being given on a basis that is really fair for all 
other Canadians? None, none. This sort of thing is of no interest 
to the Minister of Finance. I must also tell you that, in addition 
to insufficiently cutting his deficit, in addition to doing it 
wrong, by dumping it in the laps of the provinces, in addition to 
cutting expenses for the wrong people and in the wrong place, 
the Minister of Finance and his government refused to increase 
revenues where money was to be found.
<P>
	This is a fine state of affairs. You tell me who feeds me, 
Madam Speaker, and I will tell you who gets my loyalty. How is 
it that this government and this Minister of Finance were so 
timid in setting up measures to obtain money that might have 
helped Canada through its difficulties? Why were the 
banks-which, by the way, made together some $4 billion in 
profits-asked to make a temporary effort of $100 million?
<P>
	Just imagine how much money is available there. These 
corporations are saving a lot in taxes. Considering the 
circumstances, they are fabulously rich. They are getting richer 
and richer while most Canadians are getting poorer. In a context 
of justice and equitable sharing, should not a responsible 
government distribute fairly fiscal funds? I conclude since I see 
my time is up. It is unfortunate because I still have a lot of 
recommendations to make to the government. Why did the 
government spare banks and large corporations from paying 
their share of taxes? Why did it give family trust holders four 
years to stash their money elsewhere? This is outrageous.
<P>
	In concluding, I will simply state that the two Canadas did not 
see the budget the same way. As for the rest of Canada, opinion 
polls indicate that 60 per cent of Atlantic Canadians think it is a 
good budget, as well as 55 per cent of Ontarians, 54 per cent of 
Prairie residents and 51 per cent of British Columbia residents, 
whereas in Quebec, 57 per cent think it is not.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to ask my colleague from Roberval a number of 
questions. He mentioned he was not good at numbers and I 
would have to agree with him.
<P>
	He talked about the deficit climbing up to $800 billion. What 
he seems to ignore is we have a thing in this economy called 
growth. Canada is one of the fastest growing economies in the 
western world right now. If he actually applied an element of 
growth he would see that deficit start reducing under the finance 
minister's plan.
<P>
	He also talked about his great imagination. It is very true. He 
does have a terrific imagination. The federal government 
basically collects money on behalf of the provinces. That is part 
of the constitutionality of this country.
<P>
	Everyone realizes all governments are in this together and we 
have to reduce spending. This argument has been going on in 
Ontario for years. We keep blaming each other. Someone else is 
always responsible.
<P>
	The taxpayer is not fooled. In Ontario people are fully 
cognizant that the province has to reduce spending. We have 
reduced the transfer payments to the provinces far less than we 
reduced our own expenditures.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	I do not think you can fool the people of Quebec. They know 
governments have to reduce spending. This includes Quebec, 
which to this day has a $70 billion deficit. It is not doing 
anything about it. The leader of Quebec is running around with a 
referendum or something but he is not dealing with the 
economic problems of that province. Blaming all the problems 
on the federal government is not going to wash. I do not think it 
is going to wash in Quebec either.
<P>
	Everybody shared in the budget. We did increase taxation on 
some of our largest banks. Some things are not told. The Royal 
Bank had a billion dollar profit. What some do not understand is 
it had losses year after year before that.
<P>
	Far be it from me to defend the banks, but I am telling the 
reality of it. Sometimes a billion dollars sounds like a lot but 
$125 billion worth of assets is not a very good return, especially 
considering losses in the previous year.
<P>
	Blaming everything on the banks is not going to cut it. We all 
have to do something to get our costs of government down. That 
is what the budget does. It does it from the federal perspective 
and will do it for the provinces. I would like to have my hon. 
colleague address that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Madam Speaker, what compassion for those 
poor banks which made profits of only $4 billion last year. I 
would have liked my hon. colleague to show the same kind of 
compassion for the unemployed in Canada, who do not count 
their benefits in billions, and made no profit last year, but have 
registered losses, year after year.
<P>
	I would have believed that my colleague was better informed 
when he talked about the tax points used by the federal 
government and the fact that it gives money back to the 
provinces. Listening to the advocates of federalism, one has the 
feeling that it is a fantastic gift the provinces receive. The 
federal government generously redistributes among its poor 
little provinces its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10744"> 10744 </A></B>
<P>
God-given tax money. What are they complaining about? These 
are minor cuts.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I will simply say this: The federal 
government, which then was not allowed to collect taxes, asked 
for tax points to support its war effort and, later on, refused to 
give them back to the provinces, saying that the money they 
provided was going to be redistributed among the provinces to 
help them accomplish certain things.
<P>
	One has to admit that there is a problem somewhere when one 
knows what the situation is, and that the Prime Minister has 
decided to keep on collecting taxes, which originally belonged 
to the provinces-check your history books-and to give them 
only half of what it collects. This is what is wrong with 
federalism. I do agree that the system does not make any sense. 
No wonder the provinces and the federal government are 
bickering. Besides, we have a very clear, very precise solution to 
that. We are the only ones to have one. No one else has one in 
this country.
<P>
	In conclusion, when one talks about the necessity for the 
provinces to put their house in order, I will tell my hon. friend 
that I was a member of the Government of Quebec when we 
asked the public service to make enormous sacrifices and when 
we streamlined the administration. On a Canadian scale, the 
Quebec deficit would have been the equivalent of $10 billion a 
year. If the administration of the Government of Quebec had 
been as poor as the administration of the federal government, 
Quebec would be running a deficit of $10 billion a year.
<P>
	Since 1985-86, the federal government's deficit has been 
close to $40 billion, whereas the annual deficit of Quebec has 
been roughly $3 billion, $5 billion last year. The generally good 
management of Canadian provinces is in no way comparable to 
the administrative mess at the federal level, as well as to the 
disproportionate debt of the federal government which, 
proportionally, beats all records of any developed country, with 
the exception of Italy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, a 
quick question for the hon. member. It really gets tiring hearing 
this blah, blah, blah about a wonderful budget that is not going to 
do what those members claim. I get frightened when the 
opposition wants to do something even worse. It does not want 
to address the serious problem.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	Regarding the corporations, if we get more taxation out of the 
corporations, who ultimately pays the bill and what does the 
member think caused a lot of the corporations to go south of the 
border previously if not taxation? Is he trying to chase 
everybody out of Canada?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Madam Speaker, we know the opinions of the 
Reform Party. They presented them in this House and they 
condemned the budget. Here is the result of this condemnation 
by the Reform Party: in the West, their stronghold, 54 per cent of 
their constituents, 60 per cent in British Columbia, think it is a 
good budget.
<P>
	I would simply say to my friends in the Reform Party that 
their speeches do no fool anyone anymore. We know that they 
want to abolish social programs, everything having to do with 
individuals, all transfers to the neediest. We know that 
according to them corporations, banks, large companies should 
not pay tax. We can see what their choice of society is. However, 
they cannot even convince their own constituents with whom 
they are supposed to communicate so much.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to share my time tonight with the member for 
Hamilton West.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak on Bill C-73. I want to take this 
opportunity to offer my support to the budget tabled by the 
Minister of Finance last month. It truly is a budget that reflects 
the principles and priorities of Canadians.
<P>
	Our challenge was to balance the needs of our nation with the 
fiscal realities of today. Canadians asked us clearly to focus on 
cutting spending, not raising taxes, spending dollars more 
carefully on the priorities of people and ensuring fairness among 
individuals and regions. I believe the budget respects and 
reflects those principles.
<P>
	Following the budget I wanted to see how the residents of 
Edmonton East felt about the budget, to hear their ideas, 
suggestions, their comments and concerns. On the evening of 
the budget we held an informal budget forum with 
representatives of the Edmonton East community. There were 
small business owners, students, teachers, seniors, new 
Canadians and representatives from community groups and 
agencies in attendance.
<P>
	Our group came to the Edmonton East riding office to watch a 
tape of the budget speech and participate in short group 
discussions on the budget. Following that round table, I called 
from the office in Ottawa and we held a conference call on the 
budget and its impact on our riding. To determine the collective 
wisdom of Edmonton East on the budget, I asked our diverse 
group a series of questions to gauge their opinions and reactions.
<P>
	I asked what their gut feeling was. The one phrase that was 
consistently repeated as each participant voiced his or her 
opinion was it was tough and fair. They felt the budget protected 
our core Canadian values and programs. Specifically they were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10745"> 10745 </A></B>
<P>
relieved that seniors benefits were not drastically cut and they 
were delighted, actually ecstatic, that the Minister of Finance 
declared the government's support for the principles of the  
Canada Health Act and that we maintained funding levels for 
justice programs.
<P>
	Several of the participants appreciated the manner in which 
the program cuts were made. They liked that spending 
reductions were done carefully by department and not in an 
across the board manner. It is important the group expressed this 
particular reaction to budgetary spending because it showed 
support for the program review approach we undertook in our 
process.
<P>
	Albertans, like all Canadians, deserve and expect good 
government. Good government is simply delivering efficient, 
cost effective programs Canadians need and want and are 
willing to pay for in defence, in industry, in human resource 
development, in transportation, in justice and in heritage. 
Residents of my riding and across the province are firm 
believers in the concept of value for money. They want 
government programs and services that bring them good value 
for their tax dollars.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, when we initiate expenditure reduction it is 
important that we evaluate government departments on a 
program by program basis. That requires a careful and 
thoughtful review of all government programs. This is one area 
where we can see a fundamental difference between the 
approach of the government and of the Reform Party. It proposes 
across the board departmental cuts without little regard for any 
consequences, fiscal or social, with no regard for the impact 
such cuts would have on other levels of government and with no 
calculation of value for money.
<P>
	We took the tougher, more effective approach in program 
review, eliminating programs that are not working and 
streamlining others. The government's approach to the 
reduction of the public service is one of right sizing. Simply, 
right sizing promotes a careful and strategic approach to 
removing waste and duplication from organizations. We must 
work hard and co-operatively to find ways for departments and 
organizations to operate with a maximum of efficiency and 
effectiveness while maintaining high standards of service and 
program delivery.
<P>
	Slashing and cutting with any organization or business merely 
for the sake of downsizing without clear direction or strategy is 
clearly irresponsible.
<P>
	The small business representatives on our panel agreed with 
the continued support the government has given to this 
important sector of our economy. In the budget we recognized 
there are times and places where government can and should 
assist the private sector in today's fast changing global 
environment. For example, the government will continue 
supporting exports for companies in the sectors facing intense 
international competition. This is especially important in my 
province which has seen an incredible growth in the export 
trade.
<P>
	The government will also be working with Canada's banks 
between now and the fall to determine meaningful benchmarks 
for small business lending. Small business owners in Alberta 
share the national problem of securing capital for businesses.
<P>
	Since we came to office we have implemented several 
initiatives which small business owners indicate will help 
improve their ability to do business: the reduction of regulations 
and paperwork; the introduction of single window business 
service centres; and the reduction of unemployment insurance 
premiums. These are all commitments to reduce the deficit 
which will help small business.
<P>
	Participants in the budget discussions all indicated their 
approval of the tax fairness measures implemented in the 
budget. This theme of fairness was also present at my social 
security forum where participants suggested that the 
government supplement its social program reforms with 
taxation reforms.
<P>
	In the budget there are several measures to promote equity in 
the tax system. Equity starts by ensuring that taxes owing are 
taxes paid. The government implemented rules to ensure that the 
construction industry, where the underground economy thrives, 
complies with tax laws. There will be no tax deferral advantages 
for investment income earned by private holding companies. All 
tax advantages flowing from family trusts have been eliminated. 
There are several more. We have raised the corporate surtax on 
profits from 3 per cent to 4 per cent. We have added a temporary 
tax on the large deposit taking institutions, including the banks.
<P>
	Participants at my forum expressed support for the fact that 
the government dealt with deficit reduction primarily through 
expenditures. We have taken the right path at the right pace. In 
fact over the next three years spending reductions will total 
$25.3 billion against $3.7 billion in revenue actions. That is 
almost $7 in spending cuts for each $1 in new tax revenue.
<P>
	During our conference call I asked the participants what 
issues arising from the budget are important to our riding so we 
can follow them up for future action. The reaction of the group 
assembled was that the budget presents them with an 
opportunity to act in co-operation with the provinces and with 
the federal government in the development of a shared set of 
principles and objectives that will underlie the new Canada 
social transfer. This way we can ensure that our core Canadian 
values and priorities are maintained in our social programs.
<P>
	Participants were heartened by the loud and clear message in 
the budget that the principles of the Canada Health Act will 
continue to be enforced. Albertans, like all Canadians, want 
their social security programs to be more efficiently delivered. 
They want to reduce overlap and duplication. However, they are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10746"> 10746 </A></B>
<P>
concerned about the potential impact of increased provincial 
flexibility on their province, considering the lack of care and 
concern  the current provincial government has shown toward 
social programs. All participants agreed that we need to 
maintain key principles in our social system so that we can 
continue to protect our most vulnerable citizens.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	At this forum and others held on social security review there 
was widespread support for our social programs. While 
everyone agreed that there was a need for reform-people 
wanted to see programs such as the UI maintained-there was 
no support for the dismantling of the system which is implied in 
the Reform Party's registered personal security plan.
<P>
	Another concern of people in my riding is that the rising cost 
of the public pension system is placing their pensions at risk. 
The government is committed to providing a fair and reliable 
system of protection for seniors but this requires action to 
ensure the pension system is sustainable in the long term. Later 
this year the Minister of Human Resources Development, in 
collaboration with the finance minister, will release a paper 
dealing with the changes required in the public pension system 
to ensure its affordability. The budget states what the basic 
principles for the reform will be, and that is what we will work 
co-operatively with. The review is another area in which 
residents, particularly seniors, can participate.
<P>
	Some might say that the budget did not cut enough, that it 
could have been tougher. However, a budget is not just about 
balancing books; it is about balancing the needs of the nation. 
We have a fiscal responsibility to do that.
<P>
	Also some could complain we did not set longer deficit 
reduction targets. However two years of rolling targets keep our 
feet to the fire, making it impossible to postpone spending 
reductions and other actions to reduce the deficit. Past 
governments have made long term plans but always ended up 
pushing necessary action further and further into the future. The 
short term targets we have set make sure we act to reduce the 
deficit, keeping our feet to the fire.
<P>
	In conclusion, there is general agreement in Edmonton East 
that the 1995 budget takes far-reaching action to restore the 
fiscal health that supports a strong and growing economy. The 
residents of my riding found many things in the budget they like. 
They also identified the Canada social transfer and the 
retirement income review as issues for future focus. I look 
forward to working with them and with the government on these 
issues as we continue the government's progress on program and 
service improvements.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to point out to my colleague that she did not consider 
the consequences of our very large debt on investment and 
employment in Canada.
<P>
	This debt has a very negative impact on job creation. To 
finance our debt-I already said, but it is worth repeating-we 
are forced to offer a premium to foreign investors. This premium 
increases as the debt grows, which means that the Canadian 
taxpayer cannot consume as he or she should. The consequences 
of that is that there is less and less work, and more and more 
people on unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Now, because of new eligibility criteria they must rely on 
welfare. Therefore, the impact is very negative. Here is my 
question: The present federal system offers only status quo, 
which means compromises, clumsy compromises between two 
groups. In our area, we call that endless complaining. The status 
quo means eternal resignation to a dreary existence. Is it what 
you are going to offer to the upcoming generation? This status 
quo is simply jiggery-pokery and fiddling.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bethel:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question from 
the Bloc. Federalism is as important to those of us who live in 
Alberta as it is to those of us who live in Quebec.
<P>
	I understand the analogies of the family and fighting and 
feuding, but healthy families work out their differences. There 
is a kind of evolution, not a revolution, in the way we do 
business. I truly appreciate that there is getting to be a less 
centralist feeling to government these days. What we are seeing 
more of is the ability for the provinces to determine their own 
needs and to work on their own solutions. That is how I see this 
unfolding. It is very beneficial for Quebec, it is beneficial for 
the maritimes, it is beneficial for every part of our country; 
working together to solve our common problems.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
was interested in the hon. member's remarks about how her 
constituents reacted.
<P>
	I refer her to an announcement made by her government last 
year with respect to the stay in school program, which addresses 
itself directly to the issue of dropouts and potential dropouts. 
Her government announced funding for the program last year 
and I understand from the wording of the release at that time that 
the government spoke very positively about how important the 
issue is for Canada. I wonder whether she has any news on 
whether this program should continue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10747"> 10747 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bethel:</B> Madam Speaker, that is a very specific question 
and I am not prepared at this time to answer it. I am not aware of 
the press release or the program. My apologies to the hon. 
member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have quite a number of questions but in the interests of brevity I 
will limit them to one or two.
<P>
	The hon. member for Edmonton East put a lot of emphasis on 
fairness in transfers to the provinces and individuals as part of 
the government's responsibility of ensuring they have a 
standard of living we can respect.
<P>
	One of the biggest transfers we now have is the $50 billion we 
transfer to lenders; not to poor people, not to old people, not to 
young people, not to those who need an education, but to rich 
lenders around the world. In a survey 41 per cent of Canadians 
said the deficit was not being cut fast enough in order to 
eliminate the growth in that transfer so that money is available 
to Canadians.
<P>
	What does the member propose since the Minister of Finance 
has been far too slow in getting the deficit down?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bethel:</B> Madam Speaker, there are two plans of action we 
are taking, one on a short rolling, two-year target. They are 
extremely important so that we do not put off what we need to 
do. In order to get the deficit down it is important to have short 
term targets. I will leave it at that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is a privilege and an honour on behalf of the constituents of 
Hamilton West to speak on Bill C-73, an act to provide 
borrowing authority for the upcoming fiscal year, and by logical 
extension the firm but fair budget tabled on February 27 by my 
hon. colleague the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In keeping with the principles of fairness as promised in the 
1995 budget, it reflects the government's desire to cut the deficit 
primarily through spending cuts rather than massive tax 
increases, as suggested by the third party. This is substantiated 
by the fact that over the next three years there will be $7 in 
spending cuts for every dollar in new tax increases. 
Consequently the budget will have an enormous impact on 
Canada's ongoing economic recovery.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	It should also be noted that in the process of creating the 1995 
budget, the minister took care to obtain the input of Canadians 
right across this country. This was done by means of the 
prebudget hearings conducted by the Standing Committee on 
Finance.
<P>
	These hearings were held in cities throughout Canada, 
including my hometown of Hamilton. I am proud to say that 
almost 90 per cent of the recommendations of the finance 
committee were accepted by the Minister of Finance and are 
reflected in the 1995 budget.
<P>
	As chairperson of the House of Commons Standing 
Committee on Transport, I should also mention that our 
committee is currently assisting the Minister of Transport with a 
comprehensive marine review. As indicated in a recent 
post-budget document released by Transport Canada, 
``Transport Canada's New Direction and the 1995 Budget'', the 
House of Commons Standing Committee on Transport is 
holding extensive consultations on the future of Canada's 
marine sector. It plans to submit a report of recommendations by 
the end of April.
<P>
	The review focuses on identifying inefficiencies in the 
Canadian marine system and eliminating unnecessary and 
counterproductive waste and mismanagement in the marine 
sector. This will also help eliminate unnecessary federal 
government expenditures by examining ways to provide 
competitive and efficient marine services as part of an 
integrated transportation system.
<P>
	The finance minister went to great lengths to accommodate 
the opinions expressed to him directly and indirectly by his 
parliamentary colleagues as well.
<P>
	On January 6, I issued an open letter to the Minister of 
Finance on behalf of the constituents of Hamilton West 
imploring him not to increase personal income tax. Prior to the 
tabling of the budget we were on a break. When walking through 
the malls, on the streets or stopping in a coffee shop, my 
constituents told me that increasing personal income tax would 
impose an insurmountable burden on many low to middle 
income families. They also said it could have an adverse effect 
on federal revenue targets by creating an added incentive for 
underground economic activity.
<P>
	Clearly, the Minister of Finance listened to Canadians as far 
as personal income tax is concerned. We did not see a hike in 
personal income tax in this budget. This budget is firm in its 
commitment to cutting government fat, but fair in sparing the 
flesh of essential government initiatives designed to stimulate 
economic growth and job creation in this country.
<P>
	The notion of budget fairness is reflected in the minister's 
willingness to address the historically lopsided personal income 
tax contributions made by individual tax paying Canadians 
versus the amount contributed by large profitable corporations. 
In the last three decades the corporate share of total taxes 
collected by government has fallen while the share collected 
from individual taxpayers has almost doubled. In light of that 
fact, the 1995 federal budget also includes key measures 
designed to establish a fair and balanced system of taxation.
<P>
	For example, there will be an increase in the corporate surtax 
from 3 per cent to 4 per cent, as well as a 12.5 per cent increase 
in the large corporations tax. Furthermore, in a year when major 
Canadian banks reported record profits in the billions, the 1995 
budget imposes an immediate increase in the existing tax on 
capital of banks and other large deposit taking institutions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10748"> 10748 </A></B>
<P>
	For the edification of the naysayers across the way, it is 
worthwhile to consider the opinions expressed by various 
reputable organizations and individuals across the nation who 
have expressed their support for the measures announced in the 
1995 budget.
<P>
	Let us go to the editorial in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>: 
``Canada's bold budget ought to be an inspiration to other 
countries struggling with overextended governments''. This is 
for the naysayers across. We have been listening to the Reform 
Party go on and on about how terrible this budget is, how awful 
this government is and how we do not know what we are doing.
<P>
	All that is outweighed by the people who do know a little 
something about economics and I am sure they are not 
Reformers. An editorial in the <I>Financial Times</I> of the U.K. says: 
``The Canadian budget announced on Monday brings the 
country back from the brink of fiscal disaster. Mr. Paul Martin, 
the finance minister, appears to have achieved a skilful balance 
between the increasingly onerous demands of investors and 
those of his constituents''.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	An excerpt from a Reuters AFP news report in <I>The Strait 
Times</I>, Singapore's most widely read daily, states: ``Economists 
praised the government's efforts generally, saying it was 
perhaps the first serious attempt by a Canadian government to 
get a handle on spending''. I know that one-half of the former 
Tory government who is sitting in the House today would 
appreciate a remark like that.
<P>
	How about William Dudley, an economist with Goldman 
Sachs, who stated on CBC Radio: ``In the end you would have to 
say that the government has definitely gotten the message that 
this consolidation is required and the financial markets, I think, 
have to reward Canada for that''. That is pretty good stuff for the 
government.
<P>
	If that were not enough, the budget has also been endorsed by 
the Chartered Accountants of Canada, an organization 
representing 55,000 chartered accountants. It seems reasonable 
to assume that these people would know a thing or two about 
getting one's fiscal house in order. What are they saying? The 
Chartered Accountants, the 55,000 represented, state: ``We are 
pleased that finance minister Paul Martin has cut spending in 
significant ways. In particular, the seven to one ratio of cuts in 
spending to taxes should signal to investors that government is 
addressing our fiscal situation''.
<P>
	Here is the one I like: ``We are very pleased to note the 
government has not taken any drastic measures to impede the 
ability of Canadians to save for their own retirements. The 
budget brought down challenges Canadians to continue to seek 
to redefine the appropriate role and scope of governments as 
essential steps toward fiscal stability''.
<P>
	That is something we can be proud of. Despite the previously 
stated, let us say, expert opinions in the province of Ontario, 
Premier Bob Rae has been playing Chicken Little with the 
federal budget. According to that premier, the sky has been 
falling in Canada since February 27 when the federal budget was 
tabled in this House.
<P>
	In response to this government's attempt to finally get this 
nation's fiscal house in order, Rae states that the budget will 
bring about ``a historic change that literally ends the Canada that 
we have known and sets us on a much meaner course''. This 
comes from a man who clearly knows little or nothing about 
managing public funds.
<P>
	It is worth noting that in 1991 Ontario's accumulated 
provincial debt was 15.5 per cent of Ontario's GDP. This spring, 
Ontario's debt is expected to balloon to almost 30.5 per cent of 
provincial GDP. Clearly if the sky is falling, it is falling on the 
provincial NDP government in Ontario.
<P>
	In closing, for all the doom and gloom of those who may be 
questioning the character of the Liberal government and in fact 
Liberalism itself, I quote a great Canadian and a former Prime 
Minister of Canada, the Right Hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier who once 
said: ``I am a Liberal. I am one of these who thinks that 
everywhere in human terms there are abuses to be reformed, new 
horizons to be opened up, and new forces to be developed''.
<P>
	I am proud to say that this government is holding true to that 
enlightened Liberal vision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have one simple question. We always hear the Liberals talk 
about the budget and how many cuts they have made, but they 
have not cut anything. They have transferred. They have not cut 
$7 for every $1 increase in taxes. Money that was going to 
programs to help Canadians has been transferred as interest to 
the lenders.
<P>
	When will this government recognize that the spending of this 
government has not gone down? There have not been any cuts. It 
has only transferred money from Canadians who need it to 
lenders who did not need the money in the first place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Madam Speaker, I am not sure of the hon. 
member's background. Do not take my word for it; let us go to 
the experts.
<P>
	How about Fred Ketchen, chairman of the board of the 
Toronto Stock Exchange who states: ``It seems to me that the 
fellas at Moody's and the other bond rating services will be 
encouraged by what they heard the finance minister say today in 
what I would assess as being a responsible, a fair, a realistic, and 
even a humane budget''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="10749"> 10749 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us go back to the chartered accountants, the group that 
represents the chartered accountants of Canada, the 55,000 
accountants. They support the restructuring of transfer 
payments to the provinces and the decision to build more 
flexibility into Canada's educational and social program 
transfers to provinces with the creation of the Canada social 
transfer program. This is precisely what this member has been 
concerned about.
<P>
	The Reform Party in its questions talks status quo. Before the 
budget it came out with this ridiculous plan to cut everything; 
gone in two years: ``We are going to put them in sleeping bags in 
the streets across Canada, but we are going to get that budget 
deficit down to zero''. That is not the way it is going to be with 
the government. The government does it fairly and equitably 
and it is going to work. With our two-year rolling plan the House 
is going to be full of Liberals after the next federal election.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I will recognize the hon. 
member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, but he has 
only 30 seconds left for questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
as vice-chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport, I 
would like to put a short question to the chairman of the 
committee.
<P>
	Since he mentioned that he tends to go to coffee shops and 
shopping malls where he has a chance to talk about the budget, I 
would like to know whether be brought this up with his 
constituents in Hamilton West. One of the provisions of the 
budget provides for commercializing the St. Lawrence Seaway, 
but if this does not work and the Seaway is closed, how would 
the people of Hamilton react and how would they get their iron 
ore pellets from Quebec's North Shore?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Madam Speaker, that is an appropriate question 
and I thank the hon. member for it. Coming from Hamilton, 
Stelco and Dofasco are two very familiar names. The lifeline of 
the steel industry in my home town and the rest of the 
communities along that Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway is 
that seaway.
<P>
	If we leave it the way it is the hon. member knows full well it 
will collapse on itself and we will not have a seaway. The status 
quo does not work. We have to find a new way. We have to find a 
way to make that system stand on its own feet and be 
competitive in a global economy and give the stakeholders of 
that system the opportunity to play a greater role in how that 
system works.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="STAYINSCHOOLPROGRAM">STAY IN SCHOOL PROGRAM</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise today on a very important issue that came to my attention 
after the budget. It is a very negative piece of news. It is a 
situation that needs to be clarified on the government benches. I 
asked that it be put on tonight so the government could tell us 
what happened to the stay in school program.
<P>
	Canada has one of the highest drop out rates in the world 
among industrialized countries for people in high school. 
Furthermore, Canada is in a situation in which the skills 
required to enter the labour market have also increased radically 
over the last few years.
<P>
	I can borrow from a document known as the red book. On page 
32 there is a graph of rising education and training requirements 
that seems to indicate that people with less than 12 years of 
education made up about 45 per cent of the jobs available in 
1986. In the years from 1986 until 2000 that will drop to 32 per 
cent.
<P>
	Then it goes on to state that people who have 12 years of 
education make up 10 per cent of the jobs. It will be 2.9 per cent 
by the year 2000; 13 to 16 years of education will go from 22 per 
cent to 15 per cent, and 17 years or more, 22.4 per cent in 1986 to 
48.8 per cent. This graph says that close to half of the jobs 
available in Canada by the turn of the century will require 17 
years of education or more.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	For a country that has one of the highest dropout rates in the 
world among the industrialized countries, one would think we 
would want to do something about it. We did. In 1990 we 
announced the stay in school initiative that addressed itself to 
communities, to enticing different partners in the community 
including the private sector to get involved with the issue. It was 
also co-ordinated with the provinces.
<P>
	It may be of interest for the House to know that the present 
Leader of the Official Opposition supported the program even 
though some people will say that it is in the area of provincial 
jurisdiction which, if taken literally, is a false statement. To 
pretend that the dropout problem is only related to the education 
system is false. It is a broad social program that needs to be 
addressed.
<P>
	My disappointment lies in the fact that the government 
apparently ran on investing in people according to the red book. 
It said in that document:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Jobs and growth depend upon making the necessary investments in ourselves 
and our children. Consequently, we will better prepare for the transition from 
school to the workplace; provide a constructive outlet for the skills and the talents 
of younger Canadians, the innocent victims of Canada's prolonged recession.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The innocent victims of Canada's prolonged recession had the 
program cut. The government refused to continue the program 
which is recognized as a success. Who says that? On April 15, 
1994 the government announced, according to a press release, 
that it would continue to put $30 million in the program. What 
did it have to say about the program only a year ago? It said that 
there was a proven link between low levels of education and 
high levels of youth unemployment and that continued action on 
the high school dropout issue was therefore crucial to ensuring 
that the school to work transition was an avenue of opportunity 
for young people.
<P>
	It is scandalous that the government would cut the program. 
When does the government intend to take up the issue so that we 
can attend to the problem of young Canadian men and women 
who need to finish high school and need an opportunity to get an 
education, find a job and participate in Canadian society?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I paid attention to what the hon. member stated in 
reference to the stay in school initiative to provide the tools to 
motivate the key stakeholders in the community to engage in the 
process of outlining and telling young Canadians that it is very 
important to stay in school as a vehicle to achieving a job and to 
acquiring the life skills required to remain competitive in a very 
competitive marketplace.
<P>
	Obviously the hon. member missed the announcement the 
government made last Friday. There has been some redirection 
of funding. The government announced a summer job action 
plan, a package of six job creation elements for secondary and 
post-secondary education students which will result in the 
direct creation of approximately 44,500 jobs. In addition, 
Canada employment centres for students will once again be in 
operation across the country.
<P>
	Last year close to 200,000 job vacancies were filled and over 
141,000 young people participated in group information 
sessions. The number is expected to surpass last year's budget 
for students. The $8.6 million will be increased to $10.4 million. 
It is also important to note that the budget of the youth 
internship program has increased from $25 million in 1994-95 
to $118 million in 1995-96.
<P>
	Even though we are living through difficult fiscal times our 
commitment to young people speaks to two realities: the fact 
that we believe it is a priority and that we want to engage in 
effective partnerships at the community level. The 
announcement last Friday achieved both.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly the House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.05 p.m.)
