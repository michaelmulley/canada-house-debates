<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed from October 9 consideration of the motion.</p><A NAME="Int-720700"></A><a HREF="#Int-720702"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Lunney (Nanaimo—Alberni, Canadian Alliance): </b>Mr. Speaker, last night the debate began on Bill C-38.  It is a controversial bill.  Yesterday the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford spoke on behalf of my party about this bill and outlined conditions which we on our side would consider for the decriminalization of marijuana, conditions  that have not been fulfilled, that are some very serious issues which need to be addressed, and conditions by which many members of our party feel they could support the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to address several issues that I feel are very important concerns that come out of this bill.  There are five issues or reasons that come out of this bill and show that this bill is poorly thought out, poorly timed and a high risk for Canadians and for our society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of the five issues I wish to address in the brief time allotted to me involves health. As members of the House, we should, I believe, be concerned about the health of Canadians. I think there are some very serious health issues related to the bill and to the use of marijuana.</p><A NAME="T1005"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1005"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1000"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1005)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is the effect that this bill would have on our young people and on children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is safety.  I am concerned about safety.  There are some very serious safety issues. This bill would expose Canadians to significant risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth is organized crime.  There are some very serious concerns in this area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the fifth is trade and the effect that this bill if implemented will have on our trade with our largest trading partner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the subject of health, the government is spending about $500 million taxpayer dollars on a health issue: trying to convince Canadians not to smoke cigarettes. That is a lot of money.  We know that tobacco smoking is a very serious, undermining factor in regard to the health of Canadians, and it continues in spite of the warnings and the labels.  Now, due to this bill, the Minister of Health is proposing to spend another $250 million trying to convince Canadians not to smoke marijuana at a time when we are making it easier for them to do so and lowering the consequences. I wonder if this is a good investment in our health care dollars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had time to refer to it, I could quote the committee report, “Working Together to Redefine Canada's Drug Strategy”, from the committee chaired by the hon. member for Burlington.  In the report, the committee correctly identified that marijuana contains tars and benzopyrenes far in excess of what cigarettes do.  It is widely known or accepted that smoking two or three marijuana joints is the equivalent to smoking about 20 tobacco cigarettes.</p><A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-720702"></A><a HREF="#Int-720707"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-720700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b>I wonder if Canadians have had an open and thorough discussion about the liabilities we are exposing ourselves to if we increase and encourage this habit of smoking a product that is almost certain to undermine the health of long term users.  These studies are not in place. I think Canadians deserve the right to discuss this more thoroughly before we take on liability for future health care costs and for future taxpayers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned about the effect on children. The bill proposes a lower fine for young people aged 14 to 18 in regard to possession of marijuana.  What kind of program is this?  What kind of message does it send to our young people?  We have heard about passing the buck, and that happens a lot, even in a place like this.  There is a lot of passing the buck, but now we are passing the pot. I can see this encouraging older users to make sure there is a young person along with them so that if the police show up it would all belong to the young person.  That is passing the pot.  I think this is a very serious thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned about the effect that  using these products has on our youth.  There was a major article in the <i>Vancouver Sun</i> that talked about another drug, but I think it is related.  It is called crystal methamphetamine.  It is cheap.  It is everywhere.  It lasts for hours and does serious damage to the brain. It seems to be replacing marijuana for young people on the coast, and a lot of them, in fact,  because it is cheap, readily available and is produced in many homes, in a dangerous fashion.  However, for  young people taking crystal meth, there is no place to deal with them.  They are often paranoid when they come off this very nice high they get; they go through periods of paranoia and violence and have extraordinary strength because of the drug.  Hospitals do not want them and care facilities do not want them.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned that the attitude the House would be projecting if we approve the bill would be to encourage young people, to say that drugs are okay, it is  not a big problem, to use marijuana, but if it does not give them the high or costs a little too much or is a little hard to get, to try crystal meth.  Once people cross that barrier of indulging in mood altering substances, it is a slippery slope with very nasty consequences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the safety concerns, we are closing our eyes to the fact that organized crime is very heavily involved in this issue, with billions of dollars.  We estimate that in Canada, at least on the west coast, there are some 15,000 to 20,000 homes with illegal grow ops in them.  They pirate hydro in a dangerous fashion.  It is dangerous for the hydro workers and dangerous for the communities and neighbourhoods these houses are found in. It is dangerous to the children.  It is estimated that  one in four of these homes is  rigged with illegal electricity, which creates fire hazards for our police and firemen going to these homes. Many of them are booby trapped, but there are children living in these homes.  That is a very serious concern.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that there are billions of dollars going into this illegal drug trade. Do we think that by decriminalizing this we are going to undermine criminals' ability to earn profits from this? Or are we in fact increasing the market for their product?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An article from the <i>Vancouver Sun </i> of May 9 reports:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td width="15" align="right"></td>

</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article states that the cultivation of marijuana is estimated to be worth $4 billion a year in sales.  By increasing the market for these products, are we trying to encourage organized crime?  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the justice minister will say that he is toughening up penalties, as if that would be a deterrent, and he says maximum penalties, by the way.  If we really wanted to send a message, we would toughen up by increasing minimum penalties, because the same article goes on to say that jail terms were imposed in only  18% of the cases and the average length of the jail terms was just under five months.  The consequences are too low for this type of crime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This same article goes on to state:</p>

</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we really think that by making it more available we are going to help the police in this cause and will the judges impose anything other than minimum sentences and minimum fines?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, there are very serious concerns related to organized crime.</p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the safety issue, the police have an opportunity to take a breathalyzer test for someone who is under the influence of alcohol, but we currently have no test to determine impairment from drugs or from marijuana. I know there are experiments with a blood test. It is one thing to take a breathalyzer test from someone at the side of the road. However, when someone is under the influence, it might be a high risk activity for both parties involved for a police officer  to take a blood sample.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood is a high risk factor. I can imagine a police officer who is trying to take a blood sample getting a spurt in the eye.  There  could be serious health risks associated with that in this day of viral diseases, AIDS, hepatitis C and so on. What kind of risk are we exposing our officers to?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also concerned about trade issues.  Our neighbour and largest trading partner, the United States, is clearly not going this way.  We have huge trade, about $2 billion, going across the border every day and our country is very dependent on that. My riding is hurting right now because of hold-ups with the softwood lumber tariffs and we have other border issues that we are trying to resolve with the Americans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we doing to our borders for the citizens who like to travel to the U.S.?   The United States is  certainly not going our way on increasing marijuana possession. We are creating another barrier for citizens who want to travel to the United States to visit their families, to holiday, to do business and for other reasons. We are putting ourselves at risk. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are serious health concerns associated with the bill.  Smoking anything is not good for us. I can well imagine the risk that the health minister is exposing us to with medical marijuana.  Her department is sending out packets of marijuana seeds to medical doctors to dispense to their patients to grow their own.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see well-heeled liability lawyers who like to sue governments taking a class action suit when we find that down the road some of these people have been taking so-called medical marijuana with no proof that it will help anyone. What kind of liability are we exposing future taxpayers to?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a serious issue with hepatitis C and compensation related to that.  What kind of liability are we exposing taxpayers to when people using this product develop cancer or some other serious debilitating element because of this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are serious issues that need to be discussed. I hope these issues will be thoroughly aired before a decision is made by the House.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-720707"></A><a HREF="#Int-720715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-720702"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to speak at this stage in the debate on Bill C-38 which, as you and I both know, is getting a lot of media coverage and is the topic of much conversation in the homes of Quebec and Canada, because this  is an issue that really grabs people.  Often the debate is based on preconceived ideas. I would therefore encourage my colleagues in this House to ignore any preconceived ideas and to address the problem in the most objective way possible, and not to be blinded by ideology.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two statements that need to be made at the outset.  First, smoking, regardless of what substance is smoked, is not good for people's health.   This is, in my opinion, a very obvious statement, unless one is blinded by some ideology, just as one can say that drinking alcohol is  not exactly the healthiest thing to do either.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the repressive approach used by governments,  particularly those in North America, is not working.  Despite the millions of dollars, the amount of effort and the law enforcement resources invested in the battle against drugs,  there is no disputing that government repression has not worked.  Just about everyone agrees on these two statements, I believe. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having made those two statements, let us now look at what direction we can take to deal with the problems referred to.   It must be pointed out that Bill C-38 is supported in principle by the Bloc Quebecois.  We do, however, believe that any measures to soften the approach to cannabis possession must go hand in hand with preventive and educational measures aimed at the population in general, but young people in particular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provinces must be the ones involved in prevention, because—being education—it falls under their jurisdiction, and not the federal government as part of a so-called national drug strategy.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must point out in this connection that the Bloc Quebecois agrees that possession of marijuana will always be illegal and that there will always be sanctions, though not under the Criminal Code.   This is an approach the Bloc Quebecois agrees with.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do have one problem, however, since we do not know the breakdown of the $245 million allocated to the national drug strategy.  In order to be logical, within this federal system we are living in but want out of, this money ought to go to the provinces, and to agencies reporting to the provinces with expertise in drug education, prevention and   the campaign against drug abuse.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other thing that disturbs us about Bill C-38 and that is the latitude given to police officers. Members will recall that one of the reasons for suggesting that the penalty for simple possession of marijuana be changed—so instead of having a criminal record, it would be a question of fines—was that the law was being enforced differently all over Canada. Often, in large urban centres, the police, overloaded with other cases, ignored simple possession, while the same person in a smaller city would be charged with a crime. That introduces issues of geographic inequality into the enforcement of the Criminal Code.</p><A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the committee's recommendations, the first version of Bill C-38 left some discretion to police in deciding whether to lay criminal charges for possession of 15 to 30 grams of cannabis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recently heard that the Minister of Justice wants to lower that quantity from 15 to 10 grams. I want to remind everyone that this is one third of the amount envisaged by the committee established by the House. I am eager to hear the explanation for lowering it from 30 to 10 grams, which leaves even more discretionary power to the police. I really want to hear what the Minister of Justice has to say to this. I hope he will have some very serious figures to back him up, studies that will demonstrate and explain the reasoning behind this decision he seems to have already made. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all very well to say he  is open to amendments, but I do not think the minister is saying this out of the goodness of his heart; I think he was unable to resist the pressure from some of his backbench MPs and pressure from his American counterpart. Therefore, I hope he will have good answers to give us regarding the lowering of the quantity on which criminal charges can be based.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I am quite eager to ask the Minister of Justice questions about an inconsistency when it comes to small-scale growers. Individuals possessing small quantities could be fined instead of charged, but individuals cultivating   small quantities would be charged and could face harsh penalties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question for the minister—and I am prepared to consider any number of solutions—is that in doing this, we are forcing infrequent users to buy their supplies on the black market, which is controlled by organized crime rings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we want to help these criminals earn more, even if only indirectly? I am asking because this bill lacks consistency, and I am very interested to hear how the Minister of Justice will respond to what I see as this obvious inconsistency in the bill before the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, if we consider Bill C-38 in a broader context, the decriminalization of  simple possession is a measure that will have a limited impact on changing the foundations of the war on drugs.  Decriminalization, as I said at the beginning of  my speech, is not the same as legalization. One would want to control the distribution, quality and price of products,  and ensure adequate supply. That is the avenue suggested by a senator in a Senate report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois supports the principle of Bill C-38. However, we feel that there are various inconsistencies that must be remedied and corrected. Our overall approach to this bill is to leave ideology at home and hold an open discussion in the belief that a solution can be found. We hope that the Minister of Justice is doing likewise, and we are looking forward to working in committee to ensure that Canadian law is more responsive to the problems I raised at the beginning of my speech.</p><A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-720715"></A><a HREF="#Int-720724"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-720707"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise and speak to Bill C-38, the marijuana bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we look at  the title of the bill, the marijuana bill, one  wonders  why on the eve of the Prime Minister's departure from politics we are debating a marijuana bill as if it  were one of the biggest priorities we have in the country.  It seems to me that if  the Prime Minister and the government   have brought in this bill because they have  run out of ideas, then maybe     the Prime Minister should   just pack up and go home?   Canada could then    get on with  the business of governing and moving forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the  marijuana bill,   the optics look  good.  It would  decriminalize   the  small use of marijuana  but still    control it through summary fines which would  not be appear on one's record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as we look deeper into the bill,  we realize  there are serious flaws.  I will  point out those flaws today and   give the reasons the Canadian Alliance is opposed to the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In election 2000  one of the candidates running against me was a young fellow from the Marijuana Party.  I actually thought he was a very intelligent gentleman.  His purpose for running against me was to bring  out the issue of  medicinal use of marijuana.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well,  about two weeks ago a gentleman from my constituency came  to my office and we discussed at length  the medicinal use of marijuana.  He suffers from MS and  said  that marijuana gives him some  relief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want   to go back to the gentleman from the Marijuana Party because    he did get his point out. However  it  obviously was not a priority   with Canadians because he hardly got any votes. This makes  one wonder why the government would bring  forward  Bill  C-38. Bill C-38 does not address the issue of medicinal use of marijuana.  It just talks about removing criminal conviction for a certain amount of this thing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a student we used to  ask for student discounts when we bought something because we were always short of money.      It seems that kind of thinking has crept into the bureaucracy  and out from bureaucracy into the bill.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A youth between the ages of 14 and 18      would actually get  a discount on the fine. Can anyone believe that?   An adult would have  to pay $150 but a youth would only have  to pay $100.  The  youth actually gets  a student discount  on fines.  Something is flawed with the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government says that it  will  put in $10,000 for the drug strategy. The drug strategy has its own issues out here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the point of the  bill? It is not a priority for Canadians. There are other issues.  The medicinal use of marijuana is a bigger priority than this issue. I  even heard the Prime Minister talk  about this bill   on national television    saying  that we should not judge people who use   small amounts of marijuana.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we do agree on the optics.  Even the Canadian Alliance agrees but we have come up with an amount that is not quite as big as the amount in the bill.    We  think that having  five grams   should not require a criminal investigation.  We understand that, however, if one is in possession of 30 grams, which is more joints,   who are we pleasing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  bigger concern we have, with the discount that I talked about, is what kind of message are we sending to our youth?</p><A NAME="T1030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1030)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one level  we are fighting tobacco by  asking people not to smoke. On another level, we are opening   up other issues that   go along  with that, for example, after how many joints  will someone become intoxicated?   Will the person  be driving a car and will  the police have the resources to test for marijuana substance in the blood?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we have so many  other issues   it   becomes very  difficult for someone  like me, who even had, as I said, an individual run  against me in my election and   understood its  point of view, to support the bill as it is presented. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alliance would like   the bill to go back to the committee where we can  think about it. The bureaucrats have mistakenly brought forward this  bill and   the Prime Minister is in a rush to push it through before he departs. Why? Only he knows the rationale for that. What is the rush? This  is not a priority on the radar screen. There are many other issues that have a higher priority for Canadians, such as  health care and all the other issues, than  a marijuana bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance has called for amendments to the bill and has asked that it be sent  back to the committee where we can rethink it  and, when we have nothing else to do,   discuss the bill again.</p><A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1035)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-720724"></A><a HREF="#Int-720730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-720715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Murray Calder (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Trade, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Justice  recently introduced Bill C-38, the proposed  cannabis reform legislation, and  I am pleased  to debate the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House is  undoubtedly aware, countries treat cannabis possession in different ways. Some countries tolerate certain forms of possession and consumption, certain countries apply administrative sanctions or fines, and others apply penal sanctions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, despite the different legal approaches toward cannabis, a common trend can be seen, particularly in Europe, in the development of alternate measures  to criminal prosecution for cases of the use and possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use. Fines, cautions, probation, exemption from punishment and counselling are favoured by many European justice systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Australian states and territories have also adopted cannabis decriminalization measures. Some of these measures are similar to what is being contemplated in Bill C-38. I would like to take a few moments to describe the situation in South Australia, the first Australian jurisdiction to adopt cannabis decriminalization measures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reform of the cannabis laws in South Australia came with the introduction of the controlled substances act amendment act, 1986. This amendment  proposed a number of changes to the controlled substances act of 1984, including the insertion of provisions dealing with the expiation of simple cannabis offences. This represented the adoption of a new scheme for the expiation of simple cannabis offences, such as possessing or cultivating small amounts of cannabis for personal use, or possessing implements for using cannabis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cannabis expiation notice, CEN, scheme came into effect in South Australia in 1987. Under this scheme, adults committing simple cannabis offences could be issued with an expiation notice. Offenders were able to avoid prosecution by paying the specified fine or fees ranging from  $50 Australian to  $150 Australian within 60 days of the issue of the notice. Failure to pay the specified fees within 60 days could lead to prosecution in court and the possibility of a conviction being recorded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underlying this scheme was the rationale that a clear distinction should be made between private users of cannabis and those who are involved in dealing, producing or trafficking in cannabis. This distinction was emphasized at the introduction of the CEN scheme by the simultaneous introduction of more severe penalties for offences relating to the manufacture, production, sale or supply of all drugs of dependence and prohibited substances, including offences relating to larger quantities of cannabis. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CEN scheme was modified by the introduction of the expiation of offences act, 1996, that now provides those served with an expiation notice the option of choosing to be prosecuted in order to contest being given the notice. Previously those served with a notice had to let the payment of expiation fees lapse in order to secure a court appearance to contest the notice. In choosing to be prosecuted, however, people issued a notice  have their alleged offence converted from one which can be expiated to one which still carries the possibility of a criminal conviction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expiation system for minor cannabis offences in South Australia has been the subject of a number of evaluation studies. The impact of the implementation of such a system is therefore best seen there. As I mentioned, the South Australian cannabis expiation notice, CEN, system began in 1987. The main arguments for an expiation system were the reduction of negative social impacts upon convicted minor cannabis offenders and the potential cost savings. Implicit in the former view was the belief that the potential harms of using cannabis were outweighed by the harms arising from criminal conviction.</p><A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the studies upon levels and patterns of cannabis use in South Australia found an increase in cannabis use that was attributable to the introduction of the CEN scheme. Cannabis use did increase in South Australia over the  period from 1985 to 1995, but increases in cannabis use were detected throughout Australia, including in jurisdictions that possessed a large prohibition approach to cannabis. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the largest increase in the rate of weekly cannabis use across all  Australian jurisdictions occurred in Tasmania, a strict prohibitionist state, between 1991 and 1995. A comparative study of minor cannabis offenders in South Australia and Western Australia concluded that both the CEN scheme and the more punitive prohibition approach had little deterrent effect upon cannabis users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offenders from both jurisdictions reported that the expiation notice or conviction had little or no impact upon subsequent cannabis and other drug use.  However, adverse social consequences of a cannabis conviction far outweighed those receiving an expiation notice.  A significantly higher portion  of those apprehended for cannabis use in Western Australia reported problems with employment, further involvement with the criminal system,  as well as accommodation and relationship problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the law enforcement and criminal justice areas, the number of offences for which cannabis expiation notices were issued in South Australia increased from 6,000 in 1987-88 to approximately 17,000 in 1993-94 and subsequent years.  This appears to reflect the greater ease with which police can process minor cannabis offences and a shift away from the use of police discretion in giving offenders informal cautions to a process of formally recording all minor offences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substantial numbers of offenders still received convictions due to their failure to pay the expiation fees on time.  This was due in large part to a poor understanding by cannabis users of the legal implications of not paying the expiation fees to avoid a court appearance and due to financial difficulties.  Most CENs are issued for less than 25 grams of cannabis. Half of all CENs issued were received by people in the 18 to 24 age group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been strong support by law enforcement and criminal justice personnel for the CEN scheme.  The scheme has proven to be relatively cost effective and more cost effective than the prohibition would have been.  The total costs associated with the CEN scheme in 1995-96 were estimated to be around $1.24 million Australian, while total revenue from fees and fines was estimated to be around $1.68 million Australian. Had a prohibition approach been in place, it is estimated that the total cost would have been around $2.01 million Australian, with revenues from fines being around $1 million Australian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A report on the CEN scheme noted that it appeared to have numerous benefits for the community, not the least of which were the cost savings for the community as a whole, the reduced negative social impacts for the offenders, greater efficiency and ease in dealing with minor cannabis offences and less negative views of the police held by offenders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Australian Capital Territory  in 1992 and the Northern Territory in 1996 introduced similar expiation schemes.  Victoria implemented a system of cautions for minor cannabis offenders in 1998 and Western Australia has followed with a similar scheme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes made in the cannabis laws in Australia are not technically decriminalization measures as cannabis possession still remains a criminal offence in all Australian provinces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has been changed is the reduction in the penalty for possessing small amounts of cannabis for personal use to something less than imprisonment, which is what is being proposed in Bill C-38.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the House for giving me the opportunity to say a few words.  I will conclude my brief remarks by indicating that this piece of legislation goes a long way in the right direction.</p><A NAME="Int-720730"></A><a HREF="#Int-720737"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-720724"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am certainly not as high on the legislation as is the hon. member who just finished speaking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to the member's  description of what happened in Australia. If this legislation is approved, I am not sure whether the result will be positive or negative. I am completely confused by some of the results of the study that was done in Australia.  I do not think a very close analysis was made of that study, but in any case,   the information is certainly not clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not be supporting the legislation as presented.  That is not to say that by the time it comes back to the House we will see the same legislation simply because we have heard there is  pressure within the Liberal Party to make changes to it.  Every piece of legislation  before us these days has been changed because one-half of the party supports it and the other half of the party which supports the other leader does not support it. This results in a stalemate and numerous amendments. It seems we are seeing that again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> How do you unite the right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</b> Let me deal with that. We  talk about unification.  There are all kinds of precedents for unifying two entirely different entities. What is really confusing is trying to unify one party.  How can one party be unified?  Unifying usually means bringing together two or more entities into one.  But when there is one entity, and they are trying to bring it together into one entity, that is extremely confusing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what the government is doing to the country.  That is what it is doing to this legislation and other legislation.  This is another carryover of what is going on  within the great Liberal Party these days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not make a blanket statement and say police generally do not support the legislation, but every police officer to whom I have spoken is against it.  We have to ask ourselves what we are doing to society.  When are we going to stop opening up the door, getting the thin edge of the wedge in, to destroying the type of society we have in Canada?  Bill C-38 is an example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have said there will be less work for police officers.  They have other things to do besides chasing after people who have  a joint in their pockets, but the police are already chasing them to see if they have three or four joints in their pockets. There is absolutely no difference whatsoever.  People will still want to use marijuana. People will still want to sell marijuana.  The door is now open for those who want to get involved in the illegal drug trade much more so than before because they  have a ready market and there are all kinds of ways to cover up illegal activities.  The work for our police forces will not be decreased.  The door will now be open, the thin edge of the wedge will now be inserted, and our young people will have the opportunity to  participate in activities from which they would be  much better removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is creating a society which is not for the betterment of Canada.  If we start allowing illegal activities, what will be next?  Will we  overlook a break and enter because only $50 was stolen or because only one window was broken? Is that not going to be considered a criminal offence any more? </p><A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right is right and wrong is wrong. Laws are made for the protection of society, but in particular for the protection of our young people until they understand what society is all about. Legislation like this is certainly not going to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not go any further than that, except to say that I am entirely against the legislation. I do not think it is good for society. It is the thin edge of the wedge. It is just a cop-out by the government to get away from the type of work that it should be doing. It should fund our police forces properly. In Newfoundland for instance, there is talk that the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary is so underfunded that quite often in order to go  to the scene of a crime, they have to hire a taxi. This is terrible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RCMP will tell us that they are not funded properly. They do not have the staffing levels to do what has to be done. They are saddled with bureaucracy. It is almost as bad as HRDC, and we will talk about that a little later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government properly funded our police forces, we would not have to worry about saying “They do not have the bodies, they cannot do the work, so let us give them less work and  the criminals will have a field day”. It is time the government put things in proper perspective and this is certainly not the way to start.</p><A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-720737"></A><a HREF="#Int-720767"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-720730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance): </b>Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate my colleague who just spoke because he had words of wisdom, words that need to be heard across the land.  Let us not get all excited about doing something new.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when I first came to the House we were spending millions of taxpayers' dollars against the use of tobacco but at the same time we were taxing tobacco.  Let me make a forecast that within a very few years we will be spending millions of dollars and advertising against the use of a drug which cannot and will not be controlled.  We will not have any income from it either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dangerous move.  Like my colleague who just spoke, I have 12 RCMP detachments in my constituency.  Three or four of them have highway patrols.  Members should ask any one of the highway patrols about the use of marijuana.  They should ask them upfront, in private, and they will say that marijuana is more dangerous on the highway right now than alcohol. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A car can be completely out of control and a driver can be pulled over, but the test given will show a blood alcohol content of only about .02.  Yet the driver  could be worse off and have less control over the vehicle than had he or she blown more than .08.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of every single detachment tell  me the same story.  I do not want to hear these crapped up figures that people have come up with from some supportive scientists who want to see this situation continue.  If we were to go to the Province of B.C., we would find unquestionably that the largest cash crop in the province comes from the illegal sale of marijuana. That is a fine statement for a province that is growing, and that will continue.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else will continue is the actual uncontrolled amount of the acidity in the marijuana grown.  It can be doubled or tripled.  So one joint next week or a year from now will do three times as much damage as what we have at present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I served as a justice of the peace for 25 years and I had these young people come before me.  I was situated right in the centre of an area with four detachments.  It was very convenient, 24 hours a day, to act very quickly.  I felt sorry for these young people.  They would come in and the fine was $100 plus $4 in costs.   I never saw them ever take the money out of their wallets.  They always had the money in their pockets. I felt badly for them but it was the in thing to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of pushing this bill, the government should be taking money to advertise the growing danger of this drug  to society.  That is what we should be doing.  We should be getting concrete scientific evidence as to what it could do.  The government is  so in favour of trying to reach out to get young votes at the cost of destroying their lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I go home at night from here, I often stop at Tim Hortons and have--</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> A donut.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Roy Bailey:</b> No, a cup of cappuccino and a bagel.  I too often see, not so much when it is a little chillier, youth out there.  I know quite a bit about youth and I can pretty well judge their age, 14, 15 and 16 year olds.  It is not a pretty sight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know what I did, and others did no doubt, out there sucking on the obnoxious weeds of tobacco.  All this bill will do will increase the use of another obnoxious weed.</p><A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1055)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People cannot tell me that their lungs are not harmed when they inhale smoke.  That is absolute nonsense.  Why do we have masks for spraying? Why do we have masks for firefighters? Why do we have masks for any number of things? It is to protect the lungs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the privilege to sit in an operating theatre and watch a lung removed from someone who had been smoking. It was the most grotesque thing I had  ever witnessed in my life. There was even an odour to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday I went to watch the new film that will go out to every Royal Canadian Legion in the country entitled <i>A Pittance of Time</i>. It was a beautiful production.  However, on the way back I took a shortcut because I was going to be late for a committee meeting. I watched some 15 year old youth or they may have been a little older.  I could smell the marijuana.  I can smell it just like I can smell sweet grass burning.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Steve Mahoney:</b> What did you do, pull up a chair?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Roy Bailey:</b> Do not make a joke out of this, sir.  This is serious business.  It is nothing to be laughed at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I saw was what I have seen many times in my life.  It was to watch people who were not in control of themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us go back to the drawing board and let us have more scientific proof.  Let us have it come from this country and not from the imagination of some country abroad.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community care workers represent many groups and disciplines and carry out various functions.  These include: nurses, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, homemakers, home support workers and volunteers. These are the vital front line workers who provide home based care, facility based long term care, meal programs and community support programs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the delivery of many health care services shifts from the hospitals to the community, community care workers are increasingly called upon to assist in the transition and ensure a continuity of client centred care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To honour these front line workers and acknowledge the invaluable contribution they make to the health care of Canadians, the Canadian Association for Community Care has initiated the community care worker award, which is presented to the winner in the community every year during community care worker week.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over one year has passed since the tribunal made these remedy recommendations.  Despite concerns about the World Trade Organization's reaction, Canada should have taken the same position as the United States and Mexico against offshore imports.  I am very disappointed the government has not chosen to act on the inquiry findings determined by the CITT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel industry in Niagara has suffered significantly from this lack of safeguard action. Atlas Specialty Steel and others have either collapsed or are on the verge of collapse.  About 550 dedicated Atlas workers in the region of Niagara are now without work.  These are real people with real families facing an upsetting and uncertain future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am pleased that the newly formed North American steel trade committee will look at many of these pressing issues, I fear that it may be too little, too late for the Canadian steelworkers.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ensure that a North American steel accord is developed and put into place immediately.  We need to revisit safeguard action on steel imports now.  We need to take whatever actions we can to preserve the steel industry in Canada for Canadian workers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this unanimous motion and follow-up work by our embassy staff in Beijing, 8 of the 13 were released. Some are now in Canada, where they are model citizens. Tianxong Peng, for example, was freed on Christmas Eve and now lives with his sister Helen here in Ontario.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, a year later, as the Prime Minister prepares for another APEC conference, the situation in China has become worse, not better. These few releases   have been accompanied by the arrests of thousands of non-violent Falun Gong practitioners. Today, 17 individuals who are the brothers and sisters and the parents and the children of Canadians are imprisoned in China. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore ask the Prime Minister to take advantage of the upcoming APEC conference to raise the issue of these 17 peaceful individuals so that they too may be allowed to come home to their families here in Canada.</p>

Following the election of its first social-democrat president three years ago, this state has turned a new leaf and boldly moved toward democracy by enhancing  human rights, freedom of expression and freedom of the press.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike its neighbour, Communist China, Taiwan has made giant strides in building democratic structures that have paved the way for a modern and dynamic society, a model for the entire Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a sovereignist, I am proud to note that, like Quebec, Taiwan is striving for recognition as a country and for its place at the table of nations. In that sense, I hope that the Canadian government will acknowledge the democratic values promoted by that country and will encourage Taiwan to sit as an observer at the World Health Organization, as well as recognize the right of the 23 million citizens of the  Republic of China to be represented in the United Nations system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all Taiwanese, happy national day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only his public achievements that bear recall, but his private virtues: a loving husband and devoted father and grandfather, whose family love of him will be his most everlasting legacy; a loyal friend; a courageous advocate; an abiding commitment to the sister democracies of Canada and Israel and to his most beloved Winnipeg; and a jazz enthusiast as repose for the soul.</p>

This less utilized but extremely viable transportation option can and will over time alleviate pressure and congestion at major ports to the south.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Prince Rupert, a new container facility is in the planning stages, along with required rail upgrades to handle double-stacked rail cars. The offshore oil and gas potential is very real. New pipeline projects to the coast are under discussion, and currently a cruise ship dock is under construction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite current economic woes, the future of northwest British Columbia looks positive.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What exactly did the Liberal members from Quebec applaud last Tuesday? The cuts imposed on Quebec for health, education and social services, or the pillaging of the EI account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was this maybe the Liberal members' way of showing disagreement with the choice made by the National Assembly to support young families in Quebec by implementing a progressive family policy that is the envy of all, or are they perhaps opposed to the tuition freeze?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal members' applause ill conceals their desire to diminish Quebec, and that is a disgrace.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has observed a de facto moratorium on the death penalty since the early 1960s. With the removal of the death penalty from the Criminal Code in 1976 and from the National Defence Act in 1988, Canada became a de facto abolitionist state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada encourages the abolition of the death penalty internationally and supports all efforts to ensure respect for safeguards in its application. Canada calls upon countries that have not abolished the death penalty to do so or to at least consider a moratorium on its use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada further urges those governments maintaining the death penalty to ensure that any death sentences are carried out in accordance with international law, in particular by not imposing the death penalty for crimes committed by persons under the age of 18, and to respect the right to consular assistance for foreign nationals.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are investments in those communities. By the way, all of these investments are in Alliance ridings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed consideration of the motion.</p><A NAME="Int-721197"></A><a HREF="#Int-721207"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-721191"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Lynne Yelich (Blackstrap, Canadian Alliance): </b>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to take part in this debate about Bill C-38, a bill that would change how the judicial system deals with possession and production of marijuana.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues across the way have told us about the good intent of this bill:  that it will decriminalize the actions of millions of Canadians; that it will provide opportunities for young people who might otherwise be burdened by a criminal record; and that it will relieve some of the congestion in our courts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have to ask, at what cost will this be achieved?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have several concerns about this bill and the government's attempt to fast-track it  through the system, concerns ranging from the amount of marijuana that is decriminalized to the penalties and sentences for various offences. There are also numerous logistical issues involving the practical side of enforcing the proposed new law, which I feel must be addressed before legislation is passed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally and most importantly, I am gravely concerned about the message that Bill C-38 will send to Canadians in general, but to our youngest and most vulnerable citizens in particular. I intend to explore each of these concerns in greater detail during the next few minutes in the hope that these issues will be noted and perhaps highlighted in the committee setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill establishes a new system of guidelines for the decriminalized possession of marijuana. From what I understand, the government has based these numbers on what it considers appropriate or reasonable amounts of marijuana for personal or recreational use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at these numbers. Possession of 15 grams or less of marijuana gets one a $150 fine if one is an adult. Possession of between 15 and 30 grams of marijuana could get someone a fine or perhaps a summons for a summary offence. Possession of one gram or less of cannabis resin is good for a fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implication here is that having between 15 and 30 grams of marijuana is considered reasonable for personal use, that   the drug would not be meant for trafficking. Grams seem like a tiny unit of measure, and 15 to 30 grams does not sound like a lot to most of us. But depending on how much marijuana is used, that same 15 to 30 grams translates into 30 to 50 joints. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know there are many parents and grandparents in this chamber. How many of them would think it acceptable or reasonable if they were suddenly to find 50 joints concealed in their son's or daughter's book bag or clothing? Unless that son or daughter were smoking up day and night, I think I would find myself wondering if some of those joints might be for sale or for purposes other than personal use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decriminalizing up to 30 grams of marijuana is the government's idea of responsibility. In contrast, my opposition colleagues feel that this number must be reduced to a maximum of 5 grams of marijuana if this bill is to become even remotely tolerable. This would equal between 5 and 12 joints, an amount far less likely to be for the purpose of trafficking. I personally believe that even 5 grams is too much and that Canadians are better served by a government that does not take lightly illegal drug use of any kind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned a few minutes ago, the penalties for possession and production of marijuana as outlined in Bill C-38 merit considerable questioning and review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed fines for possession are negligible and, as such, I suspect they will not act as an effective deterrent. An adult possessing less than 15 grams of marijuana will face a fine of $150, or $300 for possession of between 15 and 30 grams. That is about the same as one could expect to pay for a traffic infraction such as speeding. One look at the Queensway or any other major thoroughfare will give us a pretty good idea of how unintimidated drivers are by the prospect of such a small fine. Marijuana users will likely be similarly undeterred, making the fines ineffective.</p><A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1215)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people between the ages of 14 and 18 will get an even better deal from the government if they are caught with marijuana.  Youth fines, as proposed, are one-third less than the adult version.  I question the reasoning behind this decision which takes already nominal fines and reduces them so they are more affordable for drug possessing youth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should take a cue from the world of marketing, where it is known that young people often have access to more disposable income than adults and are less cautious in their spending. They wear expensive designer clothing, shoes and accessories, and they tote the latest in high tech communications devices and gadgetry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notion that a discount fine will deter youth from possessing marijuana is an absolutely ridiculous idea.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still on the subject of sentencing, I have heard rumours that the minister may consider tougher minimum sentences for marijuana growers and for repeat offenders. I sincerely hope that this is more than a rumour because these issues have not been adequately addressed in the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a logistical standpoint, the government is trying to fast-track the bill through Parliament without ensuring that the provinces, municipalities and authorities have the proper tools in place to implement it. From what I have read, the bill does not provide extra money for policing, fine collection or any of the other inevitable administration costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, my greatest concern about the bill is the message it sends to Canadians, particularly our youth.  I hope this issue will be studied in great detail by the committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the bill was introduced there was a lot of talk about decriminalization and legalization:   Which would the government choose?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I talked to people in my riding, both adults and youth, I was disturbed to note that the terms were used interchangeably.  I worry that should the bill pass, our young people will not differentiate between two definitions and  as a result  they will come away with the idea that buying, possessing and smoking marijuana is okay. That is a behaviour actually endorsed by the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest to the House that it is irresponsible to even contemplate passing a bill such as Bill C-38 without first establishing a clear and comprehensive education campaign to inform our young people about what the bill is intended to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Saskatoon, the city council is in the process of discussing a ban on public smoking.  Similar bans have been adopted here in Ottawa and in other cities and towns across the country.  It is a health and safety issue and, as such, the cities are trying to do what they can to discourage smoking. By virtue of making it okay to possess a smokable drug, decriminalizing marijuana is a backward step in this fight for improved health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is sending mixed messages.  It is telling Canadians not to smoke because  it is bad for  them and  cigarette companies not to advertise because it can influence our young people, but marijuana, that is not criminal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the minister described Bill C-38 as the launch of a real reform.  I suggest that the bill needs some real reform.</p><A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-721207"></A><a HREF="#Int-721254"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-721197"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Leon Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance): </b>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this bill which deals with the issue of decriminalizing marijuana.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make it very clear that I absolutely cannot  and will not  support the bill.  It is certainly not supported by most of my constituents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have examined and will continue to examine the issue of decriminalization under certain circumstances  but under the terms laid out in the  legislation, it is completely unacceptable, and  I will explain in a little bit why.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I  first want to deal  with the contradiction that the legislation, as it is presented here, provides for Canadians when we have heard so much talk about the importance of dealing with the seriousness of drunk driving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day  in Canada  five people are killed and more than 200 people are injured due to drunk driving.  There has been a great public effort to try to cut down and eliminate drunk driving, period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the work on drunk driving,    the government is proposing to  decriminalize the use of marijuana in large amounts, up to 30 grams, and, at the same time, doing it before we have any kind of roadside test or reliable roadside assessment  to deal with someone driving while under the influence of marijuana.  It just seems absurd that any government would propose such a thing. All we are doing is expanding on the serious problem of drunk driving   to include another very serious problem of driving while under the influence of drugs. To me it seems totally irresponsible that the government would  propose that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much effort  on the one hand to cut down on drunk driving; so lightly the government would put in place legislation that  would make it so easy and, in effect, encourage driving while under the influence of marijuana. I believe that issue has to be dealt with before  anyone  will   seriously consider supporting this legislation, and that certainly should be the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain requirements would have to be put in place before I could ever seriously consider any  legislation to  decriminalize marijuana  and, as I said, they certainly are not in place in this legislation as it has been presented to the House. The legislation does not reflect the proposals put in place by the committee  which  spent months studying it.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  minimum requirements for change that would have to be made to this legislation before I could consider seriously supporting it are the following. First , when it comes to summary conviction fines, they would apply to five grams or less, not to the 30 grams, which is a very large amount of marijuana and is an amount more commonly connected with someone trafficking, as some of my colleagues have mentioned. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second,  we  would need a clear understanding with the  provincial governments,  and in fact  with the legal industry  which would have to exist to consistently deal with criminal offences under the decriminalization amounts.  In other words, someone caught with 35, 40 or 50 grams would face criminal convictions in the courts of all provinces. We would have to be comfortable with the set  limit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is proposing a limit of 30 grams.  I can imagine what would happen in court if someone were charged with the possession of 32 grams.  The judge would  probably say that under the Criminal Code it is unfair to charge  someone who has 32 grams even though the law  put the limit at 30.   The amounts  would certainly come into play.  It is critical that   does not happen and therefore the provincial governments would have to  agree to the level that  is set, which certainly should not be,  in my opinion, more than five grams,    and not the thirty  grams proposed in the legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another requirement would be for a progressive fine schedule to be put in place. Fines and penalties would increase based on the number of convictions and not just the same fine again and again.</p><A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal in the legislation that young people receive a lower fine for possession of amounts under 30 grams than older people is absurd. What kind of message does that send to our young people? It sends a message to them that smoking marijuana cannot possibly be   harmful, and  I absolutely disagree.  Marijuana is a very dangerous drug and  our young people should be discouraged from using it.  However, this  legislation would,  in effect,  encourage young people to use marijuana because it sends the  message  that it is not harmful. That is wrong and I think that has to be changed before the legislation can be supported.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A national drug strategy would have to be in place.  One would think that with all the good work the committee did  and   all the minds that have been working on this in the justice department, they would have focused  on putting in place a national drug strategy, some kind of an overall, overarching strategy to deal with the very serious problem of drug use in this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far what has been the government's response to this serious drug problem? It has opened  up a shoot-up site in Vancouver so  people can legally break the law right on the streets of Vancouver.  I do not think that is appropriate.  There are some very serious problems with that and we have seen them in other countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not a drug strategy.  That is admitting failure.  That is government saying that it cannot deal with this serious problem and it simply cannot win, so it will not even try. That is absolutely unacceptable and   it is shameful that a government would say that about  a problem as serious as drug use.  We know all of the social hardships that are a result of drug use and yet the government's response is to open up shoot-up sites with no national drug strategy. I think that is absurd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To focus on the problem of marijuana use first without focusing on other serious drugs, in some cases more harmful drugs, is another case of the government  setting the wrong  priorities. We cannot  try to deal with a problem like this bit by bit, piece by piece, in a completely unorganized fashion.  That is not something that will work.  Canadians know that.  I am surprised the government does not know that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue which I think will be even more difficult to deal with if this legislation actually passes is the issue of drug trafficking and grow ops.  We know   these problems have   damaged and caused great hardship in many communities across the  country.  Certain areas of our towns and cities have been harmed quite dramatically by having grow ops and trafficking in the area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law of the country has to be clear and workable to where grow ops and trafficking are considered to be and are serious criminal offences. When one is talking about decriminalizing the possession of amounts up to 30 grams,   the line  will be blurred between those who have marijuana for their own use and those who have marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. That is just making the problem more difficult to deal with. It is not really helping to fix the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those reasons and others  I   will not be supporting the  legislation.  We will  continue to encourage the government to make amendments to  fix these things and deal with the problem of trade with the United States.  The Americans have made it clear that if we decriminalize, as is proposed in this legislation, we will have more trade problems, problems in moving goods across the border.  We already have trade problems that are devastating the agriculture industry and   the softwood lumber industry. We do not need that to be broadened out to other industries.  Yet the Americans have said that this will do that.</p><A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us deal with these problems. If the government were to deal with all of these issues I mentioned, then I would consider the legislation.  I still think that decriminalizing marijuana sends a message to our young people and Canadians that it  is not as harmful as in fact I believe it is.</p><A NAME="Int-721254"></A><a HREF="#Int-721274"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-721207"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP): </b>Madam Speaker, I would like to speak briefly to Bill C-38, an act to amend the Contraventions Act and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have found the debate very interesting today.  There are many concerns with the bill that the NDP shares with many other members of the House.  It is a contradictory and confusing piece of legislation at the present time. It has widespread criticism from all sides of the political spectrum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point, the bill was introduced by the government on May 27, 2003, just one day after it launched an appeal against an Ontario court ruling declaring that people with medical exemptions have legal supplies of the drug.  It was a very obvious contradiction right at the outset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill seeks to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana but toughen penalties on large marijuana grow operations.  At present, being arrested for possession or carrying marijuana is an up to seven year jail sentence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would  like to look at  what implications the bill may have on possibly unexpected persons.  The provisions of the bill are quite simple.  Cannabis possession and production will remain illegal in Canada.  The current criminal court process and resulting criminal penalties would be replaced with fines for possession of 15 grams or less of marijuana and one gram or less of cannabis resin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would give law enforcement officers the discretion to give a ticket or issue a summons to appear in a criminal court for possessing 15 to 30 grams of cannabis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a new four tier method of punishing people.  An individual found growing one to three plants would face a summary conviction offence with a fine of up to $5,000 or 12 months in jail.  For 4 to 25 plants, it  would constitute an offence punishable by a fine of up to $25,000 or 18 months in jail.  Growing 26 to 50 plants would result in a sentence of up to 10 years and the sentence for growing more than 50 plants would be up to 14 years, which is double the current maximum penalty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rather an odd way of going about things.  It is saying that a little bit is all right and a bit more is less all right.  It seems to miss the point in terms of sending messages to people in terms of the use of marijuana.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill misleads Canadians and it perpetuates the myth that the criminal law can resolve the problems relating to drugs.  The NDP would say that there may be a fear  that increased penalties on cultivation could in fact push the price of marijuana up making it more difficult for people who use marijuana for medical purposes.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would say that a stiffer regime of penalities may ironically reinforce organized crime and force out the small operations, and that there is still an emphasis on enforcement.  We have a concern that ticketing will actually increase the demand of police resources at the local level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no provisions in the bill for amnesty for Canadians who currently have a criminal record from cannabis convictions.  There are approximately 600,000 Canadians who have criminal records for simple marijuana possession.  There may in fact be people in the House who have criminal records for marijuana. I have not done any checks but that is a possibility and certainly there are members of our family who may have it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move ahead and begin to understand marijuana in a different way then obviously we must have some kind of mechanism in place to clear the record on some of these supposed criminal offences.</p><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-38 presents a contradictory and confused approach. That is the fundamental message that we want to send.  On the one hand it purports to offer a measure of decriminalization, but the political rhetoric and system of penalties outlined actually points to a tougher and wider enforcement stance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another objection is that we fear that increasing penalties on growing marijuana will push up the price.  For medical purposes this could cause even more problems for people who are in need of it for pain management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is too much emphasis on enforcement in our estimation.  It is feared that ticketing would increase the demand for police resources at the local level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 100,000 Canadians use marijuana.  There is no evidence that the ticketing scheme or tougher sentences would reduce that number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to conclude by speaking a little about the medical use of marijuana.  The Special Committee on the Non-Medical Use of Drugs   did not deal with marijuana for medical purposes.  The NDP wishes to draw attention to the serious problems and flaws in the federal government's medical marijuana program. The current regulations of the program are very restrictive, overly bureaucratic, and severely limit the access for Canadians who have a legitimate need for therapeutic purposes. The NDP believes that these unnecessary restrictions should be lifted.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations of the Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs in this regard make very good sense and we would like to see them adopted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill still needs work.  The NDP has been very supportive of the work done by the committee on drug use and has worked hard on a consensus basis to bring about more progressive laws on this front.  We will continue to work to make this a better bill in committee.</p><A NAME="Int-721274"></A><a HREF="#Int-721316"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-721254"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Larry Spencer (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, Canadian Alliance): </b>Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to the notion of decriminalizing marijuana. I do so at a time when it is probably bringing more confusion not only to this country and especially to the teenagers of our nation but also to the nation south of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been involved in some meetings in high schools over the past year and that is one of the very hot topics there. Students are quite anxious to see this happen and just to prove it they have already ramped up their use of marijuana. It is a known fact that marijuana use in high schools has already increased because of this proposed legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Walters, the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy at the White House, recently remarked about our Prime Minister. He had something to say that we should listen to very carefully. He said that Canadians are concerned about the behaviour of their Prime Minister and the joking that he has done with this issue. Our Prime Minister said:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>I don't know what is marijuana. Perhaps I will try it when it will no longer be criminal. I will have money for my fine and a joint in the other hand.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is something like going to the airport and saying “Yes, I have a bomb in my shoe and one in my hip pocket”. We know not to do that.  It would seem to me that a Prime Minister of a nation would know not to make that kind of joking remark in any place in the world where it might be reported back. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that was a harmful statement and it is misleading to our youth. I believe it is degrading to our nation, this Parliament and to the Prime Minister himself. I was quite sorry to hear that he would make that kind of a statement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Walters of the United States also said:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Canada is the one place in the hemisphere where things are going the wrong (way) rapidly. It's the only country in this hemisphere that's become a major drug producer instead of reducing their drug production.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is very true and it is a sad commentary on our nation. It is a sad commentary on our government and on those who want to push this relaxation of the war on drugs through the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently in committee, my hon. colleague from Langley--Abbotsford admitted and said to the committee that this is a touchy issue when it comes to border relationships with the United States. After our experience with BSE and our experience with other agricultural subsidies placed on products by the United States, it would seem that we would learn our lesson.  It would seem that we would try to be decent and good neighbours to those to the south and not be so insulting to them as what we have found ourselves being.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member from Langley--Abbotsford also said that there is little point in developing a process in this country when we offend everybody south of us. That is extremely important and one of the major problems with the idea of decriminalizing marijuana. It is going to create all kinds of border problems and relationship problems with our friends in the United States.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill says that it is okay to smoke and possess 15 grams or less of marijuana, or at least it is not a criminal offence. It is okay to smoke it, but it is not okay to possess too much. It is not okay to grow. It is not okay for a lot of things and so the message is very mixed. One of the messages that concerns me more than perhaps any of the others is the mixed message or the reverse message that is going out related to the health of people who use marijuana.</p><A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all kinds of misinformation coming to us that says this practice is not harmful.  We all know that is not true.  We know that it has to be harmful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded of a time, back in the last century, in the 1950s. I was not too old at that time, but I remember as a young lad going to church.   I do not remember which man said it, but I remember being taught that should I take up the habit of smoking cigarettes,  it would be harmful to my body.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know from the fifties all the way to the nineties that was disputed. There were many people of supposed wisdom who diffused that claim.  Then all of a sudden, we began to reckon with all the cancer deaths from smoking cigarettes.  Finally, we had a number of class action suits against  tobacco companies because of the harm that tobacco smoke had caused so many people.  Now this was a known fact and they were suing the tobacco companies because there was no warning  label.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the most ridiculous things that has ever happened in the history of enlightened society. For a half century anybody with, as my dad used to say, the sense God gave a goose would know that cigarette smoke could not be helpful to one's body, that it would be harmful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my hon. colleague mentioned earlier, we, including firemen, use masks and guards to protect us from all kinds of other fumes and smoke.  We know it is not helpful to breathe that into our lungs, yet we are allowing our teenagers to believe it is quite all right. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a tragedy if the House of Commons were to adopt the bill and send that skewed message to the young people of our nation who will then, no doubt, be returning to ask for help through the health system because of the long term problems this will no doubt cause with the new high power brand of marijuana which can now be produced in grow houses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lingering effects of marijuana smoke are something far more treacherous than alcohol.  When someone drinks alcohol and becomes intoxicated, it is only a matter of hours until the body  cleans itself up, the intoxication is gone and the body is back to normal.  I am told the effects of marijuana smoke linger for days, not just hours, and a person could literally be intoxicated from marijuana smoke for all time. That  would therefore decrease the performance of our students, decrease the ability to handle automobiles, machinery, to do jobs, to think, to speak, all these things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Calgary East pointed out that it was a student discount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently bought a new automobile.  One thing that caused me to buy that new automobile was a discount on the penalty for buying it.  In other words, for not having cash, I could now get a very discounted rate on the interest I would be charged if I bought it before I had the cash.  Therefore, because the penalty for buying it early was lessened, I bought it.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have thousands of teenagers.  Because they see the penalty is lessened, they are getting the student discount.  Because it is no longer a criminal offence, they are buying into the false idea that smoking marijuana is just fine.  I cannot support such a discount.</p><A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-721316"></A><a HREF="#Int-721317"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-721274"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos): </b>Is the House ready for the question?</p>

The government should celebrate and  encourage Canada's magnificent and diverse culture by changing the Income Tax Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the multicultural critic for the Canadian Alliance, I must start  by saying our multicultural  policy has been highly successful. It is viewed around the world as being one of the most progressive policies of countries  that have  people of different cultures living together. This of course allows an expression of culture, which is excellent, and promotes, like any other cultures, innovation and creativity. One would tend to agree with the motion because it recognizes diverse creativity among the artistic community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A civilization's maturity is also reflected in how far it has developed its culture. Canadian culture is very highly respected around the world, be it the French culture, the English culture or  the aboriginal culture. We have a diverse culture. Across this nation we see this fabulous creativity from artist from all walks of life. It is a matter of great pride and support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to support the motion wholeheartedly.  However aside from the fact that we would like to support this cultural advancement, and we will support it, the difficulty with the motion is it asks  that artists be treated as a special group. It asks that they have an exemption from income tax.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many of the gripping notes I have received, mention has been made that artists have to struggle a lot before their work is recognized. I  think that is a given fact not only in Canada but everywhere else. However to change the Income Tax Act to try to assist them in that way leaves us with this  question.  Where, how far and why only them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have  a partial list of people with special status.  It includes people with disabilities, caregivers, people employed overseas, people who have stopped earning an income, people who are buying RRSPs and so forth. It is a partial list but it is big. When we see the government using taxpayer money to promote its friends, like Bombardier and some other businesses, then one would not be surprised that somebody like my colleague from the NDP, who is  from the artistic community, would also want that.  There is nothing wrong in her bringing forward that motion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had three private members' motions, particularly this week, asking for the same thing. As a matter of fact one of my colleagues, whom I supported,  brought forward a motion asking for an exemption for firefighters. Then we had my colleague from the NDP asking for income tax exemptions for those who participate in sports. Now we have this.  Where do we go from here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance believes the solution to all this lies with having lower income tax  for everybody, because every group, one way or another, has a need.  A lot of seniors live in my riding.  They face terrible times because of their fixed incomes. Calgary being a booming city, the rents are rising and so is everything else. They are having a hard time.   Groups, such as minor hockey teams,  are looking for some kind of relief.  Everyone is looking for relief.  How much can the pot be spread before there is nothing left?</p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1255)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my party's view,  a very simple solution to better  address these issues would be to  cut the unnecessary expenditures.  Let us get rid of the boondoggles at HRDC and the gun registry.  Cutting out the unnecessary expenditures would allow the Government of Canada to reduce taxes overall.  Then every Canadian would benefit, be they in the artistic community, in the business community, anywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An overall tax cut  would give the initiative to all Canadians, including artists. It would meet the objective that my colleague has put forward to help the artists that need assistance.  An overall tax reduction across the board would assist everyone, including single mothers.  We seem to forget single mothers.  Single mothers have a difficult time raising their children.  They have jobs which do not pay enough.  In my riding the last time I was out knocking on doors I came across many single mothers who had returned home to live with their parents because they could not financially make ends meet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are pockets of homeless people in our cities.  To come up  with a band-aid solution for  this group or that group will not solve many of the issues.  Why would we say yes to one  group and no to another group?  How could we differentiate between the groups?  They all make a solid contribution to our Canadian mosaic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution is an across the board tax reduction.  That can only happen if the government controls its expenditures.  If the government does not control its expenditures, then there is nothing we can do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same party that has put forward the motion has said that our foreign aid commitment should increase by 0.7%.  That is a very nice thought, but where would  the money  come from?  There is only one taxpayer and there are other issues to be addressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government reduced its expenditures, it would be able to reduce taxes.  Then everyone in society would benefit, including the artists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with difficulty that we must say  we do not support the  motion.  It is not  because we do not recognize the value of the artistic community; it is because we think a better approach would be  a reduction in overall taxes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, we all have favourite subjects. To some extent, we are all critics at heart when it comes to our special interests. Some people are passionate about sports, recreation, science or technology. In my case, it is health and culture. My past experience in health care explains my interest in the former, and my passion for arts and culture justifies my special love for the latter. Today, I want to talk about culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to congratulate the hon. member for Dartmouth for having drawn the attention of the House to the important issue of supporting artists and various cultural stakeholders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion before us today states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>

</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I continue, I want to clarify that my hon. colleague for Drummond has moved an amendment to replace the word “Canada's” with the word “a”. Later, I will talk about what this means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois will be pleased to vote in favour of the motion by the hon. member from the NDP.   Once again, this demonstrates our support for artists and creators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an obvious paradox between our daily lives, the place of culture in our lives and the status of artists. Who does not have at home books that make for a good read from time to time, to escape into another world, either real or fantasy, leaving behind the hustle and bustle of everyday life? Who does not watch television or videos once in a while? How many people enjoy a night out at the theatre or at a concert? How many CDs do you have in your collection at home—and I  hope there are more real ones than      illegal copies? This goes to show that culture is an integral part of our way of life, our reality, and wherever we turn, whatever we do, it never leaves anyone indifferent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the individuals in the many professions in the cultural sector, though? What about the artists in particular, who are self-employed for the most part? If culture is everywhere and we   consume culture daily, does this make artists some of the wealthiest members of our society? With the exception of a few comedians, singers and actors, the majority are very badly off, financially speaking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this situation, are we unable to change anything? Some thought has to be given to this by both individuals and lawmakers. Allow me first to call on individuals. Our artists are not poor only because of a limited market or    greedy production company agents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be curious to know how many illegal copies of CDs we could collect if we searched every household in Quebec and Canada. How can one claim to appreciate the work of an artist, but not feel it is worth paying $20 or $25 to buy the CD and listen to the music or songs performed as often as we want to? Copying an artist's work without paying is disrespectful, ungrateful and unfair. We have a collective responsibility to prevent artists from being robbed, and robbery must not be trivialized “because everyone is doing it”, as some put it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can the lawmakers do? Of course, we have a responsibility to creators and performers. We cannot ignore the fact that  most often they are financially hard up,if not living below the poverty line.</p><A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1300)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, they are often self-employed, which means they cannot receive certain benefits provided for in the Labour Code. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at various factors that influence an artist's work and living conditions, there is no doubt that positive government action is essential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec—this will come as no surprise—we already have provisions similar to those in Motion No. 293. At first artists were eligible for an annual exemption on copyright revenues based on a sliding scale up to $30,000. This has now been raised to $60,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except in cases when artists enjoy  a resounding success, it is difficult for them to predict what their future will hold and what their tax return will look like the following year. In this case, the past is not necessarily an indication of what the future will be like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Conference of the Arts, or the CCA, has been asking for tax breaks on copyright revenues for a long time. In its budget proposal to the finance committee in September 2002, the CCA asked for a tax exemption equivalent to the one granted in Quebec. To that effect, recommendations 3 and 4 stipulate:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>     That the government of Canada give serious consideration to supporting Canada’s professional artists and creators, the cornerstone of Canada’s cultural industries and institutions, by exempting up to $60,000 of annual copyright income.  </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>     That, following the implementation of the above-mentioned tax exemption on copyright income, the government of Canada give serious consideration to extending such an exemption to apply to up to $60,000 per annum of all artistic income.  </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there is no question of the legitimacy of these demands, and since artists deserve additional government support, at least through tax measures encouraging their artistic endeavours, we support the motion of the member for Dartmouth. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already said, a motion in amendment has been submitted by my colleague from Drummond, seconded by the member for  Matapédia—Matane. It reads: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>That the motion beamended by replacing the word “Canada's” with the word “a”. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I m sure that you will not see this as an undisguised attempt at trouble-making or petty politics.  On the contrary, we want to make this motion into a more inclusive parliamentary initiative, one that better reflects the reality of the culture of this vast territory north of the American border. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By deleting the word “Canada's”, we are acknowledging that there are different cultures within this vast country, and that all deserve the same recognition by the federal government.  To name but a few: the Quebec culture, the English Canadian culture, the French Canadian culture, and those of the aboriginal, Acadian and immigrant communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I raise my hat to all those who, day in and day out, bring colour to our lives through their cultural creations.  Thanks to them, our lives are touched by imagination and fantasy.  Often the ups and downs of life seem more bearable when our spirits can soar with the help of music, poetry or a good book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As André Malraux put it:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That freedom is what I wish for all the artists and other creative members of our society.  </p><A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1305)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

For many years I have been a strong supporter of artists of whatever type, whether it be visual artists or painters or musicians across this country. In fact, on numerous occasions I have had the opportunity to work directly and indirectly with a number of individuals and groups in promoting the great history and culture of our country, which can be done more explicitly through the art form than perhaps any other way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the best ambassadors we have had for our country, and we can say individually from our provinces, have been our artists and our musicians.  In my own case, I can think of a group of very good friends of mine, a band called Great Big Sea, which is known from coast to coast to coast.  These young men, long-time friends of mine, have done a tremendous job of representing not only Canada but specifically Newfoundland.  If one watches any show in which they perform, some time during the show, in fact quite often many times, they will mention, promote and sing about the great province from which they all come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at my friends from the Bloc next to me here. Some of the strongest artists and performers we have in this country of course come from Quebec and over the years they have done a great job not only of representing the  province but in preserving that unique history and culture of the great province of Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet is there some way we can help them? Because all of them are not successful.  I mentioned Great Big Sea. People are saying that those guys are making a lot of money these days, so why would they want breaks?  Of course they are not asking for them, but there certainly was a time; they did not just appear on the national scene.  They performed as students, actually, trying to work their way through university by making a few dollars entertaining, and it was a few dollars.  Like it is for any group, it takes a while to gain the attention that gives a group the bookings or the buy-ins or whatever in order for  it to start making money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many of our young artists, in particular our writers and painters, it takes a long time to prove themselves, to have their work accepted.  For many of them, because their names are not recognized, unfortunately, it does not matter how good the work is. Unless somebody is really keen on interpreting the works of these writers or artists, their work quite often goes unnoticed. For many of those who are successful, their breaks come through luck  or the support of some very conscientious people who are constantly looking for a good product, and consequently the performer or artist makes it on the scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately many do not, but yet in their own ways they contribute.  If we did not have our artists, if we did not have our actors, if we did not have our musicians, again I hesitate to try to understand how our heritage and culture could be promoted and preserved.  One of the ways that we learn about history is from verse.  I am sure it is from the old ballads that were passed along long before history was written by several cultures; the stories, the ballads, the poems, that is how we learned about our past.  The same is true today. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in my own province  of Newfoundland and Labrador there is a very rich culture and history.  Much of it is preserved through art forms, certainly not by the dedicated efforts of any government trying to write a proper history. Those who do that work for us and get little in return certainly should be helped in any way. Is an exemption in the Income Tax Act  the way to do it?  It is quite possible it is, and I would have no problems with that.</p><A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1310)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the danger is of course that we would get people from other groups that make low wages in their professions asking why a young evolving artist who hopefully will eventually do  exceptionally well should get a break, when those in the trades at the lower end or working on  a farm as a labourer or whatever the case may be would not.  They would say, “I am not going to get that break and I will be here until I  die”.  They would ask why they should not get a break when  they are not making any more money than the people  we are talking about exempting and when they have less of an opportunity to advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot overlook any groups in our country who are making minimal wages. If only we had proper exemptions; our party has recommended that at the least we should have a $12,000 ceiling on income tax so that families and individuals who are making low wages would not have to pay income tax before they reached that bracket.  That would give many low wage earners a break and we would not have to ask for exemptions for specific groups because they would automatically have it. Nor would we be getting complaints from individuals whose earnings are similar to those for whom we are requesting breaks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would avoid all of that by having a realistic taxation system in our country, with a base whereby low income people would  not be harmed, and also through other exemptions like capital gains and so on, because many of the artists and writers eventually get into promoting and selling their products and really become entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, yes, we support the motion. If it is one way to help, we certainly support it, but perhaps collectively we should look for a way to help not only these people who do so much for us but also to help others who cannot do so much for themselves.</p><A NAME="Int-721379"></A><a HREF="#Int-721397"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-721347"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP): </b>Madam Speaker, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise in the House today to speak in support of Motion No. 293 put forth  by my colleague, the member from Dartmouth.

<p>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should celebrate and encourage Canada's magnificent and diverse culture by changing the Income Tax Act to exempt creative and interpretive artists from paying income tax on a percentage of income derived from copyright, neighbouring rights, and/or other income derived from the sale of any creative work.</small></td>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very proud to represent a community, the riding of Vancouver East, that is home to many artists. Many people have written me or e-mailed me about this motion, and people I have met in the community have spoken to me about it. They have tremendous support for the work the member from Dartmouth has done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do want to say that the member, who is our culture critic in the NDP, has been a very outstanding advocate for arts and artists in this country. She works in a very quiet but very powerful way in persuading people about what needs to be done. I want to thank her for her dedication in continuing to bring forward issues that affect artists, but they are also issues in a broader public policy sense in our country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this motion today is a reflection of the kind of work she undertakes to start moving the wheels of government toward recognizing some simple things that could be done to support artists right across the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is a huge issue about lack of federal funding for the arts. We do know that every year the Canada Council for the Arts has to turn down over 75% of the applications for individual support. In fact, artists can only apply twice every four years, so we know there are big issues around lack of federal funding. In Vancouver, which generally is a city that represents a very strong arts community, there have been numerous reports through the Greater Vancouver Regional District and through the City of Vancouver that have actually exposed the lack of support  given to B.C. and to Vancouver for artistic endeavours compared to other provinces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We certainly have our share of issues and complaints about the lack of federal funding for arts and culture. I put that forward as a context that there is a larger issue we are dealing with here, and that is the cutbacks by the federal government in its support for arts and culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the motion before us today is an opportunity to do something that will provide very tangible and real support to individual artists. It would mean that hopefully they could still access all the other programs that are available, but by saying that we would be willing to consider a part of their income tax exempt it would be a very important initiative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of organizations in my riding like the Vancouver East Cultural Centre or the Video Inn or Headlines Theatre, or a very popular event that takes place in the fall called the East Side Culture Crawl, where members of the public in the thousands visit various studios in east Vancouver, talk with artists, look at their work and have a dialogue. It is an amazing event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of places like Gallery Gachet or the Western Front, which is a very well known artist-run co-operative, one of the oldest in the country. I think of these venues and places in my own community where artists are able to come together to perform, to speak, to paint and to display their artistic endeavours, and where the community can also learn, understand and participate. It is something that we in east Vancouver find very empowering. It is a very important part of our community. It is very much a part of the fabric of east Vancouver. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the City of Vancouver zoned particular areas to encourage what we call artists' live/work studios, because of course one of the issues is that artists never can find affordable housing, particularly if they are doing studio work where they use industrial chemicals and paints. They need a place where they can live and work, so the City of Vancouver changed its bylaws to allow that to happen.</p><A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very proud that in east Vancouver we have this incredible vitality of artistic creation and endeavour. What always amazes me is that there is a very common misconception that the government is subsidizing the arts. I  think it is the other way around.  I think  that artists are subsidizing us. If anyone ever sat down and did a proper financial accounting of the hours and  years of work that artists put into their creative endeavours and the actual monetary value that artists get, it would be pennies per hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of an artist that I recently met in Vancouver, Nathaniel Geary, who just premiered his new film <i>On the Corner</i> at the international film festival. It is a very powerful film about the downtown east side, about the drug issues and the sex trade. It is an incredible film. It has had wonderful reviews. It is difficult for him to  do the distribution for that film even though it has been critically acclaimed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the opening night when he spoke to the audience, who gave him an ovation for his work, he told us that it had taken him three years to write the script and then another year or two to actually do the filming, so there are four or five years of work. He did get some funding support but if he ever sat down and counted up what he put in, in a monetary sense,  it would literally be pennies per hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is just one example. There are tens of thousands of artists in this country who work as a labour of love on creative expression, on  artistic output. Artists are not asking for a lot, which in some ways is a sad thing. They are not asking for very much. The arts community is asking that they be acknowledged for the value of their work. There is  a monetary value. There is a value in terms of our society and what it represents in terms of our history and our culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member from the Tories  mentioned earlier, and I agree with him,  artistic expression can communicate in a much more powerful way the  ideas, concepts and  issues and the passion that people have about different things than we can by standing in the House and making a speech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion before us today is  about the  principle that the value of the work produced by artists individually and collectively as a community is something  we should recognize, and we should recognize it at different levels. One way to recognize the value of their work is to ensure that there is some mechanism within the income tax regime so that  they can deduct some of their income from copyright and from their creative work, so that they have some benefit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concept is  not new. It has been done in other places. The example  most commonly used is Ireland, where artists are allowed to use a 100% deduction. That is not being suggested here. We are only talking about a partial deduction or a percentage of income derived from copyright, neighbouring rights or other income. We are not talking about 100%. There is a well established process that has already worked in other jurisdictions, so it is very feasible and realistic that it should be done here in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received quite a lot of e-mail on this issue from artists in my own riding. Kevin wrote to me and said:</p>

That is one reason I am taking this opportunity to make a few remarks about the motion tabled by the hon. member for Dartmouth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to maintain its mandate as the representative of the Canadian people, the government must, among other things, consider the diverse culture that is so unique to our country.  It is an important characteristic of Canadian society and it should not be otherwise.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with this in mind that the Government of Canada is trying through a variety of means to stimulate the industry that reflects the character of our nation.  For this reason, the initiative from the hon. member is certainly of some interest. Nevertheless, as my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance has said before, there are many government agencies, institutions, programs and policies that are focused in whole or in part on this goal without creating or promoting unfairness in the collection of taxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was mentioned earlier, the motion proposes to reduce the tax rate applicable to income earned by literary artists.  While I do not deny that this would be a financial benefit to people working in this sector, it would be difficult to justify this type of approach to other taxpayers. Among other things, I do not see how we could explain applying such treatment to one group of Canadians while refusing it to another.  Moreover, there is no indication that all writers actually need this type of benefit. While it might be beneficial to low income writers, we would be hard pressed to explain why such an exemption should not be applied to high income earners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not hard to understand that the government would indeed be swamped by an avalanche of demands from various groups of Canadians, and understandably so.  Given the limits and priorities of our system, we would inevitably have to deny most, or perhaps all, of those requests. How then would we explain one refusal to one profession after giving special treatment to another without any particular reason?  No sufficiently valid justification can be offered in this regard, and I do not see how we could find a satisfying response to this question. Needless to say, in a society like ours which promotes social and economic justice for all, this type of practice would be unacceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequences of amending the tax system should not be taken lightly.  That is why using the tax system as suggested would not be an appropriate way to help a single sector of society, considering all of the undesirable repercussions that would flow from the decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in several respects, the motion does not have enough detail to justify straying from our usual practice.  For example, there is no indication of the amount of the reduction in the tax rate that would apply, nor are definitions suggested as to who would be considered “creative and interpretive artists” and what would constitute “creative work”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, we must not forget that there already exist various programs and incentives that stimulate the creation of Canadian cultural product.  There is a tax credit for the labour cost of creating a Canadian film and video production, including the cost to hire screenwriters.  There is the possibility for an artist to immediately deduct the cost of a work of art that the artist has created and is holding for sale, rather than waiting until it is sold.  There is the availability of a business deduction for the cost of Canadian artwork. The non-taxation of capital gains earned on cultural property given to museums is another incentive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added to all of those incentives is direct and indirect assistance provided by the government to a variety of sectors to support creative work.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to summarize by mentioning that there are, for example, support programs for certain cultural products and a host of grants, awards or bursaries of all sorts.  Direct expenditure programs allow the government to address more directly the  various specific needs within the artistic field than can be achieved through the tax system.  In this way, the assistance offered by government is more easily justified to other Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also point out as a further reminder that the 2003 budget continues the implementation of the government's five year plan to reduce taxes for all Canadians.  Unquestionably, this plan better meets the government's current objectives. These reductions apply to all taxpayers, but especially to middle and low income families with children. Of course, the reductions apply equally to families in the artistic community as they do to other taxpayers.</p><A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1330)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I respect the hon. member for her support of Canada's creative literary artists, I must emphasize that the motion before us today is not the most effective way of achieving this objective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given what I said earlier, and notwithstanding the fact that the motion tabled is certainly based on honourable intentions, I must ask that the motion not receive the support of the House at this time.</p><A NAME="Int-721392"></A><a HREF="#Int-721394"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-721386"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Wendy Lill: </b>Madam Speaker, I am delighted to have been able to turn the attention of the House to the issue of the artists in the country.  It has been a privilege.  We heard some interesting things in the course of the debate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that we heard from all sides that there is a sincere concern about the continuance of real support for people in the arts.  My motion is quite symbolic.  It  simply says let us now look at the economic state that people in the arts face in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the comments by my colleague from the Bloc who in  fact is an artist herself.  She is an eloquent spokesperson for persons with disabilities and also for culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also appreciate the comments that have been made about the need to really examine our tax system to see who it is in fact it represents and examine the idea that people who are making under $15,000 are there.  We have to make sure that we are not taxing the wrong people.  All of these things are excellent ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Conference of  the Arts has put forward some strong suggestions on how we can support people in the arts.  One of the them is tax breaks for copyright income.  Another one is an income averaging system. The  third one is really careful fine tuning of the employment insurance system which  would allow artists to be part of that and get some security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point has been made that the artist is no different from the mechanic or many other people in the country who work and are critical to the existence of the country.  The point was made that an artist can in fact work at something for years on end and not find any financial benefit until three or four years down the line.  It is very different.  It is not a wage situation. They do    not get a paycheque at the end of  every  two weeks and that makes a big difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything has been said today. I  have received some wonderful comments from artists from across the country. I want to take the last few minutes to put  a couple of things on the record.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked us to  imagine how different the world would be if we did not have our singers, painters, writers and sculptors serving as our eyes.  She went on to say, “Frankly, I think we would enjoy a more saner, more compassionate society, one that keeps a better eye on the details that can make or break a culture”.</p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1335)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an opportunity  today to support the arts in many ways. We can support them by putting more money into the Canada film fund, into the CBC;  by funding our Canada council better;  and by putting some special mechanisms into the unemployment insurance system that  would take into account the needs of people working in the arts.  We could do this   through   some kind of tax relief for copyright income for artists, and  with things like income averaging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have to do is say that it is art that legislates the heart of a nation.  That is where we have to begin and that is where we will end.</p><A NAME="Int-721394"></A><a HREF="#Int-721392"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos): </b>Is the House ready for the question?</p>
