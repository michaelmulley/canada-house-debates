</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the second group of petitions which I would like to 
present also comes from Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners support the retention of section 43 of the 
Criminal Code, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every schoolteacher, parent or person standing in the place of a 
parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a 
pupil or child, who is under his care, if the force does not

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners believe that the removal of section 43 would 
strengthen the role of bureaucrats, while weakening the role of 
parents in determining what is in the best interest of the child. 
They feel that this would be a major, unjustified intrusion of 
the state into the realm of parental rights and responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners request Parliament to affirm the duty of parents 
to responsibly raise their children according to their own

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from December 10 consideration of the 
motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to take part in this very important debate today, prior to the 
presentation of the federal budget.  The purpose is to see how we 
can promote and bring about the dreams, aspirations and objectives 
of Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is really what a prebudget debate is.  It is an 
opportunity to talk about how we should order our priorities as 
Canadians and how we should order our priorities for Canada's 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the final analysis a budget is about what the real priorities 
of the government are; not the soothing assurances, not the empty 
rhetoric and not the promises which have no substance.  It is 
about where the government will put its money, where it will 
allocate its resources and, therefore, what its real priorities 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it very clear at the outset, on behalf of my 
colleagues in the New Democratic Party, that it is our absolute 
belief that the top economic priority for the 1998 budget is to 
set targets to reduce unemployment by at least 1%.  At an 
absolute minimum unemployment should be reduced by 1%.  We must 
develop specific strategies to attain that objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to get your answers right when you keep focusing on 
the wrong problem.  That is exactly what this government has done 
over the last four years.  It has focused on the wrong problem. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1030
<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is focused exclusively on inflation, failing to set targets 
for jobs.  In the process the government is simply writing off 
literally hundreds of thousands of jobs, writing off an 
additional 500,000 jobs that are desperately needed by Canadians. 
Over a five year period an additional 100,000 jobs a year could 
push our unemployment rate to 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there will be some naysayers who will say  “We couldn't 
possibly bring the unemployment level in Canada to 5%.  Who has 
an unemployment level among industrial countries of 5%?”  Let's 
remind ourselves, in the process of trying to stiffen our resolve 
to tackle this problem, that the United States of America has an 
unemployment level today below 5%.  I think it is 4.7% at the 
current time.  The United Kingdom has an unemployment level below 
5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to ask itself and all Canadians are asking 
themselves the following question.  How is it less of a priority 
for the Government of Canada and for the people of Canada to 
reduce the unemployment level to 5% than it is for the people of 
the United States or the people of the United Kingdom? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the number one priority for Canadians and it remains the 
number one priority for Canadians.  It is a priority that is 
absolutely attainable if the government would finally recognize 
it and take up the challenge.  Unfortunately, instead of a 
commitment to generate jobs and reduce unemployment, the Liberal 
policy has been designed to ensure that jobless rates do not sink 
too far, a perversity, surely, when we look at the numbers of 
people who are suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest threat to the future is the likelihood the 
government will refuse to allow growth to continue and instead 
will choke off any real recovery in its infancy by jacking up 
interest rates yet again by strangling the process of economic 
growth that is finally beginning to glimmer on the horizon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that when the Minister of Finance really means 
business, when he makes up his mind about something, when he 
accepts that something is indeed a priority, he sets targets and 
timetables for achieving them.  That is exactly what we have seen 
the Minister of Finance do with the deficit over the last four 
years.  It is what he does with inflation.  He makes it clear 
that he is serious and he sets timetables and targets.  It is 
what he proposes now to do with the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that targets mean commitment and timetables mean 
results.  Over the last four years the Liberal government has 
been absolutely single minded in its approach to deficit 
reduction:  massive program cuts, the largest layoffs in Canadian 
history, the sell-off of some of the nation's most valuable 
assets,  and the elimination of many of the programs that provide 
support to Canadians in need, in fact many of the programs that 
define our very sense of being Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's persistent lying throughout has been:  “There 
is really no alternative”.  It has come to be understood as the 
TINA syndrome:  there is no alternative.   The tragic irony is 
that there was and still is an alternative which would have 
allowed the government to reach its original target for deficit 
reduction without the painful disastrous cuts that were the 
supposed centrepiece of this strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Testimony before the finance committee indicated that 60% of the 
improvement in government finances between 1995 and 1997 came 
from a growing economy stimulated by low interest rates.  Dr. Jim 
Stanford's analysis presented before the finance committee showed 
that if the government had merely frozen spending at its 1995 
levels, allowed economic growth and maintained lower interest 
rates, the Minister of Finance could have beaten his very own 
deficit reduction timetable.  He could have met his targets and 
still have reduced Canada's deficit to the lowest level among G-7 
countries.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study also demonstrates that pursuing a sustained 4% growth 
strategy simply by maintaining interest rates at the early 1997 
level would add an additional $70 billion to federal balance 
sheets over the next five years to be spent on the important 
programs that Canadians depend upon, that our seniors deserve, 
that our children desperately need and that our young people 
require to enter the new millennium with some sense of hope and 
promise.  In addition it would mean sufficient resources to allow 
for reasonable tax cuts targeted to where they would matter most 
and get on with debt repayment at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, if real growth is stalled by the central 
bank's obsessively low inflation policy, the fiscal dividend may 
disappear altogether.  That would be a tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need to consider this question.  Are we willing to 
spend $70 billion over the next five years to keep inflation at a 
zero level, to keep wringing jobs out of the economy, to keep 
eliminating important social programs, in order to battle an 
imaginary mythical phantom of high inflation?  Or, do we have 
other priorities like fighting unemployment, rebuilding our 
health care system, and ensuring our young people access to 
education and decent jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have been positioning themselves as a party of 
balance on economic issues.  The title of the finance committee's 
report “Keeping the Balance” is another attempt to embellish 
that image.  The point is that it bears no relationship or 
resemblance to what the Liberal government has actually being 
doing.  The reality is that Canada has eliminated its fiscal 
deficit by creating a massive social deficit for which Canadians 
will be paying for a very long time to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's real wealth is declining as we supposedly grow richer. 
The stock market is soaring.  The GDP is climbing.  However 
somehow there is not enough money to pull our kids out of 
poverty, to give young people the education they need to get 
decent jobs, to pay working men and women a living wage, or to 
maintain one of the best health care systems in the world in 
which Canadians have invested and which has become the envy of 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the government it has been an official policy of forget 
about jobs, toss in the towel on jobs.  We are told repeatedly 
that governments cannot create jobs and why should they really 
try.  The essence of the Liberal solution is to make its problem 
someone else's problem by downloading debt and offloading 
responsibility to the provinces, municipalities, ordinary people, 
the charitable sector, the non-governmental sector and, most 
callously and most unforgivably, the backs of the poor.  As a 
result the federal books may be in balance but the economy is 
very much out of kilter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The headline in the local newspaper in my riding said it all the 
day that the finance minister appeared on the west coast before 
the finance committee.  The headline read “Federal books doing 
well but the question is are Canadians doing well?”  For far too 
many Canadians the answer to that question is no, they are not 
doing well at all.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internationally we may be the first to balance the budget. This 
is something the federal finance minister constantly crows about, 
constantly congratulates himself about.  While citizens in other 
industrialized nations saw their GDP per capita grow at an 
average rate of 9.1%, Canada alone saw its standard of living 
decline.  That is not something about which the government should 
be congratulating itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result we now have the second highest incidence of child 
poverty among major industrialize countries, the second highest 
inequality index and the second highest incident of low pay for 
full time workers in the industrialized world.  The finance 
minister may claim that Canada is leading the G-7 and is on the 
verge of a new economic era, but social and economic indicators 
reveal that Canada is marching backward into the millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1989 average family incomes have fallen by roughly 5%. In 
this country 538,000 more children are living in poverty.  The 
number of food banks has tripled as the proportion of the 
population forced to rely on food banks has more than doubled. 
The number of Canadians filing for personal bankruptcy has gone 
through the roof.  This does not point to a balanced economy or 
to a leading edge economy but to an economy that is running in 
reverse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real test of a balanced economy surely is not whether the 
government can balance its books at the expense of its citizens 
but rather whether it can provide the economic environment in 
which Canadians and families can balance their own books.  We 
have been losing ground in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A stronger economy is key to the long term health of federal 
balance sheets.  Our approach would be to build a high 
employment, growing economy which could generate a significant 
fiscal dividend and could provide an ongoing revenue stream to 
address the growing social deficit.  Social investment that 
creates jobs and addresses the needs of children, youth and 
families must surely come first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be very clear about what the NDP priorities are for the 
coming year.  We will be pushing for those priorities to be 
expressed in the forthcoming federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is to make full employment the primary goal of 
government with targets to cut rates by a minimum of 1% per year. 
The Bank of Canada should be instructed that employment growth is 
the central priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is to set targets for the elimination of child 
poverty and a timetable for implementation of that commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989 the country set for itself a millennium project.  The 
House of Commons resolved unanimously an all-party resolution to 
ensure that we eliminated child poverty by the year 2000.  Before 
we go looking for a lot of new millennium projects, let us follow 
through on the commitment adopted by the House, by all members on 
all sides of the House in 1989, and make the real millennium 
project the elimination of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What could have a greater long lasting benefit?  What could be 
more enduring?  What could more captivate the people of a nation 
than pulling together and working together to eliminate poverty 
so that we make a real investment in the future of all Canadians 
and the future of the nation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third priority we will be insisting upon is to make 
strategic investments to rebuild our failing public 
infrastructure. 
Our health care system, education and training systems and 
networks, environmental and cultural industries, social housing, 
child care and elder care, highway and other important 
transportation links that make this a real nation.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth is to maintain a balanced budget over the next five years 
aiming for continuing GDP growth of 4% per year and some easing 
of the inflation target band. When this country continues to be 
totally obsessed with inflation, it absolutely fails to recognize 
that countries, including the United States to our south and the 
U.K., have recognized that yes inflation is a problem and yes 
inflation has to be kept in check, but they have understood that 
we have to be prepared to make jobs and economic growth our real 
priorities. That requires easing up a little bit on the inflation 
target band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have allowed inflation to go up in the 3% range.  As long 
as Canada continues to insist on wringing inflation absolutely 
out of the economy, reducing it to the 1% range, then we are 
going to continue to choke off those 500,000 jobs that we 
desperately need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, our priority is going to be maintaining overall tax 
levels in the short term but rebalancing the system to achieve 
greater fairness and to advance broader social policy goals such 
as the elimination of poverty, a fairer share of the tax burden 
and assistance for students and the disabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wrapping up, my final priority that I want to advance as we head 
into this budgetary process is direct tax relief measures to the 
neediest through refundable tax credits such as the GST and 
exempting essentials from the federal sales tax rather than 
enriching subsidies for those earning over $75,000 a year.  If 
circumstances permit, we want to reduce the overall GST rate by 
two points to promote job creation and give hard pressed 
consumers a break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the measures that NDP members will be advancing. 
Already to date in this fall parliamentary session, if the 
proposals the NDP had been putting forward, the concrete and 
specific proposals for job creation, had been implemented by this 
government, we would have created over 175,000 jobs.  This would 
have reduced unemployment to 7.9%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look forward to participating in the continuing debate in the 
run up to the budget.  Most importantly, we look forward to 
seeing this government finally get its priorities right and 
invest in a real future for Canada.

listened with great interest to my colleague from the NDP while 
she was speaking about having a full employment strategy. The 
first thing that came to my mind is that government in general 
does not really create jobs.  It in itself does not go out and 
hire everyone to work on the government payrolls. 
However the government creates a proper environment for job 
creation because the real engine of job creation is the private 
sector.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly my head somehow was boiling and spinning at the same 
time.  The member wants the government to stop fighting the 
mythical phantom of high inflation and to stop being obsessed 
with inflation.  She thought that the government should have a 
full employment policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suppose that inflation went above 3% or 4% and there was a 
downturn in the economy in two or three years and we begin to 
have the same problems we had in the 1980s of a high deficit, 
high debt loads, high inflation and high interest rates, is the 
member proposing that the government should hire all those people 
and put them on the public payroll? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to say to my colleague that it is extremely 
important to put things into perspective.  All of the economic 
indicators she is talking about are fair game.  However, there 
are certain indicators that I as a member of Parliament totally 
disagree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, here in Canada we had a deficit.  I want to 
congratulate the government for winning the war on the deficit. 
We used criteria that are very much different from the criteria 
being used by OECD members around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about assets in Canada and somebody from the 
auditor general's office says that we have $50 billion in assets, 
in my view, Canadian assets are really in excess of $150 billion 
taking into consideration crown corporations and everything else 
the government owns in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to put things into perspective when we talk about 
shrinking wealth and economic indicators when comparing them with 
other countries around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the private sector does not really create the jobs she is 
asking for and the private sector is not meeting the target she 
is setting, is the member proposing that the government hire all 
those people who were not hired by the private sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to say in all 
honesty, and I intend no disrespect to the member opposite, but 
that is an absurd suggestion and a distortion of the position the 
New Democratic Party has put forward today in specific, concrete 
terms.  It makes it impossible to even engage in a reasonable, 
sensible debate about fiscal policy, inflation, interest rates 
and setting targets and timetables for jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need a lecture from the member opposite on how 
important the private sector is in the creation of jobs. I will 
be going back to my office to meet with representatives from the 
chamber of commerce.  They have come to Ottawa today because they 
understand what an important partnership there must be between 
government and the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those representatives from the chamber of commerce want to talk 
to me and my colleagues from Nova Scotia about the completely 
irresponsible withdrawal of the federal government from providing 
and ensuring that the kind of infrastructure is in place which 
would allow the private sector to do its job to generate jobs and 
grow the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector is understandably concerned about the fact 
that the Government of Canada has gone pell-mell into the 
privatization of our ports without understanding that there must 
be a commitment from the government in the investment of the 
ports and make sure the infrastructure is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very concerned that the government will not make a 
commitment to ensure that our Halifax regional airport which 
serves as an international airport and is a very important part 
of our infrastucture, is in good shape. The government has been 
pulling back from its investment with the result that the entire 
business community in Nova Scotia is very concerned that our 
Halifax international airport is not getting the kind of support 
from government that it needs, deserves and absolutely requires 
if the private sector is going to be able to do its part to 
contribute to the generation of jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the question, if it was the view of the 
government that the federal government cannot do anything about 
jobs, then why in the name of heaven did the Liberal Party of 
Canada not tell the Canadian people the truth?  It told Canadians 
that it intended to make jobs the number one priority, but that 
is not what the government did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is such a ridiculous question. That is exactly what engenders 
disrespect for government, engenders disrespect for Parliament. 
It is just a completely absurd notion. The member knows that when 
he stands on his feet and says, “Would you let inflation go up 
3% or 4%”, he clearly was not listening when I said that 
allowing inflation to rise to 3% does not seem to be such a 
disastrous policy when that is what the United States has done 
and unemployment is below 5%.  That is what the U.K. has done and 
their unemployment is 5%. Canadians deserve no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very good illustration of why this government will not 
put its money where its mouth is and actually commit itself to 
making jobs the number one priority, and it went to the Canadian 
people instead in 1993 and again in 1997.

subject matter on which all hon. members share her concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view child poverty is a political term which is intended

recognize that 42% of all children living in poverty come from

Would the member care to comment on her party's position with 
regard to issues of strengthening the family outside of economic 
considerations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what the issue of 
poverty is all about is the failure of government to put in place 
policies that will strengthen the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing weakens a family more, whether there is one child or 
five children, whether there is one parent or two parents, than 
having a parent who simply cannot put food on the table, who 
cannot ensure that their kids get the best possible start in 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To repeat, I think that should be our millennium project.  It is 
the project that would matter the most to the future of this 
nation, to make sure that our kids do get a start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It requires a comprehensive, co-ordinated strategy, an all out 
assault on the problem of poverty which has many faces.  I 
completely agree and I commend the member for making the point 
that the issue is poverty, period.  It is not child poverty as if 
it is completely separate and apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear about where this decision came from, the one to 
somehow segment off child poverty as if it is not part of the 
failed economic system.  That essentially has been this 
government's decision, to not face up to the fact that at the 
root of poverty are the kind of economic policies that have been 
pursued for a decade and a half by right wing governments, both 
federal and provincial.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an honour 
to speak on this very important topic.  Over the next two or 
three months there will be much debate.  The directions we take 
will likely be debated frequently over the next couple of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results of the finance committee hearings show this Titanic 
government has decided to chart a course that steers every 
Canadian right into the iceberg.  The short sighting of the tip 
of the iceberg that resembles the deficit completely misses the 
massive danger of the submerged problem of the debt that is just 
waiting to sink the economy.  As history sometimes ends up 
repeating itself, everyone will go down with the sinking ship. 
What is worse is that shuffling the chairs on the deck will not 
buy Canadians any more time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government does not understand that high taxes kill jobs. 
This government does not understand that “high taxes equal high 
revenue” is just recycled money that is borrowed and is not new. 
This government does not understand that everyone knows the 
bloated employment insurance premium is a tax on the backs of the 
working class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government does not understand that we are losing the 
battle with the U.S. regarding the brain drain.  This government 
does not understand that Canada should not only end 
interprovincial trade barriers but that the Canada-U.S. economy 
is actually one big market made up of 330 million people. This 
government does not understand that Canada must be a global 
leader as we enter the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government does not understand that small business drives 
the economy and still faces unbearable payroll taxes and extreme 
bankruptcy statistics.  This government does not understand the 
impact that part of the consultation process means actually 
listening to Canadians and rightfully respecting their interests 
and their recommendations. The captain of this government does 
not show any desire to scope the dangers of this massive debt, 
the ticking time bomb of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather, the finance minister is too involved scoping the Prime 
Minister's job.  Let us face it, working families have been 
crippled with the burden of creating such a so-called fiscal 
dividend.  They have been taxed, taxed and overtaxed.  In the 
event of the upcoming surplus, this government should feel 
obligated to return what is rightfully theirs.  This means 
cutting taxes.  All Canadians have paid long enough for the 
misconduct of the EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are no longer prepared to sit back and let this 
government set strategies without seriously implementing the 
suggestions provided during consultation. Canadians shared their 
frustrations and proposed solutions.  This government did not 
listen.  Why did we travel across Canada and hear from over 400 
witnesses if we are not going to put their ideas to work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestion is clear.  This government is not serious about 
creating the environment to reduce employment.  It is not serious 
about cutting taxes.  It is not serious about facilitating 
growth.  This government did not listen.  The report from the 
finance committee does not represent Canada's interests. It is 
merely a supporting document of the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are being held hostage by Liberal Party politics.  The 
deathwatch on the Prime Minister has begun and the captain is the 
Minister of Finance.  He is not willing to give anything of 
substance to Canadians until he is running for or is Prime 
Minister.  It is a sad but true fact.  One only has to look at 
his own cabinet colleagues to know this is what is happening. In 
the meantime working Canadians get poorer, unemployment remains a 
national tragedy and Canadians become less competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Jeff Rubin's 1997 Monthly Indicator named the “The Federal 
Fiscal Dividend:  Who gets to spend it?”, Mr. Rubin discussed 
how personal income taxes as a share of GDP rank Canada the 
highest among the G-7 countries.  Not only is Canada's personal 
income tax rate not internationally competitive but it has now 
saddled households with the largest tax burden in Canadian 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even a $13 billion personal income tax cut over the next four 
years would leave the income tax to GDP ratio well above its 1989 
level.  After some seven years of declining after tax real income 
per capita in Canada, a personal tax decrease could at least 
begin the process of restoring domestic purchasing power in the 
economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Independent Business told us that 
“One very important priority which is the cornerstone to 
building a better life for Canadians is meaningful job 
creation”.  The CFIB said it and we have said it too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Priorities should be placed on debt and tax reduction, not on 
new program spending.  A recent survey revealed that 85% of small 
business favours restrained spending.  The plan to allocate 50% 
of the so-called fiscal dividend to new spending and the other 
50% to debt and tax reduction is wrong.  It is the wrong blend. 
This mix will only create fiscal problems in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small business has called for the emphasis to be on strategies 
that lead to private sector job creation which will provide a 
solid foundation for the future of the Canadian economy, debt 
reduction, which will decrease the servicing costs of the debt, 
and reduced taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support these initiatives for the good of Canadian small 
business.  No longer can we let the government make the wrong 
decisions for Canadians.  Who suffers?  Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a government collecting higher employment insurance 
premiums than necessary to fund the account for a rainy day.  We 
know, of course, that the EI surplus is being used as a deficit 
reduction tax.  Seventy-four per cent of small businesses polled 
said that the EI fund should be managed separately.  The CP fund 
was privatized; why not the EI fund too? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small business and the PC Party believe that a top priority is 
to substantially lower EI premiums for 1998.  That will make a 
difference in the pockets of Canadians.  Canadians have 
over-contributed in good faith to this fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for this to stop.  Working Canadians deserve to have 
their hard earned money back.  The CFIB calls for a refund to 
Canadians and so do we.  The increase set for 1998 of 66¢ per 
$100 in CPP premiums must be offset by at least this amount, if 
not more, in EI premiums.  This is an achievable objective. After 
all, the EI fund has a surplus of close to $12 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are rightfully upset about taxes, whether they are 
caused by too much government debt or spending.  It is time 
Canadians had a say in their economic future.  We are going to 
fight to give Canadians that freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly one of the greatest problems facing this country is the 
high level of unemployment.  Is there really any doubt that high 
taxation in this country is the number one cause of this horrific 
problem?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, as we know, the province with the lowest tax rate, 
Alberta, has the lowest unemployment rate.  Clearly the Alberta 
government has committed to a strategy and stuck to it.  Why can 
the federal government not do this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. unemployment rate is the lowest it has been for 50 
years.  This is not luck.  It is the result of lower taxes, which 
means more money in the hands of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe the debate on what to do with any surplus has focused 
too much on the traditional idea of “What should government do 
now?”  This is an unacceptable starting point.  Yet again we 
witness a responsive, knee-jerk reaction to a critical upcoming 
opportunity.  What this government should be focusing on is the 
question of “What can Canadians do now?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, it is income taken from working families which has 
led to the fiscal dividend.  Canadians have caught on.  No longer 
will we stand by and let unfairness happen.  We demand that the 
government act responsibly with our money.  Let us make the 
decisions on how to spend our money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The projected fiscal dividend is an opportunity for government 
to redefine itself, its size and its role to the Canadian people. 
Canadians have earned the right to spend their own money.  They 
have endured long enough.  They have sacrificed to help eliminate 
the deficit.  They have earned the right to spend their own 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any tax increase is wrong.  Taxes must be cut.  Again and again 
we hear the cry from working families and small businesses. 
Recent increases in CPP premiums were not offset by substantial 
reductions in other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario, our provincial government has kept its promise. 
Personal income taxes have been cut and government revenues have 
grown substantially.  In the last eight months Ontario has 
created 216,000 jobs in the private sector, which is roughly 70% 
of all the jobs which have been created in the country.  Clearly 
there is a lesson to be learned here:  high taxes cost jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government cut the CHST payments to the provinces by 
$6.8 billion in the mid-nineties.  The message we have heard from 
provincial finance ministers and the public is clear.  Extra 
dollars must be transferred back to the provinces so they can 
restore health, education and social programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The suffering has gone on long enough.  These transfer cuts 
meant hospital lineups in the emergency rooms, hospital closings, 
lack of resources in schools, inadequate home care for the 
elderly and the mentally ill face closed community homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are losing our future to the United States.  Every day 
Canadian talent is drained to our southern neighbours, all 
because of high taxation levels and a lack of employment 
prospects in Canada.  We are not willing to sit idle on this.  In 
Canada we face a chronic unemployment problem at 9% unemployment 
compared to 4.5% in the U.S.  This is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that taxes are also lower in the U.S.  Employment 
opportunities in the U.S. are attracting our people south because 
of the jobs that they are creating.  That is what it is all 
about.  Canadians want to work.  Young people want to put their 
skills and education to use.  If this government does not 
facilitate the setting for job creation now, our talents will 
continue to turn elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just how do we expect to be competitive with the U.S. when our 
tax rates are so much higher?  Think about it.  In the U.S. if 
you make over $250,000, the tax rate is 36%.  In Canada, if you 
only make $55,000 to $60,000 or over that, you are quickly at the 
top level of 54%.  It does not take a rocket scientist to see 
where you would get the most money for your salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a real problem with this government overtaxing Canadians 
for the purpose of claiming a so-called fiscal dividend.  I think 
it is important to note that the fiscal dividend is by no means a 
forgone conclusion.  If we did not have the $7 billion surplus in 
the employment insurance fund, the arrival of the dividend would 
be much later claimed by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let's get one thing straight.  The Minister has factored the EI 
surplus into the fiscal dividend, a purpose for which EI 
contributions were never intended.  In my opinion, this is 
totally unethical.  We urgently need an amendment to the 
Employment Insurance Act to outlaw this kind of misuse of the EI 
surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just recently this government took $2.5 billion from the 
employee pension fund to service the deficit.  This practice must 
stop.  We must stop the government from continuing to treat this 
fund as a cash cow.  Recently we privatized the CPP fund.  Why 
not consider creating a separate fund for employee pension fund 
moneys? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know Canadians want to reduce the debt, yet this government 
is planning to spend without a clear agenda.  A return to 
uncontrolled spending is another fundamental problem and counter 
to Canadian culture.  The failure to deliver on fiscal reductions 
promised in the past is becoming a recurring theme of this 
government. The spending reductions that the government promised 
in 1995 for the current fiscal year missed the target by roughly 
43%, or $5 billion.  The government's much vaunted program review 
exercise lost its effectiveness.  It seems to have not followed 
through with this plan and lost sight of the long term gains this 
initiative holds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are risks that can derail this government from achieving a 
surplus.  They include uncontrolled government spending, failure 
to deliver on fiscal reduction promises in the past and the 
dependence of recovering on low interest rates and a low dollar. 
These are the items that demand immediate attention. Ignorance of 
these issues will only set our economy back further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this upcoming surplus, we have an immediate need 
for a balanced budget legislation.  Committing to balanced budget 
legislation not only proves to Canadians that this government is 
serious about its role, but fosters growth in investment for the 
future.  Clear and defined debt reduction targets and debt 
reduction legislation must be put in place. This would prove that 
this government is serious about its commitments to reduce the 
size of the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's 50-50 formula is so loose it is almost 
meaningless, especially if it starts spending it and never has a 
dividend to split 50-50. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government must stop acting paternalistically.  Canadians 
have earned the right to choose.  The Progressive Conservative 
Party comes at this debate differently.  Our view is simple and 
effective.  Lower taxes means lower government spending.  Lower 
government spending means greater freedom for people to solve 
problems in the manner they see fit.  This means working families 
are taking responsibility for their spending, their savings, 
their investments in the future.  Informed, autonomous, 
independent Canadians foster a responsible society.  We know what 
we would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has to create an environment so that jobs can be 
created for Canadians, lower their personal taxes and allow our 
talent to be competitive with the U.S.  The government has 
refused to establish clear and measurable targets for debt 
reduction and debt-to-GDP ratio.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a weak kneed and short sighted response that ignores the 
calls the committee heard for urgent action on the debt.  It also 
flies directly in the face of public opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the Angus Reid poll found that 84% of Canadians want 
the federal government to focus on reducing the accumulated debt 
and high taxes.  We believe that one-third of the surplus should 
be devoted to debt reduction and that action to reduce the debt 
should start now.  The government must reduce our debt to GDP 
ratio to 60% by the end of this mandate and to 50% by the year 
2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxation levels in Canada remain too high.  They penalize 
initiative.  They depress investment that creates jobs.  They 
force investment elsewhere.  They encourage highly skilled 
entrepreneurial Canadians to seek their futures in more 
hospitable countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the many calls for tax cuts heard by the committee, it 
is clear the government has no intention of responding to this 
need in the near future.  We believe that tax cuts cannot wait 
until later in the government's current mandate.  The next 
federal budget must send a clear signal that one-third of the 
fiscal dividend will be used to reduce the tax burden on 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of government must change.  Before any decisions are 
made about the fiscal dividend, the federal government needs to 
answer some questions that are much more fundamental.  What 
things should the federal government not be doing any longer? 
What things should the federal government be doing completely 
differently?  What things should the federal government be doing 
that it is not doing now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The severity of these issues will not go away.  The government 
has not proven itself in its pre-budget document.  We will 
continue to push for lower taxes, balanced budget legislation and 
debt reduction targets to be included in the February budget and 
see if we can get it right then.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am absolutely astounded to hear a Conservative accuse 
the government of failing to deliver on its promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the experience, which the member did not, of sitting 
through five Conservative budgets.  They had to cut this and they 
had to cut that so they could reduce the deficit. I saw a 
Conservative government consistently increase the deficit and 
fail to deliver on a single one of the promises it made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand I have sat through four Liberal budgets.  I 
have seen them not only deliver but overdeliver on their promise 
to cut the deficit and in less than five years reach a balanced 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member talk about employment insurance premiums.  He 
may not be aware of it, but he represents a party that increased 
employment insurance premiums consistently when it was in power 
because it failed to provide for a time when unemployment would 
rise, as it did to over 11% under a Conservative government.  How 
dare he criticize a government that has consistently reduced 
employment insurance premiums and reduced the burden on both 
workers and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the member comes into the House as a representative of 
the Conservative Party, perhaps he might want to check the 
history of his own party and of his own leader on the issues 
about which he talks.  I suggest he might want to deal in his 
speech honestly with how the government has delivered on its 
commitments to Canadians on deficit reduction, on reducing EI 
premiums and on reaching a balanced budget.  It is well ahead of 
target and is putting the economy on a sound footing which it has 
not been on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about reducing taxes.  Is the member aware that when 
the party he represents was in government it was responsible for 
increasing taxes over 33 times?  One of them was the 3% surtax on 
income, which I note the finance committee is suggesting we 
should be reducing and getting rid of eventually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I recall the Liberal 
government in the 1993 election campaign promised to rip up the 
free trade agreement and to eliminate the GST. 
Two of those items are probably the fundamental reasons the 
country is doing so well.  Tax revenues increased substantially 
over the last four years.  Most of that is because growth has 
come from free trade and not from growth within the economy.

have.  That is why we are seeing the growth we are seeing now.

I listened with interest to the speech by the hon. member for

he used the analogy of the deficit being only the tip of the 
iceberg and the debt being the submerged portion that could very 
well sink the country in the event of an economic downturn.  He 
also said that it was incumbent upon government to address the 
very important issue presented by the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the member justify what he says when the Conservative

debt $300 billion in that time period, which constitutes half the 
total national debt that we face? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was not part of what 
happened then.  There were certain circumstances going on, not 
only in the country but around the world at that point in time. 
The culture quite frankly was not there.  We were not the only 
government in the world that was spending more than it took in. 
It was characteristic of a lot of the governments around the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow some type of cultural shock happened in the late 
eighties or early nineties when people and governments started to 
wake up and say “We cannot continually spend more money than we 
have taken in”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the things that happened in the 1984 to 1993 timeframe 
set the pins in place to get the fiscal dividends or rewards we 
are getting today.  I remember the opposition at the time, which 
is now the government, was totally opposed to free trade, 
figuring that it would destroy Canada.  It has been the greatest 
bonanza or dividend the country has ever received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our future will be in free trade.  Whatever happened in the past 
will never happen again.  We have to put in place balanced budget

by two.  We inherited high interest rates and the debt.  We also 
inherited budgets that were being constructed that were not even 
covering the programs.

covered their programs and started eating into the debt or the

other things to create growth in the economy such as the free 
trade agreement and the GST.  They removed the manufacturers 
sales tax and brought in the GST, one tax that allowed us to be 
competitive from a free trade standpoint.  Goods now leaving the 
country no longer have the 14% additional tax on them and because 
of the low dollar we are seeing benefits today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Ottawa 
West—Nepean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very grateful to have the opportunity to make some 
suggestions with respect to the upcoming budget.  Before I do so, 
I would like to make a couple of comments on the speech by the 
member for Calgary Southwest, the Leader of the Opposition.  He 
made these remarks yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After he spoke another Reform member rose in the House on a 
point of order and complained that only two Liberal members on 
this side were listening to the speech of the member for Calgary 
Southwest.  I was one of those members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to spring to the defence of my colleagues.  I listened 
throughout the 40 minute speech which dealt with a single point, 
the proposal to bring forward a child care tax credit in the next 
budget.  I have to say that many of us on this side support that 
kind of initiative, most especially the member for Mississauga 
South who has championed the initiative for a very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem was that the member for Calgary Southwest in 
developing this point read at great length letters from 
constituents.  If we look in yesterday's <I>Hansard</I> we will 
see column after column, four letters actually, of closely packed 
type which was read by the Leader of the Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult—and I was a captive audience—to watch 
someone read text.  It is very difficult to maintain one's 
attention level when someone is constantly reading, is not making 
eye contact and is only developing a single point with a single 
illustration.  Perhaps the other members were justified in their 
attention wandering, but because I was part of the debate I paid 
rapt attention.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For something like a prebudget debate, our responsibility as MPs 
is to bring real suggestions to the table.  While the Leader of 
the Opposition did bring one suggestion, I would like to bring 
several suggestions in the time that I have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been very concerned over the years with charities and 
non-profit organizations.  There is a tremendous oversight by 
government of this type of organization which accounts for 
approximately $100 billion in revenues every year.  I am afraid 
that a lot of the taxpayer money which goes into these 
organizations either from government or individual donors is not 
actually reaching people in need.  I have commented at some 
length on this before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I submitted a second report to the Standing Committee 
on Finance. I suggested ways in which the government could bring 
in legislation that would address some of the problems of 
accountability and transparency in not for profit organizations 
and charities.  I will run very quickly through these 
suggestions.  If anyone wants to read them in depth, copies of 
the report are available in my office. I will make three points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that government move as soon as possible to 
define what charities are in law.  As the situation now exists, 
we rely on an Elizabethan statute of 1601 to define charities. It 
would be very helpful if we modernized the definition in law and 
consulted with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charities include this broad, sweeping collection of 
organizations that are constantly badgering the public for 
projects which sometimes have very little to do with human 
suffering, the problems of the poor and those in need. At the 
very least, legislation would be written which would narrow the 
definition of charities to those helping people in need, rather 
than organizations which may be engaged in the arts, preserving 
the environment, et cetera.  Charities should have a real human 
component and should deal with human suffering.  I would like to 
see that change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now our concept of a non-profit organization, unlike a 
charity, is simply an organization which can issue tax receipts, 
but does not pay taxes.  There are about 30,000 of these 
organizations and the tax deferral is in the many billions of 
dollars.  These organizations encompass a broad range of purposes 
and are defined as whatever charity is not, as non-profit 
organizations.  This is a tremendous problem because these 
organizations have no accountability to the community. Revenue 
Canada does not even keep track of their financial statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing I would propose is that government revisit the 
Canada Corporations Act and set rules and standards in 
legislation for non-profit organizations.  It is possible to be a 
federally incorporated non-profit organization and not have to 
produce a financial statement other than for its members. There 
could possibly be only two members of a non-profit organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Non-profit organizations do not have to send financial 
statements to Revenue Canada.  There are absolutely no checks and 
balances. The government does not oversee non-profit 
organizations, which embrace organizations such as the Canadian 
Automobile Association, the Better Business Bureau and various 
industry and manufacturer associations. This is deplorable 
because when there is no oversight by government, there is no 
oversight by ordinary people. Unfortunately this can lead to all 
kinds of problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To point out one very briefly, in the past year since my first 
report on charities was released, many people have written to me. 
One point that has been drawn to my attention is the fact that 
charities and other types of non-profit organizations do not have 
to seek tenders to buy goods and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government buys goods and services from the community 
it always tries to do it by tender or by some form of open 
bidding process.  When we download responsibilities to charitable 
or non-profit organizations and they do not have a similar 
responsibility to contract out or to seek tenders, we run a 
terrible risk that there will be abuse of the system. 
It is especially bad with non-profit organizations where there is 
actually no coherent or meaningful reporting to the public at 
large. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the second point.  Revisit the Canada Corporations Act. 
Write legislation for non-profit organizations that makes them 
transparent and accountable at least in the same measure as 
for-profit organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last change in legislation I would like to see would save a 
lot of money and bring a lot of discipline to charities and 
non-profit organizations.  That would be to change the Access to 
Information Act and the Income Tax Act so that when charities and 
non-profit organizations are audited by Revenue Canada, those 
audits are public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now when Revenue Canada audits a charity, the audits 
remain secret.  The difficulty is that an organization can be 
audited and all kinds of things that are very wrong can be found. 
That organization is slapped on the wrist and if there is no 
public disclosure, it can carry on doing exactly the same thing 
as it had been doing hitherto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the greatest disciplines for any organization whether it 
is government, quasi-government or business, is the exposure to 
the public view of mismanagement.  When an audit comes along, if 
the audit finds mismanagement and it is exposed, then all those 
other organizations will step back and think very carefully about 
their management practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a matter of auditing every organization.  It is a 
matter that every organization ought to fear a public audit.  If 
the organizations conduct themselves properly and manage their 
affairs well, they have nothing to fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a major, positive step for the government to 
consider this as an option when the finance minister examines the 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are my three suggestions.  They are very important because 
the non-profit and charitable sector accounts for about $100 
billion in revenue.  It is an enormous sector.  A lot of 
charities are doing very good work but the sad thing is that 
because there is such little government oversight and there are 
so few standards written in law, we cannot tell the good 
charities from the bad charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the majority are good charities and at this time of year 
we need to support them.  So when we talk accountability and 
transparency, indeed what we are talking about is helping those 
charities help the people who are really in need. 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member raises some very interesting concerns with 
respect to the non-profit and charitable sector and how those 
organizations are treated in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that those concerns are of such a serious nature 
and I know the member has been an outspoken advocate on this 
issue. I wonder whether the member can indicate what progress the 
government has made in the four years it has held office with 
respect to these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could I also ask the hon. member to comment on the fact that 
hundreds of thousands, in fact millions, of dollars are going 
untaxed because of the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member not be better served if, rather than going 
after charities and the concerns with respect to that sector, the 
government went after the major loopholes in the Income Tax Act 
that allow families to move billions of dollars offshore without 
paying their fair share of taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member comment on whether he believes the loopholes in 
the Income Tax Act that allow tens of thousands of profitable 
corporations to not pay any taxes at all is fair to the poor, 
working people in the riding of York South—Weston who every week 
have to write a cheque to Revenue Canada?  These are people who 
can barely meet the mortgage or the rent payment.  They can 
barely put food on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can he comment on the fairness and indicate why his government 
has not made it a priority to close those massive loopholes in 
the Income Tax Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government has moved on 
some of the concerns I have raised with respect to charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada revised the T-3010 financial reporting statement 
that charities are required to fill out every year.  It is much 
more stringent, more elaborate and less ambiguous. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget the government closed a major loophole in the 
charity system. Corporations were giving money to charities and 
borrowing it back.  This major abuse was covered in the last 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget about $35 million more was allocated to the 
charity division of Revenue Canada and more people were hired to 
do audits and that kind of thing.  Revenue Canada took very 
positive steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with charities and non-profit organizations is so 
huge because of the lack of legislation.  There is a limit to 
what can be done by regulation.  The difficulty is in not having 
adequate laws and this exists particularly for non-profit 
organizations. There are guidelines set for them by Revenue 
Canada through the corporations directorate but it is unfortunate 
that without legislation those guidelines can be ignored.  People 
cannot be sent to jail.  They cannot be penalized because there 
is no law to that effect. I stress that the next major step must 
be legislation and I hope the government is listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To take up the member's second point with respect to closing tax 
loopholes, again that centres very much on non-profit 
organizations and charities.  There is a lot of abuse with 
respect to the way money is put into charities and non-profit 
organizations as a method of tax avoidance and sometimes actual 
money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hate to say it but the oversight is so loose and real problems 
have come to my attention.  I will not bring them to the House 
now because I do not think it is suitable.  I have raised these 
issues with Revenue Canada and it is investigating individual 
organizations. I do not think we should talk about that in an 
open session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have used some charities to produce their own perks. This 
is a major abuse and it is often done by the affluent.  It 
deprives people in need and worthy of assistance and it deprives 
the very good charities of the type of support they need from the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would be on the right track to look into this 
area, in particular non-profit organizations.  If you have not 
looked in a corner, you will find a lot of dust when you do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am extremely pleased to have the opportunity to 
comment in this prebudget debate.  It is an extension of one of 
the innovations of our government that I am most proud of, that 
of holding prebudget consultations.  Hearings are held across the 
country to hear from ordinary Canadians, organizations, interest 
groups and business associations as to what Canadians feel should 
be in the next federal budget. As the House knows, the finance 
committee tabled its report on those consultations very recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that Canadians from all walks of life at all levels 
have made a major contribution to the fiscal success of this 
government over the last four and a half years.  They have 
endured some significant sacrifices in the quality of their 
health care, in access to post-secondary education, in social 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a number of areas Canadians have very much been partners with 
government in achieving what by next year's budget will be a 
balanced budget for the first time in nearly three decades. It is 
important that we listen to what Canadians are saying now about 
the future for this country and the path for this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is a major concern of my constituents.  They see the 
stress on the health care system. 
They are very much supportive of the idea of assisting people 
with their pharmaceutical needs because that is often a good 
substitute for hospital care or replacement for hospital care. As 
we have an increasingly aging population, but a population that 
is also able to stay in its own homes, in its communities, they 
are very much aware of the need for a home care program. I 
encourage the government to proceed with both those initiatives.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the prime concerns of my constituents is the needs of our 
children and our young people.  I would like to talk about that 
for a few minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly want to encourage the government to proceed as well 
with its national child program.  It is important that we set up 
ways of finding out how effective are the measures that we are 
taking.  We have numerous programs in government.  We do not 
often enough stop and ask and put in place the tools for finding 
out whether they are achieving the objectives we hope they are 
achieving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more young children in Canada are living in poverty. It 
is not an acceptable situation for one of the wealthiest 
countries in the world.  As we start down a program to work away 
at the number of young children who do not have enough to eat, 
who do not have adequate housing, who are therefore disadvantaged 
when it comes to becoming properly educated, children who live in 
abusive situations, I think it is very important that we ensure 
on an ongoing basis that what we are doing is achieving the 
results we want and that we are able to shift course and shift 
those resources to things that will work if what we have started 
is not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk a little about youth as well.  Many children who 
start life in poverty become a risk at youth because they have 
not had the basic advantages that most of us take for granted. 
We certainly have as an objective that every Canadian child 
enjoys the right to be well fed, well housed, well cared for and 
well educated wherever we live in this great country. These 
become the youth who have an extremely difficult time finding and 
keeping employment and ever being responsible for themselves in 
life.  I think the continuation and the strengthening of the 
youth employment strategy is vital to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own experience in holding a youth employment info fair in my 
riding just a few weeks ago was that young people and their 
parents and their friends are telling me they do not know enough 
about the programs that are out there. But I am also seeing 
cracks in the system, cracks for those very young people at risk 
who most need the help of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the government, as the finance committee has done in 
its report, to give more attention to those community based 
programs that can work with young people and their families to 
overcome some of the disadvantages many of them have had earlier 
in life and to set them on a path in life that is going to be 
productive for them and for our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about poor children.  The fact is in the vast majority 
of cases, well over 90%, children are poor because their mothers 
are poor.  I urge the Minister of Finance, as he prepares to 
finalize his budget and present it to this House early in the new 
year, to take into consideration the different implications for 
women than for men of different measures he might take in that 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that in Canada, as in every country around 
the world, women continue to be economically disadvantaged.  As 
long as that is the case, women will continue to be socially and 
politically disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the minister for the status of women was asked in the 
House how good a job she is doing and how much co-operation she 
is getting from the Minister of Finance to be coached on how to 
do gender equity analysis of the budget. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Minister of Finance to look very carefully at that 
issue and to consider when he tables his budget outlining for 
Parliament how it affects women and many millions of children in 
this country differently than it affects men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the finance committee has recommended that we 
increase the limits for RRSP contributions.  One of our problems 
in terms of equity is the major disparity in retirement between 
men and women.  Most of the people in Canada who benefit from 
RRSP contributions are men.  I ask the Minister of Finance to 
consider whether by increasing the RRSP levels he is contributing 
to reducing economic disparity or contributing to increasing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also urge him to look at tax bracket creep.  Because tax 
brackets have not been indexed for some time now, more and more 
people at the low income end of the scale who did not have to pay 
income tax before are finding that they now have to pay it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again this is an issue of equity.  The majority of Canadians at 
the low income end of the scale are women.  That has a direct 
impact on the children those women are raising.  It has a direct 
impact on how those women provide for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How well the economy does and how well Canadians do will 
continue to depend on the strength of the economy in various 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak about the high technology sector. This sector is 
extremely important to the national capital region, of which I 
represent a portion.  This sector is also extremely important to 
the economic growth of the entire country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the minister to look very carefully at the need for a 
national human resources strategy to ensure that we continue to 
be one of the top performing countries in the world in 
information and telecommunications technology, rather than losing 
our place and losing up to 600,000 potential jobs in the next 10 
to 15 years.  There should be continuing support for the 
transition of research to actual technology and products in that 
sector.  I urge the government to put in place much better means 
of measuring data in the industry, its performance in the 
international market and its human resources needs.  That will 
enable the sector to continue to thrive in the economy and 
continue to provide good paying jobs for many Canadians in the 
years to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member spoke about young people and the difficulties they 
are having living on the poverty line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three young families in my riding, two with two kids 
and the third with one. These individuals earn $10 to $12 an 
hour.  The only jobs available to them pay that wage. These three 
families have reported to me that they have been evicted from 
their homes.  One family was trying to buy the home and the other 
two were renting.  They were evicted because they simply could 
not make the payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of the families managed to move in with their parents, 
which they are very dismayed about.  I am not too sure what the 
other family did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that if we checked with every MP we would find that 
this type of story is not unique to my riding.  It is happening 
all across the land.  These young people are struggling.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please do not get into this rhetoric about the Reform says we 
cannot cut taxes until we balance the books. No, we cannot have 
overall tax reduction until we balance the books, there is no 
doubt about that.  But we can do things that will meet the needs 
of these people by saying they will not pay any more income tax 
because the $2,000 or $3,000 extra would have saved these homes 
for these young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one case they cannot even afford a car.  They are using 
bicycles.  They cannot afford to buy gas, insurance, licence 
plates and all that.  There is just too much they cannot do. 
That is at $10 to $12 an hour jobs.  Mothers with young children 
choose to be home with the children because it becomes expensive 
to have them looked after if they wanted to take on a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of spending $25 million for a flag program, that $25 
million could do wonders for a lot of young families.  Instead of 
spending $116,000 for a committee on seniors and sexuality, 
$116,000 would help a lot of young families. I am a senior and I 
should appreciate that, but I do not appreciate it at all.  Why 
can this government not look at the dollars wasted in some areas? 
Maybe calling it a waste is not fair, but spending on things 
that we could do without when we could give these families an 
instant break on their taxes.  Please stay away from that 
rhetoric that we cannot do it until we balance the books. That is 
not what I am talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, initially I was going 
to compliment the member because I think he knows that, having 
observed me in the House for sometime, I do not normally indulge 
in rhetoric unless it is in response to rhetoric.  He was 
avoiding that very nicely until his last few comments.  Now he 
has tempted me to indulge in rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has touched on things which I touched on my speech. 
It is extremely important that we look at those income tax 
brackets which are now putting many people, both young and older, 
into taxable situations who had not previously been because of 
their low incomes.  That is extremely important.  Our child tax 
credit program is extremely important.  I will also defend the 
flag program because if this country does not stay united we are 
all going to suffer economically in such a dramatic way.  We can 
argue whether something like the flag program helps national 
unity.  I believe it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of things which I referred to in my speech 
which our government has done, is doing, or which I encourage be 
done which will help those young people.  We all know of families 
where young people are having to move back into their homes. 
Parents who thought they were grandparents are becoming parents 
all over again.  I know it is placing a lot of burden not only on 
the young people who want to be independent but on the older 
parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I addressed some of those issues in my speech.  Many of 
the things our government is doing will help that.  There is more 
to be done as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I will be splitting my time with the member for Calgary 
Southeast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise on behalf of the people from Okanagan—Coquihalla on this 
prebudget debate to express their concern over the tax and spend 
mentality of the Liberal government.  When back in my riding I 
talk to my constituents, I communicate with my constituents and 
we do that through a variety of means.  We hold town hall 
meetings.  We publish weekly editorials in the newspapers.  We 
ask for feedback.  We get that feedback. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the messages that most often comes to me from my 
constituents, the message I try to relay in the House, is again 
and again people are saying the spending priorities of the 
government are out of whack with the rest of the country. That is 
evident in a recent public opinion poll that showed Canadians do 
not trust the government in the way it spends their tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want a government that is going to look after the

</I></B></P><P align=left>They want balanced books.  They want lower taxes so that we can 
create jobs in this country.   With regard to the massive debt 
that has been built up, over $600 billion by Liberals and Tories 
for years now, they want to make sure that we start paying off 
that mortgage and look after that debt problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason is if we can tackle that debt problem and get taxes 
down, we can lay the course and the groundwork for a strong 
future for the country, for our children and our grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to do today with my time is talk a bit about 
the priorities that I mentioned earlier and a few of the 
programs.  I am not going to say that this money should not be 
spent, but I am going to point out some areas where the 
government spends money and it seems to be out of sync with the 
rest of the country on how it would like to see that money spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, I am going to talk now about the $26.4 million 
spent on a parole system in this country, a system that has 
proven to fail time and time again.  I will give a specific 
example to the House and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding on September 7 there was a double murder, the 
murder of Cecilia and Tammy Grono.  They were murdered by a 
person by the name of Kevin Machell who was on day parole in 
Calgary.  The rules of Corrections Canada state very clearly that 
a person who is tardy or does not show up at his halfway house 
should be reported within 10 minutes to one hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a shocking case because it took 24 hours for any 
authorities to notify anybody of the non-appearance of Kevin 
Machell.  In that 24 hour period he travelled to Summerland, my 
home town, and murdered Cecilia and Tammy Grono while Tammy's two 
and four year old children sat and watched in horror.  It is a 
terrible case.  Kevin Machell three months later is still on the 
loose in this country.  Maybe he is not in this country any 
longer.  We do not know but he is still on the loose. Those two 
preschool children will be spending their Christmas under police 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where did the $26.4 million go to protect the Grono family in 
this country and all the other families who have lived under this 
type of system?  It is horrendous that this could happen.  It has 
been traumatic for the family, it has been traumatic for the 
people in my riding of Okanagan-Coquihalla. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is not the $26.4 million.  If we had a system that 
worked, I would say spend $30 million or $40 million.  What is 
happening is that this is a system that is so bent on trying to 
rehabilitate the criminal, it does not look at the real fact of 
what a parole system is for.  It is to protect law-abiding 
citizens in this country.  The safety of Canadians is being 
ignored.  That has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to talk about another circumstance in my 
riding with the department of Indian affairs.  We spend some $4 
billion on the department of Indian affairs.  With that money the 
government is responsible for certain objectives and 
responsibilities.  Yet one of the responsibilities this 
government does not have is to provide assistance for individuals 
who are renting property on an Indian reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was shocked to find that in my riding there is a mobile home 
park situated on an Indian reserve.  Two months ago the people 
living there received their eviction notices.  They were told to 
move out just before Christmas.  They are low income families. 
The $4 billion we spend on the department of Indian affairs does 
not protect them because there is no law in this land that says 
there is a level playing field for people who rent property on an 
Indian reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If persons rent property let us say on an ordinary piece of land 
owned by a private citizen, they fall under the provincial 
rentals act but not if they rent property on an Indian reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has this government done to change that?  It has done 
nothing, not a thing.  The $4 billion did not help those people 
who live at Driftwood Mobile Home Park nor the other three mobile 
home parks where people are going to be evicted in the dead of 
winter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the government not taken up the initiative to make sure 
that there is a rental act federally for people who rent land on 
Indian reserves?  There is no excuse for this.  I will make sure, 
as a private member, that in the new year I will introduce such 
legislation in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time is short and there are a number of things we could talk 
about today prior to Christmas about how the government spends 
its money and the misguided way it does it.  I have come to know 
many of the Liberal members across the way, the NDP members and 
Conservative members, all of the people in the House.  They come 
here with good ideas and are good people in many respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what the federal Liberals are doing is inexcusable to 
the Canadian people.  Time and time again public opinion polls 
show that Canadians do not trust this government and will not 
trust this government.  I am not saying that the federal Liberals 
are stupid or bad people.  They are just wrong in what they do 
with our hard earned tax money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out one more example which is the need for search 
and rescue helicopters.  This is a debate that has been going on 
for close to six years when we take in the time that the 
Conservatives spent on it as well.  However, here we have a 
federal Liberal government that is not concerned about the safety 
of Canadians when it comes to search and rescue from coast to 
coast.  No, it is busy in the back rooms with its public 
relations folks sucking back cappuccinos and trying to figure out 
how it is going to explain the helicopter that it is going to 
buy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, that is unacceptable.  It was unacceptable last year in 
the pre-budget debate and it is unacceptable today.  Our military 
needs the equipment when the government sends them out to do a 
job. I was in the military and they are good people.  They do the 
best with what they have.  However, a government is irresponsible 
when it does not give them the tools they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a couple of weeks ago we saw another example.  A young man 
who went to Croatia in service of the country for peacekeeping 
was not given a helmet.  It is outrageous that he was not given a 
helmet.  His armoured patrol vehicle, which is not armoured at 
all, rolled down a hill and landed on top of him.  He now has 
brain damage.  We sent these people on peacekeeping missions 
without the proper equipment.  That is inexcusable by this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see it is time now to wrap up very quickly and I will wrap 
up.  However, I do want to say, for goodness sake, the Canadian 
public is sick and tired of the extreme uncaring positions that 
the government takes.  It is time for a balanced and reasonable 
approach when it comes to the things that Canadians need and 
want.  When it comes to social programs, criminal justice, the 
military or any department, make a choice, but let us start 
spending our money properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can laugh about it or cry about it, but for goodness 
sake let us not ignore the problem.  Let us move into the 21st 
century on a reasonable footing for the future of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
sit here perplexed.  This is the beginning of my second term in 
the House and in the last four years since I have been part of 
this House, I have often wondered why it is that members on this 
side of the House come up with those heart-wrenching, 
gut-wrenching examples like the Machell case or, as the member 
for Wild Rose talked about earlier, three young families who 
could not pay the bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that we never hear anything like that from the other 
side?  Everything we hear from the other side is that everything 
is fine, everything is great, don't worry, be happy.  It is 
really confusing when we hear those kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague used some examples.  I would like to give another 
example about spending priorities.  This is something my 
colleague talked about, the parole system, and obviously an area 
that I am working in. 
I want to ask the member a simple question.  Would it not be 
better if we took that $100 million, $200 million or $300 million 
that it is going to cost taxpayers for gun registration and put 
it into real, meaningful programs such as expanding police 
forces?  I worked for the city of Saskatoon police and they have 
had to shut down their community police station, cut back because 
they cannot pay the bills.  Would we not be better to target 
those dollars to areas where they could do far more good?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
I think it is an important one about misguided funds.  All of us 
in the House are concerned about the criminal justice system in 
this country. For goodness sake, we have had handgun control for 
many, many years and it has not prevented murders in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are talking about rehabilitation and early detection 
programs, I think the Canadian public would honestly believe that 
instead of taxing duck hunters and law abiding citizens of the 
country, because that is who the government is going after with 
its gun registration, why not direct that money toward a criminal 
justice system that works. That is what we should do. That is 
what the Canadian public is clearly telling us as legislators to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend also raised the issue of the Machell case, the 
horrendous story of a person who was on day parole who committed 
a double homicide in my riding.  I do not think I mentioned it in 
my remarks, but because of the lack of action by this government 
on the parole system in this country, I introduced a private 
member's motion dealing specifically with ensuring that there is 
a zero tolerance policy for those people who are tardy, who do 
not show up or report while on parole.  Zero tolerance means that 
if they are not at their halfway house at the assigned time, 
there would be a Canada-wide warrant put out immediately for 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that there is a reluctance on the part of the government 
and the House to accept such a policy.  When we put the facts 
together about the two Grono family members who were murdered in 
cold blood by a person who was on parole, the government said: 
“No, we think our parole system should be geared toward the 
likes of Kevin Machell. ” It favours Kevin Machell over the 
Gronos.  Now, that is wrong.  It is just plain wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is to give the benefit of the doubt in any 
parole case, give it to the victims and the law-abiding citizens 
of Canada. Why does the government insist on giving the benefit 
of the doubt to the criminals, the Kevin Machells of Canada who 
murder and rape citizens of this country.  It does not make 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For goodness sake, Liberal government, get your priorities 
straight. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to debate the prebudget motion with respect 
to the report of the Standing Committee on Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had experience with the committee since I sit on it as an 
associate member and I have attended many of its hearings.  I 
appeared before it in my former capacity as a taxpayer advocate. 
I know the kinds of people who generally appear before the 
finance committee tend to be special interest pleaders, people 
with a particular focus or point to make to the government and 
legislators.  These people are all well intentioned, as are all 
members of the legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it strikes me that all too often the people who appear 
before the finance committee in its prebudget hearings do not 
speak about the kind of real economic pain that is being felt by 
so many Canadians in a very personal and tangible way. Nor is 
that pain reflected in any way in the actual report of the 
finance committee which speaks about big issues.  It talks about 
debt, government spending priorities and so forth.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day that document and, I would suggest the 
fiscal and budgetary policies of the government, do not really 
reflect a compassionate view of the priorities of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have stood many times in this place, even though I am in my 
first term, to talk about the economic record of this government 
and to talk about the unemployment rate, the growth and the debt, 
the record high tax levels and referred to all the statistics.  I 
could do that again but rather than repeat myself I will talk 
about some absolutely devastating tragic cases of how the fiscal 
priorities of this government and previous governments have led 
to so much pain for so many real Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, I think of friends of mine, Bernice Lee and her 
husband Philip, who are relatively recent immigrants to Canada 
from Hong Kong.  Bernice and Philip have four young children and 
run a small mending and dry cleaning shop in downtown Edmonton in 
an apartment building where I used to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bernice arrives at work before 6 a.m. North of Edmonton it is 
often dark until 9 a.m. in the winter days and it can get down to 
40 below.  She does not have a car.  She gets there on public 
transport, arrives and opens up her shop.  By 7 a.m. she is 
working away.  One can walk by her store at 10 p.m. when the wind 
is howling outside in the winter and she is there alone, working 
away. Sometimes their children are there late at night, having 
come there from school because there is no one at home, because 
neither Bernice nor Philip can afford to stay at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her husband Philip works on the side, I think about a $10 an 
hour job at a computer plant in Edmonton.  He has to work the 
graveyard shift to add a little more to the family budget just so 
they can get by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked Bernice one day how their business was going.  They 
bought it the year before.  I just noticed that she was working 
so terribly hard and had nobody there to help her.  I asked her 
how it was going and she looked at me with almost tears in her 
eyes.  I don't think she had really thought about that before. 
She said they were barely hanging on and she was so disappointed 
because she said they were working so hard but were hardly able 
to keep the business going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragedy is this business represents the hopes and dreams and 
aspirations of this family in coming to Canada. The Canadian 
dream for them was that by making sacrifices, by working hard, by 
playing by the rules, they might be able to get ahead and make a 
better life for their children, but she said to me that she could 
not understand why a family in their circumstances had the kind 
of tax burden they had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said to me that if it were not for the taxes she had to pay, 
not just the small business tax and the income taxes and the 
consumption taxes but also the local property taxes and the 
provincial taxes, if not for the several thousands of dollars her 
very small one person business had to pay, she would be able to 
hire somebody to come in and help her, do the hard manual work of 
her business.  That would allow her, instead of working from 6 
a.m. to 9 p.m. and beyond, six days a week, to maybe take a day 
off or to go home at a reasonable hour to spend the evening with 
her children and her husband.  But she does not have that ability 
because her business does not have the disposable income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a reason it does not have the disposable income.  They 
are getting enough business to do that sort of thing, but they 
are not able to keep the money they are earning because of the 
fiscal priorities of the federal government.  This is the human 
impact.  People like Bernice are working well into the night. 
What were formally one income families have become two income 
families.  Children who 30 years ago used to be able to go home 
to a parental home after school are now going home to empty 
houses.  Why?  Both parents are out in the workforce trying to 
run their businesses, trying to do their jobs to pay for the tax 
bill, to furnish the funds this government thinks are so 
absolutely necessary for all the programs and bureaucracy it 
operates.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the members opposite one basic philosophical question. I 
used to be a Liberal.  Liberals love to pride themselves on their 
sense of compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their sense of compassion is to take money away from Bernice 
Lee, transfer it through some hugely expensive Ottawa bureaucracy 
and spit it out in other things such as over $5 billion in 
handouts to major corporations like Bombardier, grants to special 
interest groups so they can plead here in Ottawa for more money 
to fuel their special interests, and huge programs that create 
disincentives to work, to save and to invest in parts of the 
country.  That is what they take money away from Bernice Lee to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I ask in this debate is a very simple question but 
a profoundly important one.  Do the members of the government 
really believe they know better how to spend a dollar that 
Bernice Lee earns than she does?  Do they believe that what they 
would with an extra dollar out of her till will produce a greater 
social benefit for her and her family than that dollar left in 
her pocketbook? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do they believe hiring another bureaucrat to administer another 
distant program in Ottawa is going to do more for Mrs. Lee than 
her ability to hire somebody to come in and help her take care of 
her business?  Do they believe that another dollar in another 
grant program is going to do more for the economy and create jobs 
than Mrs. Lee can do in her own business?  That is what this 
debate is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about the statistics and the numbers, the 9% 
unemployment, the 16% youth unemployment, the $100 billion they 
have added to the debt and the 73% debt to GDP ratio.  We can 
talk about all the statistics and numbers we want and the 
Liberals are wonderful at doing that.  However, when it comes to 
people, real people and the lives they are living in this 
country, why can we not afford to change our priorities and to 
let people like Mrs. Lee keep more of what belongs to them?  That 
is ultimately what this debate is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about who the money belongs to.  Does it belong to the 
government?  Does it belong to the Liberal Party of Canada?  Does 
it belong to politicians and bureaucrats who think they know 
better how to spend that money than the Canadians who earn it? 
Does it belong to the people who make sacrifices to raise their 
families and to leave a better life to their children than they 
had themselves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to say, in this debate as we prepare for the budget 
next year, I hope the members of the government will start to 
listen to people like Mrs. Lee and will start to put their 
priorities where they belong by letting people keep a little more 
of their own money.  That really would provide the kind of hope 
that people like Mrs. Lee need to hang on a little longer to help 
their families get by. 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I do 
not know what planet my colleague is living on.  In fact, he has 
forgotten that in a matter of three years this government has 
been able to win the war on the deficit and to balance its books. 
We came out of a devastating recession.  We came out of a 
situation that was beyond control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we decide to take every single penny of surplus and dump 
it in across the board tax relief for what he calls Canadians, I 
wonder whether he is advocating this tax cut relief be given, for 
example, to someone who makes $500,000 or whether it should be 
given to somebody who makes $30,000. Is he really advocating 
across the board tax relief without having a balanced approach to 
say if John Smith or ABC Canada Inc. or whoever is making enough 
money, they do not need the tax relief?  These are the people who 
can make it on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand how he can stand up without blushing and 
call for tax cuts across the board when what this government is 
doing is providing incentives, proper programs, proper dividends 
and proper assistance for people who need the assistance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He cannot just say that the government has not done anything to 
help people like Mrs. Lee.  As a result of this government policy 
Mrs. Lee and many others like her across the country have been 
able to save.  For example, on a house with a $100,000 mortgage 
they could save over $3,000 a year.  That dividend is a result of 
what the government has done.  That came as a result of what this 
government has done in terms of proper fiscal management of the 
nation as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes I wonder about that kind of poison coated statement 
that comes from some of my colleagues on the other side of the 
House when they talk about special interest programs.  I believe 
it is their objective to eradicate every single grant that is 
given to special interest groups.  Mrs. Lee, her husband and her 
children fall under those special interest groups.  These are the 
kinds of groups, organizations and individuals who benefit from 
what they define as special grants or special interest groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to eradicate every single grant for every single 
special interest group because they probably call women a special 
interest group.  They call organizations for the disabled special 
interest groups.  They call groups that are multicultural 
organizations special interest groups and they paint everybody 
with the same brush and they want to cut grants all across the 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague should stand up within the next 30 seconds or so 
and congratulate the government on the excellent job it has done 
in trying to strike a balance between controlling the deficit, 
reducing the debt and ensuring that Canadians get the net 
dividend out of its proper fiscal responsibility.  Would he stand 
up and congratulate the government right now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will not congratulate 
the government for perpetuating 15 years of shrinking disposable 
after tax income for the average family.  This member talks about 
lower interest rates.  That has not been felt by people even when 
the member includes the reduction in interest rates.  People are 
coming home with less today than they did 15 years ago, in real 
terms after tax, because of the tax burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk about tax fairness, this member is from a shameless party. 
I remember the prime minister held a confederation dinner with 
2,300 people at $500 a plate.  He talked about the Reform Party 
fat cats to people who paid $500 a plate.  The same government 
that talks about fat cats also taxes 7.7 million Canadians who 
earn under $30,000.  It collects over $11 billion from them and 
takes on average $1,500 per taxpayer just within the income tax 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People like Mrs. Lee are not feeling anything but the economic 
pain of 30 years of bigger government. I guess that member just 
counted himself on the side of those who think they know how to 
spend that money better than she does. 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to enter into the prebudget debate in the 
House.  I was very happy to have a town hall meeting in my riding 
of Durham which many of my constituents attended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform members talked about their desire to consult their 
constituents.  It is interesting to look at the back of this 
report.  It talks about the members who actually submitted 
reports from their constituents to the finance committee.  The 
list includes many of my own colleagues, many of the opposition 
party colleagues but not a single name of a Reform Party member. 
That is unfortunate because this was a great opportunity for 
Reform Party members to do what they are always saying in the 
House that they do, that they represent their constituents, that 
they want the views of their constituents heard in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to say that the people of Durham had a direct voice 
here. 
We had a very good and open discussion.  Almost 70 people 
attended.  They gave me their ideas on what should be done if 
there is a fiscal dividend.  I was very happy to participate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one slight criticism of the finance committee report. One 
of the recommendations is to allow for an increase in the 
deductibility in the foreign component of registered retirement 
savings plans.  Within their RRSPs people can put up to 20% in 
so-called foreign investments, foreign assets.  The finance 
committee has recommended that the limit be increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very important. This limit is used not only in RRSPs but 
in all aspects of the pension system.  As I understand it, the 
newly formed Canada pension plan board would have a similar 
threshold. I object to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we have to focus on what we are talking about when we 
are talking about RRSP deductions.  RRSPs are used as a tax 
deduction.  Essentially, the result of this would be to 
subsidize, and I underline the word subsidize, higher income 
earners to invest in foreign countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no laws in Canada against foreign investments. People 
are free to do that if that is their choice. However, they may 
have to do it with their tax paid money, in other words from 
their normal savings as opposed to actually getting a tax 
deduction, an incentive if you will, to invest in another 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one small point on which I differ. I believe it would be 
improper and unwise to proceed in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of the debate on budgetary items concerns expenditures. 
The Reform Party and others talk about government spending, 
spending, spending.  What is missing when we talk about the 
expenditure of money is that sometimes, in fact a lot of the 
time, the expenditure is an investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should all know the difference between investing and 
spending. When we invest in something, we expect a return.  That 
is why it is important to recognize in the upcoming budget that 
we are not wasting money to spend money in areas of some things 
that will actually come back to us. In other words, that money 
did not disappear.  It will come back to us in the form of a 
return on our investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those very important areas is science and technology. 
There is a general recognition that we must move forward and 
embrace the challenges which science and technology present to 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Durham College is in my riding.  It has a science and technology 
faculty.  There is something like three jobs for every one of its 
graduates.  We talk about youth unemployment on the one hand, but 
we also have on the other hand a disproportionate demand for 
people who are trained in certain areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I attended the industry committee and we heard from the 
granting councils.  Representatives of the National Research 
Council, NSERC and MRC appeared before us.  They pointed out that 
Canada's expenditures in research and development lag behind just 
about every other country in the western world.  I think the only 
country that gives less money to research and development based 
on its gross domestic product is Italy. We need to invest more in 
the science field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the Conference Board of Canada published a very 
excellent report about the Canadian economy.  It found some very 
remarkable things.  It found that Canada is one of the highest 
spenders in education.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should interject, Madam Speaker, that I am sharing my time 
with the hon. member for Oxford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conference Board of Canada made a number of observations. 
Some of the very important ones were that in post-secondary 
education, Canada is one of the highest spenders in the world. At 
the same time, some of the performance in the area of science and 
technology is in fact some of the most mediocre. We need to 
revamp some of our educational institutions to ensure that we are 
training our people properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, it is interesting that one of the initiatives 
which our government is involved in is called technology 
partnerships.  It is a program I am very proud of.  In fact the 
member across the say said to give away money to Bombardier. 
Bombardier was a recipient of the technology partnerships 
program.  But that just shows the lack of knowledge that exists 
on the other side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technology partnerships matches the expenditures by companies in 
the area of research and development.  It provides a degree of 
risk capital but it is an investment that is based on a royalty 
system.  For instance as Bombardier sells more Dash-7 aeroplanes, 
money comes back into the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program has only been around for about three years and just 
recently we received our first cheque, a royalty payment coming 
back to the government.  It is very clear that the object of the 
exercise is to allow this funding to assist. It is sort of risk 
capital. We are matching money.  We have a partnership going with 
small and medium size businesses to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a company close to my riding called Camateoid which is 
another recipient of a technology partnerships venture capital 
loan.  This is a very interesting company.  It makes the paint 
for the Challenger aircraft.  It is very much related to 
aerospace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the ways we can use the resources we have in 
government to lever other forms of capital, pools of capital that 
possibly would not have been spent in the area of research and 
development.  That generates all kinds of multipliers in our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It allows our graduating students from high tech institutions to 
have a place to work in this country. We often talk about the 
brain drain and how people are being forced to leave this country 
because the opportunities are not there.  This is a very specific 
way in which the government can invest in some of these sectors, 
not give the money away but invest it in such a way that the 
money is coming back to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that when we are putting our budget together we can find 
some room to move in these areas.  As the granting councils and 
the Conference Board of Canada have said, Canada is lagging 
behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of the growth in our economy has been based on the export 
sector, almost 40% now.  If our Canadian dollar goes upward 
vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar which it probably should—and some 
people suggest the Canadian dollar is worth 85¢—if that happens, 
we are going to see a lot of unemployment because we have not 
kept up with the productivity challenges that are going to make 
this country great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate it is important that this government puts more money 
into research councils and also the technological programs that 
will make this country strong.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a question 
for my hon. colleague. He seems to be looking for funding for research 
and development. But the government has a great source of income that 
has not been tapped into, and intentionally so I think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Bloc Quebecois have often spoken in the House about 
family trusts and trusts in general. The fact is that trusts are exempt 
from provisional tax, while every other company as well as self-employed 
workers have to pay tax instalments four times a year. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1240

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By making advance payments on their income tax these people are 
actually making funds available to the government, and the government 
earns interest on these very large amounts. Why does the government 
persist in exempting trusts, in which hundreds and hundreds of millions 
of dollars are invested, without requiring that tax instalments be paid 
on these amounts, thereby benefiting the government much earlier than if 
it had to wait till the end of the year to receive the tax owed on these 
trusts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, the government is paid a lump sum at the end of the 
year, when these trusts file their tax returns. 
Yet we are looking for funds, we need money that could be used, based on 
our priorities, to relieve child poverty and to invest more in 
education, health and research and development, as my hon. colleague 
just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague, who is a member of the party in power, 
to tell us what he thinks of this approach and why the government would 
not require trusts to pay tax instalments four times a year, as all 
self-employed workers are required to do. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Madam Speaker, I cannot specifically 
answer but I suspect that part of the problem is the 
predictability of income.  For people to pay on a quarterly basis 
there has to be a degree of predictability of what the income of 
the trust is going to be. I suspect there is some argument that 
some trusts are active in some years and not active in others. It 
is very difficult to predict what their quarterly payments would 
be.  I suggest to the member that it is probably not that 
significant a loss of revenue in any case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are more interesting areas of the administration.  I think 
the member was talking to some extent about the auditor general's 
report.  It was interesting how the banks are actually holding 
back cheques in the GST system and excise system before they 
deliver them to the government.  Something our government is very 
keen on looking into is how we can make the whole collection 
process a lot more efficient and effective and increase some of 
the revenues to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us think that tax reductions will come and tax relief 
should come to some of the people the hon. member is talking 
about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I want to congratulate the member for Durham on his comments.  He 
has been a very tireless advocate for job creation initiatives 
and R and D. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him, with regard to the technology 
partnerships such as the Pasteur Merrieux one which was announced 
within the past year, whether he could comment on the potential 
impact on jobs and the economy of those kinds of initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am very happy to 
respond to the hon. member for Mississauga South who has also 
been very active in these areas.  We share a lot of similarities 
in our vocation and also in our desire to create jobs in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole concept of the expenditures in the technology 
partnerships program is about creating jobs.  Sometimes we forget 
about taking it to the nth degree.  It is about creating jobs. It 
is about creating opportunities for small and medium size 
businesses.  It is also about helping our environment.  Companies 
like Ballard Power are at the forefront of research and 
development in Canada and are creating exciting and good jobs for 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank 
the member for Durham for splitting his time with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with courage and a commitment to do what is right that the 
government has been successful on the economic front.  The Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Finance realized we could not 
continue to burden our children with constant deficits and an 
ever increasing mountain of debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national debt of more than $600 billion hangs like a 
millstone around our necks.  It takes 35¢ of every tax dollar 
collected just to pay the interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberal government was first elected in October 1993 we 
inherited a deficit of $42 billion.  This past fiscal year the 
deficit came in at $8.9 billion, almost $20 billion lower than 
the deficit in 1995-96.  It also represented the largest year 
over year reduction in the deficit in Canadian history.  At 1.1% 
of GDP as compared to 6% per cent of GDP when the government took 
office it is the smallest federal government deficit in over two 
decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This represents economic success that we are well on the road to 
surpassing.  There are indications that the federal government 
will be at or very near a balanced budget this year. With a 
balanced budget Canadian taxpayers can begin to look forward to 
annual surpluses rather than annual deficits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fiscal dividend will force the government and by extension 
the Canadian people to make choices about the kind of Canada we 
want to build for our children and grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party pledged during the last federal election that 
any surplus would be invested in social spending, for example 
health care, youth employment initiatives and education, as well 
as debt reduction and tax relief.  It was a platform that I 
endeavoured to ensure my constituents understood so that they 
knew what to expect from a Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that we need to make certain strategic investments. 
Some quick examples of this type of investment are the increases 
in the Canadian health and social transfer allocation to $12.5 
billion a year and the prime minister's millennium scholarship 
fund which will help Canadian students compete in the global 
economy.  These investments strengthen Canadian society for today 
and tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember, though, that the battle against the deficit is 
not finished.  As we enter the era of surplus we must remember 
that we continue to have an immense debt hanging over our heads. 
We ignore it at our peril.  I am convinced, and I believe the 
people of Oxford agree with me, that we should invest as much of 
the surplus as possible in debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is tempting to prescribe a short term tax reduction 
fix, it will have been for naught if economic circumstances 
change and we have not reduced the national debt.  The fiscal 
dividend cannot be used to benefit this generation alone.  We 
must look forward and realize that Canadians decades from now 
will judge us for what we do about the debt now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to tell my grandchildren that when I had the 
chance to influence government policy, as I do now, I did nothing 
to relieve them of the tremendous burden of paying interest year 
after year after year on a $600 billion national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear a lot in the House and in the provincial capitals of the 
country about tax cuts.  For the past few years the leader of the 
Reform Party has stood and asked the Minister of Finance when 
Canadians could expect an across the board tax cut.  As a member 
of Parliament from Ontario I have been able to see firsthand the 
effects of the Mike Harris inspired tax cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Mike Harris is some type of super hero to Reformers, we 
can assume a Reform administration would operate much like the 
Ontario Tories.  Mike Harris and the Ontario Tories have made a 
crucial mistake in making a tax cut.  By reducing taxes before 
the budget is balanced, Mike Harris has been forced to make 
draconian cuts to some essential services in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the official opposition may have a problem with my 
use of the word draconian.  To me an additional $700 million cut 
in education spending, following the $700 million loss in 
provincial revenues due to the latest round of the tax cut, is 
draconian. Speaking personally, the small amount of money I save 
from the Harris tax cut is not worth the effect it is having on 
the education system in Ontario.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform Party were governing the country it would follow 
the lead of Mike Harris.  Could the Reform Party tell us how much 
will have to be cut from education, health care and the 
environment to pay for the tax cuts?  Furthermore, it would add 
$600 million to our debt through its super RRSP to replace the 
CPP.  How could we possibly trust a party that refuses to even 
acknowledge that the CPP has an unfunded liability of $600 
million that must be paid out whether or not people are paying 
into the plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all want tax cuts, but those of us on this side of the House 
feel they should not come before they are sustainable.  We cannot 
afford to cut taxes one year, only to raise them the next, or, 
worse, cut an essential program because we provided an across the 
board tax cut before it could be sustained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short term tax cuts should be targeted at those who need 
it the most.  These are students, persons with disabilities and 
children of working parents with low incomes.  To be honest these 
tax cuts have already been made by the government in the last 
federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we need to broaden the group to include, possibly, 
environmental initiatives, agricultural and agri-food 
development, technological and biological research, and an end to 
the luxury tax on jewellery.  These selective tax cuts could 
provide a needed shot of adrenalin to the economy while assisting 
certain sectors to remain competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the aftermath of Kyoto it would be appropriate for a firm 
specializing in environmental technologies to receive some tax 
assistance for undertaking research and development in this area. 
This can assist Canada and the global community in reaching their 
goals.  Canada is already a leader in environmental technologies. 
Let us take it one step further to underscore Canada's commitment 
to the environment and sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, we need to reward research and development in new 
agricultural products.  Tax measures taken by the Minister of 
Finance have already assisted in helping a growing domestic 
ethanol industry.  Programs like the tobacco diversification 
program are successful in assisting farmers in developing new 
crops.  Southwestern Ontario is playing a large role in the 
development of an industrial hemp crop for export as fibre to the 
United States.  This industry will create jobs in rural Canada 
and government assistance will allow it to get off to a fast and 
successful start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to discuss briefly the excise tax on 
jewellery.  The finance committee report which we are debating 
now suggested that the Minister of Finance consider removing this 
luxury tax.  This is a 10% excise tax which is unfair when other 
items of luxury, such as fur coats, speed boats and sports cars, 
are not similarly taxed.  While there is some debate concerning 
the correlation between the luxury tax on jewellery and the 
underground economy, I ask the Minister of Finance to do what is 
just and remove this unfair tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude I would like to refer to cost recovery in the 
agricultural sector.  This is an issue that I dealt with 
extensively with corn producers in my riding in the debate over 
the creation of the Pest Management Review Agency, the PMRA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While farmers are prepared to bear a portion of the costs for 
these programs and for the most part do not have a problem with 
cost recovery, we have to ensure the system is fair.   We cannot 
ask farmers to pay for a system that is top heavy in bureaucracy 
and benefits other groups.  For farmers to pay the entire cost of 
this program when consumers and industry also benefit from it is 
unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope the government has learned a lesson from the 
PMRA debate which took place last winter and spring.  I 
congratulate the committee for studying the issue during its 
deliberations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years ago we would never have seen a debate like the one 
taking place in the House today.  The standing committee and 
members of the House could not have offered their feelings about 
the budget in a debate like this one today.  Consultations took 
place in bank board rooms with the country's elite in attendance. 
The average citizen on the street did not have a choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the Minister of Finance for giving Canadians a voice in 
this process.  His previous budgets have shown that he listens to 
the debate in the House, to committees and to average Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
do not think Canadian people should be fooled on this point. 
Successive Liberal and Conservative governments over the past 25 
years or so have got the country into the terrible debt situation 
it faces today.  The Liberals ought to listen to constituents in 
their own ridings like we in the Reform Party listen to the ones 
in ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go back to my riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan people ask me 
why Canadian taxpayers should have to continue to pay increased 
taxes because of the gross mismanagement and mistakes of our 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all well and good for the hon. member to say that they 
removed taxes on jewellery.  I have a son who could never afford 
to buy the kind of jewellery he is talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government have in real tax relief to offer 
Canadians so that they have money put back into their pockets and 
can simply live? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That same son of mine has a family.  He is 23 years old.  He has 
a wife, a small child and another one on the way.  The average 
youth unemployment in that age group in Nanaimo is 16.5%, one of 
the highest in the nation.  He recently had to leave British 
Columbia and move to Alberta where the economy is booming under 
the strong fiscal management of the Klein government.  He now has 
a full time job and can finally feed his family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of hope does the government offer my son and his young 
family in the final analysis of giving them tax relief not only 
now but in the future?  Could my hon. colleague give them some 
hope? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his comments and his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Successive governments, Liberal and Progressive Conservative, 
built up the debt.  That is quite true.  However we elected those 
governments.  There is only one taxpayer and we will have to pay 
the debt sooner or later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is better to pay it under a balanced system which tries to 
take into account all the needs, beginning with those most 
serious like health care, seniors benefits and the disabled, than 
to have a government that would hand it all out in some form of 
tax cut to everybody whether or not they need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very glad my colleague's son is working successfully in 
Alberta.  Perhaps there is a lesson there.  No one else will pay 
the debt and no one else will balance the budget. The people of 
Canada will do that, as we have been doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still considered the best country in the world in which 
to live.  People are still clamouring to come here.  We must be 
doing something right.  The government got it right this time and 
will keep on doing it until things are in balance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak today to the prebudget consultations.  These consultations 
are an opportunity for the public to provide input to the 
government as it gets ready to draw up next year's budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year, the country-wide approach to the consultations gave 
the temporary impression that the government was open and ready to 
listen to what people had to say.  But that was the extent of the 
surprise.  The reality of the matter can be found in the committee 
report we are discussing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The much-heralded exercise was very simple:  take the 
Liberals' red book II, remove the cover page and tack on a new one 
that reads Report of the Standing Committee on Finance.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what it contains: the same reasoning, the same 
promises, the same spending and the same plans for interfering in 
provincial areas of jurisdiction.  In short, the entire 
consultation exercise was a sham, because the report is nothing 
more than a rehash of the Liberals' last election platform 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To set the record straight, I would like to remind the 
government what the people of Quebec and of Canada want to see in 
the Minister of Finance's next budget.  We in the Bloc Quebecois 
have appended a dissenting report to the finance committee's 
report.  I would like to give an idea of what we are calling for in 
the next budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the Minister of Finance to pass seven specific 
measures.  These measures represent the consensus of Quebec's 
stakeholders during the prebudget consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the government must quit interfering in provincial 
spheres of jurisdiction, such as health, education and social 
security.  It must drop the idea of creating new programs in areas 
of jurisdiction that would only multiply bureaucratic structures, 
not to mention driving up costs for taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance must instead use some of the spare 
funds that he frees up over the coming years to pay back part of 
what he took from the provinces for postsecondary education, health 
and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the federal government must reform the present employment 
insurance system to put an end to the injustices created by this program 
and to provide better protection for the workers of Quebec and Canada, 
especially seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc also calls on the Minister of Finance to greatly reduce 
employment insurance premiums, based on a company's performance in job 
creation. This reduction in rates could represent 40 cents for every 
$100 of the total insurable payroll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance must also create an employment insurance 
fund which is separate from the federal government consolidated fund, as 
proposed by the Auditor General of Canada, so that money from the 
workers and the employers is not used to artificially reduce the 
deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the federal government must stimulate job creation and 
commit to seriously fight against poverty. 
The Bloc Quebecois, along with many stakeholders in Quebec, is calling 
for a major reform of personal and corporate income tax through which 
these objectives could be achieved, while implementing targeted tax 
reductions for individuals and small and medium size companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would like to mention now, as I forgot to do so at 
the beginning of my speech, that I will be sharing my speaking time with 
the member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the federal government must restore indexing in the tax 
tables. No indexing is essentially a hidden increase in personal income 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, the Minister of Finance must pass a law to prohibit 
deficits, like the one passed by the Quebec National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the GST is concerned, the Minister of Finance must first 
accept the arbitration proposal made by the Bloc Quebecois to settle 
this issue, and, depending on the outcome, he must pay to the government 
of Quebec the $2 billion in compensation being demanded for harmonizing 
with the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventh, the Minister of Finance must re-establish funding for 
international assistance. Since 1993, that is since the Liberals came to 
power, funding for international assistance has been drastically 
reduced, contrary to Canada's humanist tradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent consultations clearly indicate that there are now more than 
ever two completely opposite visions on the role that the federal 
government should play, with Quebec calling for more powers for the 
provinces and greater autonomy. The nine other Canadian provinces are 
calling for stronger action in Ottawa in their areas of jurisdiction. 
This is what we see in health, education and policies to fight poverty. 
In Quebec, the federal government's intrusion in these jurisdictions 
belonging to the government of Quebec is strongly condemned.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, these respective areas of jurisdiction are clearly specified 
in the Constitution. We said it throughout the last Parliament, and we 
are repeating it again. The government is once again putting its foot in 
the door to get into other areas of jurisdiction. We are asking the 
government to comply with the Constitution of 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also asking it to repay the money taken by the Minister of 
Finance in this respect, while the rest of Canada is asking for Canada-wide 
programs and national standards from coast to coast. These two 
competing visions are irreconcilable and a sign of future jurisdictional 
battles and useless and costly frictions between Quebec and the rest of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the first ministers are gathering here in Ottawa this 
week. Let me tell you what Mr. Bouchard said yesterday at a press 
conference, when he condemned the federal government's activities in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction. Mr. Bouchard said that “instead of 
sprinkling money through new programs in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction, the Chrétien government would be better off reducing 
personal income taxes and easing off on the cuts it has been making for 
years in transfers to the provinces. The finance minister's surplus, 
said to be somewhere between $4 billion and $6 billion for 1998-99, 
should be used first and foremost to reduce taxes. Quebeckers and 
Canadians are being taxed to death. Nothing would have a more positive 
impact on families and on the economy than quick federal tax 
relief”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to him, the Canadian tax burden is a millstone 
around the neck of Canadian productivity.  Seventy-five percent of 
the surplus should go to reduce taxes by approximately $100 per 
taxpayer.  One-quarter of the remaining surplus should go to social 
expenditures, as Ottawa wants to do but through transfer payments 
to the provinces, transferring tax points instead of creating a 
series of new programs whose common denominator is interference in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ottawa the premiers want to sell the idea of creating a 
framework for federal spending powers, a mechanism through which 
new initiatives by Ottawa would have to be approved by a committee 
of provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So they created a transition fund for science and health, a 
national pharmacare program, millennium scholarships, a Canadian 
foundation for innovation, sprinkling a little money here and there 
to create new programs, just after they cut health care and slashed 
transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They wanted to cut up to $48 billion, and now they are handing 
us back a piddling $6 billion.  Instead of transferring that to the 
taxpayers who need it, they are trying to create new programs.  And 
who do you think will end up holding the bag with these programs a 
few years down the road?  The federal government's tactic is to 
pull out of these programs and leave it up to the provinces to 
administer them, although it created both the programs and the 
needs.  Then it withdraws funding.  That is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish this government would understand common sense and take 
away this tax burden it is imposing everywhere. 
What is of the most concern to me, as I tell people regularly, is 
that the government is not giving us anything.  They are just 
returning our taxes to us.  They should stop distributing their 
goodies to make us close our eyes to reality; they should stop 
sprinkling crumbs.  The people are hungry, the people want to see 
a lessening of their tax burden.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member knows he should not be 
using props in the House.  I hope he will follow Standing Orders in 
this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> Mr. Speaker, do you mean that it is 
indecent to show a government document, that it is not permitted? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> That is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> It is not indecent, but it is not permitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> Mr. Speaker, would you include that as 
part of my parliamentary apprenticeship.  I had no idea that it was 
not appropriate to show a government document in quoting it.  I 
could not have guessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her remarks, the member mentioned that her party had 
presented a dissenting opinion.  She quoted a number of sections of 
the dissenting report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, she neglected to quote an important passage of the 
opinion, which provides that, for the Bloc, the only solution for 
Quebec is either to let itself be steamrollered by the federal 
government or to get out of Canada following a referendum on 
sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is the definitive analysis of the Bloc Quebecois on 
this debate on public finances, the upcoming budget and the choices 
to be made, I would like to know how they can point to dissent 
based on the idea of having to separate from Canada while listening 
to the eminent spokespersons of the Quebec government, the minister 
of finance and even the Quebec premier say that the federal 
government cannot be allowed to destroy Canada's Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which face is the real one?  Which is the real intent? 
Do these people want to help rebuild Canada on a healthier basis or 
do they want to separate from Canada as they indicate in their 
dissenting report? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I use a professional approach in 
my work, otherwise it would more difficult for the member for 
Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies to comment on my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to withdraw from the federal system precisely because we 
have been witnessing intrusions in our areas of jurisdiction for 40 
years. For 40 years we have been asking this government to abide by the 
Constitution, which makes Quebec a people distinct from the rest of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say that we want out of Canada because we are fed up with 
these intrusions is nothing new. The hon. member should know that 
a number of premiers have complained about the federal 
government's intrusions. Remember Mr. Duplessis, who used to tell 
the federal government “give us back our loot”. As for Jean 
Lesage, he coined the expression “Maîtres chez nous”, masters 
in our own home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, we are not the first ones to condemn the centralizing attitude 
of the federal government, which wants to create a Canadian people, 
while we say we are a different people, a distinct people. We want to 
separate, we want to achieve sovereignty, but we want to do it in 
harmony with the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Resuming debate. The hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate you for the way you said the 
name of my riding, which truly represents the four regional county 
municipalities that it covers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are discussing the prebudget consultations whereby the 
government is asking the House its opinion on the report submitted by 
the parliamentary committee. I would like first of all to mention the 
consultations that I carried out in my riding, which were submitted to 
the committee and which are included in the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, I will quote some of the people who 
participated in the debate. These are people who are experiencing these 
things in their daily lives and who are in contact with the population. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT40"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT40"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1315

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Mrs. Bilocq, of the KRTB economic development 
corporation, said “The danger, after a period of economic restraint, is 
that the government will start spending again to please the 
electorate”. 
I think the federal government has clearly demonstrated that it cannot 
shed its old habits and that, as soon as it has money available, it 
cannot refrain from dishing it out in its programs in the hope of 
gaining votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>True, the Canadian federal system is rather pitiful. The federal 
government might have less visibility than it wants if it limited itself 
to its responsibilities as defined in the Constitution, but that is what 
it should be doing. 
It should ensure that it does not invest in areas where the provinces 
already have jurisdiction and where they have developed programs. What 
the provinces really want is that the money be returned to them so that 
they can invest more in their own programs and in the strategies that 
they are currently developing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can say that it is the nasty separatists who are saying this, 
but this week, unanimously, the provincial finance ministers gave a 
warning to Mr. Martin, the minister. “Ottawa must resist the temptation 
to get involved piecemeal in programs with isolated initiatives in areas 
under provincial jurisdiction like home care services and pharmacare, 
for example”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So this message is not coming from sovereignists, it is coming from 
Canada's finance ministers, who remember. If they were not there 
themselves, they remember what happened during the seventies in the 
Trudeau era. 
The federal government started to spend left and right to give its 
members more visibility, to give itself more visibility as a government, 
and the result was the financial situation we had in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That situation has now been remedied, to a large extent on the 
backs of the people who are paying employment insurance, both employers 
and employees, and also on the backs of the provinces through cuts in 
transfer payments, but the government should not revert to its old 
habits. If, in 2000, 2001 or 2002, we have to say once again that the 
federal government should not have invested in this program, that we are 
in the red once again, we will have failed to learn the lessons from the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote another person who spoke during the consultations, 
Benoît Aubut, who represents the unemployed. 
He said: “We ask that the EI benefit period and amount not longer depend 
on the financial needs of the government but rather on those of the 
workers, who pay to be covered if they lose their jobs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week, the Bloc Quebecois made a very constructive proposal. We 
have introduced six private members' bills from six different members 
clearly showing what needs to be changed in the employment insurance 
legislation. We were even so lucky as to have the support of the NDP. 
Again, this is an issue on which the big, bad separatists could have 
made suggestions that might not have been good for Canada, but as it 
turns out, members of another party sitting next to us—and I am 
referring to the NDP—also found the idea interesting because they 
have been elected to teach the government a lesson and tell the 
government: “The changes you made to the employment insurance plan one 
or two years ago are unacceptable. 
We in high unemployment areas cannot live with that because workers are 
not assured of a sufficient income between two jobs.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is another very concrete quote on a very concrete problem that 
the government should address as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By lowering EI premiums by an amount equivalent to the increase in 
CPP contributions, the government acted on part of a recommendation made 
by the Bloc. I think this must be applauded. We made this recommendation 
in committee before any other party, and the government took our lead. 
There is, however, still room for improvement in the employment 
insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About the EI reform, even though the chief actuary said that the 
system could be self-sufficient with premiums of $2 per $100 of 
insurable income, premiums will be set at $2.70 as of January 1, 1998. 
So there is a 70-cent margin of manoeuvre.  The Conservatives would 
like to see all of that used to decrease contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, on the other hand, would rather cut contributions by about 
35 cents, or half of that margin of manoeuvre, and earmark the 
other half for improving the system so that unemployment insurance 
can resume its function of stabilizing the economies of high 
unemployment regions and become a true tool in the battle against 
poverty.  That is all we hear about these days, the battle against 
poverty, against child poverty.  The federal government absolutely 
wants to have a cheque with a nice Canada flag in the corner, 
whereas there is a proper way of doing things, with tools over 
which it has complete control, and over which it would have full 
jurisdiction.  We could talk about that this afternoon and tomorrow 
morning if that is the hon. members' wish.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance program could be modified and its 
human face restored, making it into something which could, for 
instance, eliminate the so-called spring gap.  With the new reform, 
few seasonal workers can get employment insurance to tide them over 
for the entire period they are without work until they start up 
again the following year.  We want to see that corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want to see the intensity rule done away with, which 
reduces rates by 1% each time 20 weeks of employment insurance is 
used. 
That was part of the principle of the former Minister of Human 
Resources Development, but he got the message—very emphatically—on 
June 2, 1997, when the people of his riding told him that, no, 
they could not live with such a thing, that it offended their 
dignity, that they no longer wanted a minister who was capable of 
doing such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the government, which will be producing its legislative 
progress report within a few days, not have addressed the real 
problem? The first message it got in the June 2 federal election 
was that the high-unemployment regions are seriously dissatisfied 
with the employment insurance program imposed upon them.  Budget 
choices will have to be made.  We are debating pre-budget 
consultations and I trust the government will be capable of heeding 
what has been said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people we heard from in committee on November 12, 1997, 
also told us that it was important that those who have contributed 
the most to bringing down the deficit should be the ones to benefit 
from the fiscal dividend.  Here again, the reference is to EI 
premiums, but also to provinces that have had to manage with cuts 
in transfer payments.  It was not their idea to make these cuts, 
but they are the ones who have to live with them, who have to 
contend with the impact on hospitals, CLSCs, home-care services. 
Many of the decisions taken were the result of these cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, many social stakeholders did not make extravagant demands. 
They want the money to go towards existing programs.  They told us, 
for instance, to use it to consolidate existing organizations and 
to resist the temptation to woo voters by creating new programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday again, this was brought home to us in caucus.  We 
heard from Canadian women's groups, who told us that what they want 
is not money to duplicate provincial programs, but satisfactory 
funding for women's groups in Canada.  The present government 
should listen carefully to this request because it is another way 
to fight poverty.  If children are poor, then you can be sure that 
many women in Canada are poor as well. They must have the means to 
escape this poverty, and be represented and be able to conduct 
their lives with dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in my riding also tell me they do not want to see more 
federal interference in provincial areas of jurisdiction, because 
this leaves the public confused and always trying to get the best 
deal.  People are not stupid.  They have seen what has been going 
on for the last 25 or 30 years.  I will conclude on this. 
People have been perfectly aware of the competition between the two 
levels of government over the years, and they want no more of it. 
They want each level of government to stick to its own area of 
jurisdiction until such time as there can be just one level of 
government.  In addition, when they elect representatives, they 
want to be able to know exactly who is responsible and that they 
can re-elect the government they have chosen, or not re-elect it, 
in the knowledge that they are fully responsible for their choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the fundamental reasons we want to leave this 
madhouse.  The Canadian federal system has resulted in such 
confusion in Canada that voters are unable to make logical choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we should listen to what the public is saying. 
Each of us should take his or her responsibilities and the federal 
government should mind its own business.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Party politics aside, I would like to make a few comments and ask 
a question to the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this debate on issues which may enable the government to come up 
with a more rational budget, one that will better meet the needs of our 
fellow Canadians, the hon. member said a number of times that people 
told him this or that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the latest surveys, given that our colleagues in the Bloc 
continue to constitutionalize things here in the House of Commons 
and given that 86% of the people of Quebec are saying they have had 
their fill of the endless constitutional debates, does not, in 
fact, what we call Quebec's ambivalence concern the fact that what 
we put forward in the latest election campaign, the so-called 
Canadian pact, with the objectives of meeting the real needs of 
Canadians, not require us, rather than saying we are going to scrap 
one government and improve another, do people not recognize in this 
approach, in its ambivalence, which may not really exist, the fact 
that, when they find the two governments unsatisfactory, they can 
still, through their representatives define their priorities with 
one of the two governments and call for a consensus with the two 
levels of government to act in areas they consider important, such 
as industry, tourism, highway infrastructures and other urgent 
matters? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers' common sense dictates that a balance be struck between 
the two levels of government. When 86% of Quebeckers tell us they are 
sick and tired of hearing about the Constitution left and right day 
after day, I think this means that we, as elected representatives, must 
try to act rationally, decide together what our priorities should be for 
each level of government and, if at all possible, put all available 
resources behind achieving objectives that they hold dear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can fake it only so far. In 1993, the Bloc Quebecois said it 
would get elected to hold real power. That is quite interesting. What is 
real power? 
Let us see the facts in two columns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> You should talk, with your five members in

Chicoutimi. That is reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my hon. colleague what is more important: to 
try to bring down one government or another or to try to set our main 
priorities together in such a way that we can meet them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems funny, but it is sad, 
because the speech I just heard is what my father used to say to me 
in the 1960s.  The Conservative slant, the new joint management 
slant.  It is the same bloody system with the federal government 
running the show.

reached 49.4% last time, and we are carrying on the democratic 
battle.  More and more Quebeckers understand that the federal 
system does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is going to be another two day federal-provincial 
conference, where the federal government's centralizing power, as 
soon as money becomes available, will again want to put it 
somewhere, which is the very same formula as the Conservatives'. 
The Conservatives' joint management approach was not, in the last 
election program, chosen by the majority  of Quebeckers as far as 
I know.  They have 5 members in Quebec, while the Bloc Quebecois 
has 44.  That is the quantifiable and official result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I agree I must conclude my response, but the 
comment took time.  I can tell you that the greatest service 
Quebeckers and Canadians can offer each other is to decide to 
resolve the constitutional debate so that in the future we can 
debate social and economic choices and no longer need to deal with 
the issue of the country's architecture.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
sharing my time this afternoon with the hon. member for Kitchener 
Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am grateful for the opportunity to address the House today on 
the finance committee's report, an initiative in which I have 
been actively involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let me say that I am very proud to be the vice-chair of 
the finance committee, one which worked under the direction of 
the member for Vaughan—King—Aurora and with Canadians from 
coast to coast to coast to ensure that the Minister of Finance 
has a clear presentation of Canadians' priorities, values and 
expectations for the upcoming budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This prebudget consultation is evidence that once again the 
Liberal government has delivered on its promise to provide 
Canadians with good government, to provide Canadians with a 
government that listens and then acts, a government that involves 
Canadians in the process so that the very people who are affected 
by government policies are actually there and choosing these new 
priorities for the economic realities and providing the very 
recommendations on how to achieve those new realities. This 
involvement of all Canadians in the decision making process 
ensures that we have the benefit of their knowledge, their 
experience and that we achieve the best possible outcomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike previous years, this year's prebudget consultations 
centred around the fact that Canadians for the first time in 
decades will not be faced with a deficit.  On October 15 the 
finance minister announced that no later than 1998-1999 fiscal 
year we would begin this new era which presents Canadians with 
new choices and challenges.  The country cheered. This dialogue 
and this optimism carried throughout the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each of our meetings in the provincial capitals and here in 
Ottawa I was encouraged to hear that Canadians are more 
optimistic about their own futures and the futures of their 
children and grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of our international performance we heard that 
Canadians have a positive outlook about our future as a nation 
and as a world leader. There is no doubt that this optimism is 
the product of the Liberal government's actions to set a new 
course for Canada, to eliminate the deficit and to restore 
Canada's fiscal health.  This optimism arises from the fact that 
Canadians know that at long last they have a government that 
cares about their priorities and is working co-operatively to 
ensure that all Canadians have an improved quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the committee heard time and time again, Canadians approve of 
the direction the government has taken and understand the 
decisions that have been made. Canadians have made sacrifices and 
they have supported the government's focus over the last four 
years on eliminating that deficit, on restoring fiscal health and 
at the same time making positive targeted measures to improve the 
quality of life for Canadians. 
They know that this renewed focus, this changed focus in fact 
will ensure that present and future generations have room to move 
and react to situations as they arise.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was built on principles of sharing, caring, fairness and 
equity.  These are the parameters within which we held our 
debate.  In preparing the report the finance committee considered 
more than 500 witnesses and 450 written briefs.  These 
appearances and submissions coupled with the town hall meetings 
held by many of my colleagues in this House make this the most 
extensive prebudget consultation session ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own riding of Burlington, Ontario more than 60 people 
joined with me for a good evening's discussion about the issues. 
I was overwhelmed by their enthusiasm and creativity with which 
they tackled this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps most interesting to me is the reaffirmation of the 
sense of balance that Canadians have and want.  Participants in 
Burlington and across Canada focused on the importance of 
decreasing the debt, ensuring that we have increased financial 
security and stability, and at the same time Canadians wanted 
increased investment in Canada's greatest resource, its people. 
They want the government to invest in research in preparing 
Canadians for the future economy. They want investment in health 
care and children. Children deserve to have every and equal 
opportunity to succeed in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance committee heard from Canadians on how to find that 
balance, to protect Canadians of today and provide for Canadians 
of tomorrow.  In making our recommendations members of the 
finance committee dealt with three main options available to 
them, to use the surplus to further reduce the debt, to introduce 
a major tax cut as was done with mixed reviews in Ontario, and to 
increase spending on social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House I am sure are interested to know that the 
answers from Canadians were that they feel very strongly about 
maintaining the programs we have which they have come to count 
on, but more often than not and in a very large measure Canadians 
lent their support to reducing the debt first and foremost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own riding 87% of the people at our meeting were in favour 
of reducing the debt, leaving a small percentage of people who 
supported an across the board tax cut.  In further discussing 
these ideas however it appears that Canadians wanted this 
investment and support in social programs for health care, for 
education, support for those in our communities in need, for 
fairness for seniors and those who are disabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the things that make us uniquely Canadian.  Canadians 
supported our job creation focus, our emphasis over the last few 
years on getting the environment right so that job creation will 
occur and focusing on youth employment opportunities and on the 
infrastructure program.  They hope this job creation focus will 
continue because too many Canadians still are lacking that 
opportunity which they need to make sure they can provide for 
their families and to contribute to our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four years of responsible government have produced positive 
results.  As we all know the numbers, more than 1,012,000 have 
been created.  Our commitment continues in ensuring that every 
Canadian who wants a job will have that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally the finance committee's recommendations reflect the 
need to maintain fiscal prudence and at the same time to invest 
in those initiatives that meet the social and economic needs of 
Canadians, including enhanced debt reduction, continued targeted 
tax relief, increased investment in science and technology and 
health care, as well as the urgent need to reduce child poverty 
and youth unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far too many very low income people in Canada are paying taxes. 
While we have delivered targeted tax relief, while we have 
enhanced the working income supplement, we must continue in this 
vein to take that pressure off.  We have that recommendation on 
the surtax.  While it was perhaps misunderstood by some of the 
people who reported on it, it was across the board that this 
surtax was being charged and we must begin to deliver that 
relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many presenters talked about the brain drain and the lack of 
research opportunities that exist for Canadian young people at 
home.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also talked about the precarious position we are putting 
ourselves in as an economy vis-à-vis other nations in that we 
must ensure we are making the investment for the future in those 
high tech industries and businesses that are making way for all 
Canadians.  The innovation fund has done great things but we have 
to enhance that culture of investment and research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians have made sacrifices to ensure Canada's fiscal 
health and independence are restored.  I want to thank them for 
that.  I thank all the people who were involved in this process 
of prebudget consultation:  my colleagues in the House of 
Commons, those on the finance committee, the staff of the finance 
committee, in particular our clerk and researchers and, most 
important, our committee chair, the member for 
Vaughan—King—Aurora.  His staff deserves the credit for 
ensuring the report was co-ordinated, for ensuring the <I>t</I>s 
were crossed and the <I>i</I>s dotted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank those Canadians who participated in the committee 
hearings in the cities where I had the pleasure of chairing the 
meetings, Regina, Winnipeg, Montreal, Fredericton and 
Charlottetown, and especially in Burlington.  Presenters shared 
with us their very personal experiences and their incredible 
expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my colleagues from all parties who listened with great care 
in those meetings and who asked thoughtful questions, the pace 
was somewhat intense but the spirit of co-operation and of shared 
purpose was excellent.  The results of the work of this committee 
speak for themselves.  Canadians have a unique opportunity now. 
They appreciate that opportunity and they have told us very 
clearly what their priorities and values are.  We encourage the 
minister to pay attention to the report and to implement those 
suggestions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a quick question for the hon. member.  On behalf of some of 
the constituents I have talked to I would like a little help 
regarding math.  I used to teach math and I am having a problem 
with this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 there were 1.5 million people unemployed.  In 1997 
approximately 1.3 million people are unemployed.  It sounds like 
we have had a net increase of about 200,000.  We hear this all 
the time, we have created over a million jobs, aren't we 
wonderful?  Could the member explain why we still have 
approximately the same amount of people unemployed today that we 
had in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure I understood 
the member's question.  Perhaps it was my interpretation of the 
math.  I think he suggested that 1.5 million were unemployed in 
1993 and that 1.3 million are unemployed now.  Then he suggested 
that was an increase.  Could he clarify that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there were 1.5 million 
unemployed in 1993 and there are 1.3 million unemployed in 1997. 
That means 200,000 jobs have been filled. Not over a million, but 
200,000 jobs have been filled.  Therefore it has come down from 
1.5 million to 1.3 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad the member 
clarified that point.  Earlier he implied there was an increase 
in unemployment instead of a decrease.  He needs to recognize 
that the economy has grown, that there are more Canadians in the 
workplace as we have more generations graduating from university 
and more citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers speak for themselves.  Over one million jobs have 
been created in this country and there has been a decrease in the 
overall unemployment rate across the board for Canadians.  In 
Burlington the unemployment rate is somewhere around 7% or 
better.  There are opportunities at home and abroad. Burlington 
residents and many residents across Canada feel a willingness and 
optimism in going after new markets and new opportunities.  This 
is demonstrated by the prime minister's terrific Team Canada 
missions and our focus on increased opportunity in the very 
competitive international market.  These missions have 
demonstrated that Canadians can compete and will continue to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the member to look at those numbers again and to 
keep that math straight.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the report that was obtained, and written up in Sunday's 
<I>Citizen</I> and yesterday's <I>Le Devoir</I>, it says that the government also 
knows that Canada is far from being the best country in the world 
as far as growth and development are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With research and higher education shown in this report to be 
extremely important for future development, how can the member 
explain that this government has made cuts to education and to 
research and innovation budgets?  Their recommendation is for a 
gradual increase, when needs are acute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we learn from this study ordered from on high by the 
government is that, although Canada appears to have high growth, it 
is growth that does little to increase productivity.  Even Canada 
is down in relative productivity, with the result that the standard 
of living is dropping.  If radical changes are not made, Canada is 
going to find itself in an extremely difficult situation—

member's comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was definitely a call for increased spending on research. 
Canada needs to do more to focus on that innovative economy.  We 
heard it in Montreal, in Toronto and all across the country.  I 
firmly believe in that. Many people in my riding are dependent on 
that research.  They are fulfilling the research requirements of 
the nation.  They are encouraging the country to do more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had to make some tough decisions over the last few 
years, but we have still managed to have the best country for all 
Canadians to live in.  We will—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as the federal representative of the constituents of 
Kitchener Centre and as a member of the House of Commons Standing 
Committee on Finance, it is a pleasure to take part in the 
prebudget debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 13 I held a town hall meeting in Kitchener to gather 
input from my constituents.  Throughout the months of October and 
November the finance committee held 42 meetings totalling 101 
hours.  It heard 514 witnesses and received 463 briefs on this 
subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the chair's challenge to all 301 members of 
Parliament to hold public consultations, 35 town hall meetings 
were held as well as the one which I held in Kitchener Centre. In 
addition, we received personal comments over the website for the 
finance minister, as well as several phone calls and many 
letters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to acknowledge the hard work of my colleagues on 
both sides of the House, the fair hearing we heard from witnesses 
and the sincere and thoughtful participation by all members of 
the finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message was heard loud and clear both at my town hall 
meeting and during the committee meetings we held across the 
country.  We heard many things from Vancouver to St. John's. Some 
strong themes came through.  We heard from a diverse range of 
individuals with different concerns.  We heard from economists 
who told us that we needed to look at debt reduction. In Alberta 
we heard from a disabled woman who was forced to choose between 
food and medicine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Keeping the Balance” is a reflection of what we heard.  This 
government is committed to maintaining a balance between the 
collective good and freedom while providing for those in need. 
This government has shown leadership in consulting with 
Canadians.  There has been widespread support for the prudent 
estimates put forth by the Minister of Finance.  Canadians would 
rather err on the side of prudence than find themselves in a 
situation similar to the one in which we found ourselves in 1993.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we are now in a position, after having reduced our 
economic deficit, to address the outstanding human deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Finance said during his presentation to the 
committee, this is not simply a question of budgets and their 
size.  It is a question also of what government does and how it 
does it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate should be about national priorities, about how best 
to build a strong economy and a strong society, one of both 
opportunity and security. Some see the discussion as a financial 
debate only, but it is not.  It is also a debate about values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many recommendations were made to the committee which are 
reflected in “Keeping the Balance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an intriguing correlation that emerged from the 
remarks the minister made in Vancouver and the comments and 
concerns that were echoed to our committee as we travelled across 
Canada and also ones very similar to those that I heard from my 
constituents in Kitchener Centre. I would like to review a few of 
these issues.  Time and time again, some of these themes rose 
throughout our process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is known worldwide for our health system and the 
integrity we have placed in maintaining the five principles of 
the Canada Health Act. Our treasured health care system was 
created because there was a need.  Canadians are telling us these 
needs have grown due to our aging population among other factors. 
To address this need, the government should establish in 
co-operation with the provinces, health care providers and local 
communities new approaches to health care such as a national home 
care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has done much to address the needs of the 
disabled in the community.  However, much remains to be done.  I 
believe we must continue working with groups representing persons 
with disabilities to ensure that measures recently announced are 
effective and to find further ways of helping Canadians with 
disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been hearing cries for action to curb child poverty, to 
ensure Canadian children are not going hungry.  This government 
has put in place a number of safeguards. However, we still have 
hungry children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In partnership with communities, parents, provincial 
governments, private corporations, the agri-food industry and 
volunteer organizations such as the Canadian Living Foundation, 
we can create a national school nutrition program.  This type of 
partnership approach could apply to other organizations and 
initiatives as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In communities across Canada, people are concerned about our 
youth. The ministerial task force on youth in 1996 made a number 
of recommendations which Canadians would like to see endorsed. 
The committee heard about them. We are pleased to recommend that 
additional funding be made available for the Youth Service Canada 
and student summer job creation programs, both of which provide 
opportunities for youth to enter the workforce and offer valuable 
work experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In keeping with improving the future of our youth, we have 
recommended a deferred credit formula for registered education 
savings plans which would offer student beneficiaries a federal 
grant calculated on a percentage of the total RESP contributions. 
This grant would be distributed in equal amounts in each year of 
the post-secondary program.  This would create an incentive for 
parents to plan for their children's education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The incredible debt burden weighing on the shoulders of many 
recent graduates from post-secondary institutions can take many 
years to pay, sometimes impeding their ability to enter the job 
market. That is why I support the recommendation that the federal 
and provincial governments offer students a debt repayment 
schedule that is based on income with features that would include 
interest relief, deferred grants and debt forgiveness. This would 
go a long way in reducing the burden on youth entering the 
workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very few individuals we heard from during our consultations 
called for income tax cuts at this time.  Their priority lay in 
stabilizing our economy.  However it was suggested that we 
increase the basic personal non-refundable tax credits amount, 
the spousal amount and the equivalent to spousal amount for the 
1998 taxation year. I support this recommendation.  In future 
when the fiscal situation improves and permits, I strongly 
support reintroducing indexation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From coast to coast we heard Canadians asking for a reduction in 
employment insurance premiums to balance the upcoming increase in 
CPP payments to ease the load on small business owners. 
This is one recommendation on which the finance minister has 
already acted. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1355"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 21, in co-operation with the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, the Minister of Finance announced the 
second largest drop in EI payments in 20 years, to $2.70 per $100 
of insurable earnings for 1998, 20¢ below the 1997 rate.  This is 
a savings of $1.4 billion for employers and employees.  With a 
promise of lower rates when the economic climate permits and to 
take measures to ensure EI premiums are not raised during an 
economic downturn, this will offer Canadians greater stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An additional request from small business owners is to review 
the small business deduction and the appropriateness of the 
$200,000 threshold level.  This is in keeping with the 
government's intention to offer targeted tax relief.  It is 
important that we recognize this need to enable small businesses 
to grow and prosper in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last but certainly not the least of the recommendations I 
would like to cover today is the investment in the future of our 
research and development sector.  In my mind this includes 
medical research, technological advancement, academic and 
cultural development.  There are so many facets to our social 
make-up that require the support of continuing development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the support and partnership of the federal government, I 
look forward to seeing our commitment to research and development 
grow.  It is through these commitments that we will keep our 
knowledge based industries in Canada.  The result will mean that 
our society will gain both economically and socially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I have only grazed the surface of the results of 
the consultations.  However, one thing is clear.  Canadians are 
proud of the leadership of this government and the hard decisions 
that it has made.  There is a widespread sense of relief that the 
deficit has been wrestled down.  Canadians have told us that they 
are prepared to see strategic and responsible investments in 
areas where it will be demonstrated there is value for the 
dollars spent. This government aims to do that through our 50:50 
plan of investment and debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the recommendations call for increased co-operation and 
partnership between levels of government and the private and 
voluntary sectors.  I feel strongly about partnerships. This 
government has placed great value and energy in building and 
maintaining healthy partnerships which will enable these visions 
to become a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to working on restoring and keeping 
the balance. This document is one step forward in that process.

of special investigations, he had a most impressive record of 
deporting war crime suspects from the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must not be, nor be seen as, a haven for war criminals 
and I am proud to say that the government of which I am a member 
is taking action to correct a problem that has gone on for too 
long.  I would like to welcome Mr. Sher to Canada and I wish him 
success in his attempts to rid our country of people who have 
committed unspeakable crimes against humanity.

the premiers are unanimous that the federal government should stop 
spending on new programs in provincial areas of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judging by the panic of the federal ministers of finance and 
intergovernmental affairs yesterday, Quebec and the provinces have 
hit a nerve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Finance admit that, through its arrogant

<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois has only to look at the areas in which 
we have invested.  The first thing the government did was to put 
$1.5 billion into the Canada social transfer, and it did so at the 
request of the provinces.  We invested $850 million, to be matched 
by a similar amount in a second stage, according to the Minister of 
Human Resources Development, at the request of the provinces.  We 
invested in infrastructures at the request of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A look at what the Canadian government has done—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Finance is again telling us that he invested $6 
billion in just a few years when, instead of cutting $48 billion, 
he cut $42 billion.  His math is interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is how can the federal government still claim to 
have the monopoly on being able to interpret what the public is

the federal government alone that is right about what to do with 
the fiscal dividend? 
<P><A NAME="LINK156"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the member talks about unanimity.  When we look at the initiative 
of the Minister of Human Resources Development with respect to the 
national child benefit, the provinces were certainly all for that. 
When we look at the infrastructure program, that was at the request 
of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, if the member wants to talk about unanimity, he should 
have been with me at the meeting of finance ministers.  He would 
have seen that the priorities of the Canadian government, the 
priorities of the provinces, and the priorities of Canadians are 
the same:  child poverty, health, training, human resources, 
research and development.  The priority is to build the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Finance.  All the evidence points to the 
fact that the federal government cannot resist the temptation to 
sprinkle the anticipated fiscal dividend here and there, despite 
the consensus of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government has that much difficulty resisting 
temptation, is it not because it is constantly seeking to justify 
its existence and sees going over the heads of the provinces and 
delivering services directly to the population as an easy way of 
doing so? 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, from the 
minister's replies it is obvious that the dice were stacked from 
the start, the decisions have already been made, and if the 
provinces do not bow to the federal government's point of view, the 
conference will be a failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that case, what is the point of the provincial premiers

not from Canadian taxpayers.

aboriginal Canadians, Canadians who want to invest in research

see their pensions cut, and Canadians who believe in medicare.

other business to conduct.  We are going to have tributes now to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to one of our former colleagues, the late Antonio 
Yanakis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A former Liberal member for the riding of 
Berthier—Maskinongé—Lanaudière, in Quebec, he very actively 
represented his constituents, who renewed their confidence in him 
over almost 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was always very close to his family, who has joined us today. 
It is therefore with sadness that we say farewell today to Antonio 
Yanakis, a man devoted to his constituents, who represented them in this 
House, a man valued by his colleagues throughout his career in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Government of Canada, I extend my deepest 
condolences to his children and family.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I too would like to add my condolences on the passing of Antonio 
Yanakis.  Mr. Yanakis was born on July 6, 1922 in Montreal.  He 
achieved a Bachelor of Commerce at McGill University.  He was 
very active in politics for over 20 years.  He was the mayor of 
Ville Saint-Gabriel from 1961 to 1963 and was elected to the 
House of Commons in 1965. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He presented himself very well in many of the committees of this 
House, including the agricultural committee, forestry and crown 
corporations.  He was a Knight of Columbus and a member of 
numerous service clubs in his community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this House regret the passing of Antonio Yanakis and pass 
along our sincere regrets to his family and friends.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 
New Democratic Party, I would like to extend our sympathies to the 
family of Antonio Yanakis, who passed away a few days ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Yanakis was first elected in 1965 and re-elected five times. I 
clearly recall that Mr. Yanakis was here when I was elected in 1968, 
because he had just been re-elected. He went on to be re-elected in 
1972, 1974, 1979 and 1980. If I remember correctly, he was the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour at the time. He was a 
fine politician, who represented his constituents very well for 15 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like, once again, to extend our condolences to his family. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not know Mr. 
Yanakis personally. I arrived here in 1984. As mentioned earlier, Mr. 
Yanakis was a member of Parliament from 1965 to 1984. He was first 
elected at the age of 43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took time to read his first speech in the House of Commons. No 
one will be surprised to learn that he loved his riding of 
Berthier—Maskinongé—Lanaudière, which he described as a region 
of beautiful mountains and vast forests, with hundreds of lakes 
where summer visitors can relax in a beautiful setting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said “as you probably know, I am the first Canadian of 
Greek origin to be elected to the Parliament of Canada, and in an almost 
exclusively French Canadian riding. 
This would indicate that Quebec is far from displaying the fanaticism it 
is sometimes accused of”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Yanakis stressed Quebec's dynamism. He said that “the new, 
dynamic Quebec wants to be a leader and help shape a new and proud 
Canada. It is in the full respect of the rights of both official groups, 
anglophones and francophones, that Canadians are asking us to speak on 
behalf of the new Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Progressive-Conservative Party of Canada, and on 
my own behalf, I wish to offer our most sincere condolences to all those 
who knew Mr. Yanakis, particularly his family and friends. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, I too would like to say a few words, 
because I knew Antonio Yanakis. Incidentally, his family is here with us 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Yanakis was first elected nine years before me, and we met for 
the first time in 1974. We worked together until 1984. I do not really 
remember whether he retired at the time, or whether he was defeated. In 
any case, we were troopers together in the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when I was the chairman of the Liberal caucus 
and Tony Yanakis was the treasurer.  He was the one who had to 
raise the money so things could go on in the caucus. I found him 
to be a very warm person.  I found him to be very reliable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know that I could call myself among his closest 
friends, but I revelled in the fact that I knew him well.  We 
travelled together in Geneva where he represented Canada.  At 
that time, I was brand new to the international scene, but he was 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tony Yanakis I found had a warmth about him that endeared him to 
all of us who served with him in this House.  It can be said I 
think fairly that after having served this country, after having 
served his province, after having served his municipality so well 
for so many years, he should be saluted by us here in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was one of us.  He was a parliamentarian of Canada and you, 
his family who are here today, have every right to feel the pride 
of your father, of your father-in-law, of your real friend that 
all of us felt for him as a parliamentarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who knew him well miss him very much and we give you 
our most heartfelt condolences.  We wish you welcome, also, to 
this place where he served us, where he served you and where he 
served Canadians for two decades.  I thank you in the name of 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I think it might be a question of privilege. 
I will hear it.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PRIVILEGE 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will leave to your capable judgment whether it is. 
I do raise this as a question of privilege of which I have given 
you notice today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 8, the Department of Revenue updated its website 
concerning payroll deductions and has published new tables 
reflecting those changes proposed in Bill C-2 as if those rates 
were now law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are found at website WWW.RC.GC.ca/menuemenuHSA.HTML.  The 
House has passed and sent to the Senate Bill C-2, as members are 
well aware, which amends the law respecting the Canada pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, no message has been received from the Senate concerning 
the passage of this bill.  The Senate is capable of protecting 
its own privilege in this case, however the House is also seized 
with the issue since the content of Bill C-2 is not settled until 
both Houses have agreed on the final content and royal assent has 
been granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is still open to the Senate to remit this bill to the House 
for consideration of amendments, including the alteration of 
those matters that the government is publishing as though they 
are now law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By publishing these tables before the enactment of Bill C-2, the 
government seeks to preclude this House from any consideration of 
amendments that the Senate might remit as a result of its 
deliberations.  I submit that this constitutes a contempt of the 
Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the Speaker's attention to page 226 of the second edition 
of Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I> which 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contempt cannot be codified:  Contempt has no limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why it is said that the “privileges” of the House 
cannot be exhaustively codified; there are many acts or omissions 
that might occur where the House would feel compelled to find 
that a contempt has taken place, even though such acts or 
omissions do not amount to an attack on or disregard for any of 
the enumerated rights and immunities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further on the same page, it states as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Speaker said, “—the dimension of contempt of Parliament 
is such that the House will not be constrained in finding a 
breach of privilege of Members, or of the House.  This is 
precisely the reason that, while our privileges are defined, 
contempt of the House has no limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When new ways are found to interfere with our proceedings, so 
too will the House, in appropriate cases, be able to find that a 
contempt of the House has occurred. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you will also want to refer to the ruling of 
Speaker Fraser on October 10, 1989.  At that time, the Speaker 
warned the government that he would not treat similar situations 
lightly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you yourself have made a similar ruling at least 
twice in this session. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT64"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT64"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1515

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, it is my submission to you that the time has come 
for the Chair to adopt the doctrine set out at page 227 of 
Maingot: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the final analysis, in areas of doubt, the Speaker asks 
simply:  Does the act complained of appear at first sight to be a 
breach of privilege—or, to put it shortly, has the Member an 
arguable point?  If the Speaker feels any doubt on the question, 
he should leave it to the House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will not abuse the time of this House. The 
precedents are before you and are known to you and indeed in this 
Parliament you have dealt with this issue, I would suggest. Your 
ruling cautioned the officials of the Department of Finance in 
that instance.  Now I would suggest the disease has spread to the 
department of revenue.  Obviously your admonition has carried 
little weight with the government and those public officials 
concerned with the electronic publication of this table at the 
web site which I have placed before you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This matter should be put to the House through Mr. Speaker and 
considered as an abuse of Parliament by this government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. House leader for the Conservative Party has 
raised an interesting point.  However, I would suggest that you 
reserve judgment on this point until you are able to hear from 
the minister in question or his parliamentary secretary.  They 
are not in the House at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I might observe that Bill C-2 arises out of 
an agreement between the Government of Canada and at least eight 
of the provinces, published and made known before the 
legislation was brought forward in this House.  I do not think 
anybody has ever suggested that under these circumstances 
information arising out of or from the agreement between the 
federal government and the provinces being made known to the 
public constitutes a breech of privilege because it comes forward 
before the implementing legislation has become law in totality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, I would like to suggest that if in its wisdom the 
other place decides to amend Bill C-2, frankly the hon. member 
has not made out a case as to why the web site in question would 
in any way prevent the other place from amending the bill and 
sending it back here for our consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Mr. Speaker, I invite you to consider, whatever the 
weight of the hon. member's argument, whether you can act on the 
matter because he did not, as far as I could hear, end his 
intervention by offering to move or in fact moving the 
appropriate motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank both the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and the Deputy Prime Minister for 
their views on this question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough brings up 
points that were raised earlier in the year.  I have ruled on 
matters similar to this one.  However, I want to take the advice 
of the Deputy Prime Minister in this regard.  I would like to 
hear from the minister involved in this question of privilege.  I 
am going to reserve judgment on this until I can get more 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, as far as I know, this is our last day of business 
here today, which I think is official now.  I will have a look at 
all the information that I can gather between now and our 
return to Parliament.  At that time, if it is necessary, I will 
come back to the House with a decision after I have gleaned 
enough information about it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for York South—Weston is

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
before question period the hon. member for Kitchener Centre 
addressed the House on the pre-budget debate.  During the debate 
a couple of opposition members indicated that the report of the 
Standing Committee on Finance on the pre-budget consultation was 
some sort of a trick and that it represented merely the 
government platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kitchener Centre is a member of that committee, 
travelled with the committee and participated fully in the 
process.  It would be helpful for Canadians to understand the 
genesis of the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listened to all sectors of society when we travelled from 
Vancouver to Edmonton, Toronto, Halifax and St. John's as well as 
to my own riding of Kitchener Centre.  I heard from people who 
are street people.  I heard from people who I know share the 
philosophy of some members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They appreciated that we had paid down the deficit.  They were 
looking for leadership from the government, which I think we have 
provided in a resounding way by achieving a balance in the report 
of the finance standing committee in which all members 
participated, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also we heard from them that there was very little desire for a 
cross the board tax cut.  People were looking for strategic 
investments.  The member will see those recommendations in the 
finance committee report. 
<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have a 
comment, and the member may want to respond to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She used the same phrase the Liberals use over and over and 
over.  It is not a correct way of stating the situation.  She 
talked of paying down the deficit.  That is physically impossible 
because a deficit is an amount of money that was borrowed.  It is 
true that the Liberal government is now borrowing less, so it has 
reduced the deficit.  It is borrowing less but that has nothing 
to do with paying the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member acknowledge and tell Canadians that the 
government has in fact increased the debt but at a slower rate by 
reducing the rate of borrowing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member 
opposite for pointing out that there is a deficit and there is a 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether or not we want to argue semantics, the reality is the 
government has taken a huge burden off the backs of both our 
children and our grandchildren by maintaining a balance, a fiscal 
balance, so that we can move forward and we can strategically 
reinvest in this great country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK274"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I wish the Reform Party were as concerned about poverty 
as it is concerned about the definitions of the deficit and the 
debt.  Then maybe we would have a bit less poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member across the way mentioned that Canadians were proud. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It depends on where one is living.  In the Atlantic provinces 
Canadians are certainly not proud of the Liberal government. 
Atlantic Canadians are very poor.  They have been slashed, cut, 
abused and reused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the member opposite think about the way the government 
has been working?  Does she really agree with the poverty that 
has been caused by her government in the last few years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member 
opposite for her question.  It was incredible to go across the 
country to listen to the people in Saint John talk about living 
on $89 a month of welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member that poverty is too high.  I agree with 
her that student debt is a huge issue.  There has been a human 
cost which we heard about in spades when we travelled across the 
country.  However, I would also underscore that if we had not 
made these difficult decisions and we had not achieved this 
balance we could not then redress these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now in a position where we can make meaningful decisions 
about reinvesting. 
<P><A NAME="LINK275"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
with interest to my hon. friend who detailed very accurately that 
the finance committee travelled extensively.  It met with many 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After reading the report carefully I wonder whether or not the 
committee listened to the people with whom it met.  Much of what 
I heard people from coast to coast to coast say is not reflected 
very accurately in the report.  I would not say it is not 
reflected at all.  That would be silly.  I think it is called 
keeping the balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard that the country was not in balance, that it was out of 
kilter, and that the weights were a bit lopsided.  For some 
Canadians things are going incredibly well.  I know my hon. 
friend is very serious in her work and would agree that for many 
Canadians life has actually never been better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For bankers and those holding bank stock today, man alive, this 
is as good as it gets.  The stock market is skyrocketing.  A lot 
of people are saying that exports are up and they have never done 
better. It is actually true that many Canadians will have a 
fantastic holiday.  There will be champagne corks on Bay Street 
and on main streets of the country, wherever there are financial 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chartered banks are booming with historically high profits. 
Another set of banks are doing a booming business, the nearly 
1,000 food banks across the country.  We should be embarrassed 
this afternoon, speaking in the House of Commons and knowing that 
there are nearly 1,000 food banks.  In fact they have serious 
problems because there is not enough food for hungry people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 1.4 million children living in poverty.  Only one 
industrialized nation has a worse record than Canada's and that 
is the United States.  We are second from the bottom in terms of 
accepting the reality that there are poor children in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We are behind Albania. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  My friend says “We are behind 
Albania”.  I do not think we should compare ourselves with 
Albania.  Of the western industrialized nations we are second 
from the bottom.  We have been there for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government doing about it?  Have things improved in 
the last year?  Have things improved in the last two or three 
years?  They have worsened over that time.  Since 1989 more than 
half a million children have been added to the rolls of children 
living in poverty.   This is bordering on immorality.  This is 
simply unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect some of my friends will say that this is inevitable 
when we are trying to get the fundamentals in order.  We hear 
that regularly.  This is one fundamental that we do not have in 
order. When there are 1.4 million children living in poverty this 
afternoon, and the number will have grown by the time the weekend 
is over, that is not a country with its fundamentals in order.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the government will say that it has balanced the books. 
We will know the books have been balanced properly when all 
Canadians can balance their own books, and that is not the case 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not rest easy because to accept this number of young 
people living in poverty is wrong.  It is not to say that this is 
necessary.  In some countries there are no poor children.  In 
some western industrialized nations a poor child cannot be found. 
The reason a poor child cannot be found is that there are no 
poor parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Where is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Norway and Denmark.  No poor children 
are living in the country of Denmark today, not a one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You are wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  I challenge the Liberal member who is 
challenging me.  Let the record show that my Liberal friend is 
saying that I am wrong, that there are poor children living in 
the country of Denmark.  There are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends opposite do not even know the facts.  They do not 
know the reality.  They are saying that all countries have poor 
children.  Not all countries have poor children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when we kicked off our hearings with my hon. friends. 
They are honourable friends; they take their work seriously. They 
worked hard and they met with all sorts of people. I wonder if 
they listened, however.  The Minister of Finance kicked off the 
hearings by saying that we have now cut up our credit card. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to resolve the deficit crisis if it is simply passed 
on to everybody else, if it is passed on to students.  The 
average student debt is more than $25,000.  It is easy to get rid 
of a deficit problem by asking everybody else to take out four or 
five extra credit cards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government passes it along to the provinces with major cuts 
in health care, major cuts in education, major cuts in social 
programs, and major cuts in the granting agencies for research 
facilities across the country.  It puts the provinces in more 
debt to resolve its debt load. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something even more cynical.  One reason we do not have 
a deficit today is that the government has been dipping into the 
EI fund.  The government is letting all working people and 
employers contribute through payments to the EI fund.  It will 
dip into that to pay down the deficit on the backs of working 
people.  It is easy to do, but does it really solving the deficit 
and debt crisis? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  My friend says “Yes”.  They are simply 
fobbing it off on other people, hard pressed provincial 
governments and citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard that essentially the deficit war has been won. Let 
us acknowledge the real heroes of the deficit war.  Is it the 
Minister of Finance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  As a matter of fact I suspect he is a 
lot richer than he was five years ago.  Is it members of the 
Liberal cabinet? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Is it the members of the Liberal caucus? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  The real heroes, the real people who 
made this deficit war work for the Minister of Finance are— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The Tories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Somebody had the audacity to say “The 
Tories”.  Absolutely not.  I remember those heady days with 
interest rates of 20%, deficits going up by the second, debt 
skyrocketing and so on.  No, that is not the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say who are the real heroes of the deficit war.  They are 
the students, thousands of students who leave universities and 
colleges with massive debt loads.  They are the real heroes. 
Another set of heroes are the men, women and children lined up on 
waiting lists to get into hospitals for critical surgery.  They 
cannot get in because of the cutbacks in health care.  They are 
the real heroes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1.4 million children living in poverty today, their moms and 
dads, are the real heroes of the deficit war.  The many thousands 
of people who declare bankruptcy every single month of the year 
are the real heroes.   It is not hundreds, not thousands, but 
many thousands who declare bankruptcy month after month. Personal 
bankruptcies have never been so high in Canadian history. 
Business bankruptcies have never been so high in Canadian 
history.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am simply saying these are the people who have sacrificed in 
order for this government to say the deficit war has been won. 
If these are the real casualties of the war, if these are the 
people who fought and won the war, should they not be the people 
who should receive the benefits now that the war is over? No. 
Are they going to receive the benefits?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says across the board tax cuts are out.  My 
friends in the Reform Party say they should be in.  It is fair to 
say to my friends on the finance committee, it was clear that 
Canadians said that they are out, that across the board tax cuts 
are simply not what they require or even request at this time. 
Some selected tax cuts, yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government decided that the people who need to have a tax 
break are the people who pay the maximum into RRSPs.  We can lift 
the ceiling of an RRSP so that those people who have $13,000 or 
$14,000 in loose change at the end of the year will be able to 
put more money in. Is this a priority in our country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, how many tax filers actually use the maximum RRSP 
contribution? One per cent?  If you said 2% you would be too 
high.  Less than 2% of Canadians now use the maximum RRSP 
contribution. But the government said we have to raise that to 
assist that 1% of tax filers as a priority tax measure.  This is 
maddening and it is sort insane.  No wonder people look at this 
place and ask “Who are those folks?  What on earth are they 
doing?  What have they been smoking?  Where have they been?  Who 
have they listened to?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I suggest a tax break that would help everybody, that would 
help every single citizen of this country immediately.  One that 
would put money into the hands of every single individual, 
particularly those who have been hardest hit during these tough 
economic times.  It would help every business person, every 
consumer, every working person, people dependent on social 
services.  That break would be to begin to phase down the GST 
immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the government not start to phase down the GST?  After 
all, we all remember when it was said that we need the GST to pay 
down the deficit.  The deficit has been paid down.  Therefore it 
would make sense that we start phasing out the GST.  Imagine the 
kind of signal it would send from this place if the Minister of 
Finance rose on budget day and said “We have now essentially 
wrestled this deficit lion to the ground.  We said we needed the 
GST to accomplish this.  It has been accomplished and now we are 
going to repay the people.  We are going to start phasing out the 
GST from 7% to 5% in the first year”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Nelson for finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Thank you.  This is a proposal.  It is 
not a radical proposal.  We have heard it from many people.  A 
number of people during our intervention suggested we do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of my friends from the finance committee are here.  How 
many people asked us to raise the ceiling on the RRSP maximum? 
Maybe three or four.  How many people asked us for goodness sake 
to get rid of this GST as soon as possible? Most people.  Which 
ones did we listen to?  We met with them all, but which ones did 
we listen to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all acknowledge in this House that the GST is one of the most 
regressive taxes that has been introduced in many years.  It is a 
regressive tax which the Tories introduced.  They were mean 
spirited at the time.  They said, “We are going to get those 
Canadians”.  And the Liberals opposed it.  I remember the 
current Minister of Finance standing in this House pounding his 
desk and saying that it is regressive because it hits poor people 
the hardest.  Now is the chance to change that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard advice from Canadians and there were some themes that 
came through very clearly.  One was to increase funding for 
health care.  Health care is what distinguishes our country from 
most others.  It distinguishes what Canadians feel strongly about 
from others.  It is almost a Canadian icon.  Canadians from coast 
to coast and at least 80% of the people who appeared before the 
finance committee said to strengthen our support for health care. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some said to do it even if it required an increase in taxation. 
They said, “We feel so strongly about being able to access 
quality health care no matter where we live in this country and 
no matter what our incomes, a one tier system, we want you to 
take that as a priority in terms of your recommendations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they did not say is to keep funding at $12.5 billion.  That 
is what the Liberals on the finance committee said but that is 
not what people said.  That is rock bottom.  If there is one 
thing that is clear from any province and territory is that our 
health care system is in a crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many others, I do not believe that providing more money is 
the answer.  It is only part of the answer.  Even if we provided 
a few billion dollars more we would still be far below the cost 
of health care than we would find in the United States. It would 
seem to me that should be a priority we ought to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education is the second thing I want to talk about.  When we are 
indebting our graduates as we are today with huge debt loads, 
does it indicate that we put a priority on education?  Other 
countries that really value higher education go the ultimate mile 
and do not put up any hurdles to people and have removed tuition 
fees. Whether it is in grade 10, grade 12, grade 15 or grade 17, 
there is no cost to education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those countries make the assumption that if they invest in their 
citizens, it enables them to get the training and education they 
desire and can accomplish so that they will be contributing 
citizens then for the rest of their lives.  They will repay the 
country many, many times in terms of the contribution they will 
make to the country's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something we could do if we were bold.  Or at least we 
could go beyond the minor little steps that we have taken and 
tell people that we must have better ways of easing the debt load 
and providing better grants to students who are in particular 
need. But we do not. We might think of something else when we 
talk about the tax system.  We might take a lead from certain 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ireland for example says that it wants to support its cultural 
industry, the creators, the composers, the writers.  A composer 
or a writer, an artist of that nature in the country of Ireland 
will not pay any income tax at all.  That country values its 
creators, it values those people in society who are writers and 
composers.  Those individuals will not pay any income tax at all 
in Ireland.  Has this made Ireland bankrupt?  No it has not. Has 
this encouraged Ireland's cultural sector? Yes it has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are things that countries do that are bold.  They send a 
clear signal to people that they are serious about encouraging 
particular investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us acknowledge a new trend in our country that our tax 
system does not reflect at all.  The vast majority of jobs 
created in Canada in the last three years have been in the 
self-employed sector, individuals who are essentially creating 
their own enterprise.  As a matter of fact, 87% of new jobs in 
the last three years have been created in the self-employed 
sector.  The rest almost exclusively have been created in the 
small business sector.  I am talking three, four or five people 
in a firm.  Does our tax system reflect the needs of these new 
entrants into the economy?  No it does not. Not at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just saying that in acknowledging the changes that are 
taking place our tax system needs a major overhaul in order that 
we reflect the reality of our economy and encourage, support and 
show our concern for those who are out there creating wealth, 
jobs and opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to acknowledge a good point in the report.  There are 
actually a number of good points in the report.  It recognizes 
that without research and development through to production 
primarily, Canada continues to fall behind in an ever competing 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from the granting councils that we need to restore 
funding in these areas to send a signal to the most creative 
elements in our economy that yes, we appreciate research and 
development. We appreciate the scientific research that is being 
done both in terms of applied and pure research. 
We have taken a small step in that direction by suggesting to the 
Minister of Finance that funding in some of these crucial areas 
be increased.  So this is a slight move in the right direction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize that to say the fundamentals of our economy 
are in place is simply wrong.  The average family income since 
1989 has fallen by 5%.  Every other industrialized nation has 
seen theirs increase and ours has actually fallen.  There are 
530,000 more children living in poverty today than there were in 
1989.  The number of food banks in Canada has tripled and the 
proportion of the population relying on them has doubled.  The 
number of Canadians filing for personal bankruptcy is at an 
historic high.  I could go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the economy of Canada, it is appropriate that 
we talk about at least two economies, one which is working for an 
ever reduced number of people and the other which reflects a 
social deficit, an economy where people continue to struggle. 
More than one million people are out of work.  Seventy per cent 
of the young people in this country are jobless.  Many who are 
working have three or four part time jobs at minimum wage.  They 
are barely surviving.  They are entering the ranks of the working 
poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have much work to do.  It is time that the government stopped 
listening to the bankers of the country and started listening to 
the ordinary citizens of Canada, in the rural areas, in the small 
communities, in the suburbs of the cities and see what it is they 
require. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to wish you, Madam Speaker, and all of my 
colleagues in the House of Commons a merry Christmas. 
<P><A NAME="LINK276"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure to listen to a 
seasoned politician speak on any article of business that we deal 
with in the House, although I have to admit that some of the 
ideas on which the hon. member was expounding are half-baked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last 24 months our interest rates have been at historic 
lows.  Quite frankly it took about 18 months for the economy to 
kick in because of the low interest rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about tax breaks.  That is something which 
will cost the government immediately.  When tax revenue is taken 
away, the government has lost revenue.  It has to be replaced in 
some way. On top of that, he talked about extra spending.  That 
is more expenditure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much of a deficit would the hon. member like to see the 
government incur to implement the half-baked ideas on which he 
has been expounding?  How much more would he like to put the 
country into debt? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, where do I begin? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to acknowledge that the province of Saskatchewan 
reduced its provincial sales tax in its last budget.  It was the 
first provincial government to have a balanced budget.  It runs 
the most efficient government in Canada. My friends laugh.  I 
would ask my friend to suggest a province which is more efficient 
in terms of the number of provincial employees per capita. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the federal government was cutting back drastically on 
social programs to fight the war on the deficit, and while other 
provincial governments were doing the same, one province was not. 
One province decided not to cut social programs and actually 
added to the amount of money expended for hospital programs and 
health care.  That province was the first to balance its budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very clear alternative to look at in this country 
compared to all of the other provincial governments combined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend's question is legitimate.  When we advocate a 
particular proposal, we ought to have a way to fund it.  Let me 
answer by way of example. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have suggested that the tobacco companies get out of the 
funding of cultural and sports programs.  The cultural and sports 
program says that if they do that, they will then not get the 
appropriate funding and will be unable to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By adding less than 1¢ to a package of cigarettes in tax, they 
will provide more money than is expended in all those areas right 
now.  That is for one penny a cigarette pack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that if we cannot eliminate tobacco advertising from 
all sporting and cultural events and the cost will be to impose a 
1¢ increase on the taxation on a package of cigarettes, that is 
where we would get the money.  It is easy for my hon. friend to 
say where will they get the money.  I should tell him one more 
thing.  I do not think he is aware of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is, during our hearings—I know some of my hon. friends on 
the finance committee will acknowledge this—when Dr. Jim 
Stanford came before the committee, he showed that if the 
government had merely frozen spending at the 1995 levels and 
waited for economic growth and lower interest rates, the finance 
minister would have beaten his own timetable and still have 
reduced Canada's deficit to the lowest level in the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Put simply, the cuts that took place were not necessary to 
achieve the deficit reduction targets of the Minister of Finance. 
I think this is very important to point out.  I might just add to 
my friend's question that if they are putting on targets to 
reduce the debt now, which I think is appropriate, we should also 
be putting targets on to reduce the level of unemployment in the 
country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK277"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member for Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey 
made a comment that I have to say was only half true.  He said 
that the ideas of the hon. member for Kamloops were half baked. I 
think they are fully baked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless I misunderstood him, he suggested that artists should be 
tax exempt, that they should not have to pay taxes.  All I can 
say to that is if this is the kind of logic which has been 
advanced in the House of Commons, it is no wonder our country is 
$600 billion in debt and the Canada pension plan has an unfunded 
liability of $560 billion.  This is why Canadians are taxed to 
death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that the kind of logic that has been advanced in this House 
for the past 20 or 30 years?  Is that how we got here?  That is 
my question.  I would like anyone who has been here for maybe a 
term or two to answer that.  Is that what has been going on here? 
I am really curious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am not used to that 
category of question, the scintillating intellectual depth of 
such a question.  However, I will do my best to respond to my 
hon. friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has identified a rather crucial point.  That is, over the 
last number of years governments on this side, regardless of 
whether they were Conservatives or Liberals, have seen fit to 
have a tax system that enabled year after year after year tens of 
thousands of profitable corporations to pay no income tax at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening now for almost five years to my friends in 
the Reform Party and I have never heard a single Reform member 
ever once suggest that we should change that part of the tax 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps my friend is extraordinary.  He is in many respects, I 
suggest, and maybe he holds this progressive view.  I have yet to 
hear a single Reform member criticize the fact that our tax 
system presently allows, in the last analysis, 62,000 profitable 
corporations to not pay a single penny in income tax.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, let me say that I always enjoy my friend from Kamloops 
when he gets up in this House.  Of course, he has decades of 
experience to tell us about the issues of the day and the issues 
of the past number of decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that when the New Democrats are in 
opposition as they were in British Columbia, and even when they 
were in government in British Columbia, they said that they 
balanced the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, after the election the balanced budget was not there. 
It was an aberration.  There are some lawsuits that are going on 
regarding, I believe, some recalls.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we had the New Democrats in the province of Ontario run in 
the election, they made all sorts of claims.  They had a platform 
called “Agenda for People” that they tried to burn after the 
election in case anybody took them seriously.  Of course, after 
one term they were relegated back to their traditional place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend has the best suntan on that side of the House, 
and I applaud him for it.  That might explain why it may be 
half-baked, fully-baked.  Let us just settle on the best suntan 
on that side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, let me suggest that when he uses some of his rhetoric, 
I sit on this side in my second term, thinking to myself that if 
we could get the time of their speeches cut in half, as a country 
that would make a significant contribution to global warming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member.  He tells the House that there 
are no poor people in Denmark, Norway and Sweden.  I do not 
totally accept that.  I certainly hope that he can somehow prove 
to the House that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about intellectual honesty and consistency. 
Then he said that we have to give more money for health care 
because the Americans spend more money on health care.  If he is 
going to introduce those countries as a model, he should stand in 
the House and say that those countries spend 2% to 3% less on 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to reconcile those two points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The hon. member for 
Kamloops, a very quick reply, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>   Madam Speaker, a very quick reply does 
not seem very fair at all to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be brief and answer my friend's question directly.  One 
reason that countries like Denmark and Norway, the two that I am 
most familiar with, are able to have a first class health care 
system and spend less money than we do in Canada on a GDP basis 
is because they have a whole set of other social programs that 
complement their system.  They have a comprehensive child care 
which assists children from birth if the parents require it. They 
have a whole set of programs that we call pharmacare or elder 
care or assistance and support for seniors in that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You cannot take health care out of the equation when it is part 
of a comprehensive package.  Perhaps the member will understand 
that by having a decent social system, you do not have to have 
poor children in Canada.  Those other countries have demonstrated 
by appropriate policies there do not have to be any poor parents 
and, therefore, poor children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK279"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, 
judging by the atmosphere in the House, I wonder if we could have 
unanimous consent to allow this question and answer period to go 
on for another 20 or 30 minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Does the hon. member 
have the unanimous consent of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the festive spirit of the holiday season is upon us, even 
within and around this chamber. Nonetheless, we have an important issue 
to debate today. Let us try to do so calmly and seriously, as this is a 
very serious matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this debate is to help prepare the next federal 
budget, which will define the rules of the game not only for the budget 
but also for the development of our country in the next year. Sometimes, 
policy choices made at budget time have long-lasting impact. So, this is 
a serious matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not sit on the Standing Committee on Finance. Many of those 
who spoke before me are members of this committee and, as such, have 
participated in the consultations held across the country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT75"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT75"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1610

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, anyone can read the committee's report, which is 
entitled <I>Keeping the Balance: Security and Opportunity for 
Canadians</I>. This is the report of the Standing Committee on 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite a substantial document, reflecting what was said at 
the many consultations sessions held across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like everyone here, while not all of us sit on the finance 
committee, I think that all have a say in determining what the main 
priorities should be for the coming year and next few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the vigorous action taken by the Liberal federal 
government in this last term as well as the action taken by the 
legislatures or parliaments of several provinces. I have witnessed some 
of the changes of direction the PQ government imposed on the people of 
Quebec these past few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, today, we are at a point where balance has been 
restored or is about to be restored in federal public finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago, in 1992-93, we were saying that the public 
finances were in a crisis. Canada was regarded as a country on its way 
to becoming a third world country. The worst speculations were being 
made about the development of our country. 
At the time, Canada was trailing other industrialized countries as 
regards the state of its public finances. Now, four or five years later, 
it is said to be at head of the pack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a major turnaround. We were on the verge of a disaster, 
but we have now set in place the conditions that will give our country 
a new impetus to tackle what lies ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the strategy implemented in recent years, the deficit 
dropped to its lowest level in 20 years, and it will continue to 
diminish. In fact, it will disappear. This strategy also brought 
interest rates to their lowest level in decades, while helping our 
economy pick up again and promoting job creation. 
These are all positive factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the debt, as a percentage of the gross domestic product, 
remains huge and, as pointed out by others, including the hon. member 
for Kamloops, who spoke just before me, some individuals, groups and 
organizations have shouldered the burden of this effort to put our 
fiscal house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the hon. member for Kamloops, who has been here for 
close to 20 years. He spoke in a very eloquent and colourful way, and he 
gave many examples of the price paid by various segments of the 
population. We have to be very sensitive to the description he made of 
the situation, because what he said does not exist only in his riding, 
but everywhere in Canada. It exists in my riding of 
Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies and in many ridings with a 
large number of middle or low income 
earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member did not mention it, but many small businesses also 
suffered a major shock in recent years and had to find new ways to 
organize themselves or had to restructure. Many jobs became precarious 
because of all these changes. It is a fact. Some sectors paid the price 
and shouldered the burden of that turnaround. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough to be eloquent, as the members opposite have 
been about what has gone on in recent years.  Of course, those who 
were present can always criticize what the Conservatives did from 
1985 to 1989 and from 1989 to 1993; they are perfectly entitled to 
do so.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are perfectly entitled to criticize the Liberals for what 
they did from 1993 to 1997.  There is nothing wrong with that in a 
parliamentary debate.  But, apart from criticizing past events and 
describing the impact of the changes of recent years, what matters 
now is what action we take in response to the present situation. 
What should we do and what do we suggest?  What are the points on 
which we are going to agree for the years ahead? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that reducing the deficit is the ultimate goal 
and I was very interested to see that this was also mentioned in 
the standing committee's report. 
With respect to reducing the deficit, it said, and I quote 
“Balanced budgets, and restrained spending are not the government's 
ultimate goals.  The same is true of the price stability objective 
of the Bank of Canada. They are merely intermediate objectives, 
which enable and support the achievement of our ultimate ends: 
fostering job creation, economic growth and opportunity for all, 
while maintaining the qualities that characterize Canadian society, 
particularly a concern about equity and fairness. This is the 
balance that characterizes the government's approach and reflects 
the values of Canadian society. The difficult choices made in 
recent years tried to keep this balance in mind. The choices to be 
made in the future must do so as well”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that all members should take note. 
The purpose of this debate is to get the House to take note of what 
in this report seems of interest to Canadians.  I think it is a 
step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pre-budget consultations of the past few weeks have led to 
the production of this report.  What Canadians want, and what the 
Standing Committee on Finance wants, is to have the next budget 
keep the balance that has been focused on in recent years, and must 
be attained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel it is important to specify what type of balance we 
want.  Balance in inertia is not what we want, in my opinion.  What 
the finance committee means is that a balance has been attained so 
we can lead our country in the right direction.  That is, moreover, 
what it says in the foreword to the report of the Standing 
Committee on Finance. 
It says that Canadians want a balance between the security offered 
by debt reduction and the benefits of investing in people, 
technology and research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on, but I am splitting my time with the hon. 
member for Niagara Falls.  As the representative of the riding of 
Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, I am greatly interested in the main 
thrust of this report we have before us, which consists of asking 
the government to reinvest in human resources, in education, in 
training, in health, in our young people, in a youth employment 
strategy, and also in developing our businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will add, of course, that it is also important to revise 
certain measures in our tax system with a view to ensuring greater 
equity, with particular thought to the most disadvantaged and the 
sector of the population hardest hit in recent years. 
This report contains a collection of proposals. Others can be added 
drawing on suggestions made during this debate.  Some others could 
be considered as well.  That is the purpose of this consultation 
within a parliamentary debate.  Some other proposals could be taken 
into consideration as well, such as those from the Standing 
Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development, which is 
calling for certain tax mechanisms to be redirected for the benefit 
of sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we must continue in the months to come to take a 
very serious approach to an exchange of views on these very 
important matters. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am happy to be given the opportunity to participate in this 
debate and to speak on the prebudget consultation report.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to express my support for the recommendations 
brought forward by the Standing Committee on Finance, of which I 
am a member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank the constituents of Niagara Falls who 
responded so enthusiastically to my invitation to debate these 
issues.  They provided valuable insight in the consultation 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the consultative process we heard from Canadians from all 
walks of life and all parts of the country.  Canadians took the 
time from their busy lives to tell us how they thought the 
Canadian economy should progress and what direction it should 
take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians told us very openly and sincerely about their values 
and priorities and how the next federal budget should reflect 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the report.  However, one of the recommendations of 
the report about which I am concerned is increasing the 20% 
foreign investment rule, which will happen over the next five 
years.  This is supposed to help Canadians achieve a higher 
return on their retirement savings and reduce exposure to risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question this measure.  I believe the Canadian economy is 
performing and will perform as well or better than foreign 
economies.  In addition, I believe that a dollar invested in 
Canada creates employment in Canada.  Even with the recovering 
economy, which seems to be booming in all sectors, Canada still 
needs to create more jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Canadian economy is the winner if funds are 
invested at home.  In my opinion, those savings make it easier 
for domestic companies to raise the capital they need to 
stimulate economic growth.  Growth is vitally important to future 
pensioners and workers.  When all is said and done, it is the 
gross domestic product of the future which will inevitably have 
to support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People saving for their retirement forgo higher foreign 
investment returns and thus are making a sacrifice for the 
benefit of workers in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the budget consultations, in answer to a question on the 
subject of opening the door to investment outside Canada, the 
governor of the Bank of Canada, Gordon Thiessen, replied that at 
the moment the Canadian economy is undergoing a major 
restructuring.  Canada needs many things, such as investment in 
new equipment and investment in plants, to make itself really 
competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for Canadian investors to be able to invest in 
the rest of the world and, indeed, in growing economies. However, 
Mr. Thiessen did not think this would occur in the immediate 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question foreign investment.  Often we import the problems of 
the host country with the investment.  A classic example would be 
Korea.  It is now trying to withdraw its investments around the 
world, regardless of the problem of unemployment and dislocation 
that causes.  It is often said that capital has no conscience. 
Certainly foreign capital is going to look at its own country 
before worrying about others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this day and age when there is much movement not only of 
goods and trade but also investment, it is a concern which we may 
have to live with.  However, I strongly believe that we should 
watch it carefully. There is an old saying that whoever pays the 
piper calls the tune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 50 years important changes have taken place.  Some 
are even reflected in the way the government does business. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT78"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT78"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1625
<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of these changes has to do with the way jobs are created 
today.  Nowadays jobs are created not only by small, medium and 
big business but by the ideas, thoughts or concepts of people who 
are going after a niche in the market or are selling their ideas, 
plans or concepts.  In other words, more often than not one of 
our big exports today is what is set up on a piece of paper or on 
a computer.  This is unlike a few years ago when technology had 
not yet reached the level it is at today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to bear in mind that the big income earners of the 
future are found in the minds of Canadians. They are found in the 
ability to be innovative and thus able to compete successfully 
within the global economy. Therefore it makes great sense that 
our resources and a great amount of care funds be directed to the 
development of the minds of Canadians.  This naturally means 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education will start at a very young age at the preschool level 
and progress through post-secondary education.  We must start 
educating our young minds.  We have to start providing our youth 
and our parents with the help and tools necessary in developing 
their unique resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to look very closely at our health care system 
because you cannot have a good mind without a healthy body.  This 
is one of the oldest proverbs known to man.  Therefore the 
recommendation in the report that calls for increased help for 
education and health care is to be taken very seriously.  I 
concur fully with the report when it states in order to build a 
strong society we have to improve our health care system.  I also 
agree with the recommendation that the government consider 
establishing new approaches to health care in full co-operation 
with the provinces and health care providers in local communities 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the fiscal dividends grow I am supporting the recommendations 
directed toward helping children who live in poverty.  I support 
the creation of more opportunities for Canadian youth.  It is 
vital that the federal government in co-operation with the 
provinces and territories be able to offer students a debt 
repayment schedule based on income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before, important changes have affected the way in 
which government has carried out its business in the last 50 
years.  Another important change has been in the field of 
planning.  There are those in our society who say that we have 
gone too far and moved too fast toward an open market.  We have 
learned one thing, that hiring a number of academics, sticking 
them into the civil service and telling them to plan our economy 
does not work.  Therefore if we are to get any input or planning 
we must have hearings with the public.  It is paramount that we 
consult with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least if a mistake is going to be made it will not be made by 
some ad hoc think tank dreamed up by the government and removed 
from the realities of everyday life.  I think it was Chairman Mao 
who said let a thousand flowers bloom.  This thought is the very 
essence of thinking and it is what we have discovered lately to 
be within our market economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hundreds of thousands of people thinking and discussing new 
ideas are very likely to get as good idea to emerge.  This is 
much better than having a few selected experts planning and 
finding solutions.  We encountered all this during our 
consultations and indeed we find it in our report.  The wisdom is 
out there. It is not in the bureaucracy as this report shows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember that to have fertile and aggressive thinking 
minds we must also continue to support good health care and 
education systems.  Those are the basics of a society.

raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, Immigration; the hon. member for 
Manicouagan, Rail Transportation.

<P><A NAME="LINK282"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to ask the member across:  With the cuts to 
the provinces and presumably the budget that will be coming up 
that is not going to have a whole lot in health care, I would 
like the member to explain to me how much—I am going to give him 
some calculations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a gentleman in my riding who had a triple bypass about 
a year ago.  He was sent home with medication and because his 
wife was making $6.25 an hour, he could not get the welfare card. 
This gentleman could not afford his medication and about two 
months ago he ended up back in the hospital and had a triple 
bypass and spent 45 days in the hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member explain to me how the Minister of Finance 
calculates the cost of having a person in the hospital for 45 
days when the doctor said if this person could have had his 
medication, he would never have had a second triple bypass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Pillitteri:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for her question concerning the medicare system.  As a 
matter of fact, we have increased the bottom line from $11 
billion to $12.5 billion starting this year, a year earlier than 
planned. I am not a mathematician, certainly not in answering the 
question on how someone is going to get a bypass, but let me say 
one thing.  We have the best health care system in the world.  We 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the increases that will be put in there, we certainly will 
continue to have the best health care system in the world.  If we 
try to throw around facts and figures on how much it is going to 
cost, who would we compare it with?  Would we compare it with 
south of the border to us where they are spending over 16% on 
health care and not getting the services that we are getting here 
in Canada as universal services?  They have over 30 million 
Americans without the new services.  We in Canada have a service 
which is accessible to all Canadians, slow as it might be 
sometimes, but we have a system which is enjoyed by all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also talked about cuts to the provinces.  It is 
not necessarily the case that because we put in that $1.5 billion 
more in the social transfer, the provinces will be spending this 
money on the health care system.  The health care system is a 
provincial jurisdiction.  We do have the best— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  May I remind the 
members to address their comments through the Chair, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Madam Speaker, my last comment the 
hon. member could reply to is that we are in a festive season. 
Most of us are going to have a very nice Christmas.  I think we 
have to consider that there are a lot of poor families in this 
country today.  We cannot say we are leaving this House very 
pleased because there are still too many children who will not 
have that gift under the Christmas tree and we have to say that 
this government is responsible for some of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Pillitteri:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member is 
exactly correct.

many.  As long as there is one child going to sleep at night with 
hunger or waking up in the morning with hunger, there is one too 
many.  Yes, we have to do much more.  Yes, we are doing much 
more.  This is the role of this government and the role on this 
side, to make sure that we care for those who least can afford 
it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK283"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
spent one and a half weeks with the finance committee in October, 
travelling across Canada and listening to the concerns of 
ordinary Canadians.  We visited the cities of Regina, Montreal, 
Halifax and Charlottetown when I was with the committee.  Being 
new to this process and perhaps somewhat naive politically, I was 
initially impressed that Canadians seemed to have an impact on 
this very important legislative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my time with the committee, many Canadians sat before the 
five government members and four opposition MPs and expressed 
their views on Canada's fiscal policy and the alternatives we now 
face as a nation.  I was fundamentally disappointed that their 
concerns were not reflected wholly in this committee's report. 
For this government to engage in an ostensibly consultative 
process with Canadians without really taking their opinions 
seriously makes Canadians skeptical and indeed cynical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a political representative, I am even skeptical and cynical 
of this process that led up to the publication of this vacuous 
government self-serving document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals take every opportunity in this House to blame the 
debt and deficit on the former Conservative government.  However, 
in the 1998 forecast of the <I>Economist</I> magazine which came 
out recently, the Canadian section caught my interest in 
reference to fiscal policy and deficit reduction.  I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the credit for deficit reduction goes to the passage of 
time and successful reforms earlier this decade.  The fiscal drag 
has been offset by falling interest rates and record exports 
boosted by the undervalued Canadian dollar to a consistently 
prosperous America. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Economist</I> refers directly to free trade and NAFTA, the 
same agreements that the Liberals fought while in opposition, the 
same agreements that the Liberals fought against during an 
election, the same agreements that the former Liberal leader John 
Turner argued against just last night on the CBC news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the Liberals who have allowed greater trade 
restrictions within Canada than we have internationally, that 
have allowed the insane situation to exist where there is more 
trade barriers between Ontario and Newfoundland than there are 
between Canada and Chile.  Today the government's inaction on 
interprovincial trade barriers is costing Canadians hundreds of 
thousands of jobs.  An increase in interprovincial trade by 10% 
would create 200,000 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Economist</I> article continued and said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The imposition of a national sales tax in 1991 and the 
deregulation of financial services, transport and energy are now 
widely accepted as having contributed to deficit reduction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, Conservative initiatives of which I am very proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are not responsible for the passage of time.  The 
Liberals are not responsible for interest rates or increased 
exports.  We all know the Liberals are not responsible for free 
trade or deregulation or the GST, even though the Prime Minister 
recently took credit for introducing it internationally.  The 
Liberals have no problem taking credit for the remarkable 
turn-around this economy has made due to the reforms by the 
previous Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals would also like Canadians to believe that they are 
responding to the public by increasing the Canadian health and 
social transfer payments to the provinces.  The report, in fact, 
applauds the government's decision to increase the CHST floor to 
$12.5 billion.  In fact, the Liberal government is so excited 
about this exercise that it has announced it twice.  The first 
announcement, I remember it distinctly, was in the opening days 
of the election in my home province of Nova Scotia. Unfortunately 
for the Liberals, the voting public of Nova Scotia was not taken 
in by this smoke and mirrors announcement or fiscal shell game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotians understood, and they still understand today, that 
the finance minister is not actually increasing the transfer 
payments as he would like them to believe.  He is simply pledging 
not to cut transfers further, as he has done so dramatically and 
drastically in previous budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should probably thank the Minister of Finance for his 
generosity or lack thereof.  It helped me and other colleagues 
from Atlantic Canada become elected to this House by Atlantic 
Canadians who had become cynical with this government.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance made the same announcement this week 
prior to the premiers' meeting in hopes of softening the blow 
that the Liberals had given to the provincial governments over 
the past four years.  The minister forgot to mention the $7 
billion cut his government had made that had forced the 
provincial governments to inflict draconian cuts on their 
constituents across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same section of this finance committee report, the 
committee recommends a national home care system.  Certainly in 
my riding of Kings—Hants the promise of a national home care 
system sounds very seductive.  With the reduction in transfer 
payments, local hospitals in my riding have been forced to close 
or reduce the numbers of beds.  The Hants Community Hospital has 
been reduced from 128 beds to approximately 30 beds. Western 
Kings Memorial Hospital and Eastern Kings Memorial Hospital have 
suffered cutbacks or have been closed. In some cases the 
responsibility of providing health care has been shifted to 
community based boards that now struggle just to keep viable 
medical services in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government now has the gall to reduce funding to the 
provinces, forcing bed closures in communities across Canada and 
then recommends this glistening generality of a policy initiative 
called a national home care program to make up the difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the government intends to put the same amount of 
resources into the home care program that it has committed to 
national day care or to the pharmacare program that it has spoken 
of in the past, or will this national home care program simply go 
into the annals of political rhetoric which Canadians have come 
to expect from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a feeding frenzy going on right now in the Liberal 
caucus, a feeding frenzy which is akin to that of sharks when 
they smell blood.  There is nothing that incites conflict more in 
the Liberal caucus than the smell of hard currency around the 
snouts of Liberal backbenchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the members of the Liberal caucus that this feeding 
frenzy is highly premature.  If the finance minister was not 
using the $12 billion to $13 billion surplus in the employment 
insurance fund to offset the deficit numbers, the arrival of this 
fiscal dividend would occur much later than the date that he is 
projecting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our leader has made this point clear on a number of occasions. 
The fact is that the Minister of Finance is balancing the budget 
on the backs of working and unemployed Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the report's recommendation that the government 
establish clear goals for long term sustainable debt to GDP ratio 
in Canada.  Our party ran on a platform that included just that. 
In our policy document we promised to set a target of 50% 
debt-GDP ratio by 2005.  The current Liberal strategy is to wait 
until the economy grows and see how the ratio falls. This is in 
direct opposition to a study released last month by the OECD 
which recommended the ratio be put in a clear downward trend with 
clear targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know the simple fact that this government has yet to 
learn.  By paying off the debt all taxpayers will have less 
interest to pay and will benefit by reinvestment in programs in 
the future.  By paying off the debt government funds can be 
reinvested in these programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even European countries previously not known for fiscal 
fortitude required debt to GDP ratios of 60% simply to comply 
with the Maastricht agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country is floundering now with debt to GDP ratio of 
approximately 70%, the highest of all G-7 nations. This is a 
competitiveness issue.  A low debt to GDP ratio increases 
Canada's global competitiveness, strengthens our economy and 
creates jobs for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals obviously feel that the status quo is acceptable. While 
dilly-dallying and dithering in caucus over how to spend the 
dividend, Canadians wear the heavy yoke of government inaction. 
Unfortunately, it is those same ordinary Canadians who suffer by 
that Liberal government inaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party believes that we need to couple debt reduction with 
tax relief and strategic social investment.  No one action should 
dominate another.  Instead, the three should be used to 
complement each other and to strengthen the economy.  New 
strategic investment is needed in areas that will create real 
returns for Canadians with measurable outcomes in terms of 
quality of life and international competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time strategic investment in education in particular is 
extremely important and addressing the post-secondary student 
debt issue is extremely important.  I was pleased to see that 
there are some members in this House who agree with me and there 
has been a committee report to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October I met with the Canadian Academic Round Table. They 
had their annual meeting in my riding. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I learned there had been a 280% growth in student debt in Canada 
since 1989 and a 110% growth in tuition costs.  We should 
consider the impact on the future competitiveness of Canada of 
creating a huge impediment for young Canadians to pursue higher 
education.  We should consider that we are in a global economy 
and the knowledge based industry is leaving most other sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time as a country, Canada has an opportunity to 
invest in our competitive advantage and to ensure that young 
Canadians have an opportunity to participate in prosperous growth 
by having access to higher education.  The government has created 
huge impediments to higher education and irrevocable damage to 
the future competitiveness of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third part of our plan for economic prosperity is tax 
relief.  Current tax levels in Canada run counter to our culture. 
Our current tax system penalizes initiative.  Wood Gundy reported 
this month that Canada's personal income taxes as a share of GDP 
are the highest of all G-7 countries.  From 1989 to 1993 the 
Conservative government reduced the percentage of personal income 
tax as a per cent of GDP from 14% to 13%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the Liberals have hiked the ratio to over 14%.  Let 
us make it clear that the PC government reduced the personal 
income tax to GDP ratio and the Liberals hiked it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like to think of tax relief in terms of a Canadian family that 
budgets its money every year.  Canadians and Canadian families 
have a better idea of how to spend their own money than the 
government.  The finance minister feels that once the economic 
crisis which is being dealt with on the backs of ordinary 
Canadians is under control, the government has the right to 
dictate to taxpayers how their money should be spent.  The 
government is fundamentally wrong in its judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Higher taxes reduce disposable income in two ways.  The obvious 
is the reduction in the paycheques of taxpayers.  The second is 
the long term reduction in economic growth which results from 
weaker incentives to work and to invest and the reduction in the 
international competitiveness of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax gap between Canada and the United States, as well as 
that with our other trading partners, continues to increase.  The 
OECD report warned that unless significant measures were taken in 
Canada we were risking a serious brain drain.  That has already 
begun.  Based on the numbers in the House today I would expect 
that it is occurring quite rapidly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young Canadians are the brightest light in our country.  We 
cannot afford to lose them to other countries.  I see no serious 
mention of tax relief in this report.  These taxes create a 
competitive disadvantage for Canadians relative to our closest 
neighbour and greatest trading partner, the United States, 
leading to lost opportunities and lost jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax burdens are also related to all levels of employment.  The 
Liberals boast of job creation since taking office, but Canada's 
unemployment rate has been consistently greater than 9% for 86 
straight months.  Canada's high tax burden has been shifted to 
the bottom of the wage scale through the payroll taxes the 
Liberal government continues to support, most recently with the 
CPP amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report gives additional resources to helping poor children 
once the fiscal dividend grows.  Everybody in the House feels 
that child poverty is an important issue which needs to be 
addressed, but the Liberals have no credibility when they 
pontificate about programs for impoverished children in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The children are not the root of the problem.  Poor children 
exist because of poor parents, unemployed parents and parents who 
have had the Canadian budget balanced on their backs over the 
past four years.  The Liberals simply want to throw money at this 
problem because it is politically expedient and does not require 
a great deal of vision to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must address the tax system in Canada.  High payroll taxes in 
particular create the single biggest impediment to job growth 
that we face as a nation.  As a small business person I recognize 
that when payroll taxes increase I am not able to hire the number 
of people I would like to hire.  A number of small business 
people in our caucus helped lead us to the consensus and the 
understanding that high payroll taxes are in fact killing jobs 
across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic personal exemption should be raised to $10,000, as we 
promoted during the election.  This would take two million low 
income Canadians off the tax roll and provide them with a fresh 
start.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can draw on other examples when determining what to do in the 
future to guide Canada victoriously into the 21st century.  We 
can look at the Netherlands.  In 1983 it had an unemployment rate 
in excess of 13%.  By reducing payroll, by reducing income taxes 
and by reducing regulations which hinder the development of small 
business, the Netherlands has been able to reduce its 
unemployment rate to sub 7% levels.  That is what leadership can 
achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report tabled by the Liberal finance committee is a biased 
and unfair representation of what we have heard from Canadians. 
It is a direct slap in the face to the process of consultation 
and an offence to many Canadians who took time out of their 
schedules to create reports and to make meaningful interventions 
to the committee.  At the end of the report is my party's 
dissenting opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and its report continue to ignore what Canadians 
already know.  Debt and tax reduction will lead to a stronger, 
more self-reliant and competitive Canadian economy.  We can 
reduce Canada's 9% unemployment rate, but not until we have the 
vision and the intestinal fortitude to implement policies which 
create a growth environment to benefit all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK284"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened with great interest to the member 
opposite.  He suggested that the economic prosperity Canada was 
enjoying today was the result of Tory policies of the previous 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the first question he might want to ask himself is why 
after the last election the Tory party returned as the fifth 
party in the House.  If the viewers could see the full Chamber 
they would see the small section the Tories occupy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, the member should want to ask some very specific 
questions.  He expressed frustration in his speech about the 
consultative process.  Maybe he would want to ask why the former 
Tory government had no consultative process when it came to 
formulating its budget.  It never went out to consult with 
Canadians.  The finance committee, under the Tory regime, never 
has a prebudget consultation.  It was simply all done by Michael 
Wilson in some backroom when he came up with his budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did it help Canada reach economic prosperity?  When the Tory 
government took over there was about a $28 billion deficit, but 
when it left it was at $42 billion.  It had increased by this 
massive amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tories are trying to say that we should look at them as 
being the genesis of our economic prosperity.  The Liberal 
government has been in power for four years and the deficit 
disappeared.  They were in power for nine years and it went from 
$28 billion to $42 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the fact that the debt to GDP was far 
too high, and it is.  What he failed to point out was that when 
the Conservative Party took over it was in the 50% range and when 
it left it was over 70%.  Again I have to ask the hon. member if 
that is an example of the type of Tory management which led to 
the great prosperity we see today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have talked about EI premiums.  When the Tories were in 
power the UI premiums went up by over $1.  When we came to power 
they were scheduled to go to $3.30.  In reality today they are 
down to $2.70.  Is this another example of how the Tory policy 
has led to the economic prosperity of today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also talked about unemployment, a significant problem 
in Canada.  It is a challenge for all of us to try to address. 
Was the fact that the unemployment rate had increased to 11.3% 
when the Tories left office and is now down to 9% today under a 
Liberal regime an example of their economic policies that have 
led to the prosperity we enjoy today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>   Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  His depth of knowledge on economic issues is 
obviously only exceeded by his height. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that economic policy takes years to have meaningful 
impacts. 
I cannot explain an international phenomenon.  For instance, the 
U.K. is enjoying one of the most unprecedented levels of economic 
growth as a direct result of Conservative policy.  Unfortunately 
Conservatives simply try to help by providing sound economic 
policy but sometimes the benefit falls to a government that has 
failed to catch on to implementing sound economic policy.  It 
takes years of vision to put in place the fundamentals for an 
economy to grow.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not referring to my own opinion about this issue.  I was 
quoting <I>The Economist</I>, a pretty good magazine, which costs 
about $172 a year to subscribe.  It is to be considered. If I 
felt the Conservative Party of Canada could influence the opinion 
of <I>The Economist</I>, that would be considerable for the fifth 
party, which would also bode well for where we will be in four 
years, which I suggest will be the side the hon. member is 
currently sitting on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>The Economist</I> magazine stated specifically that much of 
the credit for deficit reduction goes to the passage of time and 
to the successful reforms implemented earlier in the decade.  It 
was not early in the decade in 1984.  It was early in the decade 
of the 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fiscal drag has been offset by falling interest rates and 
record exports boosted by an undervalued Canadian dollar to a 
consistently prosperous America.  I would like to know where the 
hon. member stood at that pivotal time in Canadian history on 
such issues as free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government now talks glowingly about Liberalized trade.  One 
day it signs an agreement with Chile.  Another day it is one with 
Israel.  However it still does not bring down interprovincial 
trade barriers within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the members opposite speak about consultation, who benefits 
from consultation around the country, listening to Canadian 
taxpayers spending copious quantities of quid and then ultimately 
implementing policies completely opposite to those expressed by 
Canadians?  Perhaps it would have been better not to have done 
that.  Maybe we could have invested that money to pay off the 
debt or reduce taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Don Blenkarn as finance committee chair actually consulted with 
and listened to Canadians.  The Conservative government had 
enough vision to implement the views of Canadians and to ensure 
those views were reflected in policy which led to the more recent 
unprecedented growth of the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reference was made to payroll taxes.  There are times when 
payroll taxes need to be increased, for instance during times of 
recession when the economy needed sufficient EI funds.  There are 
times when it is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals do not recognize it, but Keynes was actually right in 
terms of government spending during times of recession to bring a 
country out of a recession.  If they listened to Keynes a little 
further—they probably did not get to that chapter—Keynes also 
advocated paying down the debt when the economy was growing.  Now 
is the time to pay down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may have introduced the member to some facts he was not 
previously introduced to when I told him the Conservative 
government reduced income taxes as a percentage of GDP from 14% 
to 13% between the years of 1989 to 1993, only to see them hiked 
under the Liberal government since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be perfectly clear.  We created the environment which led 
to a fiscal dividend.  We are very proud of that contribution. We 
are looking forward in four years to adding further to Canadians 
competitiveness by being on the government side of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK285"></A></P>

Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I congratulate the

</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed with interest his remarks on higher education. 
Would he support what is called a functional interpretation of 
constitutional powers, where the need exists the power sensibly 
should flow?  In other words, there is an increasing federal 
leadership role in setting national standards in education.  That 
is a constitutional area that in the strict terms of the 
Constitution Act, 1867 was specified as being provincial.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, in our platform we 
actually called for national testing as one way of ensuring that 
Canadian children across this great country received the same 
educational opportunities.  Young Canadians going to school in 
Port-aux-Basques should be provided with the same level of 
education as children growing up in Toronto. Parents should be 
able to know where their children rank across Canada.  That 
requires leadership to implement and Canadians will have to wait 
for four years for that kind of leadership.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin with I must say to the hon. member for Kings—Hants 
that I am proud on behalf of all vertically challenged Canadians 
to have an opportunity to stand in the House to speak in this 
prebudget debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative was established by the Liberal government in the 
last mandate in 1993.  It was to give parliamentarians an 
opportunity to gather in the House to debate the budget during 
its formulation process as opposed to the previous practice of 
having a budget debate after the tabling of the budget.  I am 
pleased that we as members of Parliament have the opportunity to 
be here because of this Liberal initiative to have a prebudget 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate all the members of the finance 
committee, particularly the chair.  They did a fine job.  They 
travelled across the country soliciting views from Canadians from 
coast to coast to coast.  Members of the committee ensured that 
the perspectives of Canadians were brought forward and were part 
of the analysis in putting together the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During its first mandate over the last four years the Liberal 
government made significant progress.  Some of the items I 
mentioned earlier in debate.  When we began our mandate we 
inherited a $42 billion annual deficit. I was pleased, as I know 
all Canadians were, when the finance minister was able to make 
his report to Canadians and indicate that the deficit would be 
eliminated no later than the next fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, several hundred million dollars have already been 
paid on the debt.  We will actually be in a surplus position very 
shortly. That is a significant accomplishment when we consider it 
has been a generation and a half since we have been in that 
position as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked a bit about setting strong economic conditions, which 
we have established in Canada over the last four years.  I would 
like to take a look at some of those achievements in terms of 
maintaining a low, sustained, constant level of inflation to 
allow for an economic environment where investment can occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at interest rates.  If we go back to the 
beginning of this decade, in 1900 three month treasury bills were 
at 11%. Today they are at 3%.  We were looking at a prime rate in 
1990 of 14%.  Today it is under 5%.  Canadians can very much 
relate to the rate of interest they pay on their mortgage for 
their new home.  In 1990 a five year rate was around 13.5%. Today 
it is just a little over 7%.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made some good progress.  Because of that progress, 
because this Liberal government has managed the economy of Canada 
prudently, effectively and efficiently, we now as a nation, as a 
Parliament, as a government have some important choices to make 
about where we go from here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign many suggestions were put forward 
by many parties and many individuals.  This government put 
forward the very straightforward proposal that once we get into a 
balanced position and we have a surplus, we will take a 50% 
portion of that surplus and apply it to debt and tax reduction. 
Over the period of our mandate we will use the other half to 
invest in the types of programs and priorities wanted by 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been having that discussion with Canadians in order to 
hear their perspective, to hear what they think about our 
proposals.  Over the past couple of months I had the opportunity 
to hold two forums in my riding of Parry Sound—Muskoka. One was 
in the town of Huntsville which was attended by a large number of 
individuals from the Muskoka side of my riding.  The other 
session was held this past week in the town of Parry Sound which 
was attended by a large number of people from the Parry Sound 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about those options, about debt reduction, tax 
reduction and expenditures.  I will summarize what some of those 
individuals were saying.  There was not only a belief but an 
insistence that we do not ever return to deficit financing in 
government, that we should bring to an end what had been going on 
in this country for a number of decades, the deficit financing 
where we basically use the assets of today for our use and burden 
our children and grandchildren with the cost of that. Canadians 
in my riding were very clear to say that must come to an end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said very clearly that they understood we were nearing the 
end of our battle with the deficit, that indeed the debt was too 
high and that we needed to devote some of our resources to paying 
down that debt.  They talked about tax decreases, and yes they do 
believe we need to have tax decreases.  But they made the point 
clearly that tax decreases must be made in a way that is the most 
beneficial to Canadians and most beneficial to our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not interested in across the board tax cuts that give 
the largest financial gain to those Canadians who earn the most. 
They want targeted tax cuts.  Tax cuts like what the Minister of 
Finance announced in his last budget where he talked about $850 
million to low and middle income families with children, where he 
talked about the tax cuts of over $160-odd million to Canadians 
with disabilities, tax cuts that would help young people with 
their education and help the parents who support them.  Those are 
the types of tax cuts Canadians want, focused tax cuts that will 
help those who are least advantaged in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not interested in large across the board tax cuts. They 
are not interested in a suggestion made in the Tory campaign 
platform, to reduce corporate taxes which would have seen our 
chartered banks receive reduced taxation.  They want tax cuts 
targeted to those in Canada who are most in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talked about the need for new investment.  They talked 
about the need to protect our social programs in Canada. They 
talked about the need to support programs like medicare.  They 
talked about the need to support things like post-secondary 
education.  They talked about the need to try to stimulate 
economic activity so it could lead to job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the important initiatives that I believe needs to be 
addressed in this budget is the whole concept and need to deal 
with the issues that involve rural Canada.  I represent a riding 
that is rural in nature.  We are about 30% of the Canadian 
population.  I think we have accomplished and made the point over 
the last few years that the circumstances under which our 
constituents live in rural Canada are different than those in 
urban Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The realities and the economic conditions we face are unique. 
Things like distances, geography, population density are all 
factors that need to be taken into account when we develop a 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made this speech on a number of occasions in past debates when 
we talked about the budget.  I would hope that as we formulate 
those policies, whether they have to do with tax reductions and 
the type of tax reductions we undertake, or the types of 
investments that we believe Canadians want and we should 
undertake, that they reflect the needs and concerns of rural 
Canadians and that they reflect the economy under which we 
operate and that we as a parliament make sure that the needs and 
concerns or rural Canadians are addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have had the opportunity to have spoken on the 
prebudget issues.  I am pleased to have had the opportunity to 
share some of these thoughts and concerns with my colleagues in 
the House.  I look forward to next February when the finance 
minister tables his budget in the House and we see another 
important step on the way to the economic progress of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member opposite seems to know what is happening with 
the parks.  He says that rural communities are important and that 
the budget should take them into account.  I agree totally.  My 
riding is highly rural. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am nevertheless concerned and wonder about my Liberal 
colleague's opinion.  Does he agree with the decisions to date to 
privatize our national parks, which bring us to ASD, which cut 
salaries and which complicate life even further? 
Often national parks are in rural settings, and the decisions made 
by this government department simply compound the economic problems 
of our communities.  Could he explain to me his thoughts on his 
government's approach to parks? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will reiterate very 
briefly what I said in a speech when I introduced the 
Saguenay-St. Lawrence bill.  We have not contemplated, are not 
contemplating now and will not be introducing into this House any 
measure that will privatize Parks Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as Liberals understand that the maintenance of our special 
places in this country is a public trust, a public trust that is 
exercised through a minister and overseen by this Parliament. 
That is the way Parks Canada operates and that is the way Parks 
Canada will continue to operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be pleased at any time to have a discussion with the 
member to clearly demonstrate that that is the way we operate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK288"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with a lot of interest to the 
hon. member, especially when he talked about rural Canada.  As a 
farmer that is very close to my heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we are moving into the next millennium and we have 
heard the hon. member for Victoria—Haliburton talk many times 
about his rotary dial cell phone.  Quite frankly we just do not 
have the services in rural Canada that we should have in order to 
be viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget there was extra money put into the Farm 
Credit Corporation.  There was extra money put into the Business 
Development Bank of Canada. I would like the hon. member to 
enlighten us on what he foresees should go into these good 
institutions that are helping rural Canada meet those challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member makes a 
very good point.  During the last budget there were measures 
which were directed at rural Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community access program had an extra $30 million put into 
it so that rural Canadians could be hooked into the worldwide 
web. 
One of the difficulties is this.  Although that type of 
technology is easily obtained in a large urban centre, it is just 
now that we are having an opportunity to place that 
infrastructure into rural Canada. Those types of things are 
important.  I would like to see that type of initiative continued 
through the next year.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about the investments we made in the Business 
Development Bank of Canada.  That was an excellent example where 
we saw a targeted program aimed specifically at tourism operators 
operating in rural areas.  That is the kind of initiatives that I 
talk about when I say we need to design our programming in a way 
that reflects the needs of rural Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the same thing when we saw the extra investment made in 
the Farm Credit Corporation, again recognizing the needs of rural 
Canadians, recognizing the need to develop programs that are in 
the best interest of rural Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am asking for unanimous consent for a motion that has 
been agreed to by all parties in this House, seconded by the

John, Winnipeg North Centre and Laval East.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK290">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
consider the request of the Famous Five Foundation to honour the 
memory of Emily Murphy, Nellie McClung, Irene Parlby, Louise 
McKinney, Henrietta Muir Edwards, the Famous Five, by allowing a 
statue commemorating them to be placed on Parliament Hill. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member for 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore have the unanimous consent of the House to 
propose the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I hear no consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resuming debate, the Parliament Secretary to Minister of Foreign 
Affairs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK291"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I had the pleasure of 
participating in the hearings of the Standing Committee on 
Finance in Vancouver.  I was impressed by the line from Flaccus 
of fate casting lots for the high and the low.  Everybody came 
along, the high barons of industry, the trade union bureaucrats, 
very powerful people, learned professors and not so interesting 
professors occasionally of economics and journalists, but it was 
an exercise in public participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the report and try to assess how many witnesses 
appeared, how many depositions, the answer is it was an exercise 
in participatory democracy.  I think that is one of the legacies 
of the patriation constitutional process of 1982, the fact that 
one took little steps but they are now becoming further steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of this when I get letters from people saying that 
the MAI project, for example, is being hatched in secret and by 
an elite.  We look at the process with MAI and to become law in 
Canada, we would need a signature on a treaty if and when a text 
is adopted, we would need a ratification of the treaty, we would 
need implementing legislation, federal and provincial I think in 
that case.  That is a lengthy process, which is still incomplete 
in Canada in relation to the Law of the Sea.  We are 14 years 
away from the first signatures, and still incomplete in many 
other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also look at the witnesses who appeared before the standing 
committee of this House on foreign affairs on MAI.  I find 35 
witnesses again covering the whole spectrum of society and the 
whole range of informed opinion on economic matters and 125 
separate depositions.  That is not a secret process. When we 
consider it will be open in the future if and when an agreement 
comes back from the OECD on MAI, the same issue will come again, 
implementing legislation with public debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a process we are engaged in with great success and with 
a large degree of collegiality if we follow the achievements of 
the committees of this House.  I sat on the foreign affairs 
committee this morning.  I noticed on two potentially very 
controversial subjects a consensus resolution was met.  In one 
case it encompassed all parties and in another case all but one. 
That is an achievement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the Standing Committee on Finance on an 
expeditious process with all deliberate speed, producing a report 
and producing some recommendations with considerable substance in 
them. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me, if I may, to comment on the first and general ideas 
here, the commitment to fiscal integrity which was the key point 
in the present government's successful campaign in 1993:  balance 
the budget and reduce the external debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would essentially agree with the tenure of this report as I 
heard witnesses before the committee that Canadians want us to 
hold the line on that.  We want fiscal integrity.  We want a 
balanced budget.  It will be achieved before the end of the 
budget year 1998, several years ahead of our original schedule, 
and we are attacking the external debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Canadians want continued investment in health and 
welfare in the community facilities necessary to maintain a 
healthy and decent society, which means commitments to pensions 
and to medicare, the most single Canadian contribution I think in 
this hemisphere.  Only the German's Bismarck in the late 19th 
century I suppose preceded us, but we have concretized it in a 
way other countries have not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe I will concentrate on a point that is in this report 
but is worth special attention.  The hon. member for Kings—Hants 
referred to it previously.  It is the investment in knowledge, 
the recognition that the next century is a knowledge based 
century and dependent on having an informed, trained, talented 
and imaginative workforce.  The key to job creation is in 
investment in knowledge and research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is known popularly as the Japanese and German syndrome, the 
defeated countries after World War II invested in pure research. 
There are no immediate returns in pure research but five or ten 
years down the road, you know that you are leading in science and 
technology and that your industries that understand this are 
beating all competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That shows up in the foundation for innovation, the $800 million 
for that, developing the infrastructure and rebuilding it in 
medicine, engineering and the sciences, the centres for 
excellence networks, the millennium scholarships, the increased 
relief to student loans and the post-secondary education debt 
relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention that I have had communications from the heads of 
universities in the last few weeks asking me to make the case for 
maintaining the grants to the federal granting agencies, the NRC, 
the SSHRC and the Canada Council.  There was a time in western 
Canada when we complained that these bodies had a certain eastern 
Canadian mentality, that the grants seemed heavily weighted in 
favour of what we call central Canada.  I am happy to say that 
the university presidents tell me that this is being corrected 
and has been corrected in large measure and they would like to 
see the grants returned to full vigour; that is to say, the 
equivalent in 1997-98 of what the grants were before the cuts. I 
would endorse that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intelligent choice of projects in which to invest is the key 
to an intelligent and reasoned approach to developing our science 
and technology for the next century.  I think this is a 
recommendation that could come forward from the House to the 
government in the elaboration of the next budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we were making the case for Triumph, the $167.5 million 
grant to the University of British Columbia base research in 
folic physics and particle physics, one had to explain what this 
was about, but the most telling argument was the spin-off in high 
talent, high intelligence based industries in British Columbia. 
We were able to point to a $200 million export contract 
enrichment in one year alone and the jobs that it brought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is the key to what we are talking about.  If we are 
competing with other countries which have larger population bases 
and perhaps larger resources in other areas, we do it by 
increasing our investment in education, by making it not really 
up to world standards but making an issue of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings us to one other area which I raised in my question 
to the member for Kings—Hants. 
I think it is necessary to have a federal role of leadership in 
education, in science and research.  It is not merely a matter of 
creating the national standard, it is not merely a matter of 
bringing economically less favoured provinces up to national 
standards.  One remembers Nova Scotia, which is certainly not a 
wealthy province, but for many years it was considered the cradle 
of education in Canada and there was an extra degree of devotion 
among Nova Scotians who were poor but honest, some say, to 
education. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, look, that is falling away when one looks at the position 
of the universities and colleges in Nova Scotia.  So, a federal 
role is necessary and there is a certain sense of equalization in 
education, but much more I think the vision for what is needed in 
terms of international competitive industry and the research base 
in science, technology and engineering that will be the 
precondition for that.  I think that requires a federal 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My plea in the budget, as is recognized in the Standing 
Committee on Education, is to make sure that this is a 
recognition of the knowledge century and the investment we must 
make in funding the science, technology and pure research with 
the skilled people who bring that to a conclusion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK292"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>   Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the hon. member on his provocative discussion about the 
importance of education and his position and opinion relative to 
the potential of the federal role in terms of leadership in some 
areas of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is quite right that Nova Scotia was a cradle of 
education and to a certain extent, perhaps, that led to the 
intelligence of the electorate in the recent election.  However, 
I am not certain of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the disparity that exists in education, not just 
between provinces, but between areas and counties in provinces, 
we need to recognize that to a considerable extent the investment 
in education is based on local tax bases.  Wealthy communities 
can invest considerably more locally in education than poorer 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up in a wonderful, picturesque part of Nova Scotia, but 
an area that is very economically depressed.  In that area, there 
were 30 students who came out of grade six at the time I did and 
only ten ever graduated from high school. For me it is 
extraordinarily important that we ensure educational 
opportunities exist in very community Canada. I believe the 
federal government can play a role in providing leadership to 
ensure that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would perhaps cite to 
the hon. member a remark that the former Prime Minister, Mr. 
Trudeau, made when he was still Prime Minister, just before his 
retirement when he received an honorary degree from Dalhousie 
University.  He said with great wit and great truth when he 
looked at the record of the alumni of Dalhousie University and 
the roles of leadership they held in national politics in Canada, 
he wondered how he had got so far himself without having a degree 
from Dalhousie University. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the wit is a large element of truth.  The maritimes invested 
very heavily in education. But it is time to recognize the 
disparities in wealth and financing since it simply operates to a 
severe disadvantage today.  I do believe that we are into a 
system where the federal government may need to deal directly 
with the municipal school authorities in this area.  This looks 
for more imaginative and mannered approaches to co-operative 
federalism which was an idea of the 1950s and 1960s, now being 
revived.  However, I think it needs a little more structure and 
sophistication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think his plea for the maritimes would be supported by this 
side of the House also.  I thank the member for that observation.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, notwithstanding Standing Order 24(2) or any other usual

after the hour of 5.30 p.m.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member have the 
unanimous consent of the House to propose the motion to extend 
the hours of sitting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There is no unanimous consent. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appeal to the Chair. 
Earlier I saw a member indicate he did not agree.  There was, 
however, unanimous consent on the motion of my hon. colleague, but 
the person who did not give his consent was not even in his seat. 
So I do not understand why his remark would be recognized.  I 
therefore believe that there is unanimous consent and I would ask 
you to reconsider the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair holds that one dissenting voice 
determines the matter. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair does not inquire about where a member is sitting in 
the House when a question is put seeking unanimous consent.  The 
Chair asked for unanimous consent.  An hon. member said no, and I 
am afraid that determines the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair is not in a position to determine whether a member was 
in his seat or not for the purposes of that and, indeed, members 
do not have to rise to say no.  The question is put to the House 
and the answers come back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret the circumstances are that I cannot entertain the 
motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I realize in about a minute 
things moved rather quickly.  I wonder if you might agree to 
review the tapes of the last five minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I observed, and I may be mistaken, was that the member 
from Etobicoke—Lakeshore asked for unanimous consent and nobody 
said no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe you then asked if the motion is adopted.  At that 
point somebody who was not in the House when the motion was moved 
came into the House and essentially voted no, but not from his 
seat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just asking, Mr. Speaker, whether you might review what was 
said in the last five minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member is quite correct. 
Because there were other items moved immediately following, the 
Chair abandoned because the House seemed to abandon the attempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion the hon. member for Etobicoke—Lakeshore sought to 
put before the House was agreed to be put to the House.  I then 
put the motion and a member said no when I put the motion to the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is a debatable motion.  I can put the motion to the 
House again if the House is willing to do that.  The difficulty 
we are facing is that it is going to take unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is unanimous consent that the motion be put to the House. 
Perhaps the hon. member for Etobicoke—Lakeshore, having obtained 
that consent, could have her motion delivered to the Chair and I 
will put the question to the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That notwithstanding Standing Order 24(2) or any other usual

</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
<P><A NAME="LINK304"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do 
not think I have ever fought this hard before to speak in the 
House of Commons but it is a pleasure to rise to speak today 
during the debate on the prebudget report issued recently by the 
finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the finance committee was very successful in hearing from 
groups like the Business Council on National Issues and in 
hearing from many social activists across the country, I really 
believe that where the finance committee failed was in hearing 
from the 70% or 80% of Canadians who are in the middle of those 
two groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make my point by reading from a letter.  I do not think 
we will find the views expressed in that letter reflected 
anywhere in the finance committee report.  This letter was 
originally sent to the hon. member for Cariboo—Chilcotin who 
recognized its importance immediately: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am writing in regard to the increase in CPP.  I am a housewife 
with two small children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My husband works 12 hour days, six or seven days a week.  Even 
with all the hours my husband works we are only making ends meet. 
We cannot afford an increase in CPP.  This increase only means 
my husband has to work even harder.  Which means we will see even 
less of him.  How is this good for my two children?  How is this 
good for our marriage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government borrows or should I say steals from the CPP fund 
and then increases it because they can't pay it back.  Why do we 
have to pay for a dishonest government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They preach about how they want to save our children.  They 
preach about broken marriages.  Then they turn around and screw 
us again.  Couples stress about money and it does affect the 
children.  It does affect the marriage.  How can afford to put my 
children in swimming lessons or baseball when any extra money we 
have the government takes?  My oldest son is five and has said to 
me “Why can't I Mommy? We can't afford it, right?” This is from 
a 5 year old.  All his friends at school get hot lunches on 
Fridays but he doesn't.  How are we supposed to dish out another 
$100 a month?  I can't work because of all the hours my husband 
works.  Why should I have to?  I want to raise my children not a 
daycare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My husband is 34 and I convinced him to finally vote this year. 
We had many an argument about it.  He said why should he bother 
voting when nothing ever changes. 
A lot of people feel this way.  I am beginning to think he is 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have rent, house insurance, truck insurance, life insurance, 
hydro, gas, phone, food, truck payments.  These are basic bills. 
As for fun, what's that?  Will CPP even be there when my husband 
retires?  I doubt it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a friend who at 28 is having to declare bankruptcy.  She 
has three children.  I know that it could be us. Kids are in 
trouble today more than ever because parents aren't there.  They 
have to work harder and longer so the kids are on their own.  The 
future looks bleaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something has to be done about this CPP.  Canada is on its way 
to ruin the way I see it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is signed Margaret Snell of Quesnel, British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to argue that people like Margaret Snell simply were not 
represented before the finance committee.  People like Margaret 
Snell did not have their views represented in the government's 
report on the prebudget hearings.  It is not only Margaret Snell. 
I believe that there are hundreds of thousands, in fact 
millions, of Canadians who feel exactly the same way as Margaret 
Snell feels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should the government do when it hears letters like the one 
I just read from Margaret Snell or the one which my leader read 
yesterday from Kim Hicks of Sackville, New Brunswick?  If the 
government had the sense that God gave the goose, the first thing 
it would do is secure the future of people like Margaret Snell, 
Kim Hicks and other people who are suffering by first taking the 
debt situation seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day the chairman of the finance committee rose in his 
place to speak about what the finance committee heard.  I know 
that my hon. friend will acknowledge that we heard representative 
after representative come before the committee to say that the 
debt is a real problem and that we should do something about it. 
In fact, the government report even says that it is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the recommendation?  The recommendation was to continue 
with the promise made during the election campaign, which is to 
allocate 50% of the surplus for more spending.  It is absolutely 
incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that when major polls are conducted across the country 
Canadians say that debt is an incredible problem.  We have to 
deal with the debt.  As my leader pointed out yesterday, when 
people have a little tax relief, what do they do with it?  They 
pay down their personal debt.  Of course they do.  It is common 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government do?  It has a huge agenda to start 
spending again, but does it have any plan on what to do with the 
debt? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government suggests that maybe it will reduce the debt to 
50% or 60% of GDP by some point in the future.  What exactly does 
that mean?  It did not commit to putting a single dollar toward 
the debt in absolute terms. The government suggests that maybe if 
the economy grows fast enough the debt will look smaller as a 
percentage of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very first thing the government should do is borne out by 
polls, letters and telephone calls which we received.  The very 
first thing the government should do is secure the future of 
people like Margaret Snell, Kim Hicks and hundreds of thousands 
of other people by starting to pay down the debt.  The government 
should have a serious plan to pay down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I want to make is that the government should 
find a way to secure the future prosperity of Canadians.  The way 
to do that is very obvious.  After having read Margaret Snell's 
letter and after having heard Kim Hicks' letter, it should be 
obvious to the government as well.  It needs to start reducing 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a tax burden in this country which is absolutely 
staggering.  In the last four years, since the government came to 
power, Canadians have seen their disposable incomes drop like a 
stone.  We know that since the government came to power 
disposable income for the average family in this country has 
fallen by over $3,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why it that?  It is because taxes continue to mount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends across the way stand every day and say they have cut 
taxes.  If people across the country really believe that the 
government has cut taxes, I have a bridge that I would like to 
sell them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People do not believe that.  I do not believe that.  We know 
that government revenues have gone up $25 billion in the last few 
years.  We also know that the government has introduced 37 tax 
increases.  We know that because income tax is not indexed for 
inflation, effectively there is an inflation tax in place which 
brings in just under a billion dollars in new revenues every year 
because people are pushed up into a higher tax bracket.  We know 
all of those things.  So how in the world can the government find 
the courage to say that somehow it has reduced taxes?  Frankly, I 
do not think anybody believes it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that in Canada today we have personal income taxes that 
compared to our G-7 trading partners are 54% higher.  I do not 
believe for a moment that the government members across the way 
in their heart of hearts feel and can even persuasively argue 
that the government really has reduced taxes.  I do not think 
Canadians are buying that at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go over a couple of things which were said by my 
leader yesterday when he said we provided some tax relief for a 
family in New Brunswick.  When that family in New Brunswick had a 
chance to spend that money, what did they spend it on?  They paid 
off some personal debt.  They set aside about a third of the 
money.  Then they spent some on essentials like medical needs and 
groceries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know better than this government what their priorities 
are.  They should have the chance to direct where that money 
goes, to keep it in their pockets in the first place.  That is 
why the Reform Party has been at the forefront of advocating 
lower taxes for all Canadians so that we can start to give 
Canadians the real hope that they need, the real hope that they 
have been deprived of over the last 10 years under successive 
Liberal and Conservative governments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK305"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank the Reform Party's finance critic for that 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As usual, using a very personalized example of how taxes, debt 
and deficits impact on a family and on an individual makes it 
much more meaningful than a long list of statistics. What the 
member has shown us today is a fine example, or maybe a very poor 
example, of what happens when governments dip into the pockets of 
Canadians.  The old joke is that it was so cold last winter we 
actually saw the finance minister with his hands in his own 
pockets for a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians understand. They do not buy this idea that taxes have 
plateaued, that the light at the end of the tunnel is anything 
other than an oncoming tax train. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to talk specifically about user fees and 
the hidden taxes that the government keeps denying it has 
increased.  He mentioned several of them, for instance bracket 
creep.  Who is the biggest bracket creep in Canada.  There is the 
issue of these hidden taxes whether they be tariffs or other 
things we do not see when we pick up the groceries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition there are user fees. I wonder if the finance critic 
could talk to us about that problem.  It is another hidden tax 
that is eating away at a family's ability to look after itself 
and has contributed to that $3,000 drop in income the average 
Canadian has sustained in the last three or four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be brief because 
my time is running out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 10 years user fees have increased by about 100% in 
Canada.  User fees effectively are a tax not only on 
corporations, businesses and all kinds of organizations that use 
government services, but it is a tax in many cases on 
individuals, people who use campgrounds and that kind of thing. 
There is no question the government has set about to raise extra 
revenues that way and because these things do not pass through 
Parliament, it does amount to taxation without representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say one word on the issue of bracket creep.  Recently we 
got a letter from a lady in Abbotsford, British Columbia who was 
having trouble making it on $16,000 a year. 
She pays quite a bit of income tax, even only making $16,000 a 
year.  In fact she had to mortgage her mobile home in order to 
pay the $800 tax bill she owed the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to make the point to my friends around the House 
today that tax relief is a viable way to help a lot of Canadians, 
people at the low end of the income scale. In the spirit of 
Christmas, I urge people to consider this today and to think that 
perhaps there are ways to help people other than initiating a new 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank my colleagues around the House for agreeing to 
let me speak today. I also want to wish them a very Merry 
Christmas and a safe and prosperous New Year. I know we disagree 
in this place, very often quite vehemently on various things but 
I think we all agree that we all want to help Canadians.  I want 
to express my best wishes to all my friends in the House today.

colleagues for agreeing to seeing that this first hour of debate 
will continue after hearing from the various political parties on 
Motion No. 75. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion has been put and the general intent has been 
indicated.  Basically, it is to find an avenue to recognize those 
men and women who were part of the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who were these people?  In response, the Mac-Paps as they were 
often referred to, were a unit of some 1,300 volunteer soldiers 
from all parts of Canada who banded together to go abroad to 
fight the enemies of democracy, the fascist powers of Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was 1936 when the Spanish Civil War began, when the forces of 
Franco overthrew Spain's democratically elected republican 
government.  With the help of support from Nazi Germany and from 
fascist Italy, the Spanish Civil War was under way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People from Canada became aware of this conflict.  They became 
aware of the threat of fascism and the rise of Nazi Germany. 
They felt that this was the beginning of what was to be an 
eventual major conflict in the free world, a conflict of free 
democratic voices against those of fascism.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The call went out.  Volunteers from coast to coast in Canada 
joined after information rallies and so on and left Canada.  They 
left their families, left their jobs, left their communities to 
fight in a foreign country against what they felt was a threat to 
freedom and a threat to democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was 1936. At the time the government of the day passed 
legislation called the Foreign Enlistment Act, 1936.  This act 
made volunteers who fought in foreign wars criminals.  One would 
have to know Canadian history to acknowledge that at the time 
there were many people within the Government of Canada who were 
somewhat sympathetic in particular to the rise of Hitler in 
Germany. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history books will reveal that many political leaders in 
Canada thought the rise of fascism was quite fashionable and 
quite acceptable. As a matter of fact, in many of the major 
cities of Canada fascism was very popular.  It was not uncommon 
to find fascist organizations organizing fascist meetings with a 
great deal of popular support throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Foreign Enlistment Act was passed in 1936 which made it 
illegal for volunteers to fight on the side of democracy and 
freedom in the Spanish Civil War. In spite of that, 1,300 people 
volunteered to go. They felt they had to defy their government in 
an effort to stand up for justice and what was right in this 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say now with the benefit of hindsight that the 
Spanish Civil War in many ways was the dress rehearsal for the 
second world war.  It was an early test of the resolve of the 
free world to make a stand against those forces wishing to crush 
democracy. We know now in retrospect that certainly was the case. 
The forces of fascism throughout Europe rose up shortly 
thereafter and it was just a matter of time before Canadians were 
involved in fighting fascism in a variety of ways and on a 
variety of fronts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We read these days about the conflict, about the incredible 
heroism, the unbelievable personal sacrifices Canadians made when 
they went to fight in this war.  They often fought with outmoded 
weapons and in some cases fought with no weapons at all.  They 
were fighting against the Luftwaffe. The Nazi Luftwaffe would 
sweep over Franco's Spain and bomb the units that were fighting 
on behalf of the republic.  Mussolini sent his naval forces and 
so on to bombard the cities and bombard the trenches where the 
freedom fighters were fighting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an incredibly bloody conflict.  It was in 1936 and it is 
fair to say it was before any sort of modern medical application 
was available on the fronts of war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly enough, one of the Canadians who distinguished 
himself, and there were many Canadians, was Dr. Norman Bethune. 
He revolutionized battlefield blood transfusions which saved the 
lives of countless of his fellow volunteers and ever since, 
future generations of soldiers fighting in war. It was then that 
Norman Bethune almost became a legend in his own time. He 
travelled from coast to coast to raise support for the republican 
forces, to raise finances and to encourage people to enlist.  He 
almost became a cult figure among those people who were fighting 
for freedom and democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The casualty rate was staggering. The suffering was 
unbelievable.  Many of my colleagues in the House of Commons are 
well aware of the nature of those battles.  They are documented 
in a number of ways.  A number of my colleagues are scholars in 
this area so I will not elaborate at this point.  I know we will 
hear others talk about the casualties of the Spanish Civil War 
and the recognition that one-quarter of all of the Canadian 
volunteers were killed or presumed dead by 1939.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the darker sides of the issue was that when many of the 
Mac-Paps who survived the Spanish Civil War and later sought to 
enlist in our armed forces to continue the fight against fascism 
in Europe and elsewhere, they were turned away for being 
politically unreliable individuals.  They were identified by 
government and by the RCMP as being suspect.  Their heroic 
contributions were overwhelmed by the fact that they actually 
experienced outright discrimination when they returned home to 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who prized freedom and democracy acknowledged their 
contribution and acknowledge that these folks were fighting for 
the things that have made our country great.  Nevertheless they 
were treated terribly by those in power and influence at the 
time.  They were subjected to police surveillance because of 
their suspected political connections and political aspirations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in Canada there is only a handful of these survivors left. 
Remember that this was in 1936.  They were young people at the 
time.  Some were not necessarily that young.  Almost all of them 
have passed away regretful that their contribution to the fight 
against fascism was never acknowledged, recognized or appreciated 
in a formal way by the Government of Canada and by other levels 
of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago a memorial was erected at Queen's Park in Toronto 
on the lawns of parliament in recognition of their contribution. 
As we speak, funds are being raised in the city of Vancouver to 
erect a statue to acknowledge the contribution these individuals 
made in the fight against fascism and the rise of Nazi Germany. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not done anything as a federal presence.  As a country 
we have not acknowledged the fact that these folks made a 
contribution that we have later acknowledged and became involved 
directly, the conflict now known as the second world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion is seconded by a number of colleagues from various 
political parties.  It simply asks that the matter be referred to 
the appropriate committee of the House for study.  Whether it is 
to give full veterans benefits to the survivors, of which there 
are probably not more than 40; whether it is to recognize the 
contribution these individuals made or some other form of 
recognition and support at this twilight time in their lives, we 
are open to whatever initiative would be appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than seal off this issue with a negative speech today, we 
should at least keep it open and keep a dialogue happening 
between ourselves as political parties and as elected 
representatives to find some acceptable way to recognize the 
tremendous sacrifices and the tremendous contribution made by the 
individuals called the Mac-Paps against the rise of Nazism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe it to these individuals.  There are probably no more than 
40 left in all of Canada.  Therefore the cost is infinitesimal. I 
think it would be appropriate to seek some method of saying 
thanks to the people who led the way in our Canadian fight 
against fascism and their fight for freedom and democracy.

Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be able to debate this motion. I 
probably find myself in the position of many members of the

the type of initiative that many members, regardless of political 
persuasion, can have some sympathy with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface, Motion No. 75 would seem to have merit.  After 
all, who cannot be sympathetic with the notion of offering some 
care and comfort to a small group of elderly Canadians who in 
their youth laid their lives on the line to fight fascism in 
Europe. 
It would surely be an act of generosity for caring Canadians. 
After all what harm could it do?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish life were as simple as that:  make a decision to call 
these men veterans, put them on benefits, and that is the end of 
it.  Of course that would not be the end of the issue.  It would 
be the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls for the government to consider the advisability 
of giving these man, the Mac-Paps, veterans status.  I assume it 
follows that the sponsoring member would wish this consideration 
to lead to such a designation.  Unfortunately the motion and its 
implication is really a non-starter from the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs studied the issue a 
decade ago and in its final report stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the committee's view that while the presentation may 
portray these issues in black and white, when all facts are 
looked at in perspective the situation is by no means as clear 
cut as those who appeared before us wished us to believe. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a clear cut issue at all.  My first difficulty is the 
tendency to revisit history and through today's sensibilities try 
to apply retroactive judgments about who fought on the right side 
and who fought on the wrong side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the tide of history would not allow us to say that the 
Mac-Paps fought on the right side, the fact of the matter is that 
they took up arms on their own volition.  Canada was not at war 
with Spain.  We had laws on the books prohibiting our citizens 
from fighting in foreign wars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that there were Canadians who fought on the other 
side.  What about them?  We had and continue to have no veterans 
benefits for those who volunteered to fight on foreign shores 
under a flag that was not their own.  Yet the motion would have 
us consider that this group of fighting men, out of all other 
Canadians who have fought in wars under foreign flags, deserve 
the same status as veterans who fought under Canada's banner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day we are left to conclude that acceptance of 
the motion implies and would require Canada to pay veterans 
benefits to any person who participates in any foreign conflict 
because he or she sincerely believes he or she is doing the right 
thing.  Lest members think that I exaggerate the possibilities, I 
suggest that granting of veterans benefits to one group of men 
who fought for what they believed to be a just cause would open 
the floodgates for many other groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member's motion did come to pass, are there other 
unintended consequences?  What would it cost?  I am sure there 
are less than 100 Mac-Paps left.  Perhaps less.  One might think 
the cost would be minimal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what the exact figures are, but to grant them the 
same veterans benefits as their Canadian counterparts would not 
be cheap.  They could be eligible for disability benefits, war 
veterans allowances, comprehensive medical care and a subsidized 
long term residential care.  Would we make these benefits 
retroactive?  If so, retroactive to when?  Which dependants would 
be eligible for what benefits?  I do not know what the final 
price tag would be but it could be a lot steeper than we would 
guess at first glance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not even begin to touch the horrendous administrative 
implications.  Since the Mac-Paps did not serve in Canadian 
forces there are no personnel or medical files for them.  It 
would, therefore, be impossible to verify whether any disability 
claims were war service related. 
In fact, it would be practically impossible to verify whether any 
particular individual even served with the Mac-Paps, given that 
the Canadian government kept no registry of the volunteers.  Nor 
would any of the unit's official records likely have survived the 
defeat in Spain.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If therefore the proposed motion were adopted and led to veteran 
status for the Mac-Paps, extremely generous presumptive rules 
would have to be included in the legislation to allow the 
Department of Veterans Affairs to accept the flimsiest of 
evidence in any claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada recognizes as its veterans those who served Canada or its 
allies in a war in which Canada was a combatant.  That is how it 
has always been and that is how it should remain.  To widen 
eligibility to those who fought for other nations, in other 
uniforms, would not be fair to those Canadian veterans who served 
their country and to those who continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To open the benefits to special cases has terribly serious and 
detrimental consequences, not only at home but abroad where we 
portray ourselves as an independent and neutral nation.  It would 
suggest that we are not neutral and that Canadians can fight for 
any nation and return home to receive Canadian benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case for voting in the affirmative on the motion does not 
hold up.  As the standing committee stated 10 years ago: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is without regard to the rights or wrongs of the action of 
those Canadians who are veterans of the Spanish Civil War.  They 
cannot be considered in the same light as Canadians who served in 
the wars in which Canada was involved as a nation.  Consequently, 
there can be no thought of treating them in the same manner by 
making them eligible for benefits under veterans legislation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee's recognition of this fact remains no 
less true today than it did when it issued its report in 1987. 
Therefore the motion cannot pass reasonable scrutiny.  It should 
not be passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK311"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in my duty as the loyal opposition critic for 
veterans affairs.  It is an honour for me to address the motion 
before the House.  I begin by thanking the hon. member for 
Kamloops for moving the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential for us to remember our history.  As we have 
heard so often, those who do not remember their history are 
doomed to repeat it.  As parliamentarians we have a special duty 
to ensure that the past informs the present and helps to shape 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to celebrate the memory of those 
Canadians who fought in Spain in the 1930s.  They took part in a 
pivotal part of our history.  I believe it is appropriate that we 
recognize their valour and ensure their memory as part of our 
history, but I cannot agree with the motion put forward for the 
simple reason that it would not be appropriate for the members of 
the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion to have the status of Canadian 
war veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was not a combatant in the Spanish Civil War.  Indeed the 
Liberal government of the day enacted legislation to make 
participation on either side an offence.  With the 20:20 
hindsight provided by almost 60 years, we may object to this and 
feel that it was unfair.  However this does not change the fact 
that these brave men were not members of a Canadian official 
force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need not think too long or too hard to see what a difficult 
precedent could be set by such an action.  At any time there are 
unfortunately dozens of declared and undeclared wars being fought 
around the world.  More than almost any other people, Canadians 
recognize the importance of world events in their lives.  As a 
multicultural country, most of us have connections to some part 
of the world where conflicts occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not in any way want to encourage Canadians to feel that 
they have some sanction to take part in the conflicts in places 
such as Afghanistan, Algeria or Angola, or to promote violence in 
places like Ireland.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need only to think back a few years to the conflict in the 
former Yugoslavia.  Canada has strong and vital communities of 
people of Serbian and Croatian heritage.  We certainly did not 
sanction any reflection of ethnic tensions here.  We value our 
role as a sanctuary of peace and democracy.  We gave generously 
to charities that sought to help the victims of the war.  As 
always, Canada played a central role in the international effort 
of the United Nations in trying to prevent conflict and protect 
civilians in Croatia and Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we are more enlightened today than in 1936.  Canada is 
deeply involved in the work of the United Nations peacekeeping 
forces that have played an important role in avoiding conflict in 
the Middle east, Cyprus, Croatia and Bosnia to name a few.  Even 
today we insist that those Canadians who want to help should do 
so through the proper channels of the United Nations.  In matters 
of war we do not freelance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the opposition critic for veterans affairs, I am proud to 
play a role in remembering the sacrifices of the veterans of the 
Canadian Armed Forces.  This past November I participated as a 
member of the delegation of veterans, young people, military and 
government representatives that travelled to France and Belgium. 
We attended the ceremony and remembrance at the Newfoundland 
Beaumont-Hamel Memorial to commemorate the war dead of the Royal 
Newfoundland Regiment.  We also attended the Ceremony of 
Remembrance at the Vimy Memorial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ceremonies were very moving and emotional and I would be 
proud to participate in efforts to ensure the memory of the 
Mac-Paps is part of this heritage.  Our level of knowledge about 
the first and second world wars is fairly good.  Places and names 
such as Vimy, Flanders and Dieppe resonate in the Canadian mind. 
But Canadians played a role in other international conflicts 
going back as far as the Boer War in South Africa.  These efforts 
are not as prominent in our history books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Kamloops has provided us with an opportunity 
to reflect on one of the pivotal points of the 20th century and 
the part played in it by Canadians.  The Spanish Civil War has a 
special place in the art and literature of the western world as 
well as the history.  Anyone who has read Hemingway's <I>For Whom 
the Bell Tolls</I> or Orwell's <I>Homage to the Catalonia</I>  has 
an idea of the passion that motivated these Canadians to take 
part in fighting the forces of fascism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many people on the left of the political spectrum, such as 
the hon. member for Kamloops, there is a romantic element in the 
principled fight against overwhelming odds.  This same spirit 
prevailed in 1936 when 1,239 men went to Spain with the full 
knowledge that they were bucking the system and going against the 
wishes of the government of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is not so well remembered is what is documented in the 
second half of <I>Homage to Catalonia</I> where the communists, 
anarchists and socialists turned on each other and destroyed any 
chance they had to effectively oppose Franco's nationalists.  The 
dream of international communism was betrayed by Stalin and 
others.  Orwell and many other veterans of the International 
Brigades felt betrayed and only a few short years later Hitler's 
Germany and Mussolini's Italy used the techniques they developed 
in Spain like the divebombing of the Basque town of Guernica in 
the second world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure all members of this House support the important work 
of our veterans organizations in educating young Canadians about 
their past and about the horrors of war and about the stories of 
their parents, grandparents and great grandparents. This is a 
role that has been played by the veterans of the 
Mackenzie—Papineau Brigade.

Quebecois critic for veterans affairs, I am pleased to rise today to

</I></B></P><P align=left>The MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion, named after the leaders of the 
1837 rebellion in Upper and Lower Canada, was made up of 1,300 Canadian 
volunteers who served in the international brigades to support the 
Republican government against the authority of fascist dictator General 
Franco during the Spanish Civil War, between 1936 and 1939. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of their sacrifices and their individual heroism, 
Canadian veterans of the international brigades are still not recognized 
as war veterans. As a result, they have never been eligible for 
veterans' benefits and, more importantly, their merit in defending the 
freedom and democracy that we, in Canada, enjoy and benefit from today 
was never recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this motion is therefore to ask that official 
recognition be given to the courage of the men and women who did not 
wait for the government's formal approval to fight for our fundamental 
freedoms and against the horrors of fascism. These Canadians went to 
Spain, where they risked their lives alongside other brave people from 
around the world to fight for freedom and democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the Spanish Republican forces and the international 
brigades, including the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion, did not win that 
fight, but history tells us that the Spanish war was the prelude to the 
downfall of fascism at the end of World War II in Europe. It seems 
appropriate that these fighters and their willingness to fight for 
justice and democracy be recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dare we ask? Why did Canada not accept to provide assistance to 
Spain at the time? 
Why did it pass the Foreign Enlistment Act on April 10, 1937, one year 
after the beginning of the Spanish Civil War? Why did Maurice Duplessis, 
on March 24, 1937, pass an act to protect the province against 
communistic propaganda, better known as the “Padlock Act”? Why this 
discrimination toward our soldiers when they came back? Why give the 
status of veterans to those who fought in the Vietnam war, but not those 
who did so in Spain? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to answer these questions from a historical perspective. 
It may be that, at the time, Canada was a British colony and England, 
like France, feared a second world war. It may be because the 
battalion's name was MacKenzie-Papineau, in memory of the 1837 
rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada. As we know, these patriots yearned 
for freedom and democracy, something which may not have pleased Canadian 
royalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Around 1835, Louis-Joseph Papineau, member of the Patriote Party, 
wanted a democratic and bilingual country open to free trade with the 
United States, a country where Church and State would be independent. At 
the time, each group had its own parliament. Members of parliament in 
both Upper and Lower Canada were elected, but they did not have any 
executive power. This power was exercised by the governor, who was 
appointed by London. This is the main reason why these rebellions took 
place. Quebec was hit first. Villages were burned, hundreds of people 
killed, 1,000 arrested, 108 tried, 60 deported, and 12 hanged. The 
authorities could have hit Upper Canada first, because the rebellions 
were just the same but, when it comes to reprimanding, history tells us 
that it takes place in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Foreign Enlistment Act and Duplessis' Padlock Act were, 
to a large extent, adopted in response to requests from the clergy and 
the right wing. 
It was also to keep the Canadian right happy when these veterans 
returned home that they were subjected to job discrimination and 
RCMP surveillance, and turned down when they tried to enlist at the 
beginning of World War II. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I do not understand why Canada recognizes veterans of 
the war in Vietnam but not the war in Spain.  We had no more 
business being in Vietnam than we did in Spain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I followed with great interest the deliberations of the 
standing committee on veterans affairs in 1986 regarding the 
participation of Canadians in the Spanish Civil War, and the 
testimony shows that the sole interest of the veterans who appeared 
before the committee was to stop the progress of fascism and to 
defend the oppressed.  History proved them right.  The war in Spain 
was the prelude to World War II and the end of two dictators, 
Hitler and Mussolini.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These civil wars between the forces of the right and the 
Spanish Popular Front government began with clashes over economic 
and social structure.  The landowning class, often noblemen, 
dominated a country that was essentially agricultural, poor and 
lacking in social programs.  This upper class relied on a clergy 
that was very rich and, on the whole, very conservative.  It also 
relied on an army whose many officers came from its ranks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people were primarily farmers, an underpaid agricultural 
proletariat, miners or factory workers, and engaged in several 
violent struggles to fight unemployment and low wages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On two occasions, the working class had managed to assume 
democratic power and to implement social, military, ecclesiastical 
and agrarian reform, early release from the army, the separation of 
Church and State, some degree of autonomy for Catalonia, and 
universal education.  I should point out as well that this was a 
time of heavy ideological struggles between communists, fascists 
and liberalists just about everywhere, but in Europe in particular. 
In 1934, those reforms were abolished after the right assumed 
power, but when the left returned in 1936 and these programs were 
resumed, the right went into action and the civil war ensued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that war, according to the statistics, 52 countries in 
the world were involved in recruiting 40,000 people for the Spanish 
cause despite the non-intervention agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, history proves that these veterans fought for 
freedom and democracy. 
This civil war was a class struggle between the landowners, the 
army and the clergy on the one side, and the people, the 
proletariat, on the other.  It was also an international 
ideological struggle between communism, fascism and liberalism.  It 
was the prelude to the Second World War and to the downfall of 
fascism and its dictators.  The Mackenzie—Papineau Battalion 
wanted to share that yearning for freedom and democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, I am calling on the government to recognize 
the sincere contribution of these veterans who enlisted in order to 
defend freedom and democracy, and to award to surviving Canadian 
veterans or their widows the benefits to which they would have been 
entitled if they had been regular members of the Canadian Armed 
Forces.

on November 17, I asked the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
about the measures she intended to take to fight the extremely 
serious problem of the arrival in Canada of a number of war 
criminals, people who are guilty of crimes in their country and who 
have applied under Canadian law for refugee status.

1997, the total number of cases of all kinds had increased.  He 
reported that the total was now over 300 cases, and including the 
new files to be considered soon for refugee status, the total would 
no doubt increase significantly in 1997-98.  According to Mr. 
Gordon, if only 1% of the 38,000 new claims pending processing 
involved war crimes, the total number of files to process would 
almost double in very short order.

</I></B></P><P align=left>You must know that in Canada there are nearly 300 people who 
are guilty or could be considered guilty by the war crimes refugee 
status commission.  There is one thing of considerable concern. 
Internationally, Canada has the reputation of giving a special 
welcome to war criminals.  In saying that, I know the government is 
just as concerned as I am about this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Minister of Immigration and Citizenship is not 
pleased to discover that we are a preferred haven for war 
criminals. However, for more than 20 years we have known that all 
sorts of mechanisms have permitted war criminals to come to 
Canada.  Despite all, we must acknowledge that little has been 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will recall that, in 1985, there was a commission of 
inquiry, the Deschênes commission, which looked particularly at 
Nazi war criminals.  It suggested a number of courses of action, 
including amending the Criminal Code, passing tighter measures on 
extradition and, of course, the main measure of ensuring that, when 
someone applied, it would be possible to identify whether they were 
guilty of war crimes.  The moment an individual was identified as 
a war criminal, without the need for an exhaustive investigation as 
is presently the case, expulsion and deportation measures were to 
be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I hope in raising this question is to offer the 
government and the Minister of Immigration and Immigration my full 
support, my participation and my energy so that we may work 
together, outside party lines, because we all know there can be no 
justice.  We will be able to send a clear message around the world 
that Canada will not tolerate war criminals on its soil.  A clear 
message will thoroughly discourage regimes guilty of such crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by saying that currently under the Immigration Act, 
specifically subsection 19(1)—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, Canada is 
constantly making progress in how it treats those who have committed war 
crimes or crimes against humanity, but a lot remains to be done. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's approach to such criminals has always been 
grounded in our commitment to ensure that justice is done and 
that Canada does not become a safe haven for war criminals and 
for those who have committed crimes against humanity now or in 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is seen as a world leader in the detection and removal of 
modern war criminals and has removed more modern war criminals 
than any other western country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, 72 persons have been removed from Canada during the 
past few years.  In addition, hundreds have been excluded by the 
Immigration and Refugee Board from accessing the refugee 
determination system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have prevented many from obtaining visas to enter Canada.  We 
are proud of this accomplishment and we are working hard to build 
on this success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada, CIC, has 
taken measures to improve its ability to address the problem of 
war criminals.  For example, CIC, regions have identified various 
co-ordinators to track modern war criminal cases and ensure they 
are dealt with expeditiously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CIC continually looks for ways to enhance its ability to deal 
with enforcement issues.  CIC works closely with its partners 
such as the Department of Justice, the RCMP and CSIS to ensure 
that information is shared and acted upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protecting the safety and security of the Canadian public will 
always be a top priority for the department.  This is one thing 
we will never compromise on.

<P><A NAME="LINK318"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am told 
I will be the last speaker in the House for 1997. If so, I am very proud 
and honoured to end the proceedings for 1997. As my mother used to say, 
“the important thing is not to always talk, but to have the last 
word”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 4, I asked the minister of Transport a clear question 
on the transportation by train of goods to northern cities such as 
Fermont and Shefferville. To my surprise, the reply was, to say the 
least, off track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked about rail transportation and the Minister of Transport 
told me about the condition of Canada's highways. Of course, the rest of 
his reply did not make sense. The minister said the provincial 
government was responsible for setting priorities to meet the collective 
needs of remote communities. Yet, I was addressing the proper level of 
government, since I was asking about rail transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, when I asked the minister about what measures he intended 
to take in the future, he told me that the federal government has been 
involved in assisting the provinces since 1919 in highway construction, 
which is utterly useless and irrelevant. All this shows that the 
minister never took an interest in the claims made by the chamber of 
commerce of Sept-Îles, which were communicated to him personally more 
than a month ago. 
This is a flagrant lack of interest in helping the people of 
Manicouagan and getting things back to normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Admittedly, the Minister of Transport realized his error.  In 
a letter dated December 9, he apologized for not replying to my 
question and for having given an inaccurate answer.  He assures me 
that officials from his department will look into my allegations 
and report back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could understand that he gave the wrong answer to my 
question, but I cannot forgive him, on behalf of the North Shore 
Quebeckers I represent, for not replying promptly to 
representatives of the Sept-Îles chamber of commerce.  I will 
therefore reiterate the facts, in the interests of advancing our 
cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 5, in other words a little more than a month ago, 
the Sept-Îles chamber of commerce requested the assistance of the 
Minister of Transport in its efforts to ensure the survival of the 
merchants in the region.  It condemned the increase in rail freight 
charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was shown, for instance, that it will now cost $154 to ship 
35 cases of milk from Sept-Îles to Schefferville, rather than $52. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Quebec North Shore & Labrador Railway handed the 
freight monopoly over to the private sector, rates have more than 
doubled.  The federal government has an obligation to ensure that 
companies receiving subsidies meet their obligations.  How can the 
government tolerate this, and not act when it knows that IOC is 
pocketing money for passenger traffic while allowing freight 
charges to skyrocket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Manicouagan, I demand that the government step 
in to re-establish fair freight rates on the Sept-Îles—Labrador 
City route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to reassure people, whether they are from Fermont 
or Schefferville, that they will be able to obtain food as 
economically as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the people in my riding of Manicouagan, and to all 
Quebeckers, my warmest wishes for 1998.  We will be boarding a 
train headed for the year 2000.  It is normal for a self-respecting 
people to have a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, in 
1996 the Canada Transportation Act, CTA, entered into law.  One 
of the main objectives of this bill was to help revitalize the 
rail sector by eliminating unnecessary economic regulation and to 
rely more on commercial arrangements between railways and their 
customers. Under the CTA, subsidies for uneconomic branch lines 
and non-VIA Rail passenger services were eliminated.  This 
included the subsidy for the Quebec North Shore and Labrador 
Railway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government eliminated the statutory subsidies for 
non-VIA passenger services, a commitment was made to ensue 
reasonable passenger rail service to remote communities such as 
Schefferville.  As a result the government entered into 
contractual arrangements with three railways, including the 
Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway, to continue to provide 
passenger rail service to remote communities.

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement specified minimum levels of passenger service such 
as the frequency of trains.  They do not, however, cover all 
details of other operations since these are best left to the 
individual railways that provide the freight and passenger 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the hon. member for Manicouagan raised an issue with 
respect to a decision by the Quebec North Shore and Labrador 
Railway to change its merchandise storage service.  Recognizing 
that the federal role is restricted to its contract with the 
QNS&L for passenger rail services, the Minister of Transport 
noted the concerns raised by the member and has asked officials 
from his department to look into this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has made a commitment to respond directly to the 
member as soon as more details are known.  I would personally 
like to thank the member for Manicouagan for his interest.  I 
lived in Schefferville for a number of years when it was a 
thriving mining town.  One of my daughters was born there.  I 
have travelled this particular railroad scores, not tens, scores 
of times both before Schefferville closed as a mining town and 
since.  I know Sept-Iles, Manicouagan and the North Shore very 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member on giving the last speech in the House 
before the break.
