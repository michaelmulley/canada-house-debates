in a democracy we have the right to protest but we must obey and

</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people who protested peacefully at the summit of the 
Americas in Quebec City were exercising their democratic right. 
However, those people who thought protesting meant throwing 
bottles, bricks, pucks and iron were nothing more than hooligans 
and anarchists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to highly commend our police services, especially the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the provincial police and the 
local municipal regional police forces for an outstanding show of 
restraint, discipline and professionalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just for a moment, imagine how police in most countries in the

coupled with the heavy burden and task of protecting 34 heads of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
recently the Dutch parliament passed a law that formally allows a 
medical doctor to euthanize a patient.  This action will set back 
palliative care, which seeks to make the end of life as 
comfortable as possible and breaks the traditional role of doctor 
as helper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first duty as a surgeon was to do no harm.  The Hippocratic 
oath forbids any physician from practising euthanasia.  Having 
practised medicine for 25 years, I personally dealt with terminal 
patients over and over again.  By creative use of drugs, 
companionship and kindness, we always found a way to comfort 
those patients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs to concentrate its resources on palliation for 
terminal patients.  Our patients deserve the best care, not the 
most expedient.

rise in the House today to recognize that Thursday, April 26 will 
mark the 15th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early that morning an explosion occurred in Reactor 4 of the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant.  The release of radiation was 
almost a million times greater than the release at Three Mile 
Island.  As a result of this accident, 125,000 people have died, 
70,000 people have become disabled and tens of thousands of 
hectares of once fertile land are now barren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In compliance with the memorandum of understanding that was 
signed in Ottawa in 1995, the Chernobyl facility was closed on 
December 15, 2000.  In return, the signing countries provided 
much needed financial and technical support to the government of 
Ukraine.  Canada's contribution of $50 million was used to fund 
the shelter implementation plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the Canadian government will continue to support the 
recovery of the Chernobyl area and I ask that hon. members and 
all Canadians take a moment to remember all those affected by 
this disaster.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome—Missisquoi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in July 
1609 Samuel de Champlain discovered the large lake that now 
bears his name, Lake Champlain.  I am proud that this discovery 
of one of our great explorers is located in my riding of 
Brome—Missisquoi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Samuel de Champlain was a true builder, a man who did everything 
possible to make his dreams a reality

Brome—Missisquoi in particular, we are surrounded by men and 
women who work just as hard for the development and growth of 
rural communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, two municipalities in Brome-Missisquoi, Stanbridge 
East near Lake Champlain and Lac Brome, have recently been 
honoured in the community beautification competition “Fleurir le 
Québec”.  They had more than 260 competitors in this prestigious 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate all those involved directly or indirectly in 
these community beautification projects.  In their own way they 
too are builders who bring a new face to our rural areas with 
their creativity and dynamism.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Cheryl Gallant (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, park wardens in our national parks 
have a proud tradition of service.  The decision by Parks Canada 
to replace wardens with RCMP officers at double the cost of fully 
training and equipping a park warden does not resolve the problem 
of unsafe working conditions.  Issuing shotguns to patrolling 
wardens only heightens the potential for violence when a 
non-confrontational approach is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that you cannot look at the activity to determine 
the danger.  Risk is determined by a subject's behaviour. 
Therefore, being told to back away by Parks Canada management is 
not appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pending decision to locate a detachment of RCMP officers in 
every national park in Canada is costly and unnecessary and, in 
the case of Ontario and Quebec, an unacceptable intrusion into 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage should do the right thing and 
allow park wardens the right to bear sidearms.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am deeply honoured by 
the support of my colleagues and surprised at the support from 
the Liberals but I do appreciate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was only yesterday that we learned that one of the biggest 
high tech employers in Canada has laid off another 2,500 workers. 
Every day we get reports that growth in the economy is slowing 
down.  The dollar is in difficulty.  There is neglect by 
government.  Consumer confidence is down.  Even the auditor 
general some time ago asked the question:  Who is minding the 
store? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What specific steps are being taken to restore the confidence of 
Canadians in the economy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first, let me simply say to the Leader of the Opposition 
that he should not be a bit surprised by the great support that 
the government has for his position and his remaining in that 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of who is minding the store, when the store was being 
minded by somebody else here in the House, yesterday the Prime 
Minister gave the following quote, which answers the hon. 
member's question.  This is a quote from the IMF.  It says  “The 
strong policy framework in place has positioned the real and 
financial economy to cope with any new major economic shock”. 
Then, the IMF goes on to say “The Canadian authorities are to be 
highly commended by their policy accomplishments”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister and the Minister 
of Finance love to talk about the IMF.  I am sure that pleases 
certain bankers and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I wonder if the minister is aware what Canadians said 
recently in the Minister of Finance's own polling conducted by 
the folks at Earnscliffe.  The poll shows that only a third of 
Canadians feel that they are better off now than they were four 
years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never mind what the bankers are saying.  They are delighted with 
the interest payments that keep coming from a government that 
neglects debt, but only a third of Canadians think they are 
better off than they were four years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government doing in specific steps to restore 
consumer and investor confidence? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member perhaps ought to go back to his numbers. 
Real disposable income in Canada is up.  In fact real disposable 
income per family is now at a record level in Canada.

more in their pocket now than they would have had three to four 
months ago.

Minister of Finance.  His own polling shows that only a third of 
Canadians feel they are better off now than they were four years 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether the Minister of Finance or the Prime Minister 
could tell us, in terms of the accountability that comes from 
having to table a budget, how many of the presidents from the 
Americas who were present in Quebec did the Prime Minister or the 
finance minister advise that we do not need to have a full and 
accountable budget month after month, maybe up to 24 months?  How 
many presidents did they advise to say that was good policy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, at the meeting of the finance ministers of the western 
hemisphere, two weeks prior to the Quebec summit, we did discuss 
this.  The vast majority of the finance ministers said that it 
was a remarkable turnaround the Canadian economy had seen with 
the elimination of the deficit, the largest paydown of debt in 
Canadian history and the largest reduction of taxes in Canadian 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, most of the finance ministers would have agreed with 
the conference board today which said that the first quarter of 
2001 was one of those rare moments in history when a huge dose of 
fiscal stimulus was actually occurring at exactly the time that 
it was needed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the finance minister talks about a huge paydown in 
debt.  He has paid down less than half of the amount of debt that 
he added to the national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we learned from Statistics Canada that the leading 
economic indicator has dropped for the fourth straight month.  We 
also know that retail sales have slipped.  Manufacturing 
shipments are down by 19% over the past four months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can he continue to talk about a rosy scenario when all the 
economic indicators are on a downslide? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have made it very clear that the signals are mixed. In 
fact we are monitoring the situation very closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just think that it is really incumbent upon the hon. member as 
well to be balanced and not to be fear mongering.  He talks about 
retail sales.  He is wrong.  Retail sales were up 1% above the 
fourth quarter of the year 2000.  His facts are wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the payment of debt, the Alliance Party recommended 
that we pay down debt by an average of $6 billion a year.  The 
fact is that we have paid down debt by $7 billion on average over 
the last four years, $1 billion more than it ever thought it 
could do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, wrong again.  We proposed a legislated minimum of $6 
billion a year, which would add up to a whole lot more, with 75% 
of unanticipated surpluses going to debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talks about the IMF report which reported that over 
the last three years our productivity growth has been about a 
third of the productivity growth in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister continue to say that Canada is leading the 
world when in fact our major trading partner sees its 
productivity growing three times as fast as here in Canada 
because of his high tax high debt policies? 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I just want to understand this legislated debt paydown. 
Is that the legislated debt paydown that the then Alberta 
treasurer, now Leader of the Opposition, brought in when he was 
the treasurer of Alberta and then had to amend six months later 
when he could not hit the target?  Is that what he is talking 
about?

create the Canada Information Office, which is mostly active in

celebrating their great democracy clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not a fact that this so-called democracy clause makes

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr.

<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural 
Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to speak to Bill 
C-3 at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian economy is still strong, thanks in part to the 
solid performance of the resource industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian companies in that area are proving that they cannot 
only prosper in the knowledge economy of the 21st century but 
also contribute to its dynamism and vitality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the prosperity of the resource sector should not be 
taken for granted. The industry must be able to make strategic 
decisions and to better position itself on domestic and foreign 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes proposed in Bill C-3 will allow two actors in the 
natural resources sector, namely Cameco Corporation and 
Petro-Canada, to continue contributing to the economic growth and 
environmental stewardship by lifting restrictions that have no 
more reason to be and which prevent them from attracting new 
investments and concluding new strategic alliances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those two companies used to be crown corporations. The 
Government of Canada sold all its shares in Cameco in 1995. It 
has kept an 18% participation in Petro-Canada, but it is a 
carried interest and the government has no say in the management 
of the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of privatization the government imposed 
restrictions on the proprietary interest of the two companies. It 
had good reasons to do so, but some restrictions have since 
outlived their usefulness and only prevent the two companies from 
taking advantage of new business opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, Bill C-3 changes the restrictions imposed on 
share ownership and the disposal of property by the Petro-Canada 
Public Participation Act. It also amends the share ownership 
provisions of the Eldorado Nuclear Limited Reorganization and 
Divestiture Act, which governs Cameco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Petro-Canada, Bill C-3 will raise from 10% to 20% 
the limit on individual shares ownership. Moreover, the 25% limit 
on the total number of shares that can be owned by non-residents 
will be eliminated. In other words, there will be no more 
restriction to the foreign ownership of Petro-Canada's shares, 
except that an individual, of whatever origin, will not be 
allowed to own more than 20% of the shares of the company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the abolition of the limit on foreign ownership, 
Petro-Canada is likely to remain under predominantly Canadian 
ownership in the foreseeable future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the 20% limit on individual ownership of voting shares in 
Petro-Canada prevents any potential takeover by a major 
multinational. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there is far greaten interest for Petro-Canada among 
Canadian investors than foreign investors. As a matter of fact 
the foreign participation in the company does not exceed 16%, 
while the existing act allows up to 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, under the Canada Business Corporations Act corporations 
subjected to share ownership restrictions like Petro-Canada are 
still required to be run by a board of directors comprised of a 
majority of Canadians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to give Petro-Canada more latitude with the management 
of its assets, the prohibition on the sale, transfer or disposal 
of all or substantially all of Petro-Canada's upstream and 
downstream assets will be replaced with a similar prohibition 
which makes no distinction between upstream and downstream 
assets. The bill maintains just the level of prohibition 
necessary to prevent the company from shutting down operations 
through the sale of all its assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Cameco, Bill C-3 eases restrictions currently 
imposed on foreign ownership without eliminating them 
completely. 
The limit on individual non-resident share ownership will be 
raised from 5% to 15%. The limit on collective non-resident share 
ownership will increase from 20% to 25%. As for the ownership 
limit for an individual Canadian shareholder, it will remain at 
25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the reduction of the foreign participation 
restrictions, Cameco will always be controlled by Canadians and 
the majority of its capital will remain held by Canadians in the 
foreseeable future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the 15% individual non-resident share ownership 
restriction rules out any possibility of takeover by a major 
multinational. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, with the 25% limit on collective non-resident share 
ownership, control over Cameco cannot fall into foreign hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, Cameco generates much more interest among Canadian 
investors than among foreign investors. Indeed, foreign 
participation in the corporation does not exceed 6% right now, 
whereas the current legislation allows a 20% participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, under the Canada Business Corporations Act, corporations 
such as Petro-Canada which are subjected to share ownership 
restrictions are still required to be run by a board of directors 
comprised of a majority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 has the support of both corporations, which see the 
current restrictions as unfair in that they do not apply to other 
corporations in their respective sectors of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion the legislation will be well received by all 
investors both in Canada and abroad. 
At the same time it will protect the Canadian status of 
Petro-Canada and Cameco. The headquarters will remain in Canada 
and the majority of the board of directors will be made up of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure my colleagues that in the case of Petro-Canada the 
proposed amendments will have no impact on the price of refined 
petroleum products. A recent study carried out by the Conference 
Board of Canada confirmed that the price of gasoline is 
established mainly according to supply and demand and has 
nothing to do with property rules governing one company 
of the Canadian petroleum industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can also assure the House that the proposed amendments will 
have absolutely no impact on the competitiveness of the Canadian 
oil and gas industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, this bill is not a prelude to the sale of the government's 
shares in Petro-Canada. 
Although its holdings in Petro-Canada no longer serve any of its 
political purposes, the government is waiting for the right time 
to sell off its shares. In other words, it will wait until the 
market conditions ensure optimal yield for Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to inform hon. members that the proposed changes 
to the Cameco legislation will not change anything in the 
commitment Canada made toward non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons or nuclear security.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has not only urged its trading partners 
to ratify the non-proliferation treaty but it has also entered 
into nuclear co-operation agreements providing an additional 
control mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada, and hon. members can rest assured of 
this, thinks that it is still necessary to impose restrictions on 
the foreign ownership of uranium. Bill C-3 gives Cameco better 
access to foreign capital and allows it to develop new strategic 
alliances, but it does not in any way compromise the Canadian 
control of the company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like also to underline that Cameco has the support of 
another element of the public sector, and I am referring 
obviously to the government of Saskatchewan. It has indicated 
that it totally supported the proposed amendments to Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the bill is consistent with sound management of 
public affairs. During the discussions in committee there were 
no serious objections. In fact, hon. members of most parties 
have expressed their support for the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is good for Petro-Canada, good for Cameco and good for 
all Canadians.  I urge my colleagues to adopt the legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise once again on Bill C-3 to discuss 
the amendments to the Eldorado Nuclear Limited Reorganization and 
Divestiture Act and the Petro-Canada Public Participation Act. 
These two acts placed restrictions on individual and foreign 
ownership when Petro-Canada and Cameco were first privatized some 
years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill intends to increase the companies' access to domestic 
and foreign capital and enable greater flexibility in using share 
exchanges and asset pooling to make acquisitions and strategic 
alliances.  I cannot help but hope the bill will finally pave the 
way for the government to sell off its remaining 18% ownership or 
49.4 million shares of Petro-Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does a number of things to make room for the sale.  It 
raises the limit on individual ownership of shares from 10% to 
20%.  The 25% limit on shares that can be owned collectively by 
non-residents is removed.  While it gives the company greater 
flexibility to manage its asset portfolio, the bill also provides 
a check against the company winding up its activities through the 
outright sale of assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary has told us that the introduction 
and passage of Bill C-3 does not pave the way for the sale of 
Petro-Canada.  He says that the government will wait for the most 
favourable market conditions before proceeding with the sale. 
However, I, and I think most other Canadians, cannot conceive of 
a more favourable time than today.  The industry is healthy, the 
company is strong and the conditions in my opinion could not be 
more favourable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that, what does all this mean?  Petro-Canada was created 
in 1975 as one of the mechanisms of the national energy program. 
The feeling of western Canadians, certainly myself and those 
representing ridings in the region, are well documented when it 
comes to the national energy program.  We never did buy the 
Liberal line that the program was a vehicle for nationalist 
dreams and a ticket to energy self sufficiency.  At the time 
Canadians were told we had less than 20 years worth of 
recoverable oil reserves and that high gasoline taxes were a 
justifiable means of guaranteeing our future energy needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at where the oil industry in Canada currently 
stands, we see that our skepticism was appropriate.  Twenty-five 
years later we know those empty threats were little more than 
Liberal hogwash, a simple money grab and a flagrant breach of the 
principles of Confederation by the federal government, a Liberal 
federal government.  We now have proven oil reserves that will 
supply Canada's energy needs well into the future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is in excess of 200 years of recoverable reserves in the 
tar sands of northern Alberta alone.  The Liberal government 
might have thought that it had fooled Canadians but we knew that 
it was the federal government poking its rather large and 
unwelcome nose into the oil and gas industry, an intrusion that 
was totally unasked for, unappreciated and clearly unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the national energy program was eventually dismantled, 
Petro-Canada lives on, fed by taxpayer dollars without their 
approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eventually the government changed its mind and in 1991 
decided that it no longer needed a crown corporation in the 
energy business and began the privatization process.  In the end, 
with the fluctuations in the markets, business setbacks and even 
the present political struggles, Petro-Canada ended up as an oil 
company much like any other oil company in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government, or should I say the taxpayers, still 
owns 18% of the company and is the single largest holder of 
stock. Only the government could own more than 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1994 I questioned the government why it would not sell 
off its national oil company while the industry was strong in 
order to recoup some of the billions of taxpayer dollars that 
were used to create Petro-Canada in the first place.  I asked the 
government why it would not do something significant and use the 
revenue from the sale of Petro-Canada to reduce Canada's debt 
burden.  In 1995 a Liberal budget promised to totally privatize 
Petro-Canada.  We can see today how reliable that Liberal promise 
was and, like so many other budget promises, it is something that 
we should consider over the coming weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains that Petro-Canada cost Canadians over $5 
billion.  Petro-Canada has never provided any benefit to 
Canadians that could not have been provided by the private 
sector.  When it was finally privatized Petro-Canada started 
making a profit and competing effectively in the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments, since Petro-Canada was established, have never had 
the courage to admit to Canadians that they would only be able to 
recover less than $2 billion of the original cost of 
Petro-Canada.  If the bill is indeed the first step in the 
process of the government selling off its remaining shares of 
Petro-Canada, my first response is that it is about time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am curious as to the timing of the bill.  On Bay Street 
investors have driven up Petro-Canada share prices in 
anticipation of a move by Ottawa to sell its shares.  Today 
Petro-Canada's shares are trading at $32.75 per share.  That is 
over a 46% increase so far this year.  There is the potential for 
the price to go even higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 would remove foreign ownership restrictions allowing 
for an expanded market and potentially an increased price.  If 
the government were to sell its shares it could optimistically 
find itself receiving $1.6 billion.  That is a $3.4 billion loss 
on what Canadians originally paid for Petro-Canada, a business 
transaction that anyone could identify as a total disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government could find itself in possession of $1.6 
billion.  What would it do with that money?  Since it was 
originally taxpayer dollars that paid for Petro-Canada, the 
funds should return to the taxpayers in a direct fashion rather 
than being dumped into the general revenue fund that Liberal 
cronies could dip into whenever they felt inclined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see the money go to debt reduction or into 
transportation improvements.  Perhaps we could really be 
revolutionary and put the money toward lowering gas taxes.  What 
an original idea.  The Liberals recently voted against that in 
the House.  I do not expect that they would really show too much 
interest in returning taxpayer dollars directly to taxpayers. 
That is too simple, too clean cut and too direct a responsibility 
for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 does a number of things that I can support. 
Petro-Canada is moving toward opening up the ownership of the 
company to both national and international interests while 
ensuring that the majority of the company is Canadian.  The 
legislation states that resident Canadians must make up the 
majority of the board of directors.  It also stipulates that the 
head office of the company must remain in Calgary, which is a 
common practice of the government and one that is not necessary 
as it ties the hands of a number of companies that the government 
has followed this practice on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance also supports the removal of restrictions 
upon Canadian businesses to allow for both domestic and foreign 
investing.  We expect that Petro-Canada, once it is no longer 
manipulated by the government, would continue to show profits and 
growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 does not only address issues surrounding Petro-Canada. 
It also addresses issues relating to the sale of shares of 
Cameco, Canada's biggest uranium producer.  Canada's Kyoto 
commitments have increased the need for Canada to find green 
energy.  Nuclear energy is one option that is being examined.  I 
do not wish to get into a debate on the merits of nuclear energy. 
That is a debate for another day.  It is clear, however, that it 
is part of the package the government is examining in 
relationship to the Kyoto accord, along with the emission 
reductions that we are trying to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Uranium remains a source of nuclear energy.  It is a vital 
factor in the world's efforts to reduce CO2 levels.  It has been 
and will increasingly be a strategically important resource for 
the country.  The bill raises foreign and individual ownership 
limits for Cameco.  Individual non-resident ownership would 
increase from 5% to 15% and the limit on the total amount of 
non-resident ownership of shares would increase from 20% to 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see that the legislation is mindful of the 
possible consequences of high levels of foreign ownership of 
uranium resources.  The lower limits on Cameco shares reflect 
across the board government restrictions on foreign activity in 
uranium mining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Canadian Alliance is all for Canadian businesses 
having all the opportunities to succeed, we must also be 
conscious of the need to keep such potentially volatile resources 
within Canadian control.  The bill allows for greater flexibility 
in the selling of shares in Canadian companies, and I support 
that effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the legislation leads to the government finally selling off 
its remaining shares of Petro-Canada it would be legislation that 
is long overdue.  We will wait and see if that is the case.  If 
Petro-Canada is sold off, we will see how much the Liberals think 
Canadians have forgotten the original purpose of Petro-Canada and 
the amount of money that taxpayers put forth to establish the 
company in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance and I will be supporting the bill as we 
have at each stage.  We will continue to support the bill at 
third reading.  We are pleased that the government is showing the 
initiative in opening up these companies to better investment and 
a bit more flexibility in the way that they operate.

to say that my caucus colleagues and I vigorously oppose Bill 
C-3, an act to amend the Eldorado Nuclear Limited Reorganization 
and Divestiture Act and the Petro-Canada Public Participation 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill relates to the mandatory provisions in the articles of 
Cameco Corporation, which was formerly known as Eldorado Nuclear 
Ltd., and Petro-Canada which was created in 1975. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 was first introduced in the previous parliament and 
died on the order paper with the dissolution of parliament last 
fall.  The bill provides that the articles of Cameco Corporation 
would have to contain a 15% individual non-resident share 
ownership limit for voting shares as well as a cap on aggregate 
non-resident share ownership voting rights of 25%.  It stipulates 
that the articles of Petro-Canada would be amended to allow for a 
20% individual share ownership limit while the aggregate 
non-resident share ownership limits would be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition the prohibition on the sale, transfer or disposal of 
all or substantially all of Petro-Canada upstream and downstream 
assets would be replaced with a similar prohibition on the sale, 
transfer or disposal of all or substantially all its assets 
without distinguishing between the upstream and downstream 
sectors of the activity.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to talk about Petro-Canada because I remember it fondly, 
not as a member of parliament but as a very proud moment in the 
life of the federal New Democratic Party.  Those with longer 
memories will recall that in the minority government era of 1972 
to 1974, the creation in 1975 of a publicly owned oil and gas 
exploration company with downstream stations was part and parcel 
of this party's support for the Liberal minority government 
following the 1972 election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall how Petro-Canada was talked about as being a window on 
the industry with the other multinationals that were operating in 
the country.  Members will recall that at that time we were going 
through some extreme price shocks following the crisis in the 
gulf and the six day war in the Middle East in 1973.  We had some 
very sharp price hikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were concerns about the rapid increase in gasoline fuel 
prices in the country.  Some rules were put in place to regulate 
or to make sure that there was a flow through in terms of how 
much product there was in the lines at the time.  As I recall, it 
was 60 days before some provinces would allow a price increase 
after a world price change was announced because that is how the 
price was determined in terms of the fuel that was in the line at 
that time.  That was a very important time and a very important 
rationale for Petro-Canada to come into being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were additional benefits as well that were well 
recognized.  We talked about the ability to have a two price 
system to take advantage of some of the enormous resources that 
exist in Canada.  We are a rich storehouse of resources.  Canada 
is blessed with some of the greatest natural resources in the 
world, such as oil and gas reserves.  We talked about a two price 
system that would not only be a benefit to consumers but would 
also be an incentive to make our products more competitive and 
sell better abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world has changed dramatically in the last 25 years, and in 
particular in the last 10 years.  We cannot do that any more, 
thanks to the free trade agreement and the North American Free 
Trade Agreement and undoubtedly the FTAA when it is put into 
place in three or four years from now. 
We cannot set a two price system.  We cannot have a price for 
Canadian products or a domestic product in Canada and export our 
commodities and our resources south of the border, or for that 
matter to any other part of the world, without running afoul of 
these WTO, FTAA and NAFTA arrangements.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister was on his feet earlier this week in the 
House of Commons trying to defend his position on natural 
resources.  He said that he wanted to keep the control of them in 
this country.  We have news for him.  We have lost that control 
already.  We lost it some time ago.  We lost it when we signed 
the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot turn off the spigot any more and say that we want to 
protect our resources so we will restrict the amount of our 
exports.  We can only do that if we turn off the spigot to our 
people and our companies.  It has to be done in direct 
relationship, so that the whole two price system and our ability 
to control our resources is very much hamstrung as a result of 
these agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These restrictions are causing hardship, distress and a good 
deal of genuine inability to comprehend.  I want to take a moment 
to inform the House that this morning on my voice mail in my 
Moose Jaw office there was a very worrisome call from an 
individual named Chris.  He said that he was trying to put food 
on the table for his family but gas prices were going up, natural 
gas was increasing and electricity was going up.  He said there 
had to be a ceiling on prices because they were getting crazy. 
“How the heck are we going to live?” was what this individual 
said in his voice mail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this individual fails to understand is that there is very 
much a restriction on what a government, either at the provincial 
or federal level, can do any more as a result of these free trade 
agreements and the WTO.  We do not have the ability any longer to 
step in and say that yes, those prices are rising dramatically 
and that we will take some action to lower them. That was the 
case before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government talks about more democracy and that free 
trade agreements, NAFTA and FTAA will result in greater 
democracy, people fail to understand because the fact of the 
matter is that governments are more restricted today than they 
were before in terms of what they are able to control and 
regulate.  That is what Chris is concerned about, although with 
great respect to him, he fails to understand the connection 
between what is happening in the world and the ability of 
governments to have any bearing on it.  The fact of the matter is 
we are in a time and a society where what we are paying is 
exactly what the market will bear.  The notion that we can have 
control on prices seems to be a far off dream. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this reminds me of what was said by Clay Yeutter who was 
the U.S. trade representative in 1987-88.  He said at the time 
the initial free trade agreement was signed between Canada and 
the United States that “Canadians do not understand what they 
have signed.  Within 20 years they will be sucked directly into 
the U.S. economy”.  That was 14 years ago, and I would say that 
Mr. Yeutter's projections are fairly much on target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no answer to the question of more democracy.  As I was 
trying to say a moment ago, governments are no longer able to 
influence the cost.  We have the invisible hand of the 
marketplace at work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk just a minute about the impact this has on the 
agricultural sector because in 1995 about 12% of total input 
costs were energy related.  They have skyrocketed since then. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I do not have the tables and the information to 
show how much they have skyrocketed, but if we talked to any 
farmer in any province in Canada he or she could give us lots of 
facts about how much transportation costs have gone up as have 
fuel bills, fertilizer bills et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that all these sharp increases in prices run contrary 
to the government's assumption that we would be and we were on a 
long term low cost trend in terms of gasoline and fuel products. 
The fact of the matter is that we have an extremely tight gas 
market at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a world, we require between 8 and 8.5 billion cubic feet of 
natural gas every day just to stay current.  There is a lot of 
talk about big developments in Alaska and in the Mackenzie 
Valley.  Each of them might bring on stream perhaps one billion 
cubic feet of gas per day.  That is when they are developed in 
about 10 years from now.  We are only going to be standing still 
at the very best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am trying to make is that I do not see prices coming 
down.  I see them continuing to escalate in the days, months and 
years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to oil, the U.S. requires about 19.5 million 
barrels of oil each day to maintain all the things that run on 
oil.  A lot of people are talking about the Alberta tar sands as 
being a big vast rich reserve of oil, which it is.  However it is 
also very costly.  As David Suzuki pointed out last Wednesday 
night at the environmental conference in Quebec City, developing 
the Alberta tar sands would result in about 1.35 million cars on 
the road each and the greenhouse gas effect that would have by 
developing that very costly oil from the Alberta tar sands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transportation is the fastest growing cause of greenhouse gases 
in the world.  There has been an explosion in transportation over 
the last 50 odd years because one day's trade today is equal to 
about one year's trade 50 or 55 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am trying to come to is that Petro-Canada was a very 
good idea at the time.  It could still be a viable project if the 
crown corporation was allowed to continue to work both here and 
abroad.  The government, with its ties to big business and the 
oil industry, is simply not interested in that at all.  That is 
why we see this legislation before us this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is privatization?  It is the commercialization, nothing 
more nor less, of the public sector, the part of society owned 
and controlled by the public through government.  These include 
things such as medicare, schools, education, social services, 
pensions and crown corporations.  The privatization of all that 
is when they are sold off and deregulated.  In short, 
privatization basically is transferring public dollars into 
private hands at a profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the creation of this country back in 1867, Canada relied 
rather extensively, probably more so than many countries 
certainly more so than the one immediately to the south of us, on 
federal crown corporations.  They played a central role in the 
economic, cultural and political development of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1937 Trans-Canada Airlines was created.  The federal 
government began to restructure many of its economic enterprises 
into federal crown corporations.  Currently there are over 40 
federal crown corporations providing a vast array of services to 
the Canadian public and Canadian business.  They range from large 
national enterprises, Canada Post Corporation being one, to 
smaller more localized operations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although many operate in competitive economic environments 
providing services which are also provided by private sector 
companies on a market basis, the purpose of a crown corporation 
is markedly different than that of private sector companies. 
While many, such as Canada Post, are supposed to operate on a 
break-even basis, it is recognized by the auditor general that 
surplus revenues may be used to help support non-profit oriented 
endeavours devoted to serving the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public welfare orientation of crown corporations was 
recognized by the federal treasury board.  The treasury board's 
president in 1998, in the annual report, evaluated crown 
corporations on criteria such as improving service to clients, 
exporting expertise and contributing to Canada's social and 
economic development.  Profitability was never included in the 
list of items to be evaluated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the province of Saskatchewan, which I have the privilege 
of representing, conducted a major review of its crown 
corporations to determine future direction.  Crown corporations 
form a significant part of Saskatchewan's economy, beginning with 
the Douglas government back in 1944, and currently make up a 
little more than 33% of its gross domestic product. 
Saskatchewan's crown corporations are some of the largest 
employers in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several important findings emerged throughout that review. 
People in Saskatchewan believed that the role of commercial crown 
corporations was to provide universal access to essential 
services.  They also believed that crown corporations should be 
used to create employment and promote economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of submissions indicated that public investment 
through crown corporations had a major role to play in the 
province's economy, and that even partial privatization of these 
enterprises would pose a major risk to Saskatchewan's economy. 
Most people there believed that crown corporations were much more 
publicly accountable than private corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite those findings, at the federal level in recent years we 
have witnessed a massive privatization of major federal crown 
corporations.  The de Havilland Aircraft of Canada, Canadian 
Arsenal Limited, Teleglobe, CN, Air Canada and now Petro-Canada 
are but a few of the public assets which have been auctioned off 
to private sector investors, abandoning the long held belief that 
a public presence in industry resources and finance is necessary 
to promote broader public policy purpose objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has adopted an approach based on the 
ideological assumption that less public intervention is an 
objective of state policy.  Indeed under the current finance 
minister, the government adopted a policy of privatizing and 
commercializing government operations wherever feasible and 
appropriate.  That is what we are seeing today with Cameco Corp. 
and Petro-Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This policy framework also has been applied to justify the 
privatization and cutbacks in numerous federal government 
operations, boards, departments and agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole point of all of this is that we need a democratic 
process in the country.  Most of the privatization has occurred 
without any meaningful consultation with Canadian citizens and 
certainly without the support or consent of trade unions and 
associations representing the workers involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privatization has been justified on the basis of misinformation 
in too many instances.  Promises and commitments made beforehand 
were abandoned soon after the shares were sold and the investors 
were making their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate around privatization must be expanded to include 
societal values in addition to the economic consequences.  Public 
ownership implies a sense of accountability to the collective 
welfare of society, which is unknown in the public sector. Public 
ownership implies democratic access to decision making through 
elected officials and representatives who are responsible to 
public forums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public ownership of major economic institutions provides 
governments with important economic levers to influence private 
sector behaviour, both in terms of investment decisions and their 
employment and managerial practices.  The struggle to preserve 
federal crown corporations is part of a greater struggle to 
define our values and who we are as a nation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will branch off a little and stay with crown corporations. 
However I will first talk for a moment or two about the Potash 
Corporation of Saskatchewan which was a huge money maker for the 
provincial government in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  It was 
sold off when the Conservatives came to power in the province 
after the 1982 election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, PCS, still exists.  It 
is now privately owned and makes record profits every year.  What 
a boon it would have been to the Saskatchewan economy when the 
Devine government was racking up billions of dollars in losses 
every year and the red ink was flowing widely.  The potash 
corporation could have been a great boon had that government had 
the wisdom to hang on to it, but of course it did not and it is 
gone now, probably forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same could be said of Northern Telecom, Nortel.  The 
Canadian market and the Toronto Stock Exchange are dependent 
these days on how much Nortel rises or falls.  People probably do 
not remember that Nortel was once Northern Telecom, a crown 
corporation which did a lot of good for the country.  It was sold 
off by an earlier government into private hands and is now making 
gazillions of dollars for a few investors some of the time. 
However the only benefit is on taxes paid, and it is not nearly 
as much of a benefit for Canadians generally now that it is in 
the hands of the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back and talk a bit about the new higher price of 
energy because the bill is on energy.  As these price increases 
reverberate throughout our economy they are causing a great deal 
of economic and social dislocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of commentators have reminded us that nearly all 
economic recessions in the U.S. over the past 60 years have been 
preceded by a spike in energy costs.  Like a new tax or a change 
in interest rates, the new price of energy benefits a few and 
costs many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen huge profits racked up in the oil industry in North 
America in recent years, particularly in the last couple of 
years.  The energy industry worldwide is benefiting from a market 
in which the growth in demand has recently outstripped the growth 
in supply and from which spare capacity has almost vanished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reports in the oil and gas journals cite industry experts who 
predict a tight natural gas market in North America for years to 
come as the gas business races to replace wells that are playing 
out. The industry must find the equivalent of between eight and 
eight and a half billion cubic feet of gas per day just to stay 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, is in 
firm control of the world market and is successfully maintaining 
its base price of about $25 U.S. a barrel.  The gasoline market 
is tight because demand is high but also because just in time 
management techniques in the refining industry are turning out to 
be more profitable for individual companies than for the economy 
as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials are warning consumers in both Canada and the U.S. of 
price spikes for gasoline this summer.  We have seen that in the 
province of Saskatchewan in the last 48 hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does more expensive energy mean for agriculture? 
Agriculture uses a great deal of energy.  I mentioned the figure 
of $4 billion in 1995 while gross farm receipts in the country 
were just over $32 billion.  That would be in excess of 12%, and 
it would certainly have gone up a lot in the intervening six 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems the government has been taken by surprise.  It did not 
expect energy prices to deviate from a long low cost trend. 
Thus far the government's response to the critical energy 
situation facing North America has been to offer more, not less, 
energy to the Americans.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's new sources of bountiful energy, the tar 
sands and the gas in the Beaufort Sea, will not reverse the trend 
toward higher energy prices.  These are tremendously expensive 
resources in terms of both extraction costs and greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Massive public and private expenditures are required before 
additional synthetic crude or new Arctic gas can be brought to 
market.  A $10 billion pipeline might bring a billion cubic feet 
of gas per day down the Mackenzie Valley, but if we compare that 
to the eight billion cubic feet of gas per day the industry now 
needs just to stay even we see the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. demand for petroleum products hovers around 19.5 
million barrels a day.  It takes billions of dollars and several 
years to increase tar sands production by just 150,000 barrels 
per day.  A supply solution to high energy prices is not in 
sight.  Lowering demand would be a more effective route to lower 
prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many farmers are already lowering energy consumption through 
techniques such as zero till, or zero tillage, to pronounce it 
fully.  Farmers rightly look to the federal government to 
redirect money and effort it now spends on increasing the energy 
supply toward a more productive and effective investment in 
demand management strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with care to the parliamentary secretary's comments 
that there is no restriction on foreign ownership and no need to 
worry about the Foreign Investment Review Agency.  Yes, we know 
that very well, and I think it is to the great regret of the vast 
majority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were assured that CN and CP, particularly CN, would not be 
subject to foreign takeover.  However we now know that the vast 
majority of shares in our two major rail lines, which may soon 
become one, are held by people who live outside our borders.  I 
already mentioned what we saw with Nortel and the Potash 
Corporation of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these points suggest that the bill, instead of being named 
Bill C-3, should be named Bill C-745, the faint hope clause, in 
the hope that none of these things will come to pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the New Democratic Party's position?  We believe now is 
not the time to give up our last meagre interest and influence in 
these vital energy sector corporations.  Opening the door to more 
foreign control of our energy sector is shortsighted and not in 
the best interests of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would have us believe the proposed changes to 
Petro-Canada's ownership restrictions would have no bearing on 
the price of refined products such as gasoline.  However by 
giving up its last stake in the company the government would 
guarantee that Canadians have no voice at all in the energy 
sector in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By abolishing the 25% cap on aggregate non-resident share 
ownership voting rights, the bill would ensure that Petro-Canada 
ends up sooner or later in the hands of foreigners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when high energy costs are hurting many Canadian 
industries, small businesses and low and middle income families, 
most Canadians want more government involvement to address the 
skyrocketing cost of fuel.  Instead the government turns its back 
and walks away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada sold all its shares in Cameco by 1995. 
In our opinion it is now, by letting go of any semblance of 
interest in a sector that has global implications, opening it 
completely and utterly to foreign control.  It is for those 
reasons that the New Democratic Party firmly opposes Bill C-3. 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to stand today to speak to Bill C-3, an act to amend 
the Eldorado Nuclear Limited Reorganization and Divestiture Act 
and the Petro-Canada Public Participation Act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill opens up two Canadian companies to greater foreign 
ownership and expands the individual ownership provisions.  The 
intent of the bill is to allow greater flexibility on the part of 
the two companies, Petro-Canada and Cameco, to better position 
themselves within the global marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within their industries Petro-Canada and Cameco are national and 
world leaders respectively.  Petro-Canada is familiar to most 
Canadians because of its retail gas outlets.  However it also has 
significant oil and gas exploration and development initiatives 
in Canada's north and along the east coast.  It is involved in 
the Alberta tar sands as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the oil and gas sector is doing well and benefiting 
enormously from the high price of oil and gas.  Petro-Canada is 
well positioned within the sector to profit from both upstream 
and downstream production.  However it continues, like any 
company, to look for growth opportunities.  The legislation is 
expected to give Petro-Canada greater flexibility for strategic 
management as the oil and gas sector continues to evolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the lessening of restrictions on foreign and individual 
ownership is one issue addressed by the legislation, the bill 
would also allow Petro-Canada to sell, transfer or otherwise 
dispose of its assets without separate provisions for upstream 
and downstream operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upstream operations such as development in the Alberta tar 
sands, offshore oil exploration in Newfoundland and natural gas 
exploration in western Canada are some of the core businesses of 
Petro-Canada.  Downstream operations, including the nearly 2,000 
retail and wholesale outlets across Canada, make Petro-Canada one 
of the more recognizable names in the gas delivery business and 
the second largest petroleum refining and marketing company in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Petro-Canada has recently focused on its core businesses, 
specifically the oil and gas production that has proven 
successful on the east coast and in western Canada.  The 
legislation could provide the company additional leeway to 
concentrate on areas that have proven successful while allowing 
it to dispose of operations that do not meet its core focus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation should allow the federal government to divest 
itself of its remaining 18% stake in Petro-Canada.  Oil and gas 
companies are profiting from current market conditions and it is 
a favourable time for the federal government to get out of the 
industry.  We all know to buy low and sell high.  If the 
government wants to maximize its investment now is the time to 
sell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How the government manages the windfall from such a sale is 
another question.  It was the Canadian taxpayer who footed the 
bill when the government established Petro-Canada as a crown 
corporation in 1975 and it should be the taxpayer who benefits 
now.  That does not mean further health care cuts or increased 
devolution of services to the provinces without corresponding 
increases in transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nova Scotia government has recently been addressing its own 
problem in the oil and gas industry: insignificant royalties from 
east coast oil and gas development.  Nova Scotia sees only 18 
cents of every dollar generated by the offshore.  The remainder 
goes to the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be a more equitable sharing of revenues between the 
federal government and the provinces.  Petro-Canada has its 
headquarters in Alberta.  That province manages to operate in the 
black because of the substantial royalties it accrues from 
resource companies like Petro-Canada.  Nova Scotia is asking for 
a similar setup so that it too can realize the benefits of oil 
and gas development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year Petro-Canada had record net annual earnings of $893 
million, easily surpassing the previous year's earnings of $233 
million and almost tripling the previous high of $306 million. 
Petro-Canada is clearly doing something right.  Still, no company 
should rest on its laurels.  If this legislation provides greater 
flexibility and allows for strategic positioning within the 
industry, it is important to support it.  The PC Party does so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation affects another Canadian company, Cameco, the 
world's largest uranium supplier.  Cameco supplies 30% of the 
western world's uranium, some 18 million pounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would provide greater flexibility to the company 
in terms of foreign ownership, although a fixed limit of 25% 
would remain in place.  There is a big difference, however, 
between the oil and gas sector and nuclear energy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Although both sectors provide energy sources and both have 
inherent risks associated with them that can have grave 
environmental impacts, Canadians remain skeptical about nuclear 
energy and the safe use of such energy.  Radioactive waste is one 
aspect of uranium mining that concerns all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to spend some time today looking at radioactive 
waste and the role that public perception plays in uranium 
production.  With legislation that opens up foreign ownership of 
this Canadian uranium producing company, the world's largest, I 
think it is important to understand what issues are really at 
stake here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the briefing material provided by the Department 
of Natural Resources respecting the legislation clearly indicates 
that nuclear proliferation standards will be maintained and are 
not impacted by the legislation.  However, when one looks at 
uranium mining there are serious environmental questions that 
need to be addressed, not just the issue of nuclear 
proliferation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report, “Inventory of Radioactive Waste in Canada”, 
examines radioactive waste in Canada according to three 
categories, nuclear fuel waste, low level radioactive waste, and 
uranium mine and mill tailings.  At the end of 1998 the total 
waste of these three categories were, respectively:  5,600 cubic 
metres, 1.8 million cubic metres, and 210 million tonnes.  Again, 
those three categories were nuclear fuel waste, low level 
radioactive waste and uranium mine and mill tailings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report estimates that by 2035, the year when the last power 
reactor is forecast to shut down, the waste totals will be: 
14,500 cubic metres, 210 million cubic metres, and 248 million 
tonnes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report goes on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Radioactive waste is currently managed in a safe and 
environmentally responsible manner by storing the waste away from 
the public and isolating it from the environment.  The management 
of those wastes meets the requirements of the Atomic Energy 
Control Board, Canada's independent nuclear regulator. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to look at what has been happening recently 
respecting the organization that oversees nuclear reactors and 
public safety in Canada.  On May 31, 2000, the Canadian Nuclear 
Safety Commission replaced the Atomic Energy Control Board.  In 
his December 2000 report, the auditor general devoted a chapter 
to the review of nuclear safety, with a focus on power reactor 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his report, the auditor general noted that the risk analysis 
of power reactors is not rigorous, raising questions about the 
safety of Canada's 22 existing nuclear power reactors.  While 
Cameco may not be in the business of supplying nuclear power 
reactors, it is directly affected by undertakings within the 
industry because of the impact this has on Canadians' acceptance 
of nuclear products, nuclear energy and nuclear waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Supporters of nuclear energy advocate that it is one of the 
cleanest sources of energy available and one that can help meet 
future demands as fossil fuel sources are depleted.  Certainly it 
is true that nuclear energy is a possible solution for energy, 
one that some countries have been more open to than others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>France has embraced nuclear power as its primary energy 
producer, relying on nuclear energy to supply 75% of its 
electricity production, the result of a 1974 initiative to be 
energy independent.  However, to be supportive of nuclear energy 
we must also have a method of dealing with the byproducts and the 
residues of nuclear energy exploitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cameco addresses these issues on a daily basis because, as a 
result of its mining operations, the company must dispose of its 
waste materials.  This can range from mine tailings to the 
protective clothing worn by employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the low level radioactive waste produced as a result 
of nuclear power production is compressed and disposed of within 
nuclear reactors.  This is not a long term solution, however, and 
other disposal methods have been discussed, including the 
availability of other sites as possible receptacles for this 
waste material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian shield, because of its stable rock formation and 
low water levels, could be opportune in this regard and is 
something that the Canadian nuclear fuel waste management program 
has discussed since 1978.  Public acceptance of such disposal 
methods will determine whether this is a long term solution to 
radioactive waste disposal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Cameco is a well respected and successful company.  However, 
like Petro-Canada, it too needs the flexibility to adapt to new 
market conditions and strategically position itself within the 
global marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I have some concerns about the application of nuclear 
energy, particularly in regard to waste disposal and byproducts, 
the intent of this legislation is to help these two companies 
grow and expand within their respective industries.  The PC Party 
supports this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent Cameco press release announced that reserves at 
McArthur River in northern Saskatchewan, the world's largest and 
highest grade uranium mine, is now expected to exceed anticipated 
production by 50%.  As Cameco continues to develop mine sites 
like the McArthur mine, it will need the flexibility to attract 
new investment and diversify its holdings.  This legislation 
should be one step toward providing that flexibility.  The PC 
Party supports the legislation for that very reason.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member's speech about his points of view on 
Bill C-3, which would see us doing away with our last influence 
on or ownership of anything to do with a public sector energy 
strategy, at least, or an energy strategy in the public interest, 
if we could put it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member explain to me the motivation, this seeming 
passion, on the part of government and obviously on the part of 
his party to divest ourselves of any interest whatsoever in our 
energy sector?  Why do he and his party think that all things 
publicly owned are bad and all things privately owned are good 
and somehow better run and better managed just because they are 
in the private sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will let him answer, but I would argue that many Canadians 
want more government intervention in the energy sector at this 
time because they are facing spiralling, out of control energy 
and fuel costs.  They want the government to take an active role. 
How does he juxtapose that reality with his party's and the 
government's fixation on privatizing everything in the energy 
sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Madam Speaker, first of all, certainly 
the Progressive Conservative Party does not agree with 
privatizing everything in Canada.  There are a number of areas, 
particularly health care, wherein privatization has no place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue before us is the result of a national energy policy 
that I do not think anyone any longer supports in this day and 
age.  The fact is that Petro-Canada has basically been privatized 
at this point.  This bill still would not complete that job.  We 
have a company that right now is making some profits, without 
question, but at the same time its stock is high.  Now is the 
time to move it out.  We have to establish a very clear direction 
on where Canadians want to go.  Do we want to be the owners of 
all of our public resources?  I do not think so.  Canadians have 
very much spoken to that themselves at the ballot box in the last 
number of years in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue is Cameco, which is a more difficult issue. 
Certainly Petro-Canada is not a difficult issue for the PC Party. 
There are other issues at stake with Cameco.  When we start to 
supply 30% of the world's uranium production, then we have issues 
of nuclear proliferation and nuclear safety.  We are supplying 
nuclear ore, uranium ore, to many reactors around the world and 
that is the more problematic issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, it is our belief that it is time to privatize 
both companies.  This does not finish the job, but it is a step 
in that direction.  I would have thought that the government 
would have taken this opportunity to complete the job.  It has 
not done that.  We would still have two publicly owned or 
government owned crown corporations.  It is a matter of time 
before the job is finished.  I expect that the government will 
continue to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will add my comments on this very important bill a 
little later, but I would like to ask for a comment from the hon. 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will recall that it was his party in 1990 that began the 
process of selling Petro-Canada.  At the time it was seen as a 
very wise move given the need for capitalization and the changes 
that were necessary.  Ten years later, we see that gasoline 
prices have now hit their highest levels and that although retail 
margins are a little weak, we are now seeing refinery margins in 
the order of 18 cents a litre.  By the way, that never gets 
discussed by the press because for some reason there seems to be 
a conspiracy of silence, whatever the case may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, to the question of the number of shares held 
by the Canadian public through the government, it is 49.4 million 
shares out of 271 million common shares in Petro-Canada, at 
$40.72, which is about $2 billion in potential revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether the hon. member has given any thought to the 
idea that rather than the $15 billion, if we amortize that over a 
number of years, that has been spent by the Canadian taxpayer to 
create Petro-Canada in the first place—and we can debate the 
merits of whether it was there to remove refinery capacity in the 
country, because that is exactly what has happened—would he 
consider or at least give some thought to, based on what Bill C-3 
is proposing, the notion of returning $2 billion in income taxes 
to Canadians as opposed to simply returning it to general 
revenue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Madam Speaker, in my speech I actually 
mentioned that we would certainly give some thought to making 
sure that any revenues generated from the sale of Petro-Canada go 
back to the Canadian taxpayer specifically.  That would be our 
first choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other part of the hon. member's question is a much more 
general question.  We need to ask ourselves if we want government 
in the private sector in this country.  We have to be very clear. 
I think the answer is no, we do not want government in business. 
We want government to do other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a windfall of profit right now in Petro-Canada.  We do 
have high oil and gas prices, without question, but there are 
other ways in which the government can influence the oil and gas 
sector without being directly in the business.  Quite frankly, 
there is no place for government in the oil and gas business, in 
retail, either upstream or downstream.  The industry is working 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has not always worked well.  I can give a prime example of 
that.  I worked in the offshore oil fields on the east coast.  In 
1985 or 1986 we drilled a well off Sable Island.  It was 85 miles 
farther out in the ocean than we had ever drilled before.  It was 
a Canadian government supplied well, so there was a lot of money 
flowing.  We drilled to about 17,000 feet.  We had never drilled 
that deep on the east coast before.  Yet the Petro-Canada 
engineers, the government people involved in that well, insisted 
that we drill another 2,100 feet.  We drilled another 2,100 feet 
of dust.  We never hit any gas reserves.  We never hit any oil 
reserves.  What we did do was break the record and drilled the 
deepest offshore well ever drilled in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happens when we start putting public money into 
private business.  Quite frankly, I do not think that would have 
happened with a privately owned corporation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to what my colleague had to say.  He 
obviously has very special experience in the oil business.  He 
made some very thoughtful remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am being approached all the time by citizens who feel 
that the price of gasoline is simply too high.  It has gone up 
again and is projected to go up yet again during the summer.  The 
people in my riding feel they are being jerked around by the oil 
companies, by OPEC or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member says there is no place for government in the oil 
industry, but one example of where the government has been very 
effective is the oil sands, or the tar sands as they used to be 
called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told that the reserves in the oil sands are as great as the 
reserves in Saudi Arabia.  Despite what was said by an NDP member 
earlier, I have also been told that the price per barrel now, as 
a result of government subsidy into research for methods of 
extracting the oil from the tar sands, is down around $12 or $13 
a barrel.  Yet OPEC is maintaining prices at $25 or $26 a barrel.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member comment on the roles of this government 
and previous governments in the development of the tar sands? How 
should we manage this resource, which is even larger than the 
resource he was tapping offshore, in the best interest of 
Canadians, particularly fixed income Canadians who are suffering 
at the present time from high gasoline and oil prices? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member asks a 
couple of questions.  The first one that I will deal with is the 
role of government in high risk ventures.  The oil sands are an 
extremely high risk venture.  They have been buoyed by the fact 
that we have had an increase in the value of oil and gas.  If we 
had not had that increase we would not have gone ahead with the 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have continued to put dollars into them and they would 
never have floated.  They would never have been a viable 
operation.  They are only viable because of the increase in the 
value of the product they produce.  The risk period is over. It 
can now be a standalone venture and be completely privatized. 
There is no need for Petro-Canada investment being there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question dealt with the price of oil and gas.  The 
government has a lot of leeway.  It has an opportunity to show a 
lot of leadership regarding the price of oil and gas.  It can get 
rid of the 1.5 cent deficit reduction tax on gasoline as there is 
no longer a deficit.  There are a number of areas of excise tax 
that could be looked at.  Part of reducing the cost of oil and 
gas is incumbent upon the federal government showing leadership, 
making reductions first and then challenging the provinces to 
meet it at least part way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, once again I have an opportunity to give a brief 
illustration of some of the concerns I have with Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me state from the outset that I will be supporting the bill. 
It is a timely bill.  We are debating a bill on a day in which 
Canadians, short of what happened in the House of Commons in the 
past 24 to 48 hours, are beginning to wonder whether or not a 
nation so blessed with energy is being put in the situation where 
it is being manipulated by its own resources.  Canadians are 
seeing prices that they could never have imagined a few years 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some time ago members on this side of the House took under their 
own wings the idea of looking at the gas and oil industry.  I am 
proud to say that the industry is doing extremely well in Canada, 
but not as proud to say that for most of my constituents it is 
doing far too well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to indicate where the bill could be improved 
because it is clear that its intention is to divest, among other 
things, federal government shares which it currently owns in 
Petro-Canada.  Petro-Canada was created out of the national 
energy policy.  As a young assistant I sat in the gallery and 
watched as the act unfolded.  Back then it was an issue for me. 
Amazingly enough at the age of 38 it is still an issue for me and 
it will continue to be an issue for most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will provide my colleagues with a description of where the 
energy sector is going.  There has been a lot of interest in the 
idea of a continental energy policy.  I had an opportunity to 
make some observations on that during the take note debate last 
evening.  The most interesting comment that I have heard came 
from the former governor general of the country, Ray Hnatyshyn, 
who as a young member from Saskatchewan referred to a continental 
energy policy as it related to Canada and the United States at 
the time as being a bit like “swapping partners with a 
bachelor”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is trying to explain to Canadians that when there 
are opportunities to provide more energy for other parts of the 
world desperately in need of energy, there inevitably becomes a 
consequence to one's own consumption and to one's own domestic 
situation as far as the market is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would probably shock and surprise Canadians to know when they 
are fuelling up with gasoline or buying home heating fuel, or 
truckers who are using diesel fuel, that all our energy is priced 
in U.S. terms because of the differentiation between the Canadian 
and the U.S. dollar.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standard benchmark for oil as set by West Texas Intermediate 
is about $26, $27 or $28 a barrel in the U.S., which is $42 or 
$43 in Canadian terms.  That number has to be divided by 159 
because a conventional barrel of oil yields 159 litres of 
gasoline.  That makes it about 25 or 26 cents a litre.  That is 
the breakdown of why people in Ontario are paying 80 cents a 
litre for gasoline and perhaps more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crude oil in Edmonton today is selling for about 26 cents a 
litre.  It takes about one cent to push it through taxpayer 
funded pipelines which we gave over to the oil industry as an 
apology for the energy program many years ago, so it is now 27 or 
28 cents a litre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Refiners in Ontario and across the country will then transform 
the crude product, the bitumen, into a rack price, which is known 
as the wholesale price.  This usually costs them about two or 
three cents a litre.  However the margin today is 18 cents a 
litre.  Of the refinery's production, 15 cents is going into the 
pockets of oil companies.  I am not so concerned about their 
ability to do it.  They say it is economics 101 and it is their 
right to do these things because that is the way it is done in 
other markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the U.S., the average refinery margin is hovering about nine 
cents a litre.  However, because we are Canadians and because it 
is our own product priced in U.S. dollars, not including taxes, 
we are being forced to pay an extra eight or nine cents a litre. 
That may not mean a lot but when we consider that 35 billion 
litres of gasoline a year are sold in Canada, we are talking 
about a transfer, for every penny where there is no competition 
at that level, of some $350 million from the Canadian consumer's 
pocket to the oil companies.  Some members may wish to nod their 
heads approvingly or disapprovingly but the facts and the proof 
are in the pudding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record profits that are being made in the downstream, in the 
refining and retailing of gasoline, is testament in and of itself 
of the evidence that something has gone completely wrong with the 
industry and for which there is no oversight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to talk about the retail margin.  If I am an 
independent I would be buying gasoline today for about 74 cents a 
litre including tax.  I would have about four to five cents to 
work on.  That is usually what is needed to turn a pump on, to 
pay for staff and to keep one's nose above the water line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 we have seen the sustained policy of oil companies, 
using their huge profit at the refinery level to cross-subsidize. 
That never gets challenged because there is no competition there. 
They do not mind losing money at the retail level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Big, beautiful gasoline sites are being put up by the integrated 
major oil companies in the country.  It costs millions of dollars 
to acquire the land, to put up the infrastructure and the 
capital, and yet they are running on margins of one cent a litre 
or half a cent a litre, and in some cases negative one or 
negative two cents a litre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be completely illegal in the United States. 
Shareholders would get upset at losing money at the retail level 
because retailing and refining gasoline are completely different. 
Also anti-competitive questions would be raised.  To build a 
facility like that on the most expensive sites to attract people 
to the site would be prohibitive.  It would likely reflect in the 
cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hence when we go to the United States, and many of us have done 
that although with our weaker dollar it has been more difficult, 
we go to a little gas station on the side of the road.  It is an 
ugly, beaten up looking thing.  The guy is outside with his dirty 
hands and his wife is pumping gasoline.  The gasoline at this 
station is 10 cents a gallon less than the Mobil across the 
street.  A product cannot be offered at cost or below cost unless 
money is being made somewhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are opportunities for the government to look at the issue 
of segment reporting.  One of the benefits that I hope would not 
be lost, in any attempt to sell the final 18% of Petro-Canada 
shares, would be segment reporting.  One of its advantages, 
because it is a publicly held company, is that it tells people 
what it made at the retail level.  It has not engaged in 
predatory pricing versus what it has lost or made at the refinery 
level.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I want to talk about what makes up the cost of gasoline. 
We have 26 cents for crude.  We have 18 cents as a refiner margin 
today in Ontario, particularly in Toronto.  We have taxes in the 
area of 24.7 cents, which consist of 10 cents for the federal 
excise, 14.7 cents for the province and about 5.6 cents for the 
GST.  Of course the GST goes up with the cost of the product. 
The final point I want to put into this cost, and why it is so 
important for us to consider it now in Bill C-3, is that in the 
future when it comes to being able to measure these companies we 
will have less of an opportunity to do so.  Yes, the books will 
be open, but they will be open for shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will there be guarantees, as we see with a current partially 
held public company, that these companies will be held to a 
higher standard?  Will there be guarantees to ensure that all 
reporting is not combined and that it is not simply put in and 
consolidated, as we see with Imperial Oil and Sunoco?  They tell 
us what they made in crude and of course what they made in the 
entire downstream, which is refining and retailing.  As we know, 
they are two completely separate businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are opportunities for the federal government and 
parliament to begin to look at the impact a possible continental 
energy policy would have on product.  For instance, in regard to 
transferring a certain amount of product from Canada to the 
United States, priced in U.S. dollars, if we do not take into 
account the fact that there will be an impact on Canadians, a 
cost push in higher prices, then I think we are engaging in a 
fool's errand.  There is no doubt in my mind that a continental 
energy policy must take into account the impact it could have on 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is important that we head in that direction and 
that we begin to look at ways in which we can co-ordinate our 
valuable energies and our resources.  However, if we fail to 
estimate the impact on Canadians, we will lose the very people 
who give this place legitimacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now gasoline is at 80 cents a litre in Toronto and there 
is an 18 cent a litre margin at the refinery level, which not too 
many papers, media or members of parliament want to talk about. 
We tend to spin around and worry about the taxes that are part of 
gasoline.  I think they are important, but there is not a single 
member of the House of Commons who does not know that those taxes 
go back into general revenues and are there for the common good 
of the country.  We can dismiss re-election for every member of 
parliament here if we do not like the way our taxes are spent, 
but there is no accountability for the chairman of Imperial Oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That money that we call taxpayers' money, which is part and 
parcel of the cost of crude, does not go up on long weekends and 
every Canadian knows that.  Canadians also know it goes to pay 
for our hospitals and for our roads.  Equally, they know that if 
we are dealing with the subject of taxes maybe we ought to look 
at how the oil industry is spending those taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may come as a surprise to some members of the House of 
Commons that an oil company will charge an independent cash on 
the barrelhead, taxes in, for delivery of goods and products, for 
their product, the gasoline.  They demand the taxes up front. 
However, because they are large companies they get to keep that 
tax for 30 to 40 days as a float, simply because they happen to 
be large players.  That is part of their general revenue.  Never 
has working with the government been so profitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason I find it rather ironic that we are dealing with 
what appears to be a rather casual housekeeping matter in Bill 
C-3, that we should proceed with this.  However, make no mistake 
about it.  Most of us here know that we are proceeding with the 
further privatization of a company that has done very well from 
the marketing point of view considering where its shares were a 
few years ago.  I applaud the company for that.  They are now at 
$40.72 in trading.  That is quite a whack of cash.  Some $2 
billion is what the federal government has at stake here if it 
decides to sell its common shares on the open market tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue very passionately that this money is only a small 
amount of the money Canadians put toward creating Petro-Canada in 
1990 as a result of a decision by the House of Commons.  I think 
the time has come to do something, given the high cost of energy 
and the anticipated even higher costs down the road.  The oil 
companies use the excuses of warmer summers and colder winters or 
shutdowns in Kuala Lumpur or wherever in order to justify these 
high prices.  The excuses are predictable, but they are certainly 
not exhaustive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason I think it is important for the House of Commons 
to consider taking that money and do nothing else, short of 
putting it in the general revenue, but to give it to every single 
Canadian on his or her income tax in the form of a grant, a 
credit or however the system can be worked.  I would advocate 
very strongly for that because I think it gets us away from the 
arguments being made by members on the other side that the 
solution to high costs of energy is somehow related to taxes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the other side know only too well, as my colleagues 
here from New Brunswick know, that when the provincial government 
of New Brunswick in 1992 gave back two cents a litre to 
consumers, delivered through the oil companies, the public never 
saw the savings.  The hon. member for Peterborough knows this 
very well and has said it very eloquently to a lot of his 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers felt that the government was heading in the right 
direction by dropping taxes, for whatever reason, and it was one 
of the more difficult environments in which to do it, but the 
public never saw the savings.  This was reason the Liberal 
committee on gasoline pricing recommended that if we were to take 
the tax off taxes on gasoline, we must ensure that the resulting 
savings go to Canadians, not to the bottom line of oil companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was true then and we have evidence of it having occurred in 
real terms in Canada.  It is one of the reasons that, yes, even 
the right wing government of Mike Harris in the province of 
Ontario agrees with the findings of the committee.  It is one of 
the reasons they have done nothing with their 14.7 cents a litre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also take the liberty at this time to explain and remind 
members of the House of Commons that when it comes to diesel, the 
fuel that keeps our trucks going to and fro, the federal 
government takes a mere four cents a litre, not 14.7 cents, not 
22 cents and not 25 cents.  We recognize the importance of that 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague from Peterborough explained, which I did 
not know, when a farmer or a construction company buys coloured 
fuel no taxes are paid from the federal point of view, period. 
There may GST on it but that is quickly remitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, as it relates to taxes, is on very 
strong ground.  I believe that some day there will be the ability 
for us to afford a tax cut in that area, but consumers are not 
fooled.  Only six months ago crude oil was at $38 a barrel and 
the price at the pump was 77 cents in Ontario. It is now down to 
$26 a barrel for crude and the price has gone up to 80 cents a 
litre and rising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter how many analysts or how much of the public's money is 
being used to bamboozle the public about how gas pricing occurs, 
the public is not fooled by these rather shameful tactics to use 
their money to make them feel like complete idiots when it comes 
to how pricing occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not be so passionate about the question of energy or 
gasoline if I did not think it was a problem that existed 
elsewhere in other industries.  I have talked to other colleagues 
about this before.  I believe we have some problems with respect 
to concentration.  If the oil industry can get away with this, 
then I am sure there are other industries that can do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to finally end by simply saying that I call upon all 
colleagues and members of parliament on both sides.  I am 
certainly interested in hearing their questions.  Believe it or 
not, I had no intention to stand and talk on this bill but it 
begins the process of coming to grips with the changes around us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not begin to understand the market structure to which 
we are making changes, we will have done a disservice to the 
public.  We will have failed in our mission to create good public 
policy.  I plan to work with the government.  It is a good bill 
but let us do it in a manner considerate to the context in which 
Canada currently finds itself with high energy prices. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
think I understood the hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge 
to mean that he believes there is a role for government to 
intervene in and regulate the energy marketplace that, frankly, 
is not serving Canadians very well at this point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize the member is an authority on the subject.  I have 
heard him speak about energy prices many times in the House of 
Commons.  I firmly believe he is genuine in what he is saying, 
but I would ask him to clarify something for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it his feeling or point that government can and should set 
national energy policies for the well-being of Canadians or does 
he believe, like we heard from the Tories, that we should let the 
free hand of the marketplace prevail and it will find its own 
natural level? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I would like to understand a little more clearly 
from the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member for 
Winnipeg Centre and I have had a few discussions about this and I 
thank him for his very kind remarks about my very cursory 
knowledge of the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the hon. member that I believe all options in terms of 
the free market should be available to the industry, as others, 
before we look at the issue of government intervention.  I think 
that intervention by government should be of necessity. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My argument, in very plain words, is that there is a deficiency 
in the free market as it relates to oil and gas.  For anybody to 
tack on 18 cents a litre as a margin at the refinery when 
competitors to the south are operating at substantially less, 
demonstrates to me that if I thought, given that 35 billion 
litres of gasoline is being sold every year, the opportunity of 
potentially making $300 million, to $500 million would invite 
new entrants in the marketplace, that would be the first 
indication that the free market is non-existent here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that our Competition Act needs teeth.  This may 
come as a surprise to some hon. members, but the Competition Act 
was written in 1985 by groups represented very heavily by big 
oil.  It was one of the reasons I brought in my bill which would 
remove the efficiencies defence or excuse in which, if one can 
believe it, a company, if it could demonstrate that it was acting 
in a merger which could have competitive, harmful effects, could 
proceed with the merger as long as it could demonstrate 
efficiency.  We have two players in the case of propane.  This 
was evident in terms of what happened in August.  Superior bought 
out ICG. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Superior went to the competition tribunal because of course the 
bureaucrats said that Superior would have 100% control of the 
energy market.  They said that it would be competitively harmful 
and that it would have a negative impact on consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tribunal, in a two to one decision, said that 
notwithstanding the fact that it would hurt consumers, the 
competitive process and ultimately the free market, the fact that 
one company can buy out the other and shut it down is a form of 
economic efficiency.   That defence was put in specifically in 
1985 so that we would wind up in a situation where there was a 
Competition Act that looked a lot more like a concentration or 
monopolization of the Canada Act.  I think we need to look at the 
economic instruments, such as the Competition Act, to ensure that 
there is fair play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk to the hon. member about independents that have lost 
their shirts because they were too good for the obvious reasons 
that I mentioned.  Cross-subsidization does occur but it should 
be illegal.  It is illegal in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If shareholders knew that oil companies were engaging in the 
practice of losing money at the retail level while saving a lot 
of money at the wholesale level to discipline their competitors 
who rely on them for supply, they would walk away in droves 
saying that those companies were not making proper economic 
decisions and that the government was not paying attention to the 
fact that this was obviously anti-competitive and obviously 
wrong. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, as 
I understand it, what my colleague is saying is that government 
or quasi-government organizations have the very important role of 
ensuring that competition is fair and fair at all levels of 
industry.  I think that is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I have difficulty doing is explaining to my 
constituents how it has been possible to undertake competition 
type reviews of this industry or parts of this industry, 
culminating I think in the conference board review within the 
last year or so, and yet it is impossible to demonstrate the 
collusion and the anti-competitiveness that my constituents feel 
are occurring in the oil and gasoline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my colleague take us through and explain what has happened 
with those reviews? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague:</B>  Madam Speaker, those are very excellent 
questions.  I want to explain to the hon. member that although I 
and many members on the committee held much promise that the 
conference board would do a thorough and independent job, it 
became apparent to us that much of its methodologies were in fact 
wrong and flawed.  For instance, it compared that wholesale 
market that I was talking about, the refinery level, to 1% of the 
U.S. market, mostly the market of Plattsburgh and Buffalo, New 
York, which of course are trailers to the Toronto and Montreal 
markets.  There was an asymmetry in terms of comparison.  The 
board was literally comparing watermelons to apples, with the 
apples in the U.S. following the situation here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if the board had taken the whole of the United States 
and compared it to the whole of Canada it would have found, as I 
and many others have discovered in any objective review, that the 
two are very different.  In the U.S., in many respects, one will 
find that its refineries do not even sell gasoline at retail so 
there is real vibrant competition at the wholesale level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the hon. member's question was a very good 
one.  It dealt with the question of why investigations have not 
turned up conspiracy collusion.  I want hon. members to really 
understand this.  Collusion is not illegal in Canada.  The burden 
of proof to discover collusion and price fixing under section 45 
requires not only the establishment of the fact that it has 
happened and not only the intent of the individual, but that it 
had an undue impact or an undue standard on the market.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Can anyone believe this?  Our Competition Act is similar to 
someone going in, knocking over a bank, having the intent to 
knock it over, carrying it out, pistol-whipping whoever is there 
but not being proven as having committed a criminal act unless 
the effect of their act is to bring about the collapse of the 
Canadian monetary system.  It means it is a burden of proof not 
beyond reasonable doubt but a burden of proof that can never be 
proven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member would probably have the chairman of Imperial 
Oil, Shell or any of those companies, which I am sure they would 
not do nor should they do, come before the Supreme Court of 
Canada and swear under oath that they had committed a conspiracy 
and of course done that by way of affidavit. Therefore the 
problem is with the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I beg the hon. member and all hon. members in the House 
to remind themselves who wrote the Competition Act in 1985. If 
they do not like the way it was written and they do not like the 
high, unjustified costs of energy that have been fleecing 
Canadians, then I beg them to ignore the fact that the media has 
locked the issue down and to start discussing it because their 
constituents are doing it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member's speech. 
He has talked about the role of government in the energy sector 
and has spoken about the importance of government being able to 
play an effective role on behalf of the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put to him that, as a result of some decisions his own 
government has enthusiastically supported, particularly around 
the adoption of NAFTA, and now its proposal for the FTAA, it has 
taken away precisely the tools that government needs to 
effectively assist the people of this country in the energy 
sector and, for that matter, in many other sectors.  I would like 
the member to comment on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister was bragging recently about the continental 
energy pact.  He talked about how he had educated President 
George Bush about the fact that we have tar sands.  My God, we 
have tar sands.  The Prime Minister said “He didn't know two 
months ago.  I'm a good teacher”.  He may be a good teacher but 
he is an even better person to sell off our resources and the 
control that Canadians should have over our own destiny when it 
comes to energy resources and other resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not recognize that as a result of the NAFTA 
provisions, which now exist, that we are not in a position to 
decide as Canadians that if, for example, there are energy 
shortages in this country that we will give preference to the 
people of Canada?  It is not exactly a revolutionary concept, is 
it, that when Canadians want to have access to their own energy 
resources they should be given preferential access to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under NAFTA and under the FTAA, as proposed and enthusiastically 
supported by the government, we have lost that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the hon. member to explain how it is that he is so 
concerned about Canada's ability to protect our own energy 
resources when his government sold out that ability by adopting 
NAFTA and now proposing the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague:</B>  Madam Speaker, I need no lesson from 
the hon. member when it comes to speaking out against my own 
party.  I know the hon. member has quite a degree of interest in 
that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out to the hon. member that there are many 
countries in this world that have those kind of resources. Russia 
would be a good example of where it cannot get the investment to 
get the resources.  Sure, it may belong to the people, but 
ultimately the people will never see the benefit of those 
resources because they will remain in the ground ad infinitum 
with that kind of a socialist policy, which we understand to mean 
not recognizing the market as it currently exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell the hon. member that I am prepared to exhaust the 
free market and make sure it works appropriately before we have 
some kind of a command system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member had a class example of why gasoline prices are 
expensive in his own riding.  The Atlantic Richfield Company came 
into his riding, knocked out a few independents, had prices below 
cost, even below the level of taxation, and the hon. member never 
once raised the issue.  The independents are out of the way and 
British Columbians in his riding are now paying among the highest 
prices for gasoline in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to my position as it relates to gasoline, I would 
ask the hon. member to once and for all take up this issue, tell 
his constituents why he did not talk about this and explain to 
them specifically what international policy or international 
conspiracy has to do— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The hon. member for 
Prince Albert.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I was not intending to speak on this matter, but 
there has been such good debate and provocative ideas presented 
that I could not resist it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I picked up some of my Liberal friend's comments which I found 
very interesting.  I give him credit for standing up and not just 
taking the party line.  He gave a fairly damning indictment about 
competition law in the country saying that it was ineffective, 
that it was geared against the consumer and that we really did 
not have competition.  He alluded to the U.S. and how good things 
were there, how much better the consumer was served, how much 
better the prices were and that it had good competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would invite the government to look across the border at the 
U.S. competition law and policies and then bring forth 
legislation in the House that would create a more competitive 
economy in the country to better serve our consumers.  I thank 
him for pointing this matter out.  This has to be heard by other 
people on the other side of the House, and I give him credit for 
raising this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For people my age in Saskatchewan and Alberta, who I believe are 
thinking people and can remember things, if they are depressed 
today, the word Petro-Canada is not like Prozac.  It does not 
have good vibes in my part of the country.  It brings back bad 
memories about a thing called the national energy plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My New Democrat friends do something that I have seen very few 
people do in my lifetime.  They are good at forecasting the 
future, or they think they are.  Lenin and Marx predicted the 
future, and there were a whole slew of socialist thinkers after 
that time who projected the future of civilization.  I would like 
to know which one has actually predicted the future accurately. 
I think just about every one of them totally struck out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in the 1970s when we brought in Petro-Canada, the prime 
minister was worried about the $100 per barrel oil price.  The 
energy minister at that time talked about the same thing, that 
the invisible hand of the market would bring prices up that high 
and Canadians had to be protected.  The NDP members at that time 
were the government's cheerleaders.  They said the government was 
right, that they could see the future.  We have not seen $80 per 
barrel oil prices and we have not seen $100 per barrel oil 
prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something else concerns me.  There is an aspect of the bill with 
which I have a good deal of difficulty.  There are a lot of 
restrictions on the shares and the ownership of these shares.  I 
do not buy fuel from Petro-Canada.  It is a matter of principle 
with me because I am one of those people who remembers the 
experience from the 1970s.  However I drive by every once in a 
while to check Petro-Canada's prices.  Believe me it is the same 
price as Shell, Imperial Oil, the Co-op and other competitors in 
the marketplace.  If I and my learned friends over there were 
somehow going to get a benefit ownership, I have not seen it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was much lamenting about how the oil industry gouged the 
economy with excessive pricing.  I would suggest to most folks in 
the House that if we got rid of the wellhead price, the royalty 
structure, the excise tax on fuel and so on we would probably see 
an instant 50% plus reduction in the price.  If there are any 
benefactors out of increased energy prices in this economy, it is 
the provincial and federal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the members from Saskatchewan who spoke 
earlier that if oil and energy prices were not at the levels they 
are today their NDP government in Saskatchewan would have an 
enormous problem trying to balance the books. 
It is about the only thing in that province these days that pays 
the bills.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am amazed that the member for Palliser would say that we 
should go back to a two price, made in Canada price.  Was he 
actually saying that we should price 15% to 20% of Saskatchewan's 
oil and energy for Ontario, Quebec and other regions of the 
country at a dramatically lower rate than what we would for an 
export price to the U.S.?  I would find it very surprising if 
people in Saskatchewan would accept that as good logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise a few comments about the share structure.  I am 
trying to figure out why they would have a restriction that 
nobody could own shares in excess of 15% or 20% or whatever the 
amount is.  I have a lot of problems with that.  In my view 
Petro-Canada is no different than Shell or any other oil company. 
They are in the marketplace and are privately held companies. Why 
does the government want this restriction in the bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general commented that a lot of our crown 
corporations and government owned operations were vehicles to 
appoint unqualified people to important positions.  Many of them 
are not doing a very good job.  I would say the government does 
not want to lose control of Petro-Canada because it wants to 
retain the ability to appoint people to the board of directors. 
It is one of those plums that it still has and it does not want 
to give it up.  That is one explanation why it would be that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was mentioned that the share price of Petro-Canada is $36 a 
share.  If my math is right, if those shares were sold at $36 a 
share that would be $1.8 billion.  If that was paid on our 
national debt that would mean we would save about $136 million 
every year on interest charges.  That would go right to the 
bottom line of this national federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This money could be used to build highways or buy MRI machines 
for Saskatchewan.  Saskatchewan does not really have many MRIs. 
It could be used to help children.  As my learned friend with the 
Liberals mentioned, maybe we could do what Mike Harris did in 
Ontario and pay that money back to the taxpayer in the form of a 
dividend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad some of the Liberal members are starting to learn that 
some of the things Mike Harris is doing in Ontario are all right. 
There is one over there that is not in agreement with the 
proposal of her fellow colleague but he was quite bullish on 
that.  I want to point that matter out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these restrictions were removed from the shares and these 
shares could be freely traded, maybe we would be talking about 
$45 a share.  Then we could be looking at $2.5 billion or $3 
billion on these things.  These restrictions diminish the value 
of those shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the head office being in Ottawa?  I think that even 
lawyers who graduated from law school with a D average could find 
a way to get around that loophole.  They could hire one 
secretary, put a telephone in that office, put up a sign saying 
head office and that would qualify.  I really do not know where 
this sort of thing comes from.  If anyone thinks about this 
seriously, this could be a way of maintaining some sort of 
Canadian control.  We have too much of this.  We have the same 
sort of problem with Air Canada with that sort of thing in 
legislation.  It is another restriction on ownership.  It is 
about politics and not good business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few more comments about the province of Saskatchewan. 
Much was said about our crown corporations.  I want to bring up 
one matter which is Wascana Energy, a crown corporation owned by 
the New Democratic government. 
Some Canadian owned companies in Calgary tried to purchase that 
company.  The premier and his cabinet did not want to give up 
ownership of the company and opposed it.  A year or so later, lo 
and behold they sold it to Occidental Petroleum, an American 
corporation out of California.  Guess who sits on the board of 
directors of Occidental Petroleum?  Allan Blakeney.  He lost his 
socialist past and is part of that corporate agenda.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of other crown corporation ownerships in Saskatchewan 
were used to balance the budget in that province.  Believe it or 
not the NDP government sold its shares in Cameco and applied it 
to the public debt.  That is amazing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saskatchewan government owned shares in the Potash 
Corporation of Saskatchewan and sold those.  It owned a big stake 
in the heavy oil operator at Lloydminster.  Guess what the NDP 
government did with its shares?  It did what Mike Harris or Ralph 
Klein might have done and sold them.  Then its government members 
went around Canada and said they were good fiscal conservatives. 
I am not going to disagree with them.  That is good fiscal 
conservatism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I find all these comments about the Saskatchewan family 
of crown corporations rather strange.  I also find it strange 
that a member from Saskatchewan would talk about returning us to 
the national energy program where Saskatchewan would sell its oil 
to other Canadians at well below market prices.  I wonder how the 
premier of that province would balance his books?  He would 
probably come to Ottawa, ask the Prime Minister to give the 
province more money because it had a shortfall in its budget and 
needed more financial assistance.  I find a lot of those comments 
hard to defend from a Saskatchewan perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one last comment I would like to make.  If atomic 
energy ever takes off, we will be the Saudi Arabia of the world 
in terms of atomic energy.  There are a lot of interesting things 
on the go in atomic energy.  South Africa has a interesting 
project with a 100 megawatt nuclear reactor, not a 1000 megawatt 
reactor, and it uses modern ISO standards of construction.  If 
this ever catches on and is a safe way of delivering energy, 
Saskatchewan will be the place sitting on the energy in North 
America, not Alberta or Texas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan is sitting on a great opportunity if it can find 
the technology to deliver atomic energy safely to consumers in 
North America.  I do not think our governments should close the 
door to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know coal and hydro are problems.  We certainly know with 
some of the treaties of the problems with hydrocarbons and 
petroleum.  Atomic energy is starting to look like it has some 
possibilities, especially with modern technology.  Most of the 
nuclear industries we know use 1950 or 1960 technology in 
developing their plants.  We have an opportunity to use much more 
advanced technology to develop high quality nuclear reactors 
today that could deliver clean energy to consumers in North 
America.  We should be looking at that as an opportunity in the 
future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very glad to be able to join the debate on Bill C-3.  I am 
probably one of those people who the member for Prince Albert was 
talking about.  I firmly believe the federal government has not 
just a role but an obligation to try to ensure that Canadians 
have good access to affordable energy, especially in our harsh 
winter climate.  Energy is not a luxury commodity it is a 
necessary commodity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something that is our birthright, something that is our common 
wealth, something that is part of our Canadian heritage should be 
accessible to Canadians at a preferential price than we sell it 
offshore.  I am proud to say that on behalf of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians, especially people in my riding, have phoned me 
and asked for help, for some relief, for the federal government 
to stop being so impotent when it comes to giving them access to 
affordable energy.  They are asking why it cannot be that way. 
They sent us here to represent their interests.  This winter 
their interests or needs were better access to affordable energy 
because they thought they were being gouged, ripped off and 
cheated by big oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when Canadians collectively decided to try to 
take steps to represent their interests when it came to energy. 
That is when people with more vision apparently than those who 
occupy the House today came up with the idea that perhaps we 
should not have our entire energy industry foreign owned and 
foreign controlled because we do not know when we are being 
gouged or overcharged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did not say, as the hon. member for Prince Albert was 
trying to imply, that we should nationalize the whole industry. 
They did not come on that strong.  They said we should have one 
oil company, a watchdog, a window on the industry.  We would be 
part of the industry and we would have one company owned by the 
people of Canada, not owned by the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with that idea?  What is it about that idea that 
so frightens small minded people?  The hon. member also tried to 
imply that crown corporations are owned by the party in power.  I 
get tired about hearing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very fitting, timely and appropriate that we are having 
this debate today because I think energy is a top of mind issue 
for most Canadians.  Certainly judging from the calls I have 
received in recent months, frankly this past winter, Canadians 
are very concerned about a constant and reliable supply of clean, 
affordable energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am mostly concerned about the homeowners who live in my 
riding.  They are my primary concern, but small businesses, 
schools, hospitals, institutions and non-profit organizations are 
reeling with shock and horror at what is happening to their 
operating costs, for seemingly no rhyme or reason.  Seemingly 
arbitrary skyrocketing prices in energy are what infuriates 
Canadians the most.  That is why recently people such as me in my 
private member's bill have been advocating some kind of 
government intervention, some kind of regulation, no matter what 
form it takes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it bothers the hon. member for Prince Albert so much, we will 
not call it a national energy program.  That seems to irritate 
him.  It seems to set him off.  We do not want to provoke him and 
make him any more hostile than he already is, so we will call it 
something else.  Let us call it an energy price commission. There 
is a good moderate sort of phrase.  It would not have broad 
sweeping powers to nationalize every oil industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we are saying is we want some stability and some 
regulations.  If we had an arm's length energy price commission, 
the oil companies would have to come, whether producers or 
retailers, to that commission and justify why they deserve a rate 
increase, a hike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not let it happen every long week.  Perhaps twice a 
year or perhaps every six months, they could come before that 
panel and argue the merits of their case as to why they deserve 
an energy price increase and then that would be it.  If it were 
justifiable, the people of Canada would know the rationale and 
they would not feel so gouged, cheated and ripped off as they do 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who spoke previously can call that whatever he 
wants.  I call it a good idea.  I call it advocating on behalf of 
Canadians.  It is not just the NDP that seems to think that way. 
The Government of Newfoundland introduced such a thing a short 
two months ago.  We have been talking about it all winter.  I am 
sure it was not our initiative that gave it the idea.  It 
actually learned it from the Government of Prince Edward Island 
because it had been doing that for 40 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Prince Edward Island had the common sense to 
represent the interests of its own people and put the interests 
of its citizens before the interests of big oil.  It could stand 
up on its hind legs and stand up to big oil.  Now Newfoundland 
has followed.  Perhaps now it does not sound like such a crazy 
idea to the small minded people who are afraid of that concept. 
Canadians would be proud of us if they could hear a debate in the 
House in which we represent their interests and not the interests 
of big oil.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a lot about energy pricing today.  I should like 
to raise another element.  The member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge talked about the real costs of margins 
from the producer to the refiner.  I should like to talk about 
the whole cost of energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to start viewing energy pricing.  We have to look at the 
whole cost of burning fossil fuels.  When we look at the whole 
cost of oil as a fossil fuel it is amazing.  It is not the $12 a 
barrel that it costs to produce a barrel of oil in the tar sands. 
It is not the $28 a barrel that we are charged by OPEC.  It is 
more like $150 a barrel when the cost of the American military to 
keep the gulf shipping lanes open is factored in.  When the 
environmental degradation that takes place every time we burn a 
litre of fossil fuels is factored in, that is the whole cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it is viewed that way all other sources of alternative 
energy such as solar power or wind power seem like a bargain by 
comparison.  Demand side management becomes the logical choice. 
Instead of trying to find ways to get cheaper access to fossil 
fuels and soiling our own nests to the point where we cannot live 
on the planet for very much longer if we carry on, we should be 
looking at ways to enjoy the same quality of life or even an 
improved quality of life using less and less energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada should be a centre of excellence in demand side 
management.  Obviously we have needs that most countries do not 
have in terms of a harsh winter climate.  We should be experts in 
the field of doing more with less.  I certainly advocate that as 
being the direction we should go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To meet the actual immediate needs of Canadians I believe there 
is a role for government to play in intervening to represent the 
interests of Canadian citizens before the interests of oil 
companies.  The idea of a national energy program should not be 
frightening.  It should not be met with such fear and 
trepidation.  It is not a two headed monster.  It is looking 
after people's interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only real thing that we have seen the government try to do 
to recognize the plight of Canadians this last winter was the gas 
rebate, the home heating rebate program.  I received a phone call 
from a person in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut.  I do not know how he 
got my number.  It is not in my riding, but the argument was the 
rebate system was flawed and that we should think about what it 
does to northerners.  Northerners make higher salaries because of 
the increased cost of living.  Nobody in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, 
got the $125 because none of them were at the low income cutoff 
line that we see in most cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though they have $500 and $600 per month home heating bills 
in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, nobody was getting the rebate.  The 
rebate of $125 would heat their houses for one week but they did 
not get a penny.  It was getting so bad that the home heating 
retailer would not give credit any more.  People had to show up 
with cash on the barrelhead to purchase a barrel of home heating 
oil because he was concerned that they simply would not be paying 
those bills because they did not have the money.  That is the 
kind of crisis we are facing when we do not intervene on people's 
behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a great deal about energy supply and energy 
strategies.  Now we are starting to hear about a continental 
energy strategy, that George Bush has a vision of being able to 
tap into the resources of the whole hemisphere.  We heard 
recently he now plans to open up the natural gas fields in 
Alaska, causing the need for the Mackenzie Valley pipeline or a 
pipeline like it to run down through Yukon or through Alaska into 
the southern states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see why he is interested.  There is 33 trillion cubic feet 
of natural gas in that one natural gas field.  It seems like an 
astronomical number until we consider that every year the United 
States uses 22 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.  He is going 
to open up the north and arguably, although I think the argument 
is pretty good, it will do serious environmental damage to Canada 
with the Mackenzie Valley pipeline that has been studied to 
death.  There is no way to build this pipeline without serious 
interference with the flora and fauna of the Yukon territory so 
that the United States can have natural gas for one and a half 
years.  He will do all that damage for one and a half years of 
natural gas.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is staggering to me.  It is probably the best and most 
graphic illustration I can find to make the point that we cannot 
continue to do what we are doing.  The jig is up in terms of 
energy consumption in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Suzuki had a good statistic recently.  He said that for 
everyone in all the developing nations to live with the same 
level of energy use as we live with in Canada today, we would 
need six more planets.  There are not enough resources on this 
planet for everyone in China to have 2.2 vehicles in the garage, 
an outboard motor and all other things we use energy for.  There 
simply is not enough.  There simply would not be enough air to 
breathe if we were fuelling that many vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to take a sensible approach to an energy strategy.  I 
would argue that our energy price commission would comment on 
alternative forms of energy.  This would not only help set the 
price of energy and the length of time at which those prices 
would be fixed, but it would also promote alternative sources of 
energy.  It would promote Canada as a centre of excellence for 
alternative energy sources so that we could develop the 
technology and export it.  This would benefit the planet instead 
of just flooding the world with more and more natural gas and 
oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we used an interventionist hand or at least took a regulating 
role, the Government of Canada could not only benefit Canadians 
by better access to affordable energy but also benefit the world 
in terms of showing some vision and some recognition that what we 
are doing is wrong and sooner or later we need to wean ourself 
off fossil fuels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of being a fiercely proud Canadian nationalist, Bill 
C-3 seems like the death rattle of a national dream.  I hearken 
back to a time when people in the Chamber had enough sense, 
foresight and political courage to take active steps to represent 
the interests of Canadian citizens before the interests of oil 
companies.  That manifested itself in a national energy program, 
part of the strategy which had one oil company owned by the 
people of Canada so that we had a watchdog on the industry and a 
window into how the industry really operated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a time of courage.  That was an era when people had 
some vision and some political courage.  That has been eroded and 
stripped away by the mania that everything must be deregulated, 
the free hand of the market must prevail and the government must 
not intervene whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has not served us well.  It was the mantra of the Business 
Council on National Issues and groups acting out of self-interest 
and not the common good.  We used to have people who were taking 
steps for the common good.  What a concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe our precious natural resources are part of our common 
wealth.  It is a term we also do not hear too often.  Some of us 
feel strongly that the oil under our feet is part of the common 
wealth we all share as Canadian citizens.  Our children should be 
proud of it and we should be able to feel secure about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the galling things is that we have now watched successive 
governments trade away our ability to intervene on behalf of 
Canadians when it comes to preferential pricing of energy 
products even though it is ours, is under our soil and we seem to 
have quite a bit of it.  We have an abundance of natural gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used to work on the oil rigs in Alberta.  Every time we hit 
natural gas everybody would collectively curse under their breath 
because they did not want more gas.  We would cap those wells off 
and move on to the next well.  That is a fact.  One cannot swing 
a cat in northern Alberta without hitting a capped off natural 
gas well.  There is no shortage.  There is a manufactured 
shortage if anything so prices can be jacked up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to my original point, there was a time in 1975 when 
men and women in this place with political courage, with vision 
and with a fierce national pride inspired whole generations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a young man then and I was very proud of the fact that we 
were taking active steps to represent ourselves and make sure we 
did not lose whole industries to foreign ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Liberals such as Walter Gordon and Paul Martin Sr. and 
people like them were against too much foreign ownership.  They 
passed laws to regulate how much of our industry should be 
controlled by foreigners.  Frankly we want the interests of 
Canadians to be put before the interests of others. That is only 
natural. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, then, would successive governments, the Tory government 
under Mulroney and now the Liberal government under the current 
leadership, trade away to our export market our ability to make 
sure Canadians have access to our precious energy resources at a 
preferential price?  I call it economic treason when someone 
trades that away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  It being 5.30 p.m., the 
House will now proceed to the consideration of private members' 
business as listed on today's order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I note that the hon. member from the Liberal Party who 
was to move his motion does not appear to be in the House.  I do 
have a motion on the same subject which I would be pleased, with 
the consent of the House, to propose.  It calls for recognition 
of the Armenian genocide of 1915.  I certainly would be pleased 
to proceed with my motion in the absence of the hon. member, if 
there is consent of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I wonder if it would be helpful to the House if we would 
extend government orders for a while until the member arrives. If 
the member arrives we could stop immediately at that time to deal 
with the item.  I would be prepared to agree with that. Otherwise 
I guess we have no choice but to adjourn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Is there unanimous

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> The hon. member for Brampton 
Centre is not present to move his motion pursuant to the notice 
published in today's notice paper. Accordingly, the order is 
dropped from the order paper.
