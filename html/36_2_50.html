</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today the people of Lithuania and Lithuanian Canadians 
are celebrating the occasion of the 82nd anniversary of the 
Declaration of Independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has always had a very positive relationship with 
Lithuania.  This is partly due to our steadfast refusal to 
recognize the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states and also our 
rapid recognition of re-independence in 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's active Lithuania Canadian community has also greatly 
contributed to fostering exchanges and maintaining the friendship 
between our countries.  The cultural and diplomatic ties between 
our countries have been fostered and strengthened over time 
through the twinning of cities, military co-operation through 
NATO's partnership for peace, as well as trade investment 
initiatives such as the Baltic express mission in 1998.  The 
government is currently planning a follow-up Baltic express 
mission which will take place in September of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to offer my congratulations to President Adamkus, 
the Lithuanian parliament and to the people of Lithuania on this 
momentous occasion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for 
months now I have had farmers from my riding of Athabasca coming 
to me to tell me how they are suffering.  Alberta farmers are 
being crushed under a burden of debt and non-existent profits due 
to crop failures, high input costs and low commodity prices. 
Many of the municipalities in the province of Alberta have 
declared their regions disaster areas, and life is not getting

provide them with any substantive relief or assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been trying my best to help our farmers, but now I 
realize that what I should have been telling them all these 
months was, instead of lobbying the agriculture minister for 
assistance, they should have sent in bogus applications to the 
Minister of Human Resources Development.  No doubt they would 
have received more money than they could ever have hoped for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go back to the farmers to give them an update I can tell 
them that the reason they have not received any real assistance 
is that this government was too busy losing over a billion 
dollars to worry about western farmers.

distinguished citizens.  J. Angus MacLean, a long-time member of 
the House and a former premier of P.E.I., died yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The man everyone knew as Angus served our province as opposition 
leader from 1976 to 1979.  He was premier from 1979 to 1981.  He 
retired from leadership but continued to serve his constituents 
as their MLA for another year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to his tour of provincial duty, Angus was one of the 
members of parliament for the dual riding of Queens in Prince 
Edward Island, which became the riding of Malpeque in 1966.  He 
served in the House in a most distinguished fashion for 25 years. 
During that period Angus was Minister of Fisheries from 1957 to 
1963. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Born on a small farm in 1914, Angus never lost his affinity for 
the rural way of life.  He left the island to serve his country 
in World War II in 1939.  His aircraft was shot down, he spent 10 
weeks behind enemy lines and finally made his escape to safety. 
Decorated for his heroics with the RCAF during the war, Angus 
returned home to his beloved province and a life of public 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A man of principle, Angus drew respect from people of every 
political stripe.  His common sense approach and sense of fair 
play endeared him to all.  His droll sense of humour also served 
him well.

identified.  The protocol left the issue of labelling of 
transgenic foods unresolved, however.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when the Minister of Human Resources Development was 
busy with Indian Affairs and Northern Development, she knew about 
problems with millions of dollars that were funnelled from HRDC 
to the Metis Provincial Council of B.C.  In fact she received 
over 50 complaints from the Metis regarding, guess what, missing 
funds, sloppy bookkeeping, political interference and possible 
conflicts of interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the minister do?  She did nothing.  What has she done 
about this since she became minister of HRDC?  She has done 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the minister do nothing about complaints, warnings and 
audits until they receive media exposure? 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, again the hon. member is wrong.  In 
reference to this issue, a third party audit was done by 
Consulting and Audit Canada.  We are working with the Metis 
nation to improve the relationship we have with them and to deal 
with the issues that have been brought forward on that account. 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad the minister mentioned the audit because the 
audit of the Metis program stated “internal policies, procedures 
and monitoring were either not in place or not being followed”, 
referring to things such as nepotism, missing documents, missing 
applications.  Does that sound familiar?  Two audits, two 
programs, same minister.  Does the House see a pattern here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With her disastrous track record, why does the minister not just 
admit that she is way out of her league and resign? 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

hon. member has said here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of the House, we believe that the Government of 
Canada can work with individuals and organizations to make a 
difference in the lives of Canadians.  We will continue to stand 
up for that, and I, as minister of Human Resources Development 
Canada, will ensure that in the area of grants and contributions 
we have an administrative practice and process in place that will 
support these very important programs.

<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
wish to inform the House that I am designating tomorrow, February 
17, as an allotted day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>QUESTION PERIOD 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I thought I would rise on a brief point of order related to what 
has been happening in question period the last few days.  I rise 
partly out of concern for the whole House, but partly to make a 
specific case for the smaller parties.  It is a case I have made 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as you know, if you have to take a lot of time 
standing, waiting for order, that uses up time which would 
otherwise go toward questions and answers.  If we do not get to 
the so-called third round, that is to say, the third opportunity 
for the smaller parties, the smaller parties then lose a much 
larger percentage of the time for questions that is available to 
them than the Reform Party and the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit empirically, and not in any partisan way, that it is 
just the nature of the place, that most of the banter, the noise 
and the shouting—although we contribute from time to time, the 
same as the Conservatives—takes place between the government and 
the two major opposition parties.  In effect, we as a smaller 
party are punished for behaviour to which we are only minor 
contributors, if you like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this accumulates day over day into a form of unfairness 
which I am asking you, Mr. Speaker, to address.  I am asking you 
to be tougher with the House in this respect, in terms of order. 
I am pleading with my fellow House leaders and fellow colleagues. 
We do not need the level of racket in this place that has come to 
characterize it.  We cannot hear each other.  There is too much 
cheap hollering going on when people are trying to listen.  I do 
not like a lot of the answers that are given, or for that matter 
a lot of the questions, but I would like to hear them.  If we 
cannot do that, then what is the point of being here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore you, Mr. Speaker, to be tougher with members.  If you 
ask members not to say something and they say it, move on.  Do 
not stand there and plead with them for minutes and use up 
minutes that belong to the smaller parties.  If you ask people to 
move to their question and they do not move to their question, if 
the next sentence that comes out of their mouth is not in an 
interrogatory form, move on.  They will get the message.  They 
will stop doing it.  I think we need less exhortation and more 
punishment.  That is what has to happen in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge you, Mr. Speaker, to consider what I have said. 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I cannot help but echo the same sentiments of the 
House leader of the New Democratic Party.  There is a 
disproportionate price that is paid by the smaller parties as a 
result of the system and the process that has evolved.  When 
question period is cut short due to the racket, it is the two 
last questioners in the House who inevitably lose their 
questions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has already been pointed out—and I think the government 
House leader would support this position—there should be an 
intervention on the part of the Chair because the acquiescence, 
in essence, hurts parties that are not causing the problem and we 
are paying a disproportionate price.  To lose one question out of 
a possible five or six is a huge portion of the amount of floor 
time that we have in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would echo that sentiment and ask that the Chair be more 
diligent in interventions if questions are not posed properly. 
If time is being wasted we should move to the next party or the 
next questioner. 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is something being lost, which is the fact that if 
members on the government side make a lot of noise and I, as was 
the case today, am penalized because of their noise, I cannot get 
my question out and I cannot make the points that I carefully 
considered before even asking the question.  If I am then cut off 
and directed to move right to the question because of the 
misdemeanour of Liberals, that is not fair.  I carefully consider 
what I want to put to the minister.  I have a complete package 
and if I am cut off because of their misdemeanour that is not 
equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that when you consider this point of 
order you also consider the fact that my rights are being 
interfered with inappropriately when I am cut off because of 
noise from the government benches.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to make three comments on the matter we are 
addressing at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I must say that I feel a great deal of sympathy 
with the views expressed by the NDP and Progressive Conservative 
House leaders.  I do feel that time wasted in this House results 
in missed opportunities for questions, not just for the two 
smallest opposition parties, but also for the other two 
opposition parties.  This is indeed most regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, however, like you to also take into consideration the 
point of view expressed by our Reform Party colleague, who has 
just said something I am in complete agreement with.  As members 
of the opposition, when we ask a question, we must not be taken 
hostage by the lack of discipline of the Liberals, which might 
result in question period being speeded up.  We have to be 
careful about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point I would like to raise is that, while I have 
every sympathy for the point of view of the NDP House Leader, I 
strongly deplore the tone in which she addressed you, 
Mr. Speaker; it was cavalier to say the least. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me add my thoughts to the debate on this point of 
order.  I agree that decorum is a bulwark of democracy. 
Civilized behaviour during question period enhances our image in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, when you make a ruling and advise any member, 
whether the member occupies a position of title or not, that 
ruling truly must be upheld immediately.  With that kind of 
decision, Mr. Speaker, the Speaker's chair will earn the greater 
respect of parliament and Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
too empathize with the House leaders from both the NDP and Tory 
party who have described what happens when time is wasted in 
abundance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today during the intervention by the member from Nose Hill it 
took nine minutes for the government side to quiet down long 
enough for the member to get out a truncated question because of 
the delaying tactics.  It took nine minutes.  We could sit here 
as quiet as mice during that time, but if the uproar continues 
over there, not only do the smaller parties, but all of us, 
including Canadians, get short shrift because other good 
questions get lost in the hubbub. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very true that sometimes when asked to go directly to a 
question when a member has done nothing wrong, Mr. Speaker, you 
can make the judgment call on who is creating the fuss.  However, 
often when someone has been interrupted two or three times, not 
by any noise made on this side of the House but by standing 
ovations and carrying on over there, if the ruling is delivered 
“You are finished, go directly to your question”, that is not 
the fault of the member asking the question, it is the fault of 
the government, in this case, which chose to take up nine minutes 
with general hubbub and carrying on.  That is not right.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, an important point has been raised here.  I do think it 
is not just the responsibility of the Speaker, but it is the 
responsibility of all of us in the House.  I think we were all 
encouraged when a time limit was put on questions and answers. It 
allowed more participation in question period and it certainly 
helped pick up the pace of question period. On both sides of the 
House there is some fault and some correction to be taken. 
Inflammatory language in questions simply stirs a response. 
Perhaps that response should be more contained than it is, but I 
do encourage you, Mr. Speaker, to do whatever you can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak on behalf of Liberal members who do not usually 
get their first question on until at least 2.45 p.m.  We are the 
ones who are most penalized if question period drags on longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support some of the comments that have been made but I also 
encourage all members in the House to support you, Mr. Speaker,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a brief comment about this point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend you for extending question period today by a few 
minutes.  I know it is difficult for you to make that judgment 
call, but perhaps that is one avenue you could choose in the 
future.  If the majority of the disturbances in question period 
are coming from the government side, then obviously as many have 
made the point, it is the opposition that primarily is penalized. 
If you were to extend question period by another five or ten 
minutes or whatever time they want to take up, I do not think it 
would take very many days before the government side would learn 
the lesson that questions will still get asked. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly, 
when decorum is absent from our deliberations during Oral 
Question Period, fewer questions are asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must kept in mind, however, that the objective of question 
period is not just to ask questions, but to get answers.  The 
public's expectation of Oral Question Period is that it will 
gain a better understanding of how government and parliament 
operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do deplore the lack of decorum, which results in not all 
questions getting asked.  Unfortunately, answers are rarely 
forthcoming, and I realize this is beyond your control, 
Mr. Speaker, and not affected by decorum. 
Please excuse me for saying what I think.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  I rise on the same point of 
order, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think representations to you suggesting in any way that your 
demeanour has not led to expeditious handling of these matters in 
the House would be totally unfounded. I think you have 
demonstrated exemplary behaviour in the way you have tried to 
bring order at times.  I think the solution to the problem lies 
with members themselves on all sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will hear three more interventions and 
then I will go from there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I think we all agree that we have confidence in the 
Speaker.  I want to pick up on the minister's comments as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent upon us as members of parliament when we are 
putting the question that most of us in the Chamber are mature 
enough to know what words are unparliamentary. When we choose 
that type of language we should be shut off completely from 
getting up and going over the question once again because it is 
time delay.  I think both sides of the House would agree on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are under time restraints as individual members.  There is a 
35 second limit on our questions.  Mr. Speaker, I think you have 
been very, very good in enforcing that.  Whether it is our party 
or some other party, including the government, but when the 
members use spontaneous applause and standing ovations for their 
members, the stopwatch should begin.  If they are on their feet 
for 30 seconds, question period should be extended by 30 seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think a set of rules that will work are known to all of us, 
but we have to set the rules and live by those rules.  I think we 
would all be supportive of that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I may, I would 
say I think the House would benefit from your penalizing those 
who abuse your generosity by causing a ruckus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an opposition party causes a disturbance, you should 
intervene by taking a question away from it.  If you discover 
that the commotion comes from the government side, they too 
should be penalized by having Oral Question Period extended by 
the amount of time they spent reacting to one of our questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make this suggestion to resolve the problem in all humility. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
human being is the only animal that when one word is used 
inappropriately gets into all kinds of problems.  That is why we 
have Beauchesne's, <I>Robert's Rules of Order</I> and what have 
you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important in this House when one member is speaking that 
other members are listening.  For the most part I sit here very 
quietly and listen to a lot of rhetoric from all sides.  It is 
very important for us and the Canadian people that when somebody 
is speaking, other people have the courtesy to be quiet. 
<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  All of us would agree that in the last 
two days our question periods have not been the best that we have 
had in the last short while.  It seems like we are all getting in 
a circle and we are pointing fingers.  The fact of the matter is 
that we should just turn our fingers around and point them at 
ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Speaker I could stand up and yell for order until I am 
blue in the face but I am not going to do that.  I am not going 
to try to outshout this House of Commons.  I will not do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard interventions from every party in here. We all 
agree that if we are going to get more questions in and hopefully 
more answers in, we are going to have to co-operate.  I would 
remind you that in the last parliament when it came to question 
period I was forever asking you to please shorten the questions 
and the answers so we could get more questions in. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House decided collectively to do something for itself.  The 
party leaders came to me saying “We need certain questions; they 
mentioned a number”.  I said “That is easy.  We have 45 minutes 
and there are 60 seconds in each minute.  If you multiply the 
two and divide by the number of questions you want to ask, you 
end up with 35 seconds for the question and 35 seconds for the 
answer”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything went well.  Why?  Because it came from the House.  It 
came from us collectively that we could make this House function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a question posed, what possible good can it do to 
heckle so we cannot even hear the question?  If a person asks a 
question, it is surely because that person wants to hear an 
answer.  I cannot control the quality of the question nor the 
answer but I can now control, thanks to you because you agree, 
the length of the questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of pointing our fingers at one another, let us look at 
ourselves.  I am not here to lecture you.  God knows, I have sat 
on those benches and I know what it is like in question period. I 
know what you are trying to do.  It is not as if I arrived here a 
couple of weeks ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, surely we can come to some kind of an 
agreement that we will be able to conduct ourselves the way we 
want to conduct ourselves so that the people who are asking the 
questions will get the answers and those who are giving answers 
will be heard on the other side.

suggestions.  I do not take offence when a member parliament 
stands and says that maybe I should try this or maybe I should 
try that.  That is okay.  It is advice.  I will listen to advice. 
If you get a little bit frustrated, I sit in this chair day 
after day and hear our own members not give each other the chance 
to speak or be heard on the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I have been a little too lenient, perhaps I should tighten it 
up to the point where at least we can function a little bit 
better.  But as your Speaker, I do not want to be be some kind of 
dictator or martinet.  I do not want to do that.  I want all of 
us, the 301 of us, to be able to do our work in such a fashion 
that we will be proud of what we do in here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all of you to review what has been said by your peers. 
This is not somebody from outside; this is you who have spoken in 
here today.  Look at <I>Hansard</I> and look at your own conduct, 
and me too.  Let us see if tomorrow we can do a little bit 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard the points you brought up and I am going to take 
them to heart.  But unless and until this House collectively 
wants to discipline itself, I suggest that your Speaker can stand 
here and shout all through question period and it will not make 
one iota of difference until we want to make this House the place 
that it should be.  As the hon. member from Winnipeg said, we owe 
each other that respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I ask you to respect each other as parliamentarians.

Speaker, I have had several petitions to present for some time, 
but because of the unusual proceedings in the House I have not 
been able to introduce them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first petition deals with rural route mail carriers.  The 
petitioners seek the support of the House in ensuring basic 
rights to help Canada Post improve wages and working conditions 
for rural mail carriers, which are unfair and discriminate 
against rural workers.  Therefore the petitioners call upon 
parliament to repeal section 13(5) of the Canada Post Corporation 
Act.

parliament, at the earliest opportunity, invoke section 33 of the 
charter of rights and freedoms to override the B.C. court of 
appeal decision and reinstate subsection 163.1(4) of the criminal 
code, making possession of child pornography illegal.

people from Newfoundland, Quebec, Prince Edward Island, Alberta, 
B.C., Ontario, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  The

relatively new, but it is expanding at an extraordinary rate.  It

petition signed by 5,325 people from Vancouver Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners draw the attention of the government to the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House

achieve the elimination of child poverty by the year 2000.

I rise today to seek leave under Standing Order 52(2) to move,

House do now adjourn for an emergency debate to address the 
deepening economic and social crisis facing the Island of Cape 
Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not speak just about the Devco situation because I know 
that would not be sufficient under the rules.  However, during 
the month of January it was indicated by the provincial 
government that it would either sell or close down the Sydney 
Steel Corporation. 
It has not sold it.  It has listed the assets for sale. This 
means 700 people will lose their jobs in that industry.

the Devco legislation, this comes to about 2,400 jobs in an area 
that already has an unemployment rate two to three times the 
national average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a national crisis.  It is an emergency.  It has happened

AUTHORIZATION AND DISSOLUTION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK225">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 15, 1999 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-11, an act to authorize the divestiture of the 
assets of, and to dissolve, the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation, to amend the Cape Breton Development Corporation Act 
and to make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to follow up on the comments I made on November 15, 
1999 on Bill C-11, an act to authorize the divestiture of the 
assets of, and to dissolve, the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation.  On that occasion I spoke about the Liberal 
government's lack of respect for the workers in Atlantic Canada 
and how Bill C-11 was just another insult to the workers who have 
given their lives to Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since November 15 much has happened in Cape Breton with regard 
to the Liberal government's treatment of the Devco question. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 4, Devco miners had to resort to a strike to get the 
Liberal government's attention.  Did it listen?  Of course not. 
It continued to stick its head in the sand.  It was only when 
miners barricaded themselves underground and threatened to go on 
a hunger strike that the government began to take an interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, after a year of asking for a meeting with the Minister 
of Natural Resources, union representatives were able to sit 
down with the minister and air their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations on the pension plan began on January 11 and were 
referred to a mediator last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Miners should have been granted the right to negotiate their 
pension plan from the outset of the dispute. However, we should 
never expect the Liberal government to consult those concerned. 
That would be far too much to ask. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the miners were fighting for the right to negotiate, it 
was revealed that the finance minister's shipping company was 
part of the fleet bringing coal in from Columbia and the U.S.  It 
was also reported that the finance minister's company had 
expressed interest in buying some of Devco's assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has no shame.  It cuts thousands of jobs 
in Cape Breton while the finance minister directly profits from 
the sale of Devco.  In my books that is what I call a conflict of 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the only problem with the Liberal government's quick 
sale of Devco.  The moneys set aside for economic adjustment are 
inadequate even by the government's own estimates which placed 
the need at $300 million.  The proposed funding package is 
definitely inadequate in comparison to the Gardiner-Pinfold study 
which suggested the cost to offset fallout from the closure of 
Devco would be $1.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is once again writing its policy on the run.  It 
refused to consult the affected communities, the unions that 
represent the workers affected and other community groups who 
live in Cape Breton and know what the impact will be if Devco is 
sold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often my Liberal colleagues on the other side of the House 
forget that the policies which they support have a direct impact 
on the lives of Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the policy decisions made by the government have hurt 
Canadians.  The cuts to social transfers have crippled our health 
care system and increased tuition fees for universities to such a 
level that many Canadians no longer consider post-secondary 
education.  Because of changes to the employment insurance, 
800,000 unemployed workers cannot receive EI benefits, even if 
they contributed to the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do the hon. members opposite realize the hardship that will 
descend on the people of Cape Breton if Devco is closed?  It is 
sometimes hard to imagine the effect on a community when it is 
not ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I have seen the devastation caused by 
unemployment.  I have seen families thrown into poverty, children 
going to school with no food in their bellies and workers going 
to the employment insurance office day after day hoping to find 
jobs but leaving empty-handed.  This kind of desperation takes a 
toll on the family and on the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is content with turning its back on Cape 
Bretoners when it could have proceeded in a humane and proactive 
manner. It could have sat down with community leaders, unions, 
elected representatives to figure out what needed to be done to 
fulfil the government's obligation under sections 17 and 18 of 
the original Devco act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of its drive-by announcement, the minister could have 
actually talked to Devco workers, answered a few of their 
questions and, heaven forbid, actually have acted on their 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government always run away when the Canadian people 
want to talk to them?  The former Minister of Human Resources 
Development categorically refused to meet with unemployed workers 
even though his department administered the Employment Insurance 
Act which condemned thousands of Canadian families to poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Minister of Natural Resources comes in, announces the 
Devco closure and takes off.  Why do Canadians have to take to 
the streets to get the Liberal government to listen to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton and Sydney—Victoria have 
stood in the House repeatedly to identify the fundamental 
problems with this bill.  They outlined the lack of public 
consultations, but did the Liberal government listen?  Of course 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, it is par for the course for this government.  Let me 
talk about other areas where the Liberals have let Canadians 
down:  the lack of leadership in the aboriginal fisheries crisis; 
the inaction of the government on homelessness; the government 
turning its back on hepatitis C victims; the Liberal government 
cuts in social transfers which have plunged our health care into 
crisis; the sky-rocketing cost of getting a post-secondary 
education; the cuts to employment insurance; the bungling of HRDC 
grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made a habit of letting down Canadians and 
this Devco sell-off is just another item on the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is not too late.  The government can still set 
things right.  I hope the Minister of Natural Resources and his 
colleagues listen carefully to the debate that is going on now 
and act in the best interest of the people of Cape Breton.  It is 
pretty clear they have not so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should have more respect for those people who 
have spent 30 years working underground in the coal mines. I bet 
not many members in the House of Commons have ever worked 
underground.  I know what it is like to work underground because 
I worked for 15 years underground.  However, I did not work for 
the coal industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must show respect for the people of Cape Breton. 
It must take a lead hand and take care of those people who have 
spent 30 years of their lives underground in Cape Breton. The 
government has a responsibility.  It cannot just sell off Cape 
Breton to the Minister of Finance who wants to be the next Prime 
Minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
listening to the hon. member's speech, I know there must be 
another side to the story of Cape Breton.  I know that I speak 
for millions of Canadians when I say that we understand just how 
difficult the closing of the mines of Cape Breton is for the 
miners and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are members of the House who should be ashamed of 
themselves for trying to make Canadians believe that Cape Breton 
miners cannot be retrained.  They would have us believe that the 
economy of industrial Cape Breton is nothing more than coal mines 
and steel mills, which we just heard today, and that its future 
can never move beyond the old economy.  There are members of the 
House who would sustain political careers by keeping Cape 
Bretoners chained to industries that are no longer viable as 
presently operated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret to the people of industrial Cape Breton that the 
economy has been on life-support for over 30 years.  Is this fair 
to the miners?  Is it fair to their wives?  Is it fair to their 
children?  Is it fair to these families to put more money into 
industries going nowhere when money can be spent on industries 
that have a future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cape Bretoners can and will make changes to their own future. 
They have done it in the past with people like J.P. McLaughlin, 
Moses Coady and Father Thompkins.  The federal government is not 
turning its back on Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will review what the federal government is doing in a later 
comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are very few miners who in fact are going to be 
dislocated.  Jobs are available at the Prince mine.  They have a 
chance of employment there.  There are over 500 jobs being 
created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I really welcome the 
comments by my Liberal colleague across the way, but not his 
question.  It shows how disconnected he is to the problems in 
Cape Breton. He did not see the families who came here to meet 
with parliamentarians.  He did not see the wives crying and tears 
rolling down their cheeks because of what the government has done 
to the people of Cape Breton.  He seems to have forgotten what 
the Liberals have done to those families of Cape Breton.  He 
should take another look at what has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot train people at 50 years of age and think that they 
will go back into the mines.  That is what we are talking about. 
We are talking about people over 45 years old, those who are 50 
and 54 years old.  Do you want them to be trained and go back to 
college?  You should quit thinking that because it is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about is giving a fair agreement to those 
people so they can put bread on their table and feed their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We will go to the 
hon. member for Dewdney—Alouette, but before we do that may I 
ask hon. members to address each other through the chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is incredible what we have just witnessed in this 
place.  We have a colleague from the New Democratic Party who has 
lived the life of a Cape Bretoner with the experiences he was 
talking about and the hon. member for Durham, a Liberal, has the 
gall to stand up in this place and lecture that member and other 
members of the opposition about what they should do and what they 
should think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Liberals' policies and their arrogance, which he has 
just demonstrated, that has led to this kind of situation in Cape 
Breton.  This is the kind of arrogance that is a pattern across 
these benches that speaks every day to the reason why we need a 
change in the governing party and to throw them out of office so 
that people will have a different approach and a different way of 
governing in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just ask my colleague if he might comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there again I would like to 
thank the hon. member for his comments and not his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the government failed to do for all the years it 
was in power in Cape Breton.  When Cape Breton was in its hands 
why did it not begin training people?  Why did it wait until it 
had closed the mines and put people on welfare before beginning 
to train them?  Why did it give them the hardships they have 
today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years and years the government was served on a silver 
platter by Atlantic Canadians.  Do the Liberals know why they 
were kicked out?  Do they know why Doug Young was kicked out.  It 
was because of their attitude, as the hon. member just showed. 
That is why Atlantic Canada has kicked the Liberals out of 
office.  I hope that the rest of the country, along with Ontario, 
smartens up and kicks them out too, because they do not deserve 
to have a place in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when my good friend the member for Acadie—Bathurst gets 
upset, I worry he will have a heart attack. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I empathize with my colleague.  No one likes to see people lose 
their jobs, but I have to disagree with him on two statements 
that he made.  He said that the Liberal government had cut health 
care to the bone.  Yes, we did make some cuts to health care in 
1993, but now the funding has been returned to health care in the 
year 2000 to what it was in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  They keep yelling. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the yelling across the way will not make more housing 
available after the next election.  This is ridiculous. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the question I want to ask my friend.  Devco has been 
supported for 30 years by the federal government.  My colleague 
said that.  How can we make a change at Devco?  Do we keep on 
putting money into something that continually loses money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Give them a fair deal.  That is 
what the government should do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  The member is saying that it is a fair 
deal.  In my region we lost many people from the lumber industry. 
I am sure it is the same in Acadie—Bathurst. Sometimes when the 
resource is no longer there or people cannot make any money, they 
have to make a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would my colleague suggest the federal government do in 
order to keep the people working at Devco?  I just cannot see how 
it can stay open if it loses money. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very fond of my colleague 
opposite.  He goes to the same barber as I do, and we get our 
hair cut the same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I have a heart attack here, in the House, fighting for the 
people in the Atlantic region, it will have been worth it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat it in English.  If I have to have a heart attack 
in this Chamber fighting for the people in my riding and the 
people of the Atlantic, it is worth it to have one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding health care, in 1969 the government was paying 50% of 
the cost of health care.  Today we are down to 13%.  I do not 
care what happened back in 1993.  The Liberals have cut health 
care.  That is why seniors do not have adequate health care any 
more.  That is why people want to privatize health care.  It is 
because the Liberals have cut health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our grandparents and our children have to wait in the hallways 
of hospitals to get service.  When our parents have cancer they 
have to go to the United States to get service.  That is what the 
Liberals have done in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the hon. member's question about Devco, we need a fair 
deal for those people so that they can get up in the morning and 
be proud because they have served the country for 30 years.  For 
30 years they have gone underground and put their lives on the 
line for the country.  They deserve better than what the Liberals 
have given them today.

<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak today in the debate on second reading of Bill C-11, an act 
to authorize the divestiture of the assets of, and to dissolve, 
the Cape Breton Development Corporation, to amend the Cape 
Breton Development Corporation Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other Acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we are having to debate this bill is that, on January 
28, 1999, the federal Minister of Natural Resources announced 
the closure of the Phalen Mine and the privatization of the 
Price Mine, both of these being coal mines located in Cape 
Breton and operated by the Cape Breton Development Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 means the withdrawal of the federal government from 
coal mining in that region.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this decision, once the closure and privatization 
have taken place, some 1,000 people will be without work in a 
region where the unemployment rate is already close to 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we should take advantage of the debate on this bill to 
properly examine how this could happen.  Our role as 
parliamentarians requires us to question the economic 
development choices made by the federal government in the past, 
so as not to keep on repeating the same planning errors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have an example of this in the coal mining sector. 
In recent years, the fishers have also had to pay a high price 
for the federal government's lack of planning and poor resource 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also ask ourselves how the government needs to act in 
future to ensure regional development, and we must wonder, in 
light of its numerous failures, whether it ought not to leave 
this to the provincial governments, which are often in a better 
position to know what a population to which they are closer 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I shall focus on the importance of planning 
replacement industries when the decline of others is 
predictable, and particularly on the replacement of polluting 
energy sources such as coal by renewable and cleaner energy 
sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I would like first to return to the situation of the 
workers, who, after years of work in the harsh conditions of the 
mining industry, find themselves without work and with few 
prospects for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That moves me, because last year, with some of my colleagues, I 
met the representatives of these workers, who were very 
concerned about their fate.  They had come to Ottawa to tell 
parliament and the government that they should do something to 
save their community.  To my way of thinking, they are the 
victims of the lack of vision of the federal government, whose 
economic strategy for this region hinged solely on the mining 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1967, the federal government has injected over $1.5 billion 
in coal mining by the Cape Breton Development Corporation. 
However, by the end of the 1960s, a commission on the future of 
the industry on Cape Breton Island indicated that coal 
production should be phased out and the local economy 
diversified.  Unfortunately, the Liberals of the day, like the 
Liberals of today, lacked political courage.  Instead of 
planning a change in the economy in co-operation with the 
provincial government, the federal government preferred to keep 
its little empire, which assured it maximum visibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so the federal government continued over the years to 
encourage hundreds of young workers to go into the mines like 
their father. 
It said to them “Trust the federal government, you young men, 
you will have jobs for the rest of your days.  Keep on mining”. 
We can see what happened.  Today, the government is putting the 
key in the door and proposing an early retirement program that, 
however, excludes some 230 miners with over 25 years' seniority. 
These events are serious, very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the federal government has a moral responsibility 
to these workers and to the some 6,000 people living off coal 
mining, since it is in large measure responsible for this 
situation.  I encourage my colleagues who will be examining this 
bill in committee to remember this responsibility when they 
address the issue of pensions and acquired rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation totally upsets me, since I have seen the federal 
government behave this same way in many other sectors of the 
economy, dropping them overnight, with no transition, with no 
alternative, when its visibility was threatened.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One only has to think about the program for older worker 
adjustment. That program was designed to help workers who were 
often the victims of the federal government's mismanagement and 
of plant closures. That program helped workers, in spite of 
being underfunded and in spite of criteria which were sometimes 
inflexible and which did not take specific circumstances into 
account. But at least there was a program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this is no longer the case since 1997. The then 
Minister of Human Resources Development stubbornly refused to 
maintain the program. 
And the new Minister of Human Resources Development did not have 
anything concrete to propose to these workers, even though a 
unanimous report from the human resources development 
subcommittee recommended that measures be taken for workers, 
including the 230 miners. But the government has nothing for 
these people. This is how caring this government is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government abandons these workers, but it has no qualms 
about using employment insurance surpluses, about using money 
that belongs to workers and to which they are entitled. These 
workers are even more frustrated when they see that the 
Department of Human Resources Development uses their money for 
political purposes and distributes it so freely that it is 
unable to know who got money and for what purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to avoid other human dramas such as the closing of the 
Cape Breton Development Corporation, this government must 
absolutely have greater long term vision. If mines in Cape 
Breton had to close, other coal mines elsewhere in Canada could 
suffer the same fate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta produces 50% of Canada's coal and British Columbia 
produces 35%. And even if western coal is of better quality than 
eastern coal, the fact remains that power plants, which are the 
main users of coal, are gradually replacing it with natural gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the price of coal on the international markets has 
declined sharply over the past 20 years. 
Between 1981 and 1994, prices of the two leading types of coal 
dropped by 40% to 50%. And this trend is expected to continue 
because this is a source of energy that leaves a high level of 
very polluting residue in the air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the report released last September by the federal 
government appointed task force said that coal use was coming to 
an end.  It felt that Canada should rapidly cut back on its use 
of coal to produce electricity if it was to meet its commitments 
to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report also concluded that, in order to produce more 
electricity while reducing pollution, coal would have to be 
replaced by energy sources that produce less atmospheric 
pollution, such as hydroelectricity and natural gas. 
An analysis suggests that Canada should reduce its production of 
coal-generated energy by 38% over the next decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out in passing that while Canada, by signing the Kyoto 
protocol, undertook to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions 
by 6% annually to 1990 levels by the year 2012, Canadian 
emissions increased by 13% between 1990 and 1997 and that, 
without a radical change in government policies, greenhouse 
gases could increase by as much as 41% by 2020. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the predictable decline in fossil fuels and given 
its international greenhouse gas reduction commitments, it is 
high time the federal government invested substantially in the 
development of alternative forms of energy. 
The government must have a long term plan to favour the use of 
energy that is less harmful to our health and our environment, 
such as hydroelectricity, wind energy and solar energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government had acted 25 years ago, we would not see what 
is happening now in Cape Breton. We would not be faced with the 
fact that 1,000 workers will lose their jobs and that an entire 
community is threatened because of decisions that were not taken 
25 years ago.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take this opportunity to mention that the federal task 
force report I referred to earlier asked the federal government 
to harmonize its environmental assessment process with the 
provinces' processes, so that it will no hinder the development 
of new sources of energy, particularly hydroelectricity, which 
could help Canada meet the targets set out in the Kyoto 
protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I encourage the federal government to start planning 
now, in co-operation with provincial governments, the 
transitional measures that will be required to reorient the 
economy of areas that are in decline such as Cape Breton, 
particularly in the energy sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government can no longer afford to close down entire 
industries or regions by walking away from its responsibilities 
to workers and communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to make 
it clear to the House and to those who are listening to the 
debate on television that our friends in the opposition are 
confusing two very important elements with respect to Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 essentially authorizes the sale of the Devco assets so 
that the private sector can take those assets to create jobs and 
continue coal mining in Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate that the opposition would use this as a platform to 
talk about the human resources package, to talk about health care 
in Canada, to talk about any number of other issues some related 
and some not.  But using this simple bill which will allow for 
the sale of Devco assets and the continuation of coal mining as a 
platform for other issues could create a delay, but hopefully 
would not, that may hurt that process.  I do not think anyone 
wants to see that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to make it clear that on the human resources side, 
which is very separate from this bill, the government has made a 
commitment of $111 million of severance and early retirement 
measures for the workers and $68 million for economic 
development. Add to that $12 million from the province.  This has 
been made available to the communities so that they may redevelop 
their local economies to respond to the realities at Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Jonquière raised a number of very good points.  I 
go back to my comments and questions to the opposition last 
November.  Do we not believe that the best ideas for economic 
renewal come from the communities, their leaders and their 
citizens as opposed to Ottawa or elsewhere in the country? Should 
we not empower them to find the best solutions for the challenges 
they face? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I caution opposition members to focus on the need to get on with 
the future of Cape Breton.  Focus on the need to make sure that a 
strong private sector buyer is able to create the jobs that we 
hope can be maintained.  Do not confuse the human resources 
package with the need to move on with the private sector partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member for Jonquière not agree that the very best 
solution for local communities is to allow local leaders and 
citizens to implement their ideas so that their economy best 
reflects their needs and the capacity of their citizens in this 
millennium?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague across the way for his question.  I believe 
he has not looked at the history of what has been going on in 
Cape Breton for the past 25 years.  He is not familiar with 
history, a history that was made by this government, by the 
Liberal government of the day.  This government is responsible 
for the situation we are in today.  Had it left the local 
communities and the province to do what they wanted, had it not 
played sugar-daddy in order to build up its empire and get back 
its visibility, things would not have ended up like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past 25 years, the government has invested $1.5 billion, 
or $1 million for every one job. 
Instead of handing it back to the people, it invested again in 
order to extend the life of something that was doomed to 
failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have quoted federal government studies which have stated for 
years that our thoughts about coal have to be changed.  It has 
continued telling people “Things are fine.  Stay as you are, the 
future is no problem.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government had no social conscience.  Today, once the harm 
has been done, the hon. member over there tells us “We are going 
to pull out.  We are going to leave the local communities to 
become self-governing”.  They turn everything topsy-turvey and 
then they withdraw.  They cannot ignore the fact that they are 
the ones in the wrong, and they are the ones who have to right 
that wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for her comments with respect 
to what is happening in Cape Breton.  I hear the members on the 
government side talk about the real issues, about what we are 
talking about and that this has nothing to do with the human 
resources package. As my colleague has mentioned, what we are 
talking about is that the government has funded this corporation 
and clearly and obviously has run this corporation into the 
ground and has now decided to walk away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we expect from the government is a fair settlement for the 
men, the families and the communities of Cape Breton Island.  I 
hear the government members saying would it not be better to 
allow the communities to decide their fate.  Cape Bretoners have 
been wanting that opportunity for 30 years, but they have never 
had that opportunity.  It has always been left in the hands of 
the friends of the government to decide for Cape Bretoners what 
is best for them.  That is what has happened to this crown 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague agree with the New Democratic Party that this 
is not about the government making the decision to arbitrarily 
get out of the industry?  It is the government and it can make 
that decision.  This is about ensuring that Cape Breton miners, 
their families and communities are given a fair settlement before 
the government walks away and sets this corporation up to sell it 
probably to another Liberal friend.

the cause and the effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government that turns things upside down, that decides to 
withdraw from certain fields after making sure that these fields 
no longer meet the aspirations of the locals, is not entitled to 
do so.  It must do so according to the conditions of the people 
who have been deprived of development in their region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never been to Cape Breton, but I hope to go there one 
day.  People have said to me that solutions were put to this 
government over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I spoke of the POWA. 
This program existed before.  It did not suit everyone, but it 
was one small way this government could, with our money, with 
its ever diminishing open-mindedness, meet the needs of these 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, no.  It did not suit it any more, since it was good for 
the people.  So it withdrew it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is interesting that in the month of January the 
miners had to go underground on strike to try to get a negotiated 
settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as if there were no precedent. One example is medical 
benefits.  When Via Rail was shut down, medical benefits were 
provided to those employees.  When CN was shut down, medical 
benefits were continued for those employees. When Devco was being 
closed down, the government told the miners who have gone 
underground and suffered injuries and their families that there 
would be no extension of any medical benefits whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of settlement the miners are seeking, in other 
areas as well, in terms of relocation and in terms of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague has done her homework for which I commend her.  She 
has a sensitive understanding of the issue.  Would she not agree 
that these people should be entitled to the same benefits as the

industries?

throwing money out the window.  Billions of dollars have gone

is denying them those rights?

moving forward, until one day they take a turn in the opposite

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ)</B> moved that Bill C-203, an act 
to amend the Auditor General Act (Poverty Commissioner), be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to talk about the 
creation of the position of poverty commissioner. On March 25, 
1999, I introduced a bill to amend the Auditor General Act. 
Because the session was prorogued, I reintroduced this bill and 
we are finally discussing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I introduced this bill last year, I had no idea that 
today's debate would take place in the context of the scandal 
relating to job creation at the Department of Human Resources 
Development. The management of job creation programs reflects 
badly on the whole Liberal government. In this context, having a 
poverty commissioner would be a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before talking about the purpose of creating the position of 
poverty commissioner, I want to briefly remind the House about 
poverty. The figures say it all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can quote four sources, including the Canadian Council on 
Social Development. Between 1989 and 1997, the number of 
children living in poverty increased by 37.5%. In 1989, the 
members of this House unanimous passed a resolution to eliminate 
child poverty. Ten years later, there is a 37.5% increase, 
according to the CCSD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Campaign 2000 made the same finding: there was a 47% increase in 
the number of poor children in families with an income below 
$20,000, a 44% increase in the number of children living in low 
income families, and a 51% increase in the number of children 
living in a family relying on social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Data from Statistics Canada indicate that between 1993 and 1996, 
23% of single parent families had experienced poverty for a 
period of four years.  Single individuals make up 19% of the 
poor, and single parents 23%, a very large proportion of whom 
are women.  It is also reported that one quarter of the 
population has experienced poverty for at least one year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 18 to 24 year old group, 33% have been poor for one year. 
According to the Canadian welfare council, the fourth source of 
reference, four out of ten heads of single parent families are 
living in poverty, as well as single individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, four different sources that have analyzed the increase 
in poverty among children, adults, women and female single 
parents tell us that since 1989 there has been a real increase 
in poverty, and this is a source of concern.  Certain categories 
of the population suffer more from poverty, for instance the 
elderly.  Although their situation has improved markedly, we are 
very much aware that the older one gets the more chance there is 
to find oneself poor.  This is the case for those over the age 
of 74. It is primarily older women who are poor, and it is said 
that the proportion is twice that for men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation of young people aged 18 to 24 is also cause for 
concern.  According to Statistics Canada, their poverty rate is 
the highest of all age groups, 26% in 1995. 
It is said that, after taxes, 32.5% of young people between 18 
and 24 have faced poverty for a full year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, poverty is also expressed in terms of increased demand on 
the food banks.  In all our ridings, there has been an increase 
in demand on the food banks, more suicides, student and family 
debt, many bankruptcies and reduced savings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have cited a lot of figures, but behind them lies a lot of 
human drama.  There is a lot of economic vulnerability, even 
though the growth rate is strong.  Part of the public is not 
entitled to the redistribution of wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many people are kept from being full-fledged citizens.  I see 
poverty as being on a continuum, where, at one end, people are 
extremely poor and, at the other, people are poor.  Those who 
are extremely poor have a hard time obtaining the essentials, 
that is, food, clothing and housing.  According to the UN, they 
represent about 6%.  At the other end, there are the people who 
just manage to make ends meet at the end of the month.  But 
where it hurts is the lack of manoeuvring room these people have 
in meeting their family's daily needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here too work must be done to understand all the facets of 
poverty.  In our society, poverty has many faces, even though 
they say we live in the best country in the world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the present government, we have just gone through six years 
of social deficits. Let me raise four points, or four government 
decisions that have really contributed a great deal to the 
unravelling of our social fabric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the Canada social transfer. Provincial governments 
have lost $33 billion in transfers. This is $33 billion less in 
provincial coffers, but also $33 billion less in the pockets of 
individual citizens. The Canada social transfer provides money 
for education, health, and welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now travelling throughout Quebec to speak about what the 
federal government has done, and the drastic cuts it has made. 
The sick, women, and children are those who have been hurt. 
Those cuts will last until 2003. That is right, the cuts are not 
over just yet. Since the government came to power, the cuts have 
totalled $21 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this mean, cuts of $21 billion, in practical terms. It 
means a loss of revenue for the provinces. In Quebec, it means 
we will be hiring 3,000 physicians less, 5,000 nurses less, and 
5,800 teachers less. It also means that those most affected, 
welfare recipients, will get $500 less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really hurts. Cuts in the Canada social transfer affect 
individual citizens the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is the EI surplus.  Twenty six billion dollars 
were snatched back, and six unemployed workers in ten no longer 
qualify for employment insurance, the new name for unemployment 
insurance.  The problem is that people who suddenly find 
themselves out of work can no longer count on benefits that 
would at least ensure them a decent standard of living until 
they found another job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem the government has not had the courage to tackle 
is the non-indexing of tax credits and tax thresholds. The result 
is an additional $2 billion in the federal government's coffers. 
This means that, between 1993 and 2001, non-indexing will have 
enabled the federal government to rake in an additional 
$17.59 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fourth issue is federal government funding for social housing. 
This has become a matter of serious concern.  If the federal 
government had put more money into social housing, there would 
have been 30,000 additional units in Quebec so that families had 
decent housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cycle I spoke of earlier in connection with poverty also 
exists for those who are homeless or do not have decent, safe 
accommodation, with a roof over their heads that does not leak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the holiday season, we saw troubling images of the 
quality of housing occupied by certain people.  This is a 
disgrace in a country that claims to have the best standard of 
living in the world.  A poverty commissioner could keep close 
tabs on this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I moved a motion in the House of Commons asking the government 
to develop a concrete plan of action for the next ten years, 
with full funding, not the piecemeal approach we are used to 
with this government.  There should also be someone in charge of 
ensuring that any measure taken by this government is properly 
managed, and monitoring its impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned about the impact of the measures taken 
haphazardly by this government. It is a big machine. We are all 
aware of the scandal that was just uncovered at Human Resources 
Development Canada. We know how this scandal is hurting 
individuals who might have benefited from government grants 
awarded through HRDC.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening right now at Human Resources Development 
Canada is nothing new. I have here an article published in 1987, 
where a $1 billion black hole is mentioned. This article was 
written in 1987 by a reporter saying that the way public 
finances were managed had created a $1 billion black hole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had introduced a tax deduction, a tax loophole 
really, for businesses involved in research and development. It 
was later found out that some of them had taken advantage of 
this loophole but did not give anything in return, because they 
had not done any research and development. There was no control 
with regards to the way public finances were managed. This is 
very troubling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is said that such things date back to the time of Marc 
Lalonde, a Liberal Minister of Finance.  Then came another 
Minister of Finance, Michael Wilson, who wanted to put on the 
brakes but realized it was too late, because the total was up to 
one-tenth of the national deficit, because of these very 
shortcomings, these programs and measures that are taken without 
any real thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could list a number of such shortcomings between 1983 and 
1987.  I would, however, prefer to continue with the importance 
of having a poverty commissioner.  There is a scandal going on 
at the present time.  In three weeks we may no longer be talking 
about it, but we know that we taxpayers are the ones providing 
the funds, and we want to ensure it is better redistributed 
throughout all of society, to provide more help to those who 
need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore very difficult to assess the effectiveness of 
the federal government's actions, which is why a poverty 
commissioner could put some order in all of this. Not after five 
or ten years.  The auditor general reports on the government's 
management of various departments, but I consider that the 
government distributes its largesse with excessive randomness 
and lack of rigour.  There is an ongoing saga of financial 
shortcomings in all of this government's programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have contacted the auditor general.  I would have liked to 
have seen him report to the House on child poverty in this 
country, in light of the resolution adopted in 1989. 
I asked him to assess the measures, decisions and the feedback 
mechanisms proposed by the government in 1989 having a direct 
impact on child poverty and to measure the effects on the 
targeted clientele. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's response was that I was raising a very 
important issue, but that it was the government's responsibility 
to do such an assessment itself.  However, when the government 
does its own assessments, we know whose desk they land on and 
how difficult it is to get answers from the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the creation of a position of poverty commissioner would set 
the record straight.  The Minister of Human Resources 
Development is acting as judge and jury in the scandal raging at 
HRDC. 
When a government is under attack, it defends itself, and often 
we do not get the whole picture or the whole truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An independent poverty commissioner could answer 
parliamentarians' questions instead of getting the run around as 
we are getting the run around at the moment.  We in the Bloc 
Quebecois want an independent auditor.  This was supported by 
100 of our colleagues in the House of Commons; ten members from 
all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fight is not over.  I have brought it here to parliament, but 
I want to recruit support.  I have had a lot of it, but what I 
am after is to have the government see to it that public funds 
are better managed.  Too many people are suffering as a result.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this private member's bill 
presented by my colleague from the Bloc.  It is a bill to amend 
the Auditor General Act to appoint a poverty commissioner. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to create the appointment of a 
poverty commissioner for the purpose of reducing or eliminating 
poverty in Canada.  The poverty commissioner would report to the 
auditor general and through him annually to the House of Commons. 
The bill gives the poverty commissioner powers to study the 
causes and effects of poverty, to recommend courses of action to 
the government, to hold public consultations and to evaluate the 
effectiveness of measures taken by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have worked with the member and I know she has a heart of 
compassion for people and a real desire to see people in distress 
have some measure of assistance and have their concerns addressed 
in a meaningful way.  I commend my colleague for her caring and 
compassion.  When we are in public office we need these 
perspectives in order to have practical measures to address the 
concerns of a wide range of Canadians, including those who live 
in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are members in this House who have probably experienced a 
measure of poverty in their own lives.  Some have been more 
fortunate but we all know that we are responsible to assist each 
other when we are in need and in distress.  This is a proposal 
whereby we can be of practical assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a point of debate here, and I welcome the opportunity 
to participate as my colleague has invited us to, as to what 
degree we are personally responsible to be involved in the lives 
of other people.  The poverty commissioner to some degree may 
allow some of us as Canadians to feel that we do not have to 
become personally involved in empathizing and caring for the 
needs of each other because there is an official to do that.  My 
colleague will possibly address this concern when she makes her 
summary remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would want to make sure that in taking official measures to 
address the needs and concerns of our fellow citizens that we do 
not forget our personal responsibility to reach out to others to 
care for them, to give them that kind of person to person 
assistance.  That would be more meaningful than all of the 
debates, studies, interventions, lobbying and papers could ever 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether the member would consider adding an element to 
her bill. The poverty commissioner she is proposing would also 
propose, suggest and advocate ways in which we as citizens could 
personally reach out to each other in a meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As she has pointed out, there are many causes of poverty.  I 
would suggest that to some degree when Canadians are in 
circumstances of distress, someone reaching out to them in a 
personal and caring way can make a tremendous difference. The 
encouragement and the interaction during circumstances of 
distress can give a lift that more official measures will not do. 
Perhaps my colleague would consider that as an element of her 
proposed plan and of the work of the poverty commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could get into a long debate about the definition of poverty. 
I am not sure that would be particularly fruitful at this time. 
At some point we would want to make some distinctions between 
levels of poverty.  There have been a number suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the low income cutoff in Canada below which everyone is 
considered to be of low income or in poverty.  However, that 
level keeps riding as the standard of living rises and perhaps is 
not a measure of poverty in its truest sense.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social union and the talks between the provinces and the 
federal government have suggested a market basket approach. 
Poverty would be measured by an individual's or a family's 
ability to afford the necessities of life such as food, clothing 
and shelter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These things can be debated.  I think my colleague would agree 
that is not the point she is making at this time.  It is not 
about splitting hairs or becoming technical in the definition of 
poverty, but about a more meaningful approach in extending 
practical assistance to people who are in distressed financial 
circumstances. If she agrees with that, and I think she does, 
then possibly at this point we could leave aside that element of 
the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a country as rich as Canada, it is inconceivable that there 
are not the resources to ensure that all of our citizens have the 
necessities of life.  My colleague has made that point very 
eloquently.  This country has the resources to provide people 
with the necessities of life when they are unable to secure those 
necessities themselves. It also has the resources to provide them 
with access to education, health care, transportation, housing 
and learning information because we need knowledge in order to 
build skills to provide ourselves with the means to secure the 
necessities of life and more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a point well taken. It is disturbing that in a country 
like Canada we would have to debate this in the House of Commons. 
We have seen on our television screens the horrific scenes from 
countries like Sudan.  That is something that goes beyond poverty 
to tragedy.  In a country like Canada we generally do not think 
in terms of that kind of need. We should not have to think in 
those terms.  It is important that we realistically address the 
expectations we have for all of our citizens and not just for 
some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a suggestion for my colleague who has made this proposal 
of a poverty commissioner.  There needs to be measures whereby 
people can move from the category of poverty to, shall we say, 
more desirable circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us were impoverished students at one time.  We were 
barely able to afford one meal a day but we knew that was 
temporary.  We did not consider ourselves to be impoverished 
because we knew it was a temporary step before we gained the 
skills and employment we needed in order to have much better 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly there are people who are new to our country and who 
are becoming established.  They are in very straitened 
circumstances, to use an old fashioned word.  Again they know it 
is temporary and they look forward to entering our country's 
economic life and succeeding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are individuals who technically but temporarily are in 
poverty.  However I think the member is referring to people to 
whom poverty all too sadly is more or less a permanent way of 
life.  We need to address this in a coherent fashion. We have 
piecemeal approaches, some of which, as the member pointed out, 
have just recently fallen under some cloud.  We want to have a 
very comprehensive way of addressing serious issues like this 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for her efforts.  I hope that these remarks 
will be of assistance to her.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with other members who have said that it is very sad we 
even have to contemplate the creation of a poverty commissioner 
in a country as wealthy as ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reflect on the first international trip I made as a 
member of parliament with the minister for CIDA.  We went to 
Jordan and Israel and into refugee camps on the West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip.  I had never seen or experienced poverty like that. 
It was so crushing.  The smell and the sight were really 
appalling and shocking.  All I wanted to do was turn around and 
go back to my beloved country but I still had five more days to 
go through those refugee camps to experience and see what those 
people had to live through.  There is no escape at that level of 
poverty. They are walled in with security and armed guards all 
around them.  There is very little hope for those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last spring I made a trip up the James Bay coast to various 
first nations communities.  I saw the poverty they were forced to 
live in.  It was incredibly degrading for them.  They had to send 
their children to a residential school.  That was an incredible 
symbolism of oppression and degradation for them.  The school had 
no fire exit and only one door.  None of the fire escapes on the 
four storey building functioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unbelievable that in this country people are forced to 
send their children to those schools.  People live three and four 
generations in one home because our country will not accommodate 
them in any way and help them live in dignity.  The fact is that 
in the first place they had been forced to move to an area that 
could not sustain their traditional way of life.  This meant they 
could not feed their children in the way their parents had 
managed to feed them.  We forced them into poverty and then 
abandoned them to that poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think about what is happening around us right now with the 
rising cost of heating oil. For many people it could be 
completely unaffordable.  I do not know if any other members of 
parliament have ever had to wake up in a house with no heat in 
the middle of winter and know that there would not be any heat 
for a long time.  That is an experience of poverty which families 
suffer in this country.  There will be even more because social 
assistance rates are very minimal. They are not adjusted when the 
cost of heating oil goes up.  People who need to heat their house 
have to take that money out of the food money for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our first nations people suffer poverty in disproportion to 
everyone else in this country.  The kinds of institutions that 
would help them or those living in our inner cities move out of 
poverty are not there.  Shamefully, our inner cities are 
degenerating and there is no hope for the people to move out.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Madam Speaker, I reiterate my support 
for the creation of a poverty commissioner.  As well, I urge the 
government to take a serious look at the causes of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that more women live in poverty than men.  The rate of 
children living in poverty has increased.  Single parent families 
headed by women often live in poverty.  Women's wages are lower 
than men's.  If women want to escape poverty through education, 
tuition costs have risen astronomically, which makes it even more 
difficult for women to achieve higher education unless they have 
the goodwill and financial help of their families to carry them 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The poverty commissioner would evaluate the effectiveness of 
measures taken by the federal government to reduce and eliminate 
poverty, and advise the federal government on measures it could 
take to reduce or eliminate poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the change from unemployment insurance to employment 
insurance we have a very successful method of redistributing 
wealth to those who are in need and have paid insurance to cover 
the losses when they are unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, outside of that strip along the southern U.S. border, 
where most Canadians live, there are those of us who live in 
remote, rural areas who work in extreme climates where employment 
is seasonal.  We were disproportionately affected by the changes 
to employment insurance.  In Yukon alone it meant a reduction of 
$7 million.  That money was not coming into our area because 
people were no longer eligible for employment insurance benefits. 
There are similar stories across the country in every single 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on something the Reform member said 
about creating a poverty commissioner, how it would somehow take 
away from an individual's ability to reach out in a personal way 
to help those around them.  With the cuts we have seen, people 
have been trying to look after each other in very practical ways, 
especially in the areas of education and health care.  However, 
even at the height of the cutbacks there was no lack of people 
looking out for each other.  It never took away an individual's 
initiative to help someone, to see someone in need and go the 
extra mile for them.  Creating a poverty commissioner would not 
disempower a single Canadian from taking the initiative to help 
someone else, to mentor them so they can then become responsible 
members of our community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to end by quoting a very respected former member of 
this House, J. S. Woodsworth, who said “What we desire for 
ourselves, we wish for all”.  To this end, may we take our share 
of the world's work and the world's struggles.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of the Progressive 
Conservative Party to join the debate today on this bill which 
would establish a poverty commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January of this year the PC Party released the report of our 
task force on poverty.  Set up last March, the task force held 16 
public meetings across Canada to listen and learn about the 
causes, the effects and possible solutions to the growing problem 
of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed 41 recommendations, which will be considered at our 
policy convention in May.  These recommendations focus on fixing 
the problems, not allocating blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our task force was set up because the government refused to 
agree to a joint parliamentary committee to study the problem of 
poverty, as proposed by one of my colleagues last year during a 
day-long debate on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is a cause of despair among Canada's disadvantaged, 
while the growing threat of poverty is a source of insecurity for 
its middle class.  It is clearly time to move forward on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force report of my party presents a menu of proposals 
to start addressing the problems of poverty.  Poverty is not a 
choice for many Canadians; however, poverty comes with a high 
cost to all Canadians.  It is a major social and economic problem 
which denies our great country access to millions of Canadians 
who, due to circumstances, cannot contribute to the growth of our 
great nation.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The direct economic costs totalled billions of dollars in income 
support and other programs.  The indirect economic costs could be 
even higher since poverty compromises the realization of Canada's 
potential as an innovative, competitive and prosperous nation in 
our new global economy.  The human costs are immeasurable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is a fact of life for almost one in five Canadians. 
What is most alarming is the growing number of children living in 
poverty.  These children are starting life at a disadvantage. 
Our task force was told that those who are born poor are at 
greater risk than children from higher income families of 
experiencing poverty right through their adulthood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today many children are going to school hungry.  Children are 
also part of the growing number of homeless people in Canada.  In 
some of our wealthiest cities the use of food banks is growing at 
an alarming rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The return on investment in preventing and reducing poverty in 
Canada would be tremendous.  The economic and social well-being 
of all Canadians would be improved.  Our task force was told that 
each dollar invested today in programs to reduce and eliminate 
child poverty could result in future savings of up to $7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no easy solutions to poverty, but it is time to 
recognize and deal with this growing problem.  The successful 
implementation of an anti-poverty strategy requires a mechanism 
by which results can be measured and governments held 
accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internationally, Canada has been measured and found wanting in 
dealing with the issue of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our task force talked to Canadians about the need for a social 
audit.  We proposed that a Canadian social audit be conducted by 
an arm's length agency similar to the auditor general, the 
privacy commissioner and the information commissioner, including 
representation from all Canadian governments and all sectors of 
Canadian society.  We are proposing that the social audit agency 
be appointed by and report to parliament.  The social audit 
should include a mechanism for public input and the results of 
the social audit should be made public.  This would help 
Canadians determine how well their social programs are working 
and would give us a tool in developing workable solutions to the 
problem of poverty in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we are debating today proposes a similar mechanism. 
The bill would establish a poverty commissioner under the 
auspices of the Auditor General Act.  The poverty commissioner 
would analyze the causes and effects of poverty in Canada, 
evaluate the effectiveness of measures taken by the federal 
government to reduce or eliminate poverty and advise the federal 
government on measures it could take to reduce or eliminate 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The poverty commissioner would be a senior officer reporting 
directly to the auditor general and would report annually to the 
House of Commons as the Commissioner of the Environment and 
Sustainable Development does now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada currently participates in an international social audit 
led by the United Nations committee on economic, social and 
cultural rights, which is charged with monitoring and reporting 
on countries' compliance with the international covenant on 
economic, social and cultural rights.  Canada ratified the 
covenant in 1976 with the written agreement of every provincial 
and territorial government in Canada.  By signing this agreement 
Canada explicitly recognized in particular the right of every 
Canadian, as outlined in Article 11, to “an adequate standard of 
living for himself and his family, including adequate food, 
clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living 
conditions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international covenant requires periodic reviews of Canada's 
compliance with the agreement.  In 1986 a group of independent 
human rights experts formed the United Nations committee on 
economic, social and cultural rights, which was created to 
develop a meaningful system of supervision to monitor countries' 
compliance.  The Canadian report is prepared by a 
federal-provincial-territorial committee of officials responsible 
for human rights legislation in Canada.  The UN committee reviews 
the reports, questions government officials and seeks input from 
Canadian NGOs.  Then it publishes its own conclusions and 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last report was critical of Canada and its lack of progress 
in implementing this covenant.  Specifically, the United Nations 
committee report noted that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—since 1994, in addressing the budget deficits by slashing 
social expenditure, the State Party has not paid sufficient 
attention to the adverse consequences for the enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights by the Canadian population 
as a whole, and by vulnerable groups in particular....The absence 
of an official poverty line makes it difficult to hold the 
federal, provincial and territorial governments accountable with 
respect to their obligations under the Covenant.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Under international law we are obligated to take action to 
improve the standard of living of our poorest citizens.  We do 
not need international experts telling us that it is time to deal 
with this problem.  It makes more sense for Canadians to judge 
how well the social needs of Canadians are now being met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that a domestic social audit for Canada would be an 
invaluable tool to determine the effectiveness of our social 
programs in meeting the needs of all Canadians.  As our task 
force stated in its report, it is up to us to start working 
together to build a road from this poverty.  An arm's length 
poverty commissioner or social auditor could give the government 
invaluable guidance in targeting Canada's social programs to make 
them as effective as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel kind of sad that the bill is a non-votable bill because 
it is an extremely good one.  I assure the Bloc member that we 
support the motion even though it is non-votable.  If it were a 
votable item, my party and I would surely support this kind of 
bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. 
member for Québec has introduced an interesting bill aimed at 
putting into place under the auspices of the auditor general a 
poverty commissioner who would report directly to parliament 
annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner's task would be to analyze the causes and 
effects of poverty in Canada, to evaluate the effectiveness of 
federal measures to reduce poverty and to advise on measures that 
could be taken to reduce or eliminate poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should recognize that this function would not be at all in 
keeping with the mandate of the auditor general.  For one thing, 
the task would confer an advocacy role on the office, which 
conflicts with the requirement for the auditor general to remain 
completely objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Government of Canada has already in place what 
amounts to a de facto poverty commissioner.  Some 30 years ago, 
in 1969, the federal government established the National Council 
of Welfare.  Since then the council has published regular poverty 
profiles and further advises the Minister of Human Resources 
Development on matters of concern to low income Canadians. Unlike 
the proposed poverty commissioner, the National Council of 
Welfare enjoys and activates its advocacy role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me assure the House, however, that the Government of Canada 
shares the hon. member's concerns for the poor.  Much of the 
agenda of the government has been directed at creating the 
economic conditions and building a social safety net that 
protects all Canadians.  The government has recognized from the 
beginning that an effective social safety net must be built on 
strong fiscal management and a sound economy.  In the final 
analysis, the best way to reduce poverty is through a strong 
economy delivering opportunities to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Government of Canada has been taking direct 
action to strengthen the social safety net and thus reduce 
poverty.  The 1999 budget increased cash transfers for all 
provinces over the next five years, including $11.5 billion for 
health care and $5 billion in equalization payments.  As well, 
$850 million was invested in the national child benefit in 1997. 
A subsequent $850 million in increases announced in 1998 by the 
federal government will provide substantial support to low income 
families with children.  Moreover the government is committed to 
a third significant increase in July 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our employment programs help groups such as people with 
disabilities, youth, Canadians in areas of high unemployment and 
people who want to go back to school to get more skills. 
Aboriginal people have access to a number of programs, including 
help to increase their education.  Centres are being created to 
reach out to street youth to provide support and counselling. The 
aboriginal human resource development strategy has a new urban 
component to focus on the unemployment of and training needs of 
aboriginal people in urban areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives and the issues they were designed to address 
serve to illustrate a point that is pertinent to the discussion 
of Bill C-203.  We have to remember that poverty is a 
multi-jurisdictional issue.  It is painted in many different 
colours across the country and varies over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many initiatives of many governments impact on the issue of 
poverty.  We must remember that the federal government does not 
hold all the levers of social policy.  We share them with 
provincial and territorial governments. 
That is why a concerted co-operative effort of all the players is 
required to mount an effective campaign to reduce poverty across 
the nation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national child benefit is one example of a joint effort by 
the federal, provincial and territorial governments to support 
families and reduce child poverty.  By July 2000 the federal 
government will have increased the Canada child tax benefit to 
$1.7 billion and, for their part, our partners in the provinces 
and territories are investing in complementary programs and 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet another example of effective co-operation is the strategy 
that has been developed concerning Canadians with disabilities, 
an issue that is also related to poverty.  All governments came 
together to release a document called “In Unison:  A Canadian 
Approach to Disability Issues”.  It establishes a blueprint for 
full citizenship for people with disabilities.  It will focus 
long term policy development on three interrelated building 
blocks: disability support, employment and income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cite these initiatives to illustrate the point that in a 
multi-jurisdictional society like Canada poverty is an issue that 
must be dealt with through a partnership such as the social 
union.  Poverty is a concern to all levels of government, as well 
it should be, but no one government acting alone can be expected 
to succeed in eliminating it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the introduction of the bill has served a useful 
purpose in focusing the attention of the House, and we hope the 
Canadian public, on the subject of poverty.  Let us hope it will 
serve to hurry the development of transjurisdictional policies 
and strategies to achieve our common goal of eliminating poverty 
across the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first of 
all, I wish to thank members who took part in the debate.  It is 
a shame that we did not have more than one hour to discuss a 
problem as serious as poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will reply to the first question by the Reform Party member, 
who said that a poverty commissioner is no substitute for the 
assistance that the public should provide to the less fortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not agree more that a poverty commissioner is no 
substitute for what each one of us should be doing to help those 
in need.  However, a poverty commissioner is one means by which 
parliamentarians could keep tabs on what this government is 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find most unfortunate the remarks of the Liberal member, who 
has rhymed off a long list of programs that have an impact on 
poverty.  This is precisely the problem: we are not able to 
measure the full impact of all these measures.  The HRDC scandal 
has made that abundantly clear.  There were programs to help 
certain areas in various regions. We know how the money was 
spent and how effective the programs were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the self-serving remarks by the Liberal Party member an 
even greater incentive to call for the creation of a position of 
poverty commissioner.  The type of management under the Liberal 
government, the management of the Department of Human Resources 
Development, is not a recent development; it goes back some 
years.  In 1987, a journalist wrote an article about this 
government's tax measures; in his view, those measure were 
catastrophic.  So it is one failure after another.  It is a 
massive machine, I agree. We should not be commenting on the 
track record over five years. This should be done every year for 
every measure. I think there has to be a better assessment of 
what should be done and what is being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from several national groups in Quebec and in 
Canada, who support the creation of a position of poverty 
commissioner. 
It was mentioned that such a resource does not exist. We talked 
about the Canadian Council on Social Development, which gives 
advice to the government, but the poverty commissioner would 
have much more authority and would have greater access to the 
government's management than any outside consultant.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While the figures provided by the CCSD are relevant, a poverty 
commissioner could ensure government effectiveness. He could 
give advice to the government and he could even hold public 
consultations to assess the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned. It may be that, ten years from now, I will 
no longer sit in the Canadian parliament. However, I am 
concerned about the fact that ten years ago we were deploring 
the way in which the government was managing public finances. 
This year, we have a scandal with Human Resources Development 
Canada, and we know that some communities are being excluded 
from these federal grants because things are done very much at 
random. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could use the examples from Human Resources Development 
Canada and from the billion dollar gap created in 1983 by a few 
measures adopted by the then Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year, when we say we need more money and families can not 
make ends meet, it is precisely because there were not enough 
watchdogs to keep a eye on public finances. It is about time 
that parliamentarians decide to put their financial house in 
order and that the government's wealth is available to share 
around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is not that there is no money. What is important is 
how that money is spent and to what end. When policies are 
developed to prevent tax avoidance, when some companies which 
are are friends of the ruling party have better access to 
government grants, it is time to worry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I have used up all the time available to me to 
talk about such an important issue as increased poverty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, epidermolysis bullosa or EB is a group of rare and 
debilitating genetic skin diseases in which the skin and mucous 
membranes are so sensitive that the slightest touch may cause 
painful blistering.  EB is a lifelong disease often present at 
birth, which causes severe physical, emotional and financial 
hardships for the affected persons and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two types of EB, non-scarring and scarring.  The 
non-scarring type varies in form from the severity of seasonal 
blistering in the hands and feet to widespread blistering during 
much of the year.  In some cases blisters appear over 75% of the 
body inside and out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the mildest form can transform simple tasks such as walking 
and typing into impossible ordeals.  Open sores and blisters that 
heal slowly if at all characterize the most severe form of EB. 
This continuous blistering leads to scarring causing 
disfigurement and immobilization of fingers, toes, arms and/or 
legs.  Blisters that form in the mouth, oesophagus, throat and 
stomach cause serious complications leading to secondary 
infection, anemia and malnutrition, general debilitation, cancer 
and premature death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think of EB I think of the courage displayed by those who 
suffer from EB.  I think of the pain and frustration, the shame, 
the guilt and the toll it takes on one's self-esteem and 
self-confidence.  I think of the parents of children such as the 
Foreman family whose son Quinn was diagnosed when he was five 
weeks old.  Approximately 70% of his body was covered in 
blisters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Mrs. Foreman's letters I have come to understand how 
their lives were turned upside down.  Due to the lack of 
awareness by both the public and the medical profession, the 
diagnosis for Quinn was very slow in coming.  For nearly five 
months Quinn was fed through a syringe because his mouth and 
throat were completely covered with blisters, but this child's 
suffering did not end there.  He lost all his fingernails and 
toenails.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It seemed as though every time Quinn was picked up by one of his 
parents, he received a new blister.  From then on the only time 
his parents picked him up was to feed or change him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mrs. Foreman describes the hardest part of this ordeal was 
having to break the blisters and bandage him up as if he were a 
burn victim.  This process took approximately two hours every 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think of EB and EB sufferers, I think of the almost total 
lack of services and support offered to those who live with this 
disease every day.  I think of the measures taken by parents 
seeking a miracle which often involves going to the United States 
or abroad, where governments have invested in research into this 
illness and have attempted to treat its symptoms with procedures

information, if any at all, about the disease at birth.  A 
diagnosis is rarely arrived at easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think of EB, I think of my constituent Kevin Campbell. 
Both Kevin and his sister inherited this disease.  Kevin is a 
perfect example of the hidden potential and ability that people 
with EB possess.  If it were not for Kevin's initiatives to raise 
awareness of EB for all Canadians who suffer from it, there may 
not be the Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Research Association, 
more commonly known as Debra Canada.  And I would not have joined 
this fight to raise awareness of EB in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Living with EB means being engaged in a never ending battle to 
educate.  My question is for the Minister of Health.  What steps 
are being taken by his department to encourage and facilitate 
research and development into the cure and treatment of Canadians 
suffering from EB?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, on behalf of the health minister, 
I would like to thank our hon. colleague from Parkdale High Park 
who raised the issue of epidermolysis bullosa with both 
sensitivity and competence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As she pointed out, it is a rare genetic disease. It 
dramatically affects a number of our fellow Canadians. That is 
why the federal government is willing to help Canadians 
suffering from this disease and to improve the health of the 
whole Canadian population. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the Medical Research Council of Canada, the federal 
government is funding biomedical and clinical research expertise 
on skin diseases across Canada.  The foundation of knowledge that 
these men and women are building will give the researchers of 
tomorrow the building blocks necessary to find cures on such 
conditions as EB. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To further its commitment to health research, the federal 
government proposed the creation of the Canadian institutes of 
health research. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next few months, a number of health research institutes 
will be created and each institute will put in common the 
expertise of Canadian health searchers all across Canada. Just 
imagine for a moment how great it would be to bring your child, 
for example, to a hospital which would be linked to a Canadian 
Institute of Health Research. Then you would know that the 
physicians examining your child would be able to benefit from 
the expertise of searchers located anywhere in Canada and 
working in every field of health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Physicians linked to such an institute would have direct access 
to the most recent and relevant data, whether it be the latest 
developments in the area of biomedical research on that disease 
or other related diseases. 
That would be more reassuring than the current situation and 
your child's health would be in good hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I encourage our colleague to continue—

I rise tonight on behalf of Canadian consumers who, for months, 
have been paying high prices for gasoline, diesel fuel and 
heating oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are at home having dinner or on the road, as well as 
truck drivers who are working, wonder why the price at the pump 
of a litre of gas is so high. The only reason it is so high is 
because people do not know what the price would be if it were 
not for the federal, provincial and other hidden taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Friday, I watched a program with Paul Larocque on TVA in 
Quebec City. On this program, Denis Dauray, from Les Pétrole Maurice, 
called for a real inquiry into the oil market in Quebec and 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is asking for concrete measures from the federal government 
and the Government of Quebec. This is what I am asking for 
tonight on behalf of consumers, of people who are at home 
tonight, of those who are in their truck working and of those 
who are driving to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am demanding that the Government of Canada take concrete 
action in co-operation with provincial and territorial 
governments, towards the reduction of the federal excise tax, a 
uniform reduction of the road tax in Quebec and the restoring of 
a special monetary subsidy on the price of fuel oil for families 
that have used this product since December 1, 1999. It would be 
in force for four months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be the same thing the President of the United States 
just gave several Eastern States. In Nova Scotia, steps have 
been taken in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the industry minister is the following: Why can 
we not strike as soon as possible, in February or March, a real, 
public inquiry into petroleum markets? It must not be conducted 
behind closed doors, as all studies have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are asking for, and the request comes from consumers, is 
a real public inquiry that will include—and we must not forget 
them this year—independent producers, in order to shed light on 
the production costs of a litre of gas, of a litre of diesel and 
of a litre of fuel oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want concrete action because we want to know what is really 
going on in the Canadian petroleum industry, and we want to know 
as soon as possible. That is what consumers want.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for bringing the issue of increases in gasoline, diesel 
and home heating prices to the attention of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week following a question from the same member, the 
Minister of Industry asked the petroleum industry to meet with 
him so as to explain the reasons for recent diesel fuel price 
increases in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that all members of the government are concerned 
about this issue since we all represent consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Competition Bureau must ensure that prices are 
determined by market forces and that the provisions of the 
Competition Act are respected.  I can assure the hon. member that 
if the Competition Bureau finds that companies or individuals 
have engaged in anti-competitive conduct, it will not hesitate to 
take immediate and appropriate action under the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that no federal agency has the authority to directly 
regulate retail prices except in emergency situations. Consumers 
who may be asking the hon. member to have gas prices regulated 
should take their message to the provincial governments. 
Presently only Prince Edward Island and Quebec have elected to do 
so in some manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we must remember that there are also outside factors 
influencing the price of fuel.  Such factors include cutbacks by 
OPEC in crude oil production, an increase in demand for heating 
fuels and low levels of stocks in industrialized countries.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, on October 
26, 1999, I warned the House and the Minister of Human Resources 
Development about the disastrous situation of seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alain Boudreau, a young seasonal worker, is getting $50 a week 
in EI benefits because the method of calculation takes only his 
last 26 weeks of work into account. If the calculation were 
based on a year, Alain would receive $272 in benefits. This 
makes a world of difference for a young person starting out.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development answered this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, we have to remember that EI is not an industry or a 
business. It is an income support program for those who qualify. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Beaudreau does qualify under the Employment Insurance Act, 
but he only gets $50 a week. The parliamentary secretary added: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are eligible apply for it and receive benefits based 
upon the earnings they have been taking home from the jobs they 
have had. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the calculation were based on a year, Alain Boudreau would 
get $272. For the government to believe that, when people 
qualify and get $50 in employment insurance benefits, it is an 
industry or a business is maddening. I wonder what is and 
industry or a business when the Minister of Human Resources 
Development gave away $300,000 of taxpayers money to relocate a 
company from Hamilton to Brant, in her own riding. That is an 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A company like Wal-Mart, which has millions and does not need 
money, was able to get $500,000 from the government to build a 
warehouse in Canada. Now, we very well know that this building 
would have been built here anyway and that Wal-Mart did not need 
money from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government say in this House that workers who have 
lost their jobs consider employment insurance as a business? 
They do not control jobs. They are not responsible for losing 
their jobs. Their employer is. Workers have no control over 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the government rewards employers by giving them $300,000 
here and $500,000 there. The Prime Minister sold one of his 
businesses in his riding to a friend who did not have the money 
to pay and who later got money from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This employer bought the business from the Prime Minister, who 
later got his money. While such scandalous practices are going 
on in our country, the government refuses to help people like 
Alain Boudreau, who receives $50 a week, and who has been 
accused of seeing employment insurance as an industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unacceptable. This is why I ask the government, the 
minister and the parliamentary secretary to examine their 
conscience and consider changes to employment insurance— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
hon. member, but his time is up.

<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, let me 
begin by denying the allegation.  No company was transferred from 
Hamilton to Brantford because of any HRDC programming.  I also 
want to say that the company known as Wal-Mart received no HRDC 
funding.  If the member would like to talk to me about that 
afterward, I will be happy to go into the details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are helping young Canadians like Alain Boudreau every day. 
Unlike the member opposite, we do not want to increase his EI 
benefits.  Rather we want to encourage him to have the 
opportunity to access a good education and then a good job.  That 
is precisely what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We invest $155 million every year to help young people get on 
the job experience.  As well we provide assistance and advice on 
how to enter the workforce.  We offer various types of financial 
assistance so that young Canadians can have access to a good 
education and get a good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the member that employment insurance is a temporary 
income support program for people who are between jobs.  It has 
programs to help unemployed people return to work as quickly as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a needs based program.  It is not like the social 
assistance programs run by the provinces.  Rather, it is an 
insurance program.  Those who are eligible apply for it and 
receive benefits based on the earnings they have been taking home 
from the jobs they have had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>EI is also about helping Canadians get back to work through a 
reinvestment of about $800 million in re-employment benefits.  In 
addition, the Canada jobs fund was introduced to help create 
lasting jobs in high unemployment regions.  We introduced an 
hours based system that addresses the special nature of seasonal 
work which often involves large numbers—

the hon. member but the time has expired.

adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow
